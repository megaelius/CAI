Massive stars and their stellar winds are important for a number of feedback processes. The mass
lost in the stellar wind can help determine the end-point of the star as a NS or a BH. However, the impact
of mass-loss on the post-Main Sequence evolutionary stage of massive stars is not well understood.
Westerlund 1 is an ideal astrophysical laboratory in which to study massive stars and their winds
in great detail over a large range of different evolutionary phases. Aims: We aim to study the radio
emission from Westerlund 1, in order to measure radio fluxes from the population of massive stars,
and determine mass-loss rates and spectral indices where possible. Methods: Observations were
carried out in 2015 and 2016 with the Australia telescope compact array (ATCA) at 5.5 and 9 GHz using
multiple configurations, with maximum baselines ranging from 750m to 6km. Results: 30 stars were
detected in the radio from the fully concatenated dataset, 10 of which were WRs (predominantly late
type WN stars), 5 YHGs, 4 RSGs, 1 LBV star, the sgB[e] star W9, and several O and B supergiants. New source
detections in the radio were found for 5 WR stars, and 5 OB supergiants. These detections have led
to evidence for 3 new OB supergiant binary candidates, inferred from derived spectral index limits.
Conclusions: Spectral indices and index limits were determined for massive stars in Westerlund
1. For cluster members found to have partially optically thick emission, mass-loss rates were calculated.
Under the approximation of a thermally emitting stellar wind and a steady mass-loss rate, clumping
ratios were then estimated for 8 WRs. Diffuse radio emission was detected throughout the cluster.
Detections of knots of radio emission with no known stellar counterparts indicate the highly clumped
structure of this intra-cluster medium, likely shaped by a dense cluster wind.
