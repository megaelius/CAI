Conceptualizing planetary habitability depends on understanding how living organisms originated
and what features of environments are essential to foster abiogenesis. Estimates of the abundance
of life's building blocks are confounded by incomplete knowledge of the role of chirality and racemization
in organic compounds in the origination of living organisms. Chirality is an essential feature
of enzymes as well as many lock-and-key type structures. There are four known processes that can
act on complex organic molecules to promote racemization for abiogenesis: quantum-tunneling
effects; selection via interaction with circularly polarized light (CPL); templating processes;
and interactions with electrical and magnetic (EM) fields. These occur in different places, respectively:
cold interstellar space; regions of space with energetic photons, dust and/or magnetic fields;
and mineral surfaces (for both templating and EM fields). Chirality as a feature of terrestrial
life suggests neither a special place for local development of homochirality nor for extra-terrestrial
enrichment and delivery. The presence of these molecules in three competing scenarios for life's
origin - chemical gardens, geothermal fields, and ice substrates - relies on a framework of hypothesis
and estimation. An easily-modified worksheet is included in the supplemental material that allows
a user to generate different scenarios and data related to the distribution of chiral organic molecules
as building blocks for living organisms within the galaxy. A simple hypothetical mechanism for
planetary magnetic field reversals, based on a high-density plasma inner core, is also presented
as a means to aid in estimating field polarity and hence the orientation of racemization processes
based on planetary magnetic fields.
