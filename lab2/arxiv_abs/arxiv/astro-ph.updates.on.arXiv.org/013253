Context. VLBA monitoring of BL Lacertae at 15 GHz reveals a quasi-stationary radio feature in the
innermost part of the jet at 0.26 mas from the radio core. Stationary features are found in many blazars
but have rarely been explored in detail. Aims. We aim to study the kinematics, dynamics, and brightness
of the quasi-stationary feature of the jet in BL Lacertae based on the VLBA monitoring with submilliarcsecond
resolution (subparsec-scales) over 17 years. Methods. We analyse position uncertainties and
flux leakage effects of the innermost quasi-stationary feature and develop statistical tools
to differentiate the motions of stationary feature and radio core. We construct a toy model to simulate
the observed emission of the quasi-stationary component. Results. We find that trajectories of
the quasi-stationary component are aligned along the jet axis, which can be interpreted as displacements
of the radio core. During the jet stable state the core shift significantly influences the apparent
displacements of the stationary component, which shows orbiting motion with reversals. The quasi-stationary
component has low superluminal speeds on time scales of months, which is likely due to large positional
errors. On time scales of years the apparent speeds are subrelativistic, of about 0.07 c. We find
that the brightness profile of the quasi-stationary component is asymmetric along and transverse
to the jet axis, and this effect remains unchanged with epoch. Conclusions. Accurate positional
determination, high cadence of observations, and properly accounting for the core shift are crucial
for measuring the trajectories and speeds of the quasi-stationary component. Its motion is similar
to behaviour of the jet nozzle, which drags the outflow in a swinging motion and excites transverse
waves of different amplitudes traveling downstream. (abbreviated)
