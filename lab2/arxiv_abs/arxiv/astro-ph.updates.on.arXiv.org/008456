We use cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations to study early structure formation in two
dark matter (DM) cosmologies, a standard CDM model, and a warm DM (WDM) model with a particle mass
of $m_{\chi}c^{2}=3$ keV. We focus on DM haloes with virial masses $M\sim 10^{10}\ M_{\odot}$.
We find that the first star formation activity is delayed by $\sim 200$ Myr in the WDM model, with similar
delays for metal enrichment and the formation of the second generation of stars. However, the differences
between the two models in globally-averaged properties, such as star formation rate density and
mean metallicity, decrease towards lower redshifts ($z\lesssim 10$). Metal enrichment in the
WDM cosmology is restricted to dense environments, while low-density gas can also be significantly
enriched in the CDM case. We calculate the free-free contribution from early structure formation
at redshifts $z>6$ to the cosmic radio background (CRB), and find that it is $3.8_{-1.7}^{+15.8}$%
($10.4_{-4.6}^{+43.3}$%) of the total signal inferred from radio experiments such as ARCADE 2,
in the WDM (CDM) model. We find that the direct detection of the $\mathrm{H_{2}}$ emission from early
structure formation ($z\gtrsim 7.2$), originating from the low-mass haloes explored here, will
be challenging even with the next generation of planned far-infrared space telescopes, unless
the signal is magnified by at least a factor of 10 via gravitational lensing. However, more massive
haloes with $M\gtrsim 10^{12}\ M_{\odot}$ may be observable for $z\gtrsim 10$, even without lensing,
provided that our extrapolation from the scale of our simulated haloes is valid.
