We report on the discovery of the companion star to the millisecond pulsar J1342+2822B in the globular
cluster M3. We exploited a combination of near-ultraviolet and optical observations acquired
with the Hubble Space Telescope in order to search for the optical counterparts to the known millisecond
pulsars in this cluster. At a position in excellent agreement with that of the radio pulsar J1342+2822B
(M3B), we have identified a blue and faint object (mF275W \approx 22.45) that, in the color-magnitude
diagram of the cluster, is located in the region of He core white dwarfs. From the comparison of the
observed magnitudes with theoretical cooling tracks we have estimated the physical properties
of the companion star: it has a mass of only 0.19 \pm 0.02 Msun, a surface temperature of 12 \pm 1 x 10^3
K and a cooling age of 1.0\pm0.2 Gyr. Its progenitor was likely a ~ 0.84 M star and the bulk of the mass-transfer
activity occurred during the sub-giant branch phase. The companion mass, combined with the pulsar
mass function, implies that this system is observed almost edge-on and that the neutron star has
a mass of 1.1 \pm 0.3 Msun, in agreement with the typical values measured for recycled neutron stars
in these compact binary systems. We have also identified a candidate counterpart to the wide and
eccentric binary millisecond pulsar J1342+2822D. It is another white dwarf with a He core and a mass
of 0.22 \pm 0.2 Msun, implying that the system is observed at a high inclination angle and hosts a typical
NS with a mass of 1.3 \pm 0.3 Msun. At the moment, the large uncertainty on the radio position of this
millisecond pulsar prevents us from robustly concluding that the detected star is its optical counterpart.
