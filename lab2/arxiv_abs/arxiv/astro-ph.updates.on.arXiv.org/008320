PAN is a scientific instrument suitable for deep space and interplanetary missions. It can precisely
measure and monitor the flux, composition, and direction of highly penetrating particles ($> \sim$100
MeV/nucleon) in deep space, over at least one full solar cycle (~11 years). The science program of
PAN is multi- and cross-disciplinary, covering cosmic ray physics, solar physics, space weather
and space travel. PAN will fill an observation gap of galactic cosmic rays in the GeV region, and provide
precise information of the spectrum, composition and emission time of energetic particle originated
from the Sun. The precise measurement and monitoring of the energetic particles is also a unique
contribution to space weather studies. PAN will map the flux and composition of penetrating particles,
which cannot be shielded effectively, precisely and continuously, providing valuable input for
the assessment of the related health risk, and for the development of an adequate mitigation strategy.
PAN has the potential to become a standard on-board instrument for deep space human travel. PAN is
based on the proven detection principle of a magnetic spectrometer, but with novel layout and detection
concept. It will adopt advanced particle detection technologies and industrial processes optimized
for deep space application. The device will require limited mass (~20 kg) and power (~20 W) budget.
Dipole magnet sectors built from high field permanent magnet Halbach arrays, instrumented in a
modular fashion with high resolution silicon strip detectors, allow to reach an energy resolution
better than 10\% for nuclei from H to Fe at 1 GeV/n.
