We examine the reconstruction of galaxy cluster radial density profiles obtained from Chandra
and XMM X-ray observations, using high quality data for a sample of twelve objects covering a range
of morphologies and redshifts. By comparing the results obtained from the two observatories and
by varying key aspects of the analysis procedure, we examine the impact of instrumental effects
and of differences in the methodology used in the recovery of the density profiles. We find that the
final density profile shape is particularly robust. We adapt the photon weighting vignetting correction
method developed for XMM for use with Chandra data, and confirm that the resulting Chandra profiles
are consistent with those corrected a posteriori for vignetting effects. Profiles obtained from
direct deprojection and those derived using parametric models are consistent at the 1% level. At
radii larger than $\sim$6", the agreement between Chandra and XMM is better than 1%, confirming
an excellent understanding of the XMM PSF. We find no significant energy dependence. The impact
of the well-known offset between Chandra and XMM gas temperature determinations on the density
profiles is found to be negligible. However, we find an overall normalisation offset in density
profiles of the order of $\sim$2.5%, which is linked to absolute flux cross-calibration issues.
As a final result, the weighted ratios of Chandra to XMM gas masses computed at R2500 and R500 are r=1.03$\pm$0.01
and r=1.03$\pm$0.03, respectively. Our study confirms that the radial density profiles are robustly
recovered, and that any differences between Chandra and XMM can be constrained to the $\sim$ 2.5%
level, regardless of the exact data analysis details. These encouraging results open the way for
the true combination of X-ray observations of galaxy clusters, fully leveraging the high resolution
of Chandra and the high throughput of XMM.
