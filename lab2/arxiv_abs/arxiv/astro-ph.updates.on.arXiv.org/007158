A carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) of around unity is believed to act as a natural separator of water-
and methane-dominated spectra when characterizing exoplanet atmospheres. In this paper we quantify
the C/O ratios at which this separation occurs by calculating a large self-consistent grid of atmospheric
models, using the latest version of \emph{petitCODE}. We find that the transition C/O ratio depends
on many parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and spectral type
of the host star, and could range between at least 0 and $2.6$. By mapping all the transition C/O ratios
we propose a \emph{four-class} classification scheme for irradiated planets. We predict a region
(\emph{The Methane Valley}) where methane always remains the cause of dominant spectral features.
\ce{CH4} detection in this region, or the lack of it, provides a diagnostic tool to identify the prevalence
of cloud formation and non-equilibrium chemistry. As another diagnostic tool, we construct synthetic
Spitzer IRAC color-diagrams showing two distinguishable populations of planets. Any deviation
from these populations on the color-maps marks the possibility of cloud presence or non-equilibrium
chemistry in their photosphere. Finally, we demonstrate that spectral synthesis on the cloud-free
grid can be used to identify such environments for individual objects as well. For example, we examine
HD 189733b and WASP-96b spectra and find possible indications of cloudy conditions in HD 189733b
and consistency of WASP-96b as a cloud-free planet. Our results highlight the necessity of comparing
planetary spectra against cloud-free equilibrium-chemistry grids as a first step to point out
possible involving physics or systematics in the observations.
