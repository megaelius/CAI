Recent multi-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae are producing successful
explosions and explosion-energy predictions. In general, the explosion-energy evolution is
monotonic and relatively smooth, suggesting a possible analytic solution. We derive analytic
solutions for the expansion of the gain region under the following assumptions: spherical symmetry,
one-zone shell, and powered by neutrinos and $\alpha$ particle recombination. We consider two
hypotheses: I) explosion energy is powered by neutrinos and $\alpha$ recombination, II) explosion
energy is powered by neutrinos alone. Under these assumptions, we derive the fundamental dimensionless
parameters and analytic scalings. For the neutrino-only hypothesis (II), the asymptotic explosion
energy scales as $E_{\infty} \approx 1.5 M_g v_0^2 \eta^{2/3}$, where $M_g$ is the gain mass, $v_0$
is the free-fall velocity at the shock, and $\eta$ is a ratio of the heating and dynamical time scales.
Including both neutrinos and recombination (hypothesis I), the asymptotic explosion energy is
$E_{\infty} \approx M_g v_0^2 (1.5\eta^{2/3} + \beta f(\rho_0))$, where $\beta$ is the dimensionless
recombination parameter. We use Bayesian inference to fit these analytic models to simulations.
Both hypotheses fit the simulations of the lowest progenitor masses that tend to explode spherically.
The fits do not prefer hypothesis I or II; however, prior investigations suggest that $\alpha$ recombination
is important. As expected, neither hypothesis fits the higher-mass simulations that exhibit aspherical
explosions. In summary, this explosion-energy theory is consistent with the spherical explosions
of low progenitor masses; the inconsistency with higher progenitor-mass simulations suggests
that a theory for them must include aspherical dynamics.
