(Abridged) Stars more massive than $20-30M_{\odot}$ are so luminous that the radiation force on
the cooler, more opaque outer layers can balance or exceed the force of gravity. These near or super-Eddington
outer envelopes represent a long standing challenge for calculating the evolution of massive stars
in one dimension, a situation that limits our understanding of the stellar progenitors of some of
the most exciting and energetic explosions in the universe. In particular, the proximity to the
Eddington limit has been the suspected cause for the variability, large mass loss rate and giant
eruptions of an enigmatic class of massive stars: the luminous blue variables (LBVs). When in quiescence,
LBVs are usually found on the hot ($T_{eff} \approx 2 - 4 \times 10^4$ K) S Dor instability strip. While
in outburst, most LBVs stay on the cold S Dor instability strip with a $T_{eff} \approx 9000$ K. Here
we show that physically realistic three dimensional global radiation hydrodynamic simulations
of radiation dominated massive stars with the largest supercomputers in the world naturally reproduce
many observed properties of LBVs, specifically their location in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR)
diagram and their episodic mass loss with rates of $10^{-7}-10^{-5} M_{\odot}/yr$. The helium
opacity peak is found to play an important role to determine these properties, which is not realized
in the traditional one dimensional models of massive stars. The simulations also predict that convection
causes irregular envelope oscillations and 10-30% brightness variations on a typical timescale
of a few days. The variability is more prominent in our models that are on the cool part of the S Dor instability.
These calculations pave the way to a quantitative understanding of the structure, stability and
the dominant mode of mass loss of massive stars.
