Massive protostars grow and evolve under the effect of rapid accretion of circumstellar gas and
dust, falling at high rates ($\ge 10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}\, \rm M_{\odot}\, \rm yr^{-1}$). This mass
infall has been shown, both numerically and observationally, to be episodically interspersed
by accretion of dense gaseous clumps migrating through the circumstellar disc to the protostellar
surface, causing sudden accretion and luminous bursts. Using numerical gravito-radiation-hydrodynamics
and stellar evolution calculations, we demonstrate that, in addition to the known bloating of massive
protostars, variable episodic accretion further influences their evolutionary tracks of massive
young stellar objects (MYSOs). For each accretion-driven flare, they experience rapid excursions
toward more luminous, but colder regions of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. During these excursions,
which can occur up to the end of the pre-main-sequence evolution, the photosphere of massive protostars
can episodically release much less energetic photons and MYSOs surreptitiously adopt the same
spectral type as evolved massive (supergiants) stars. Each of these evolutionary loop brings the
young high-mass stars close to the forbidden Hayashi region and might make their surrounding H II
regions occasionally fainter, before they recover their quiescent, pre-burst surface properties.
We interpret such cold, intermittent pre-main-sequence stellar evolutionary excursions and
the dipping variability of HII regions as the signature of the presence of a fragmenting circumstellar
accretion disc surrounding the MYSOs. We conjecture that this mechanism might equivalently affect
young stars in the intermediate-mass regime.
