Within the binary-driven hypernova 1 (BdHN 1) scenario, the gamma-ray burst GRB190114C originates
in a binary system composed of a massive carbon-oxygen core (CO$_{core}$), and a binary neutron
star (NS) companion. As the CO$_{core}$ undergoes a supernova explosion with the creation of a new
neutron star ($\nu$NS), hypercritical accretion occurs onto the companion binary neutron star
until it exceeds the critical mass for gravitational collapse. The formation of a black hole (BH)
captures $10^{57}$ baryons by enclosing them within its horizon, and thus a cavity of approximately
$10^{11}$cm is formed around it with initial density $10^{-7}$g/cm$^3$. A further depletion of
baryons in the cavity originates from the expansion of the electron-positron-photon ($e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$)
plasma formed at the collapse, reaching a density of $10^{-14}$g/cm$^3$ by the end of the interaction.
It is demonstrated here using an analytical model complemented by a hydrodynamical numerical simulation
that part of the $e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$ plasma is reflected off the walls of the cavity. The consequent
outflow and its observed properties are shown to coincide with the featureless emission occurring
in a time interval of duration $t_{rf}$, measured in the rest frame of the source, between $11$ and
$20$s of the GBM observation. Moreover, similar features of the GRB light curve were previously
observed in GRB 090926A, GRB 130427A and GRB 160625B, all belonging to the BdHN 1 class. This interpretation
supports the general conceptual framework presented in Ruffini et al. (2019) and guarantees that
a low baryon density is reached in the cavity, a necessary condition for the operation of the "{\it
inner engine}" of the GRB presented in an accompanying article (Ruffini & Moradi 2019).
