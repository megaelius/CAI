Saturn's mid-sized moons (satellites) have a puzzling orbital configuration with trapping in
mean-motion resonances with every other pairs (Mimas-Tethys 4:2 and Enceladus-Dione 2:1). To
reproduce their current orbital configuration on the basis of Crida & Charnoz's model of satellite
formation from a hypothetical ancient massive rings, adjacent pairs must pass 1st-order mean-motion
resonances without being trapped. The trapping could be avoided by fast orbital migration and/or
excitation of the satellite's eccentricity caused by gravitational interactions between the
satellites and the rings (the disk), which are still unknown. In our research, we investigate the
satellite orbital evolution due to interactions with the disk through full N-body simulations.
We performed global high-resolution N-body simulations of a self-gravitating particle disk interacting
with a single satellite. We used $N \sim 10^5$ particles for the disk. Gravitational forces of all
the particles and their inelastic collisions are taken into account. As a result, dense short-wavelength
wake structure is created by the disk self-gravity and global spiral arms with $m \sim$ a few is induced
by the satellite. The self-gravity wakes regulate the orbital evolution of the satellite, which
has been considered as a disk spreading mechanism but not as a driver for the orbital evolution. The
self-gravity wake torque to the satellite is so effective that the satellite migration is much faster
than that was predicted with the spiral arms torque. It provides a possible model to avoid the resonance
capture of adjacent satellite pairs and establish the current orbital configuration of Saturn's
mid-sized satellites.
