There is ample evidence in the Milky Way for globular cluster (GC) disruption. Hence one may expect
that also part of the Galactic halo field stars may once have formed in GCs. We quantify the fraction
of halo stars donated by GCs by searching for stars that bear the unique chemical fingerprints typical
for a subset of GC stars often dubbed `second-generation stars'. These are stars showing light element
abundance anomalies such as a pronounced CN-band strength accompanied by weak CH-bands. Based
on this indicator, past studies have placed the fraction of halo stars with a GC origin between a few
to up to 50%. Using low-resolution spectra from the most recent data release of the latest extension
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV), we were able to identify 118 metal-poor ($-1.8\le$[Fe/H]$\le
-1.3$) CN-strong stars in a sample of 4470 halo giant stars out to 50 kpc. This results in an observed
fraction of these stars of 2.6$\pm$0.2%. Using an updated formalism to account for the fraction
of stars lost early on in the GCs' evolution we estimate the fraction of the halo that stems from disrupted
clusters to be 11$\pm$1%. This number represents the case that stars lost from GCs were entirely
from the first generation and is thus merely an upper limit. Our conclusions are sensitive to our
assumptions of the mass lost early on from the first generation formed in the GCs, the ratio of first-to-second
generation stars, and other GC parameters. We carefully test the influence of varying these parameters
on the final result and find that, under realistic scenarios, the above fraction depends on the main
assumptions at less than 10%. We further recover a flat trend in this fraction with Galactocentric
radius, with a marginal indication of a rise beyond 30 kpc that could reflect the ex-situ origin of
the outer halo. (abridged)
