Mars Global Surveyor measurements revealed that the Martian crust is strongly magnetized in the
southern hemisphere while the northern hemisphere is virtually void of magnetization. Two possible
reasons have been suggested for this dichotomy: A once more or less homogeneously magnetization
may have been destroyed in the northern hemisphere by, for example, resurfacing or impacts. The
alternative theory we further explore here assumes that the dynamo itself produced a hemispherical
field. We use numerical dynamo simulations to study under which conditions a spatial variation
of the heat flux through the core-mantle boundary (CMB) may yield a strongly hemispherical surface
field. We assume that the early Martian dynamo was exclusively driven by secular cooling and we mostly
concentrate on a cosine CMB heat flux pattern with a minimum at the north pole, possibly caused by
the impacts responsible for the northern lowlands. This pattern consistently triggers a convective
mode which is dominated by equatorially anti-symmetric and axisymmetric (EAA) thermal winds.
Convective up- and down-wellings and thus radial magnetic field production then tend to concentrate
in the southern hemisphere which is still cooled efficiently while the northern hemisphere remains
hot. The dynamo changes from an alpha^2- for a homogeneous CMB heat flux to an alpha-Omega-type in
the hemispherical configuration. These dynamos reverse on time scales of about 10 kyrs. This too
fast to allow for the more or less unidirectional magnetization of thick crustal layer required
to explain the strong magnetization in the southern hemisphere.
