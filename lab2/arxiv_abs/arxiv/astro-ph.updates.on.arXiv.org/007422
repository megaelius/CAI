We present a reformulation of axion modified electrodynamics where the equations maintain a similar
form Maxwell's, with all modifications redefined within the constitutive relations between $\vec{D}$,
$\vec{H}$, $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{E}$ fields. In this reformulation the axion induced bound charge
density, polarization current density and bound current density are identified along with the
associated induced vacuum polarization and magnetization, which are shown to satisfy the charge-current
continuity equation. The reformulation is important when considering conversions of axions into
photons, relevant in many experimental contexts. For example, when a DC $\vec{B}$-field is applied,
oscillating bound vacuum charges and polarization currents are induced at a frequency equivalent
to the axion mass. In contrast, when a large DC $\vec{E}$ field is applied, an oscillating bound current
or magnetization of the vacuum is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass. Moreover,
the integral forms of the equations can be used to clearly define the boundary conditions between
distinct media either with or without axion induced vacuum polarization or magnetization. This
provides clarity when considering experiments sensitive to axion induced electric and/or magnetic
effects inside or outside the high DC field region. For example, we show how the axion induced oscillating
polarization under a DC magnetic field is analogous to a permanent polarised electret oscillating
at the frequency of the axion's Compton mass. The oscillating electret sources an EMF which acts
to change the Lorentz Force acting on conducting electrons as well bound electrons in a dielectric.
This means that conductors and capacitors in a high DC magnetic field can act as a detector for low-mass
axions without suppression of the signal due to electromagnetic shielding.
