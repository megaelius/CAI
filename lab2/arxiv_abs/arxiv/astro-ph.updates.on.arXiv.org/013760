Unambiguous detection of signals superimposed on unknown trends is difficult for unevenly spaced
data. Here, we formulate the Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM) that can determine the best model
for many signals superimposed on arbitrary polynomial trends. DCM minimizes the Chi-square for
the data in the multi-dimensional tested frequency space. The required number of tested frequency
combinations remains manageable, because the method test statistic is symmetric in this tested
frequency space. With our known tested constant frequency grid values, the non-linear DCM model
becomes linear, and all results become unambiguous. We test DCM with simulated data containing
different mixtures of signals and trends. DCM gives unambiguous results, if the signal frequencies
are not too close to each other, and none of the signals is too weak. It relies on brute computational
force, because all possible free parameter combinations for all reasonable linear models are tested.
DCM works like winning a lottery by buying all lottery tickets. Anyone can reproduce all our results
with the DCM computer code. All files, variables and other program code related items are printed
in magenta colour. Our Appendix gives detailed instructions for using dcm.py. We also present one
preliminary real use case, where DCM is applied to the observed (O) minus the computed (C) eclipse
epochs of a binary star, XZ And. This DCM analysis reveals evidence for the possible presence of a
third and a fourth body in this system. One recent study of a very large sample of binary stars indicated
that the probability for detecting a fourth body from the O-C data of eclipsing binaries is only about
0.00005.
