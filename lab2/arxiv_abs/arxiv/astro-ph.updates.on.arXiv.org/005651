The observation that the orbits of long-period Kuiper Belt objects are anomalously clustered in
physical space has recently prompted the Planet Nine hypothesis - the proposed existence of a distant
and eccentric planetary member of our solar system. Within the framework of this model, a Neptune-like
perturber sculpts the orbital distribution of distant Kuiper Belt objects through a complex interplay
of resonant and secular effects, such that in addition to perihelion-circulating objects, the
surviving orbits get organized into apsidally aligned and anti-aligned configurations with respect
to Planet Nine's orbit. In this work, we investigate the role of Kuiper Belt initial conditions on
the evolution of the outer solar system using numerical simulations. Intriguingly, we find that
the final perihelion distance distribution depends strongly on the primordial state of the system,
and demonstrate that a bimodal structure corresponding to the existence of both aligned and anti-aligned
clusters is only reproduced if the initial perihelion distribution is assumed to extend well beyond
$\sim 36$ AU. The bimodality in the final perihelion distance distribution is due to the existence
of permanently stable objects, with the lower perihelion peak corresponding to the anti-aligned
orbits and the higher perihelion peak corresponding to the aligned orbits. We identify the mechanisms
which enable the persistent stability of these objects and locate the regions of phase space in which
they reside. The obtained results contextualize the Planet Nine hypothesis within the broader
narrative of solar system formation, and offer further insight into the observational search for
Planet Nine.
