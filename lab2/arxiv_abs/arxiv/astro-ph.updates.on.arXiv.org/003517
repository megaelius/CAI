As a parent population to long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), energetic core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe)
are leading candidates as multi-messenger sources of electromagnetic and gravitational-wave
emission for LIGO-Virgo and KAGRA. While their central engines are currently unknown, this outlook
derives from a general association with newly born neutron stars, black holes and high-density
accretion disks that may extend down to the Inner Most Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) of the latter.
We here highlight the capability of heterogeneous computing for deep searches for broadband extended
gravitational-wave emission (BEGE) from non-axisymmetric accretion flows onto rotating black
holes with durations of tens of seconds similar to Extended Emission in LGRBs and SGRBEEs. Specific
attention is paid to electromagnetic priors derived from BATSE, BeppoSAX and Swift and data-analysis
by GPU-accelerated butterfly filtering with over one million chirp templates per second. In deep
searches using banks of up to 8 million chirp templates, the challenge is to identify signals of astrophysical
origin in a background of pronounced correlations between the LIGO detectors H1 and L1. As the parent
population of normal LGRBs, relatively more frequent supernovae of type Ib/c are of particular
interest to blind all-sky searches, in archive LIGO S6 or real-time observation runs concurrently
with electromagnetic observations covering the Local Universe up to about 100\,Mpc at upcoming
Advanced LIGO sensitivity. Detection of their output in gravitational waves is expected to unambiguously
determine the nature of their central engines and, by implication, that of GRBs.
