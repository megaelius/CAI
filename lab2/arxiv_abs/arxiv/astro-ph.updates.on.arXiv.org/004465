A randomly chosen star in today's Universe is most likely to live in a galaxy with a stellar mass between
that of the Milky Way and Andromeda. Yet it remains uncertain how the structural evolution of these
bulge-disk systems proceeded. Most of the unobscured star formation we observe building Andromdeda
progenitors at 0.7<z<1.5 occurs in disks, but >90% of their star formation is reprocessed by dust
and remains unaccounted for. Here we map 500micron dust continuum emission in an Andromeda progenitor
at z=1.25 to probe where it is growing through dust-obscured star formation. Combining resolved
dust measurements from the NOEMA interferometer with Hubble Space Telescope Halpha maps and multicolor
imaging (including new UV data from the HDUV survey), we find a bulge growing by dust-obscured star
formation: while the unobscured star formation is centrally suppressed, the dust continuum is
centrally concentrated, filling in the ring-like structures evident in the Halpha and UV emission.
Reflecting this, the dust emission is more compact than the optical/UV tracers of star formation
with r_e(dust)=3.4kpc, r_e(Halpha)/r_e(dust)=1.4, and r_e(UV)/r_e(dust)=1.8. Crucially,
however, the bulge and disk of this galaxy are building simultaneously; although the dust emission
is more compact than the rest-optical emission (r_e(optical)/r_e(dust)=1.4), it is somewhat
less compact than the stellar mass (r_e(M_*)/r_e(dust)=0.9). Taking the 500micron emission as
a tracer of star formation, the expected structural evolution of this galaxy can be accounted for
by star formation: it will grow in size by Delta(r_e)/Delta(M_*)~0.3 and central surface density
by Delta(Sigma_cen)/Delta(M_*)~0.9. Finally, our observations are consistent with a picture
in which merging and disk instabilities drive gas to the center of galaxies, boosting global star
formation rates above the main sequence and building bulges.
