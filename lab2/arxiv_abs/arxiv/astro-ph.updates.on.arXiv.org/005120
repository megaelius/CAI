We report Submillimeter Array dust continuum and molecular spectral line observations toward
the Orion Bar photon-dominated region (PDR). The 1.2 mm continuum map reveals, for the first time,
a total of 9 compact (r < 0.01pc) dust condensations located within a distance of ~0.03 pc from the
dissociation front of the PDR. Part of the dust condensations are seen in spectral line emissions
of CS (5-4) and H$_2$CS ($7_{1,7}$-$6_{1,6}$), though the CS map also reveals dense gas further
away from the dissociation front. We detect compact emissions in H$_2$CS ($6_{0,6}$-$5_{0,5}$),
($6_{2,4}$-$5_{2,3}$) and C$^{34}$S, C$^{33}$S (4-3) toward bright dust condensations. The
line ratio of H$_2$CS ($6_{0,6}$-$5_{0,5}$)/($6_{2,4}$-$5_{2,3}$) suggests a temperature
of $73\pm58$ K. A non-thermal velocity dispersion of ~0.25 - 0.50 km s$^{-1}$ is derived from the
high spectral resolution C$^{34}$S data, and indicates a subsonic to transonic turbulence in the
condensations. The masses of the condensations are estimated from the dust emission, and range
from 0.03 to 0.3 $M_{\odot}$, all significantly lower than any critical mass that is required for
self-gravity to play a crucial role. Thus the condensations are not gravitationally bound, and
could not collapse to form stars. In cooperating with recent high resolution observations of the
surface layers of the molecular cloud in the Bar, we speculate that the condensations are produced
as a high-pressure wave induced by the expansion of the HII region compresses and enters the cloud.
A velocity gradient along a direction perpendicular to the major axis of the Bar is seen in H$_2$CS
($7_{1,7}$-$6_{1,6}$), and is consistent with the scenario that the molecular gas behind the dissociation
front is being compressed.
