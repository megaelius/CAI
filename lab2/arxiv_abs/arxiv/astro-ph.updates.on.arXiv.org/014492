The time-scales associated with the various stages of the star formation process remain poorly
constrained. This includes the earliest phases of star formation, during which molecular clouds
condense out of the atomic interstellar medium. We present the first in a series of papers with the
ultimate goal of compiling the first multi-tracer timeline of star formation, through a comprehensive
set of evolutionary phases from atomic gas clouds to unembedded young stellar populations. In this
paper, we present an empirical determination of the lifetime of atomic clouds using the Uncertainty
Principle for Star Formation formalism, based on the de-correlation of H$\alpha$ and H\,{\sc i}
emission as a function of spatial scale. We find an atomic gas cloud lifetime of 48$\substack{+13\\-8}$\,Myr.
This timescale is consistent with the predicted average atomic cloud lifetime in the LMC (based
on galactic dynamics) that is dominated by the gravitational collapse of the mid-plane ISM. We also
determine the overlap time-scale for which both H\,{\sc i} and H$\alpha$ emission are present to
be very short ($t_{over}<1.7$\,Myr), consistent with zero, indicating that there is a near-to-complete
phase change of the gas to a molecular form in an intermediary stage between H\,{\sc i} clouds and
H\,{\sc ii} regions. We utilise the time-scales derived in this work to place empirically determined
limits on the time-scale of molecular cloud formation. By performing the same analysis with and
without the 30 Doradus region included, we find that the most extreme star forming environment in
the LMC has little effect on the measured average atomic gas cloud lifetime. By measuring the lifetime
of the atomic gas clouds, we place strong constraints on the physics that drives the formation of
molecular clouds and establish a solid foundation for the development of a multi-tracer timeline
of star formation in the LMC.
