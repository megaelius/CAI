We present a detailed determination and analysis of 3D stellar mass distribution of the Galactic
disk for mono-age populations using a sample of 0.93 million main-sequence turn-off and subgiant
stars from the LAMOST Galactic Surveys. Our results show (1) all stellar populations younger than
10\,Gyr exhibit strong disk flaring, which is accompanied with a dumpy vertical density profile
that is best described by a $sech^n$ function with index depending on both radius and age; (2) Asymmetries
and wave-like oscillations are presented in both the radial and vertical direction, with strength
varying with stellar populations; (3) As a contribution by the Local spiral arm, the mid-plane stellar
mass density at solar radius but 400--800\,pc (3--6$^\circ$) away from the Sun in the azimuthal
direction has a value of $0.0594\pm0.0008$\,$M_\odot$/pc$^3$, which is 0.0164\,$M_\odot$/pc$^3$
higher than previous estimates at the solar neighborhood. The result causes doubts on the current
estimate of local dark matter density; (4) The radial distribution of surface mass density yields
a disk scale length evolving from $\sim$4\,kpc for the young to $\sim$2\,kpc for the old populations.
The overall population exhibits a disk scale length of $2.48\pm0.05$\,kpc, and a total stellar
mass of $3.6(\pm0.1)\times10^{10}$\,$M_\odot$ assuming $R_{\odot}=8.0$\,kpc, and the value
becomes $4.1(\pm0.1)\times10^{10}$\,$M_\odot$ if $R_{\odot}=8.3$\,kpc; (5) The disk has a
peak star formation rate ({\rm SFR}) changing from 6--8\,Gyr at the inner to 4--6\,Gyr ago at the
outer part, indicating an inside-out assemblage history. The 0--1\,Gyr population yields a recent
disk total {\rm SFR} of $1.96\pm0.12$\,$M_\odot$/yr.
