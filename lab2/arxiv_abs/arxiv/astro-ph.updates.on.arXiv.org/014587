We present a study of the filamentary structure in the emission from the neutral atomic hydrogen
(HI) at 21 cm across velocity channels in the 40"-resolution observations in The HI/OH/Recombination
(THOR) line survey of the inner Milky Way. Using the Hessian matrix method in combination with tools
from circular statistics, we find that the majority of the filamentary structures in the HI emission
are aligned with the Galactic plane. Part of this trend can be assigned to long filamentary structures
that are coherent across several velocity channels. However, we also find ranges of Galactic longitude
and radial velocity where the HI filamentary structures are preferentially oriented perpendicular
to the Galactic plane. These are located (i) around the tangent point of the Scutum spiral arm and
the terminal velocities of the Molecular Ring, around $l\approx 28${\deg} and $v_{\rm LSR}\approx
100$ km/s, (ii) toward $l\approx 45${\deg} and $v_{\rm LSR}\approx 50$ km/s, (iii) around the Riegel-Crutcher
cloud, and (iv) toward the positive and negative terminal velocities. Comparison with numerical
simulations indicates that the prevalence of horizontal filamentary structures is most likely
the result of the large-scale Galactic dynamics and that vertical structures identified in (i)
and (ii) may arise from the combined effect of supernova (SN) feedback and strong magnetic fields.
The vertical filamentary structures in (iv) can be related to the presence of clouds from extra-planar
HI gas falling back into the Galactic plane after being expelled by SNe. Our results indicate that
a systematic characterization of the emission morphology toward the Galactic plane provides an
unexplored link between the observations and the dynamical behaviour of the interstellar medium,
from the effect of large-scale Galactic dynamics to the Galactic fountains driven by SNe.
