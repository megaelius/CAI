HD 144277 was previously discovered by MOST space photometry to be a young and hot delta Scuti star
showing regular groups of pulsation frequencies. The first asteroseismic models required lower
than solar metallicity to fit the observed frequency range based on a purely photometric analysis.
High-resolution, high S/N spectroscopic data obtained with the HARPS spectrograph were used to
determine the fundamental parameters and chemical abundances of HD 144277. These values were put
into context alongside the results from asteroseismic models. The effective temperature, Teff,
of HD 144277 was determined as 8640(+300)(-100) K, log g is 4.14 +/- 0.15 and the projected rotational
velocity, vsini, is 62.0 +/- 2.0 km/s. As the vsini value is significantly larger than previously
assumed, we refined the first asteroseimic model accordingly. The overall metallicity Z was determined
to be 0.011 where the light elements He, C, O, Na, and S show solar chemical composition, but the heavier
elements are significantly underabundant. In addition, the radius of HD 144277 was determined
to be 1.55 +/- 0.65 Rsun from spectral energy distribution fitting, based on photometric data taken
from the literature. From the spectroscopic observations, we could confirm our previous assumption
from asteroseismic models that HD 144277 has less than solar metallicity. The fundamental parameters
derived from asteroseismology, Teff, log g, L/Lsun and R\Rsun, agree within one sigma to the values
found from spectroscopic analysis. As the vsini value is significantly higher than assumed in the
first analysis, near-degeneracies and rotational mode coupling were taken into account in the
new models. These suggest that HD 144277 has an equatorial rotational velocity of about 80 km/s and
is seen equator-on. The observed frequencies are identified as prograde modes.
