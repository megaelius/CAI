We present a detailed study of the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and massive black holes (BHs) of four
of the nearest low-mass early-type galaxies: M32, NGC205, NGC5012, and NGC5206. We measure dynamical
masses of both the BHs and NSCs in these galaxies using Gemini/NIFS or VLT/SINFONI stellar kinematics,
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and Jeans Anisotropic Models. We detect massive BHs in M32,
NGC5102, and NGC5206, while in NGC205, we find only an upper limit. These BH mass estimates are consistent
with previous measurements in M32 and NGC205, while those in NGC5102 and NGC5206 are estimated for
the first time, and both found to be $<$$10^6~M_{\odot}$. This adds to just a handful of galaxies
with dynamically measured sub-million $M_{\odot}$ central BHs. Combining these BH detections
with our recent work on NGC404's BH, we find that 80\% (4/5) of nearby, low-mass ($10^9-10^{10}~M_{\odot}$;
$\sigma_{\star}\sim20-70$ km/s) early-type galaxies host BHs. Such a high occupation fraction
suggests the BH seeds formed in the early epoch of cosmic assembly likely resulted in abundant seeds,
favoring a low-mass seed mechanism of the remnants, most likely from the first generation of massive
stars. We find dynamical masses of the NSCs ranging from $2-80\times10^6~M_{\odot}$ and compare
these masses to scaling relations for NSCs based primarily on photometric mass estimates. Color
gradients suggest younger stellar populations lie at the centers of the NSCs in three of the four
galaxies (NGC205, NGC5102, and NGC5206), while the morphology of two are complex and are best-fit
with multiple morphological components (NGC5102 and NGC5206). The NSC kinematics show they are
rotating, especially in M32 and NGC5102 ($V/\sigma_{\star}\sim0.7$).
