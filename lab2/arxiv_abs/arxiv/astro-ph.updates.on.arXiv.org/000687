We examine the role of energy feedback in shaping the distribution of metals within cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations of L* disc galaxies. While negative abundance gradients today provide
a boundary condition for galaxy evolution models, in support of inside-out disc growth, empirical
evidence as to whether abundance gradients steepen or flatten with time remains highly contradictory.
We made use of a suite of L* discs, realised with and without `enhanced' feedback. All the simulations
were produced using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Gasoline, and their in situ gas-phase
metallicity gradients traced from redshift z~2 to the present-day. Present-day age-metallicity
relations and metallicity distribution functions were derived for each system. The `enhanced'
feedback models, which have been shown to be in agreement with a broad range of empirical scaling
relations, distribute energy and re-cycled ISM material over large scales and predict the existence
of relatively `flat' and temporally invariant abundance gradients. Enhanced feedback schemes
reduce significantly the scatter in the local stellar age-metallicity relation and, especially,
the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] relation. The local [O/Fe] distribution functions for our L* discs show clear
bimodality, with peaks at [O/Fe]=-0.05 and +0.05 (for stars with [Fe/H]>-1), consistent with
our earlier work on dwarf discs. Our results with `enhanced' feedback are inconsistent with our
earlier generation of simulations realised with `conservative' feedback. We conclude that spatially-resolved
metallicity distributions, particularly at high-redshift, offer a unique and under-utilised
constraint on the uncertain nature of stellar feedback processes.
