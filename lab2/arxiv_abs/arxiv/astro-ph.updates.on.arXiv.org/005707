Aims: We aim to understand the fragmentation as well as the disk formation, outflow generation and
chemical processes during high-mass star formation on spatial scales of individual cores. Methods:
Using the IRAM Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) in combination with the 30m telescope,
we have observed in the IRAM large program CORE the 1.37mm continuum and spectral line emission at
high angular resolution (~0.4'') for a sample of 20 well-known high-mass star-forming regions
with distances below 5.5kpc and luminosities larger than 10^4Lsun. Results: We present the overall
survey scope, the selected sample, the observational setup and the main goals of CORE. Scientifically,
we concentrate on the mm continuum emission on scales on the order of 1000AU. We detect strong mm continuum
emission from all regions, mostly due to the emission from cold dust. The fragmentation properties
of the sample are diverse. We see extremes where some regions are dominated by a single high-mass
core whereas others fragment into as many as 20 cores. A minimum-spanning-tree analysis finds fragmentation
at scales on the order of the thermal Jeans length or smaller suggesting that turbulent fragmentation
is less important than thermal gravitational fragmentation. The diversity of highly fragmented
versus singular regions can be explained by varying initial density structures and/or different
initial magnetic field strengths. Conclusions: The smallest observed separations between cores
are found around the angular resolution limit which indicates that further fragmentation likely
takes place on even smaller spatial scales. The CORE project with its numerous spectral line detections
will address a diverse set of important physical and chemical questions in the field of high-mass
star formation.
