Binary stars are thought to be a controlling factor in globular cluster evolution, since they can
heat the environmental stars by converting their binding energy to kinetic energy during dynamical
interactions. Through such interaction, the binaries determine the time until core collapse.
To test predictions of this model, we have determined binary fractions for 35 clusters. Here we present
our methodology with a representative globular cluster NGC 4590. We use HST archival ACS data in
the F606W and F814W bands and apply PSF-fitting photometry to obtain high quality color-magnitude
diagrams. We formulate the star superposition effect as a Poisson probability distribution function,
with parameters optimized through Monte-Carlo simulations. A model-independent binary fraction
of (6.2 +- 0.3)% is obtained by counting stars that extend to the red side of the residual color distribution
after accounting for the photometric errors and the star superposition effect. A model-dependent
binary fraction is obtained by constructing models with a known binary fraction and an assumed binary
mass-ratio distribution function. This leads to a binary fraction range of 6.8% to 10.8%, depending
on the assumed shape to the binary mass ratio distribution, with the best fit occurring for a binary
distribution that favors low mass ratios (and higher binary fractions). We also represent the method
for radial analysis of the binary fraction in the representative case of NGC 6981, which shows a decreasing
trend for the binary fraction towards the outside, consistent with theoretical predictions for
the dynamical effect on the binary fraction.
