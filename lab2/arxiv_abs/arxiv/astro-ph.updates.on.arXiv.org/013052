The ultraviolet-visible wavelength range holds critical spectral diagnostics for the chemistry
and physics at work in planetary atmospheres. To date, exoplanet time-series atmospheric characterization
studies have relied on several combinations of modes on Hubble's STIS/COS instruments to access
this wavelength regime. Here for the first time, we apply the Hubble WFC3/UVIS G280 grism mode to
obtain exoplanet spectroscopy from 200-800 nm in a single observation. We test the G280 grism mode
on the hot Jupiter HAT-P-41b over two consecutive transits to determine its viability for exoplanet
atmospheric characterization. We obtain a broadband transit depth precision of 29-33ppm and a
precision of on average 200ppm in 10nm spectroscopic bins. Spectral information from the G280 grism
can be extracted from both the positive and negative first order spectra, resulting in a 60% increase
in the measurable flux. Additionally, the first HST orbit can be fully utilized in the time-series
analysis. We present detailed extraction and reduction methods for use by future investigations
with this mode, testing multiple techniques. We find the results fully consistent with STIS measurements
of HAT-P-41b from 310-800 nm, with the G280 results representing a more observationally efficient
and precise spectrum. We fit HAT-P-41b's transmission spectrum with a forward model at Teq=2091K,
high metallicity, and significant scattering and cloud opacity. With these first of their kind
observations, we demonstrate that WFC3/UVIS G280 is a powerful new tool to obtain UV-optical spectra
of exoplanet atmospheres, adding to the UV legacy of Hubble and complementing future observations
with the James Webb Space Telescope.
