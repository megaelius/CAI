The core-collapse of a hydrogen rich massive star most often results in a supernova (SN) with a plateau
phase in its light curve. However, in some cases we do not observe this plateau. We present observations
of the unusually luminous supernova 2016gsd that displays little evidence of the expected drop
from the optically thick phase to the radioactively powered tail. With a peak absolute magnitude
of V=$-$19.95$\pm$0.08, this object is one of the brightest type II SNe, and lies in the gap of magnitudes
between the majority of type II SNe and the superluminous SNe. The velocities derived from the absorption
in H are also unusually high with the blue edge tracing the fastest moving gas initially at 20000 kms$^{-1}$
and then declining approximately linearly to 15000 kms$^{-1}$ over ~100 days. The dwarf host galaxy
of the SN indicates a low metallicity progenitor which may also contribute to the weakness of the
metal lines in its spectra. We examine SN 2016gsd with reference to similarly luminous, linear type
II SNe such as SNe 1979C and 1998S, and discuss the interpretation of its observational characteristics.
We compare the observations with a model produced by the JEKYLL code and find that a massive star with
a depleted and inflated hydrogen envelope struggles to reproduce the high luminosity and extreme
linearity of SN 2016gsd. Instead, we suggest that the influence of interaction between the SN ejecta
and circumstellar material can explain the majority of the observed properties of the SN. The high
velocities and strong H$\alpha$ absorption present throughout the evolution of the SN may imply
a CSM configured in an asymmetric geometry.
