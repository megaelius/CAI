We analyze optical spectra of a two-ribbon, long duration C1.1 flare that occurred on 18 Aug 2011
within AR 11271 (SOL2011-08-18T15:15). The impulsive phase of the flare was observed with a comprehensive
set of space-borne and ground-based instruments, which provide a range of unique diagnostics of
the lower flaring atmosphere. Here we report the detection of enhanced continuum emission, observed
in low-resolution spectra from 3600 \AA\ to 4550 \AA\ acquired with the Horizontal Spectrograph
at the Dunn Solar Telescope. A small, $\le$0''.5 ($10^{15}$ cm$^2$) penumbral/umbral kernel brightens
repeatedly in the optical continuum and chromospheric emission lines, similar to the temporal
characteristics of the hard X-ray variation as detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on
the Fermi spacecraft. Radiative-hydrodynamic flare models that employ a nonthermal electron
beam energy flux high enough to produce the optical contrast in our flare spectra would predict a
large Balmer jump in emission, indicative of hydrogen recombination radiation from the upper flare
chromosphere. However, we find no evidence of such a Balmer jump in the bluemost spectral region
of the continuum excess. Just redward of the expected Balmer jump, we find evidence of a "blue continuum
bump" in the excess emission which may be indicative of the merging of the higher order Balmer lines.
The large number of observational constraints provides a springboard for modeling the blue/optical
emission for this particular flare with radiative-hydrodynamic codes, which are necessary to
understand the opacity effects for the continuum and emission line radiation at these wavelengths.
