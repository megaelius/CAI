We study the physical conditions of the circum-galactic medium (CGM) around z=0.25 galaxies as
traced by HI and metal line absorption, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include
galactic outflows. Using lines of sight targeted at impact parameters from 10 kpc to 1 Mpc around
galaxies with halo masses from 10^11-10^13 M_solar, we study the physical conditions and their
variation with impact parameter b and line-of-sight velocity delta v in the CGM as traced by HI, MgII,
SiIV, CIV, OVI, and NeVIII absorbers. All ions show a strong excess of absorption near galaxies compared
to random lines of sight. The excess continues beyond 1 Mpc, reflecting the correlation of metal
absorption with large-scale structure. Absorption is particularly enhanced within about v<300
km/sec and roughly 300 kpc of galaxies (with distances somewhat larger for the highest ion), approximately
delineating the CGM; this range contains the majority of global metal absorption. Low ions like
MgII and SiIV predominantly arise in denser gas closer to galaxies and drop more rapidly with b, while
high ions OVI and NeVIII trace more diffusely distributed gas with a comparatively flat radial profile;
CIV is intermediate. All ions predominantly trace T~10^4-4.5 K photo-ionised gas at all b, but when
hot CGM gas is present (mostly in larger halos), we see strong collisionally-ionised OVI and NeVIII
at b <= 100 kpc. Larger halo masses generally produce more absorption, though overall the trends
are not as strong as that with impact parameter. These findings arise using our favoured outflow
scalings as expected for momentum-driven winds; with no winds, the CGM gas remains mostly unenriched,
while our outflow model with a constant velocity and mass loading factor produce hotter, more widely
dispersed metals.
