Synthetic intensity maps are generated from a 3D kink-unstable flux rope simulation using several
DKIST/DL-NIRSP spectral lines to make a prediction of the observational signatures of energy transport
and release. The reconstructed large field-of-view intensity mosaics and single tile sit-and-stare
high-cadence image sequences show detailed, fine-scale structure and exhibit signatures of wave
propagation, redistribution of heat, flows and fine-scale bursts. These fine-scale bursts are
present in the synthetic Doppler velocity maps and can be interpreted as evidence for small-scale
magnetic reconnection at the loop boundary. The spectral lines reveal the different thermodynamic
structures of the loop, with the hotter lines showing the loop interior and braiding, and the cooler
lines showing the radial edges of the loop. The synthetic observations of DL-NIRSP are found to preserve
the radial expansion and hence the loop radius can be measured accurately. The electron number density
can be estimated using the intensity ratio of the Fe~\textsc{xiii} lines at 10747 and 10798~\AA.
The estimated density from this ratio is correct to within $\pm10\%$ during the later phases of the
evolution, however it is less accurate initially when line-of-sight density inhomogeneities
contribute to the Fe~\textsc{xiii} intensity, resulting in an overprediction of the density by
$\approx30\%$. The identified signatures are all above a conservative estimate for instrument
noise and therefore will be detectable. In summary, we have used forward modelling to demonstrate
that the coronal off-limb mode of DKIST/DL-NIRSP will be able to detect multiple independent signatures
of a kink-unstable loop and observe small-scale transient features including loop braiding/twisting
and small-scale reconnection events occurring at the radial edge of the loop.
