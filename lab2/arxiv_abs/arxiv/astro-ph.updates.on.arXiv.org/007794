Context. Main sequence stars with a convective core are predicted to stochastically excite Internal
Gravity Waves (IGWs), which effectively transport angular momentum throughout the stellar interior
and explain the observed near-uniform interior rotation rates of intermediate-mass stars. However,
there are few detections of IGWs, and fewer still made using photometry, with more detections needed
to constrain numerical simulations. Aims. We aim to formalise the detection and characterisation
of IGWs in photometric observations of stars born with convective cores (M > 1.5 M$_{\odot}$) and
parameterise the low-frequency power excess caused by IGWs. Methods. Using the most recent CoRoT
light curves for a sample of O, B, A and F stars, we parameterise the morphology of the flux contribution
of IGWs in Fourier space using an MCMC numerical scheme within a Bayesian framework. We compare this
to predictions from IGW numerical simulations and investigate how the observed morphology changes
as a function of stellar parameters. Results. We demonstrate that a common morphology for the low-frequency
power excess is observed in early-type stars observed by CoRoT. Our study shows that a background
frequency-dependent source of astrophysical signal is common, which we interpret as IGWs. We provide
constraints on the amplitudes of IGWs and the shape of their detected frequency spectrum across
a range of mass, which is the first ensemble study of stochastic variability in such a diverse sample
of stars. Conclusions. The evidence of a low-frequency power excess across a wide mass range supports
the interpretation of IGWs in photometry of O, B, A and F stars. We also discuss the prospects of observing
hundreds of massive stars with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in the near future.
