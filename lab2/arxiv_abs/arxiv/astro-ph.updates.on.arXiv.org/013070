We report velocity-delay maps for prominent broad emission lines, Ly_alpha, CIV, HeII and H_beta,
in the spectrum of NGC5548. The emission-line responses inhabit the interior of a virial envelope.
The velocity-delay maps reveal stratified ionization structure. The HeII response inside 5-10
light-days has a broad single-peaked velocity profile. The Ly_alpha, CIV, and H_beta responses
peak inside 10 light-days, extend outside 20 light-days, and exhibit a velocity profile with two
peaks separated by 5000 km/s in the 10 to 20 light-day delay range. The velocity-delay maps show that
the M-shaped lag vs velocity structure found in previous cross-correlation analysis is the signature
of a Keplerian disk with a well-defined outer edge at R=20 light-days. The outer wings of the M arise
from the virial envelope, and the U-shaped interior of the M is the lower half of an ellipse in the velocity-delay
plane. The far-side response is weaker than that from the near side, so that we see clearly the lower
half, but only faintly the upper half, of the velocity--delay ellipse. The delay tau=(R/c)(1-sin(i))=5
light-days at line center is from the near edge of the inclined ring, giving the inclination i=45
deg. A black hole mass of M=7x10^7 Msun is consistent with the velocity-delay structure. A barber-pole
pattern with stripes moving from red to blue across the CIV and possibly Ly_alpha line profiles suggests
the presence of azimuthal structure rotating around the far side of the broad-line region and may
be the signature of precession or orbital motion of structures in the inner disk. Further HST observations
of NGC 5548 over a multi-year timespan but with a cadence of perhaps 10 days rather than 1 day could
help to clarify the nature of this new AGN phenomenon.
