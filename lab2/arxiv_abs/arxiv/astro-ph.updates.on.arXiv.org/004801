A collision between two molecular clouds is one possible candidate for high-mass star formation.
The HII region RCW 36, located in the Vela molecular ridge, contains a young star cluster with two
O-type stars. We present new CO observations of RCW 36 with NANTEN2, Mopra, and ASTE using $^{12}$CO($J$
= 1-0, 2-1, 3-2) and $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) line emissions. We have discovered two molecular clouds
lying at the velocities $V_\mathrm{LSR} \sim$5.5 and 9 km s$^{-1}$. Both clouds are likely to be
physically associated with the star cluster, as verified by the good spatial correspondence among
the two clouds, infrared filaments, and the star cluster. We also found a high intensity ratio of
$\sim$0.6-1.2 for CO $J$ = 3-2 / 1-0 toward both clouds, indicating that the gas temperature has been
increased due to heating by the O-type stars. We propose that the O-type stars in RCW 36 were formed
by a collision between the two clouds, with a relative velocity separation of 5 km s$^{-1}$. The complementary
spatial distributions and the velocity separation of the two clouds are in good agreement with observational
signatures expected for O-type star formation triggered by a cloud-cloud collision. We also found
a displacement between the complementary spatial distributions of the two clouds, which we estimate
to be 0.3 pc assuming the collision angle to be 45$^{\circ}$ relative to the line-of-sight. We estimate
the collision timescale to be $\sim$10$^5$ yr. It is probable that the cluster age by Ellerbroek
et al. (2013b) is dominated by the low-mass members which were not formed under the triggering by
cloud-cloud collision, and that the O-type stars in the center of the cluster are explained by the
collisional triggering independently from the low-mass star formation.
