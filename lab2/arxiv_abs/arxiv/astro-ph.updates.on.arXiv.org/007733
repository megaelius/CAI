Coupling between fast magneto-acoustic and Alfv\'en waves can be observe in fully ionized plasmas
mediated by stratification and 3D geometrical effects. In Paper I, Cally & Khomenko (2015) have
shown that in a weakly ionized plasma, such as the solar photosphere and chromosphere, the Hall current
introduces a new coupling mechanism. The present study extends the results from Paper I to the case
of warm plasma. We report on numerical experiments where mode transformation is studied using quasi-realistic
stratification in thermodynamic parameters resembling the solar atmosphere. This redresses
the limitation of the cold plasma approximation assumed in Paper I, in particular allowing the complete
process of coupling between fast and slow magneto-acoustic modes and subsequent coupling of the
fast mode to the Alfv\'en mode through the Hall current. Our results confirm the efficacy of the mechanism
proposed in Paper I for the solar case. We observe that the efficiency of the transformation is a sensitive
function of the angle between the wave propagation direction and the magnetic field, and of the wave
frequency. The efficiency increases when the field direction and the wave direction are aligned
for increasing wave frequencies. After scaling our results to typical solar values, the maximum
amplitude of the transformed Alfv\'en waves, for a frequency of 1 Hz, corresponds to an energy flux
(measured above the height of peak Hall coupling) of $\sim10^3$ $\rm W\,m^{-2}$, based on an amplitude
of 500 $\rm m\,s^{-1}$ at $\beta=1$, which is sufficient to play a major role in both quiet and active
region coronal heating.
