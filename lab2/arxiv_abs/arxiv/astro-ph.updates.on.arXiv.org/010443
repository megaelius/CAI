We report radio continuum and molecular line observations of the Galactic super star cluster RCW38,
obtained from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array with a minimum angular resolution
of $0''17\times0''15$ ($\simeq289\,{\rm AU}\times255\,{\rm AU}$). The C$^{18}$O image reveal
many massive condensations embedded within filamentary structures extending along the northwest-southeast
direction in the center of cluster. The condensations have sizes of 0.01--0.02pc, H$_2$ column
densities of $10^{23}$--$10^{24}$\,cm$^{-2}$, and H$_2$ masses of 10--130$M_\odot$. In addition,
the 233-GHz continuum image discovered that two dense, small millimeter-sources with radii of
460 and 200 AU (SourceA and SourceB). SourceA is embedded within the most massive C$^{18}$O condensation,
whereas no counterpart is seen for SourceB. The masses of SourceA and SourceB are estimated as 13
and 3$M_\odot$ at the optically-thin limit, respectively. The C$^{18}$O emission shows a velocity
gradient of 2km/s at the central 2000AU of SourceA, which could be interpreted as a Keplerian rotation
with a central mass of a few $M_\odot$ or infall motion of gas. Further, the ALMA $^{12}$CO data reveal
that SourceA and SourceB are associated with molecular outflows exhibiting maximum velocities
of $\sim$30--70km/s. The outflows have short dynamical timescales of $<$1000yr and high mass outflow
rates of $\sim10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}\,M_\odot$/yr. These observational signatures suggest an
early evolutionary phase of the massive star formation in SourceA and SourceB, although further
investigation based on the high-resolution observations are needed to reach a firm conclusion.
