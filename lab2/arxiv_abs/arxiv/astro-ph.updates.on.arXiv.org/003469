We investigate the nature of the extragalactic unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) by cross-correlating
several galaxy catalogs with sky-maps of the UGRB built from 78 months of Pass 8 Fermi-Large Area
Telescope data. This study updates and improves similar previous analyses in several aspects.
Firstly, the use of a larger gamma-ray dataset allows us to investigate the energy dependence of
the cross-correlation in more detail, using up to 8 energy bins over a wide energy range of [0.25-500]
GeV. Secondly, we consider larger and deeper catalogs (2MASS Photometric-Redshift catalog, 2MPZ;
WISE x SuperCOSMOS, WISC; and SDSS-DR12 photometric-redshift dataset) in addition to the ones
employed in the previous studies (NVSS and SDSS-QSOs). Thirdly, we exploit the redshift information
available for the above catalogs to divide them into redshift bins and perform the cross-correlation
separately in each of them. Our results confirm, with higher statistical significance, the detection
of cross-correlation signal between the UGRB maps and all the catalogs considered, on angular scales
smaller than 1 degree. Significances range from 16.3 sigma for NVSS, 7 sigma for SDSS-DR12 and WISC,
5 sigma for 2MPZ and 4 sigma for SDSS-QSOs. Furthermore, including redshift tomography, the significance
of the SDSS-DR12 signal strikingly rises up to 12 sigma and the one of WISC to 10.6 sigma. We offer a
simple interpretation of the signal in the framework of the halo model. The precise redshift and
energy information allows us to clearly detect a change over redshift in the spectral and clustering
behavior of the gamma-ray sources contributing to the UGRB.
