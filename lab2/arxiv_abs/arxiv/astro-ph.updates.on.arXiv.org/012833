Outflows form an integral component in regulating the gas cycling in and out of galaxies, although
their impact on the galaxy hosts is still poorly understood. Here we present an analysis of 405 high
mass (log M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}\geqslant10$), star-forming galaxies (excluding AGN) with low
inclinations at $z\sim$0, using stacking techniques of the NaD $\lambda\lambda$5889,5895 A neutral
gas tracer in IFU observations from the MaNGA DR15 survey. We detect outflows in the central regions
of 78/405 galaxies and determine their extent and power through the construction of stacked annuli.
We find outflows are most powerful in central regions and extend out to $\sim$1R$_{e}$, with declining
mass outflow rates and loading factors as a function of radius. The stacking of spaxels over key galaxy
quantities reveals outflow detections in regions of high $\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$ ($\gtrsim$0.01
M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$) and $\Sigma_{M_{*}}$ ($\gtrsim$10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$kpc$^{-2}$)
along the resolved main sequence. Clear correlations with $\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$ suggest it is
the main regulator of outflows, with a critical threshold of $\sim$0.01 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$
needed to escape the weight of the disk and launch them. Furthermore, measurements of the H$\delta$
and D$_{n}$4000 indices reveal virtually identical star formation histories between galaxies
with outflows and those without. Finally, through stacking of HI 21 cm observations for a subset
of our sample, we find outflow galaxies show reduced HI gas fractions at central velocities compared
to their non-detection control counterparts, suggestive of some removal of HI gas, likely in the
central regions of the galaxies, but not enough to completely quench the host.
