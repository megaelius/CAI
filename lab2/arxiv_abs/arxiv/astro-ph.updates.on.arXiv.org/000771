We have studied the SC (short cadence) Kepler light curve of an SU UMa star, V1504 Cyg, which extends
for a period of about 630 d. All superoutbursts in V1504 Cyg have turned out to be of the precursor-main
type and the superhump first appears near the maximum of the precursor. The superhumps grow smoothly
from the precursor to the main superoutburst showing that the superoutburst is initiated by the
tidal instability (as evidenced by growing superhump) as envisioned in the thermal-tidal instability
(TTI) model proposed by Osaki (1989). We have performed power spectral analysis of the light curve
of V1504 Cyg. One of outstanding features is an appearance of a negative superhump extending for
around 300 d, well over a supercycle. We have found that an appearance of the negative superhump tends
to reduce the frequency of occurrence of normal outbursts. Two types of supercycles are recognized
in V1504 Cyg, which are similar to those of the Type L and S supercycles in the light curve of VW Hyi,
a prototype SU UMa star, introduced by Smak (1985). It is found that the Type L supercycle is the one
accompanied with the negative superhump and the Type S is that without the negative superhump. If
we adopt a tilted disk as an origin of the negative superhump, two types of the supercycles are understood
to be due to a difference in outburst intervals, which is in turn caused by a difference in mass supply
from the secondary to different parts of the disk. The frequency of the negative superhump varies
systematically during a supercycle in V1504 Cyg. This variation can be used as an indicator of the
disk radius variation and we have found that observed disk radius variation in V1504 Cyg fits very
well with a prediction of the TTI model.
