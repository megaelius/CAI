Main sequence, fully-convective M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries are observed to be larger than stellar
evolutionary models predict by as much as $10-15\%$. A proposed explanation for this discrepancy
involves effects from strong magnetic fields, induced by rapid-rotation via the dynamo process.
Although, a handful of single, slowly-rotating M dwarfs with radius measurements from interferometry
also appear to be larger than models predict, suggesting that rotation or binarity specifically
may not be the sole cause of the discrepancy. We test whether single, rapidly rotating, fully convective
stars are also larger than expected by measuring their $R \sin i$ distribution. We combine photometric
rotation periods from the literature with rotational broadening ($v \sin i$) measurements reported
in this work for a sample of 88 rapidly rotating M dwarf stars. Using a Bayesian framework, we find
that stellar evolutionary models underestimate the radii by $10-15\% \substack{+3 \\ -2.5}$,
but that at higher masses ($0.18<M<0.4 M_{Sun}$) the discrepancy is only about $6\%$ and comparable
to results from interferometry and eclipsing binaries. At the lowest masses ($0.08<M<0.18 M_{Sun}$),
we find the discrepancy between observations and theory is $13-18\%$, and we argue that the discrepancy
is unlikely to be due to effects from age. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant radius
discrepancy between our sample and the handful of M dwarfs with interferometric radii. We conclude
that neither rotation nor binarity is responsible for the inflated radii of fully convective M dwarfs,
and that all fully-convective M dwarfs are larger than models predict.
