Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a rare (< 10%) subclass of core-collapse SNe that exhibit relatively
narrow emission lines from a dense, pre-existing circumstellar medium (CSM). In 2009, a warm Spitzer
survey observed 30 SNe IIn discovered in 2003 - 2008 and detected 10 SNe at distances out to 175 Mpc
with unreported late-time infrared emission, in some cases more than 5 years post-discovery. For
this single epoch of data, the warm-dust parameters suggest the presence of a radiative heating
source consisting of optical/X-ray emission continuously generated by ongoing CSM interaction.
Here we present multi-wavelength follow-up observations of this sample of 10 SNe IIn and the well-studied
Type IIn SN 2010jl. A recent epoch of Spitzer observations reveals ongoing mid-infrared emission
from nine of the SNe in this sample. We also detect three of the SNe in archival WISE data, in addition
to SNe 1987A, 2004dj, and 2008iy. For at least five of the SNe in the sample, optical and/or X-ray emission
confirms the presence of radiative emission from ongoing CSM interaction. The two Spitzer nondetections
are consistent with the forward shock overrunning and destroying the dust shell, a result that places
upper limits on the dust-shell size. The optical and infrared observations confirm the radiative
heating model and constrain a number of model parameters, including progenitor mass-loss characteristics.
All of the SNe in this sample experienced an outburst on the order of tens to hundreds of years prior
to the SN explosion followed by periods of less intense mass loss. Although all evidence points to
massive progenitors, the variation in the data highlights the diversity in SN IIn progenitor evolution.
While these observations do not identify a particular progenitor system, they demonstrate that
future, coordinated, multi-wavelength campaigns can constrain theoretical mass-loss models.
