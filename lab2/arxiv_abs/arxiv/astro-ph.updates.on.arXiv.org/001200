We study the dynamics of super-Eddington accretion flows by performing two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations. Compared to previous works, in this paper we include the $T_{\theta\phi}$ component
of the viscous stress and consider various values of viscous parameter $\alpha$. We find that when
$T_{\theta\phi}$ is included, the rotational speed of the high-latitude flow decreases; while
the density increases and decreases at the high- and low-latitudes, respectively. We calculate
the radial profiles of inflow and outflow rates. We find that the inflow rate decreases inward, following
a power-law form of $\dot{M}_{\rm in}\propto r^s$. The value of $s$ depends on the magnitude of $\alpha$
and is within the range of $\sim 0.4-1.0$. Correspondingly, the radial profile of density becomes
flatter compared to the case of a constant $\dot{M}(r)$. We find that the density profile can be described
by $\rho(r)\propto r^{-p}$, and the value of $p$ is almost same for a wide range of $\alpha$ ranging
from $\alpha=0.1$ to $0.005$. The inward decrease of inflow accretion rate is very similar to hot
accretion flows, which is attributed to the mass loss in outflows. To study the origin of outflow,
we analyze the convective stability of slim disk. We find that depending on the value of $\alpha$,
the flow is marginally stable (when $\alpha$ is small) or unstable (when $\alpha$ is large). This
is different from the case of hydrodynamical hot accretion flow where radiation is dynamically
unimportant and the flow is always convectively unstable. We speculate that the reason for the difference
is because radiation can stabilize convection. The origin of outflow is thus likely because of the
joint function of convection and radiation, but further investigation is required.
