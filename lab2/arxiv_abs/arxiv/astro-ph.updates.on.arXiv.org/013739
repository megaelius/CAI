The detected Na/Mg ratio in a sample of 17 Na-enhanced and Na-rich meteors is investigated based
on obtained spectral, orbital and structural data. We utilize the meteor observations of the AMOS
network obtained within a survey of medium-sized meteoroids supplemented by higher-resolution
spectra observed on the Canary Islands. Ground-based meteor observations are then compared with
high-resolution Echelle spectra of simulated ablation of known meteorite samples in a high-enthalpy
plasma wind tunnel. It was found that most Na-enhanced and Na-rich spectra can be explained by the
effect of low meteor speed related to low ablation temperatures and generally do not reflect real
meteoroid composition. Spectra obtained by the laboratory experiment simulating low meteor speeds
show corresponding Na-rich profiles irrespectively of the meteorite composition. We estimate
that for an H-type ordinary chondrite with speed of $\approx$ 10 km/s, the Na line intensity is increased
by a factor of 40 to 95. The dynamical analysis has revealed that all Na-rich meteors originated on
Apollo-type orbits and exhibit consistent chondritic material strengths. For more clarity in
the classification of Na-enhanced and Na-rich meteoroids, we propose new speed-dependent boundaries
between the spectral classes. Real compositional Na enhancement was confirmed in five cometary
meteoroids: two Perseids, an $\alpha$-Capricornid, $\nu$-Draconid and a sporadic. The two Na-enhanced
Perseids were linked with increased material strength suggesting that the detected increase of
volatile content has implications for the meteoroid structure.
