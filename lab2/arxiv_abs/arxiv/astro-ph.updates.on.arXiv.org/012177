Recent evidence from abundance patterns of chemical elements in solar energetic particles (SEPs),
and, ironically, the belated inclusion of H and He, has provided evidence for four distinct physical
pathways of SEP acceleration. Abundance measurements divide each of the previous categories of
impulsive and gradual SEP events, based upon the presence or absence of shock acceleration, or upon
the dominance of either preaccelerated ions or ambient coronal plasma. SEPs are drawn from plasma
that originally entered the solar corona on magnetic loops in active regions where, relative to
the photosphere, abundances of elements depends upon the first ionization potential (FIP) so that
SEPs differ from the solar wind which rises on open magnetic fields. After FIP fractionation, acceleration
of impulsive-source SEP1 ions, at islands of magnetic reconnection in solar jets, generates an
additional steep power-law dependence of abundance enhancements vs. the ion mass-to-charge ratio
A/Q, with Q-values determined by a source temperature of T~3 MK. For these SEP1 ions, proton abundances
at A/Q=1 fall on the power-law-fit line from elements Z=6-56. More acceleration of SEP1 ions by shock
waves can add protons from the ambient plasma to supply "excess protons" above the fit line, a new
signature of shock acceleration, either locally in the same jet to define SEP2 ions or at an extensive
shock averaging residual ions from a multi-jet active region to defining SEP3. Larger gradual SEP
events, with stronger shocks, sample more deeply the ambient coronal material with T =0.8-1.6 MK,
and, for these SEP4 events, proton abundances can again fit the power-law extrapolated from the
fit of Z>2 ions. Particle acceleration and transport with simple power-law dependences on velocity
and A/Q has provided an unexpected but powerful new tool with signatures of the dominant physical
processes involved.
