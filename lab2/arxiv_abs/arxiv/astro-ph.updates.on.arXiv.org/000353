We present wide-field near-infrared J and Ks images of the Andromeda Galaxy taken with WIRCam on
the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) as part of the Andromeda Optical and Infrared Disk Survey
(ANDROIDS). This data set allows simultaneous observations of resolved stars and NIR surface brightness
across M31's entire bulge and disk (within R=22 kpc). The primary concern of this work is the development
of NIR observation and reduction methods to recover a uniform surface brightness map across the
3x1 degree disk of M31. This necessitates sky-target nodding across 27 WIRCam fields. Two sky-target
nodding strategies were tested, and we find that strictly minimizing sky sampling latency does
not maximize sky subtraction accuracy, which is at best 2% of the sky level. The mean surface brightness
difference between blocks in our mosaic can be reduced from 1% to 0.1% of the sky brightness by introducing
scalar sky offsets to each image. The true surface brightness of M31 can be known to within a statistical
zeropoint of 0.15% of the sky level (0.2 mag arcsec sq. uncertainty at R=15 kpc). Surface brightness
stability across individual WIRCam frames is limited by both WIRCam flat field evolution and residual
sky background shapes. To overcome flat field variability of order 1% over 30 minutes, we find that
WIRCam data should be calibrated with real-time sky flats. Due either to atmospheric or instrumental
variations, the individual WIRCam frames have typical residual shapes with amplitudes of 0.2%
of the sky after real-time flat fielding and median sky subtraction. We present our WIRCam reduction
pipeline and performance analysis here as a template for future near-infrared observers needing
wide-area surface brightness maps with sky-target nodding, and give specific recommendations
for improving photometry of all CFHT/WIRCam programs. (Abridged)
