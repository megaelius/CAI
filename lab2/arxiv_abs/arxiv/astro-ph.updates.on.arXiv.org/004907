We propose quartic inflation with non-minimal gravitational coupling in the context of the classically
conformal U(1)_X extension of the SM. In this model, the U(1)_X gauge symmetry is radiatively broken
through the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) mechanism, by which the U(1)_X gauge boson (Z' boson) and the
right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) acquire their masses. We consider their masses in the range of O(10
GeV)-O(10 TeV), which are accessible to high energy collider experiments. The radiative U(1)_X
gauge symmetry breaking also generates a negative mass squared for the SM Higgs doublet, and the
electroweak symmetry breaking occurs subsequently. We identify the U(1)_X Higgs field with inflaton
and calculate the inflationary predictions. Due to the CW mechanism, the inflaton quartic coupling
during inflation, which determines the inflationary predictions, is correlated to the U(1)_X
gauge coupling. With this correlation, we investigate complementarities between the inflationary
predictions and the current constraint from the Z' boson resonance search at the LHC Run-2 as well
as the prospect of the search for the Z' boson and the RHNs at the future collider experiments. The
