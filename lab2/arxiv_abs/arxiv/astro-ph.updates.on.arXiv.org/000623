Expulsion of neutron-rich matter following the merger of neutron star (NS) binaries is crucial
to the radioactively-powered electromagnetic counterparts of these events and to their relevance
as sources of r-process nucleosynthesis. Numerical simulations of NS-NS coalescence find, however,
a wide range in the quantity of prompt dynamically-ejected mass. Here we explore the long-term (viscous)
evolution of remnant black hole accretion disks formed in such mergers by means of two-dimensional,
time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations. The evolution of the electron fraction due to charged-current
weak interactions is included, and neutrino self-irradiation is modeled as a lightbulb that accounts
for the disk geometry and moderate optical depth effects. Over several viscous times (~1s), a fraction
~10% of the initial disk mass is ejected as a moderately neutron-rich wind (Y_e ~ 0.2) powered by viscous
heating and nuclear recombination, with neutrino self-irradiation playing a sub-dominant role.
Although the properties of the outflow vary in time and direction, their mean values in the heavy-element
production region are relatively robust to variations in the initial conditions of the disk and
the magnitude of its viscosity. The outflow is sufficiently neutron-rich that most of the ejecta
forms heavy r-process elements with mass number A >130, thus representing a new astrophysical
source of r-process nucleosynthesis, distinct from that produced in the dynamical ejecta. Due
to its moderately high entropy, disk outflows contain a small residual fraction ~1% of helium, which
could produce a unique spectroscopic signature.
