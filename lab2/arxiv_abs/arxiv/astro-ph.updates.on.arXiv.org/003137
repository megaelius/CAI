I compare to each other what I consider to be the two most promising scenarios to explode core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe). Both are based on the negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). In the jittering
jets scenario a collapsing core of a single slowly-rotating star can launch jets. The accretion
disk or belt (a sub-Keplerian accretion flow concentrated toward the equatorial plane) that launches
the jets is intermittent with varying directions of the axis. Instabilities, such as the standing
accretion shock instability (SASI), lead to stochastic angular momentum variations that allow
the formation of the intermittent accretion disk/belt. According to this scenario no failed CCSNe
exist. According to the fixed axis scenario, the core of the progenitor star must be spun up during
its late evolutionary phases, and hence all CCSNe are descendants of strongly interacting binary
systems, most likely through a common envelope evolution (whether the companion survives or not).
Due to the strong binary interaction, the axis of the accretion disk that is formed around the newly
born neutron star has a more or less fixed direction. According to the fixed axis scenario, accretion
disk/belt are not formed around the newly born neutron star of single stars; they rather end in failed
CCSNe. I also raise the possibility that the jittering jets scenario operates for progenitors with
initial mass of 8Mo<M(ZAMS)<18Mo, while the fixed axis scenario operates for M(ZAMS)>18Mo. For
the first time these two scenarios are compared to each other, as well as to some aspects of neutrino-driven
explosion mechanism. These new comparisons further suggest that the JFM plays a major role in exploding
massive stars.
