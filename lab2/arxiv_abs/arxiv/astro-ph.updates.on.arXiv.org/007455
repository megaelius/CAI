Binary Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs accreting mass from non-degenerate stellar companions
through the single-degenerate channel have reigned for decades as the leading explanation of Type
Ia supernovae. Yet, a comprehensive theoretical explanation has not yet emerged to explain the
expected properties of the canonical near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf model. A simmering
phase within the convective core of the white dwarf leads to the ignition of one or more flame bubbles
scattered across the core. Consequently, near-Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia
are inherently stochastic, and are expected to lead to a range of outcomes, from subluminous SN 2002cx-like
events, to overluminous SN 1991T-like events. However, all prior simulations of the single-degenerate
channel carried through the detonation phase have set the ignition points as free parameters. In
this work, for the first time, we place ignition points as predicted by {\it ab initio} models of the
convective phase leading up to ignition, and follow through the detonation phase in fully three-dimensional
simulations. Single-degenerates in this framework are characteristically overluminous. Using
a statistical approach, we determine the $^{56}$Ni mass distribution arising from stochastic
ignition. While there is a total spread of $\gtrsim 0.2 M_{\odot}$ for detonating models, the distribution
is strongly left-skewed, and with a narrow standard deviation of $\simeq 0.03 M_{\odot}$. Conversely,
if single-degenerates are not overluminous but primarily yield normal or failed events, then the
models require fine-tuning of the ignition parameters, or otherwise require revised physics or
progenitor models. We discuss implications of our findings for the modeling of single-degenerate
SNe Ia.
