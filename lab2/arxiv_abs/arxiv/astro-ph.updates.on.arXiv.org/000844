The early stages of planet formation are still not well understood. Coagulation models have revealed
numerous obstacles to the dust growth, such as the bouncing, fragmentation and radial drift barriers.
We study the interplay between dust coagulation and drift in order to determine the conditions in
protoplanetary disk that support the formation of planetesimals. We focus on planetesimal formation
via sweep-up and investigate whether it can take place in a realistic protoplanetary disk. We have
developed a new numerical model that resolves spatial distribution of dust in the radial and vertical
dimension. The model uses representative particles approach to follow the dust evolution in protoplanetary
disk. The coagulation and fragmentation of solids is taken into account using Monte Carlo method.
A collision model adopting the mass transfer effect, that can occur for different-sized dust aggregate
collisions, is implemented. We focus on a protoplanetary disk including a pressure bump caused
by a steep decline of turbulent viscosity around the snow line. Our results show that sufficient
resolution of the vertical disk structure in dust coagulation codes is necessary to obtain adequately
short growth timescales, especially in the case of a low turbulence region. We find that a sharp radial
variation of the turbulence strength at the inner edge of dead zone promotes planetesimal formation
in several ways. It provides a pressure bump that efficiently prevents the dust from drifting inwards.
It also causes a radial variation in the size of aggregates at which growth barriers occur, favoring
the growth of large aggregates via sweeping up of small particles. In our model, by employing an ad
hoc alpha viscosity change near the snow line, it is possible to grow planetesimals by incremental
growth on timescales of approximately 10^5 years.
