Ultra-high energy neutrinos are detectable through impulsive radio signals generated through
interactions in dense media, such as ice. Subsurface in-ice radio arrays are a promising way to advance
the observation and measurement of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos with energies above those
discovered by the IceCube detector ($\geq$1 PeV) as well as cosmogenic neutrinos created in the
GZK process ($\geq$100 PeV). Here we describe the $\textit{NuPhase}$ detector, which is a compact
receiving array of low-gain antennas deployed 185 m deep in glacial ice near the South Pole. Signals
from the antennas are digitized and coherently summed into multiple beams to form a low-threshold
interferometric phased array trigger for radio impulses. The NuPhase detector was installed at
an Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) station during the 2017/18 Austral summer season. $\textit{In situ}$
measurements with an impulsive, point-source calibration instrument show a 50% trigger efficiency
on impulses with voltage signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of $\le$2.0, a factor of $\sim$1.8 improvement
in SNR over the standard ARA combinatoric trigger. Hardware-level simulations, validated with
$\textit{in situ}$ measurements, predict a trigger threshold of an SNR as low as 1.6 for neutrino
interactions that are in the far field of the array. With the already-achieved NuPhase trigger performance
included in ARASim, a detector simulation for the ARA experiment, we find the trigger-level effective
detector volume is increased by a factor of 1.8 at neutrino energies between 10 and 100 PeV compared
to the currently used ARA combinatoric trigger. We also discuss an achievable near term path toward
lowering the trigger threshold further to an SNR of 1.0, which would increase the effective single-station
volume by more than a factor of 3 in the same range of neutrino energies.
