Context. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) launch highly energetic jets sometimes outshining their
host galaxy. These jets are collimated outflows that have been accelerated near a supermassive
black hole located at the centre of the galaxy. Their, virtually indispensable, energy reservoir
is either due to gravitational energy released from accretion or due to the extraction of kinetic
energy from the rotating supermassive black hole itself. In order to channel part of this energy
to the jet, though, the presence of magnetic fields is necessary. The extent to which these magnetic
fields survive in the jet further from the launching region is under debate. Nevertheless, observations
of polarised emission and Faraday rotation measure confirm the existence of large scale magnetic
fields in jets. Results. Radio emission distributions from the jets with dominant large-scale
helical fields show asymmetry across their width. The Faraday rotation asymmetry is the same for
fields with opposing chirality (handedness). For jets which are tilted towards the observer the
synchrotron emission and fractional polarization can distinguish the fields chirality. When
viewed either side-on or at a Blazar type angle only the fractional polarization can make this distinction.
Further this distinction can only be made if the direction of the jet propagation velocity is known,
along with the location of the jet's origin. The complex structure of the braided field is found not
to be observable due to a combination of line of sight integration and limited resolution of observation.
This raises the possibility that, even if asymmetric radio emission signatures are present, the
true structure of the field may still be obscure.
