We present a multiwavelength study of the flat-spectrum radio quasar CTA 102 during 2013-2017.
We use radio-to-optical data obtained by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope, 15 GHz data from the Owens
Valley Radio Observatory, 91 and 103 GHz data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, near-infrared
data from the Rapid Eye Monitor telescope, as well as data from the Swift (optical-UV and X-rays)
and Fermi ($\gamma$ rays) satellites to study flux and spectral variability and the correlation
between flux changes at different wavelengths. Unprecedented $\gamma$-ray flaring activity
was observed during 2016 November-2017 February, with four major outbursts. A peak flux of (2158
$\pm$ 63)$\times$10$^{-8}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a luminosity of (2.2 $\pm$
0.1)$\times$10$^{50}$ erg s$^{-1}$, was reached on 2016 December 28. These four $\gamma$-ray
outbursts have corresponding events in the near-infrared, optical and UV bands, with the peaks
observed at the same time. A general agreement between X-ray and $\gamma$-ray activity is found.
The $\gamma$-ray flux variations show a general, strong correlation with the optical ones with
no time lag between the two bands and a comparable variability amplitude. This $\gamma$-ray/optical
relationship is in agreement with the geometrical model that has successfully explained the low-energy
flux and spectral behaviour, suggesting that the long-term flux variations are mainly due to changes
in the Doppler factor produced by variations of the viewing angle of the emitting regions. The difference
in behaviour between radio and higher-energy emission would be ascribed to different viewing angles
of the jet regions producing their emission.
