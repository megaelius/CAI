The next generation of electromagnetic and gravitational wave observatories will open unprecedented
windows to the birth of the first supermassive black holes. This has the potential to reveal their
origin and growth in the first billion years, as well as the signatures of their formation history
in the local Universe. With this in mind, we outline three key focus areas which will shape research
in the next decade and beyond: (1) What were the "seeds" of the first quasars; how did some reach a billion
solar masses before z$\sim7$? (2) How does black hole growth change over cosmic time, and how did
the early growth of black holes shape their host galaxies? What can we learn from intermediate mass
black holes (IMBHs) and dwarf galaxies today? (3) Can we unravel the physics of black hole accretion,
understanding both inflows and outflows (jets and winds) in the context of the theory of general
relativity? Is it valid to use these insights to scale between stellar and supermassive BHs, i.e.,
is black hole accretion really scale invariant? In the following, we identify opportunities for
the Canadian astronomical community to play a leading role in addressing these issues, in particular
by leveraging our strong involvement in the Event Horizon Telescope, the {\it James Webb Space Telescope}
(JWST), Euclid, the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE), the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT),
the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), the Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and ultraviolet
Research (CASTOR), and more. We also discuss synergies with future space-based gravitational
wave (LISA) and X-ray (e.g., Athena, Lynx) observatories, as well as the necessity for collaboration
with the stellar and galactic evolution communities to build a complete picture of the birth of supermassive
black holes, and their growth and their influence over the history of the Universe.
