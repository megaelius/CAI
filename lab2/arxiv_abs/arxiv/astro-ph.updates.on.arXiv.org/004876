The importance of radiation pressure feedback in galaxy formation has been extensively debated
over the last decade. The regime of greatest uncertainty is in the most actively star-forming galaxies,
where large dust columns can potentially produce a dust-reprocessed infrared radiation field
with enough pressure to drive turbulence or eject material. Here we derive the conditions under
which a self-gravitating, mixed gas-star disc can remain hydrostatic despite trapped radiation
pressure. Consistently taking into account the self-gravity of the medium, the star- and dust-to-gas
ratios, and the effects of turbulent motions not driven by radiation, we show that galaxies can achieve
a maximum Eddington-limited star formation rate per unit area $\dot{\Sigma}_{\rm *,crit} \sim
10^3 M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, corresponding to a critical flux of $F_{\rm *,crit} \sim
10^{13} L_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$ similar to previous estimates; higher fluxes eject mass in bulk,
halting further star formation. Conversely, we show that in galaxies below this limit, our one-dimensional
models imply simple vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and that radiation pressure is ineffective
at driving turbulence or ejecting matter. Because the vast majority of star-forming galaxies lie
below the maximum limit for typical dust-to-gas ratios, we conclude that infrared radiation pressure
is likely unimportant for all but the most extreme systems on galaxy-wide scales. Thus, while radiation
pressure does not explain the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, it does impose an upper truncation on
it. Our predicted truncation is in good agreement with the highest observed gas and star formation
rate surface densities found both locally and at high redshift.
