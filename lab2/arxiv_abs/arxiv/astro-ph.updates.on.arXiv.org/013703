Cosmological analyses of galaxy surveys rely on knowledge of the redshift distribution of their
galaxy sample. This is usually derived from a spectroscopic and/or many-band photometric calibrator
survey of a small patch of sky. The uncertainties in the redshift distribution of the calibrator
sample include a contribution from shot noise, or Poisson sampling errors, but, given the small
volume they probe, they are dominated by sample variance introduced by large-scale structures.
Redshift uncertainties have been shown to constitute one of the leading contributions to systematic
uncertainties in cosmological inferences from weak lensing and galaxy clustering, and hence they
must be propagated through the analyses. In this work, we study the effects of sample variance on
small-area redshift surveys, from theory to simulations to the COSMOS2015 data set. We present
a three-step Dirichlet method of resampling a given survey-based redshift calibration distribution
to enable the propagation of both shot noise and sample variance uncertainties. The method can accommodate
different levels of prior confidence on different redshift sources. This method can be applied
to any calibration sample with known redshifts and phenotypes (i.e. cells in a self-organizing
map, or some other way of discretizing photometric space), and provides a simple way of propagating
prior redshift uncertainties into cosmological analyses. As a worked example, we apply the full
scheme to the COSMOS2015 data set, for which we also present a new, principled SOM algorithm designed
to handle noisy photometric data. We make available a catalog of the resulting resamplings of the
COSMOS2015 galaxies.
