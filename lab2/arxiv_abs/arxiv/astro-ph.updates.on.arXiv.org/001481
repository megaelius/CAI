Strongly stratified hydromagnetic turbulence has recently been identified as a candidate for
explaining the spontaneous formation of magnetic flux concentrations by the negative effective
magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI). Much of this work has been done for isothermal layers for
which the density scale height is constant throughout. We now study the validity of earlier conclusions
about the size and growth rate of magnetic structures in the case of polytropic layers, which scale
height decreases sharply towards the surface. To allow for a continuous transition from isothermal
to polytropic layers, we employ a generalization of the exponential function known as the q-exponential.
Now, the top of the polytropic layer shifts with the polytropic index such that the scale height at
some reference height is always the same. We use both mean-field and direct numerical simulations
of forced stratified turbulence to determine the resulting flux concentrations. Magnetic structures
begin to form at a depth where magnetic field strength is about 3-4% the local equipartition field
strength with respect to the turbulent kinetic energy. Unlike the isothermal case where stronger
fields can give rise to magnetic flux concentrations at larger depths, in the polytropic one the
growth rates decreases for structures deeper down. For vertical fields, magnetic structures of
super-equipartition strengths are formed because such fields survive downward advection, unlike
NEMPI under horizontal magnetic fields. The horizontal cross-section of such structures is approximately
circular. Results based on isothermal models can be applied locally to polytropic layers. For vertical
fields, magnetic flux concentrations of super-equipartition strengths form, which supports
suggestions that sunspot formation might be a shallow phenomenon.
