In this {\it Letter}, we present the result of an axisymmetric CCSN simulation conducted with appropriate
treatments of neutrino transport and proper motions of proto-neutron star (PNS), in which a remarkable
PNS acceleration is observed in association with asymmetric neutrino emissions by the time of $300$ms
after bounce. We find that these asymmetric neutrino emissions play important roles in the acceleration
of PNS in this phase. The correlation between the PNS proper motion and the asymmetric ejecta is similar
to that in the neutron star (NS) kick of hydrodynamic origin. Both electron-type neutrinos ($\nu_{\rm
e}$) and their anti-particles ($\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$) have $\sim 10\%$ level of asymmetry between
the northern and southern hemispheres, while other heavy-leptonic neutrinos ($\nu_x$) have much
smaller asymmetry of $\sim 1 \%$. The emissions of $\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$ and $\nu_x$ are higher in
the hemisphere of stronger shock expansion whereas the $\nu_{\rm e}$ emission is enhanced in the
opposite hemisphere: in total the neutrinos carry some linear momentum to the hemisphere of the
stronger shock expansion. The asymmetry is attributed to the non-spherical distribution of electron-fraction
($Y_e$) in the envelope of PNS. Although it is similar to LESA (lepton-emission self-sustained
asymmetry), the $Y_e$ asymmetry seems to be associated with the PNS motion: the latter triggers
lateral circular motions in the envelope of PNS by breaking symmetry of the matter distribution
there, which are then sustained by a combination of convection, lateral neutrino diffusion and
matter-pressure gradient. Our findings may have an influence on the current theories on the NS kick
mechanism although long-term simulations are required to assess their impact on the later evolution.
