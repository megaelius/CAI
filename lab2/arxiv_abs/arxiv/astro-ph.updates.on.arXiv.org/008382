Dust is a crucial component of the interstellar medium of galaxies. The presence of dust strongly
affects the light produced by stars within a galaxy. As these photons are our main information vector
to explore the stellar mass assembly and therefore understand a galaxy's evolution, modeling the
luminous properties of galaxies and taking into account the impact of the dust is a fundamental challenge
for semi-analytical models.We present the complete prescription of dust attenuation implemented
in the new semi-analytical model: G.A.S. This model is based on a two-phase medium originating from
a physically motivated turbulent model of gas structuring (G.A.S. I paper). Dust impact is treated
by taking into account three dust components: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Very Small Grains,
and Big Grains. All three components evolve in both a diffuse and a fragmented/dense gas phase. Each
phase has its own stars, dust content and geometry. Dust content evolves according to the metallicity
of it associated phase.The G.A.S. model is used to predict both the UV and the IR luminosity functions
from $z=9.0$ to $z=0.1$. Our two-phase ISM prescription catches very well the evolution of UV and
IR luminosity functions. We note a small overproduction of the IR luminosity at low redshift ($z<0.5$).
We also focus on the Infrared-Excess (IRX) and explore its dependency with the stellar mass, UV slope,
stellar age, metallicity and slope of the attenuation curves. Our model predicts large scatters
for relations based on IRX, especially for the IRX-$\beta$ relation. Our analysis reveals that
the slope of the attenuation curve is more driven by absolute attenuation in the FUV band than by disk
inclination. We confirm that the age of the stellar population and the slope of the attenuation curve
can both shift galaxies below the fiducial star-birth relation in the IRX-$\beta$ diagram.
