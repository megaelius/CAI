Observations in the local universe show a tight correlation between the masses of supermassive
black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}$) and host-galaxy bulges ($M_{\rm bulge}$), suggesting a strong
connection between SMBH and bulge growth. However, direct evidence for such a connection in the
distant universe remains elusive. We have studied sample-averaged SMBH accretion rate ($\overline{\rm
BHAR}$) for bulge-dominated galaxies at $z=0.5-3$. While previous observations found $\overline{\rm
BHAR}$ is strongly related to host-galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) for the overall galaxy population,
our analyses show that, for the bulge-dominated population, $\overline{\rm BHAR}$ is mainly related
to SFR rather than $M_\star$. This ${\overline{\rm BHAR}}$-SFR relation is highly significant,
e.g. $9.0\sigma$ (Pearson statistic) at $z=0.5-1.5$. Such a $\overline{\rm BHAR}$-SFR connection
does not exist among our comparison sample of galaxies that are not bulge-dominated, for which $M_\star$
appears to be the main determinant of SMBH accretion. This difference between the bulge-dominated
and comparison samples indicates that SMBHs only coevolve with bulges rather than the entire galaxies,
explaining the tightness of the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge}$ correlation. Our best-fit
$\overline{\rm BHAR}$-SFR relation for the bulge-dominated sample is $\log\overline{\rm BHAR}
= \log\mathrm{SFR} - (2.48\pm0.05)$ (solar units). The best-fit $\overline{\rm BHAR}/\mathrm{SFR}$
ratio ($10^{-2.48}$) for bulge-dominated galaxies is similar to the observed $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm
bulge}$ values in the local universe. Our results reveal that SMBH and bulge growth are in lockstep,
and thus non-causal scenarios of merger averaging are unlikely the origin of the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm
bulge}$ correlation. This lockstep growth also predicts that the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge}$
relation should not have strong redshift dependence.
