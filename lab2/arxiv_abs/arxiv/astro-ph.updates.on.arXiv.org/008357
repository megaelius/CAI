The LambdaCDM model of cosmology, though very successful at large scales, has some discrepancy
with observations at the galactic and sub-galactic scales. These include the core-cusp problem,
missing satellites problem etc. Spergel and Steingardt (2000) proposed that if dark matter undergoes
feeble self interactions with each other, then such problems can be averted. In this thesis, a two-component
dark matter model involving two singlet scalar fields capable of self-interactions has been proposed
and its impact on large scale structure formation has been studied through cosmological simulations.
The proposed model involves simple extensions of the Standard Model with two singlet scalar fields
formed non-thermally through the decay of heavier particles in the very early universe. These particles
acquire their relic abundance through a freeze-in mechanism. The coupled Boltzmann equation of
the FIMP-FIMP model was solved and the relic densities for different values of the coupling parameters
were obtained and matched with PLANCK results. The impact of dark matter self interactions was studied
through cosmological simulations using a modified version of the parallel TreePM code GADGET-2
and the halo mass function and halo catalog for different dark matter self interaction cross sections
were obtained. Lastly, the newly developed Effective Theory of Structure Formation (ETHOS) framework
which is a new and innovative paradigm in the study of the cosmological effects of different dark
matter models was studied and using the public code, ETHOS-CAMB the signatures of dark acoustic
oscillations in the matter power spectrum for a particular dark matter model was obtained.
