We carry out ``full-physics'' hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation in the normal-branch
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) braneworld model using a new modified version of the {\sc Arepo}
code and the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We simulate two nDGP models (N5 and N1) which represent,
respectively, weak and moderate departures from GR, in boxes of sizes $62\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ and
$25\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ using $2\times512^3$ dark matter particles and initial gas cells. This
allows us to explore, for the first time, the impact of baryonic physics on galactic scales in braneworld
models of modified gravity and to make predictions on the stellar content of dark matter haloes and
galaxy evolution through cosmic time in these models. We find significant differences between
the GR and nDGP models in the power spectra and correlation functions of gas, stars and dark matter
of up to $\sim 25$ per cent on large scales. Similar to their impact in the standard cosmological model
($\Lambda$CDM), baryonic effects can have a significant influence over the clustering of the overall
matter distribution, with a sign that depends on scale. Studying the degeneracy between modified
gravity and galactic feedback in these models, we find that these two physical effects on matter
clustering can be cleanly disentangled, allowing for a method to accurately predict the matter
power spectrum with baryonic effects included, without having to run hydrodynamical simulations.
Depending on the braneworld model, we find differences compared with GR of up to $\sim15$ per cent
in galaxy properties such as the stellar-to-halo-mass ratio, galaxy stellar mass function, gas
fraction and star formation rate density. The amplitude of the fifth force is reduced by the presence
of baryons in the very inner part of haloes, but this reduction quickly becomes negligible above
$\sim0.1$ times the halo radius.
