Massive stars, supernovae, and kilonovae are among the most luminous radiation sources in the universe.
Observations usually show near- to mid-infrared (NIR--MIR, $\lambda\sim 1-5~\mu$m) emission
excess from H\,{\sc ii} regions around young massive star clusters (YMSCs). Early phase observations
in optical to NIR wavelengths of type Ia supernovae also reveal unusual properties of dust extinction
and dust polarization. The popular explanation for such NIR-MIR excess and unusual dust properties
is the predominance of small grains (size $a\lesssim 0.05~\mu$m) relative to large grains ($a\gtrsim
0.1~\mu$m) in the local environment of these strong radiation sources. The question of why small
grains are predominant in these environments remains a mystery. Here we report a new mechanism of
dust destruction based on centrifugal stress within extremely fast-rotating grains spun-up by
radiative torques, which we term the RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism. We find that
RATD can disrupt large grains located within a distance of $\sim 1$ pc from a massive star of luminosity
$L\sim 10^{4}L_{\odot}$ or a supernova. This effect increases the abundance of small grains relative
to large grains and successfully reproduces the observed NIR-MIR excess and anomalous dust extinction/polarization.
We apply the RATD mechanism for kilonovae and find that dust within $\sim$ 0.1 pc would be dominated
by small grains. Small grains produced by RATD can also explain the steep far-UV rise in extinction
curves toward starburst and high redshift galaxies, and the decrease of the escape fraction of Ly$\alpha$
photons from H\,{\sc ii} regions surrounding YMSCs.
