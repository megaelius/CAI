A planet's emission spectrum contains information about atmospheric composition and structure.
We compare the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of blackbody fits and idealized spectral retrieval
fits for the 44 planets with published eclipse measurements in multiple thermal wavebands, mostly
obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The evidence for spectral features depends on eclipse
depth uncertainties. Spitzer has proven capable of eclipse precisions better than 1E-4 when multiple
eclipses are analyzed simultaneously, but this feat has only been performed four times. It is harder
to self-calibrate photometry when a single occultation is reduced and analyzed in isolation; we
find that such measurements have not passed the test of repeatability. Single-eclipse measurements
either have an uncertainty floor of 5E-4, or their uncertainties have been underestimated by a factor
of 3. If one adopts these empirical uncertainties for single-eclipse measurements, then the evidence
for molecular features all but disappears: blackbodies have better BIC than spectral retrieval
for all planets, save HD 189733b, and the few planets poorly fit by blackbodies are also poorly fit
by self-consistent radiative transfer models. This suggests that the features in extant broadband
emission spectra are due to astrophysical and instrumental noise rather than molecular bands.
Claims of stratospheric inversions, disequilibrium chemistry, and high C/O ratios based solely
on photometry are premature. We recommend that observers be cautious of error estimates from self-calibration
of small data sets, and that modelers compare the evidence for spectral models to that of simpler
models such as blackbodies.
