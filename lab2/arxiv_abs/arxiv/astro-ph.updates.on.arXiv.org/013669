High-redshift Lyman-alpha blobs (LABs) are an enigmatic class of objects that have been the subject
of numerous observational and theoretical investigations. It is of particular interest to determine
the dominant power sources for the copious luminosity, as direct emission from HII regions, cooling
gas, and fluorescence due to the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can all contribute significantly.
In this paper, we present the first theoretical model to consider all of these physical processes
in an attempt to develop an evolutionary model for the origin of high-z LABs. This is achieved by combining
a series of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations with ionization and Lyman-alpha
(Lya) radiative transfer models. We find that massive galaxies display a range of Lya luminosities
and spatial extents (which strongly depend on the limiting surface brightness used) over the course
of their lives, though regularly exhibit luminosities and sizes consistent with observed LABs.
The model LABs are typically powered from a combination of recombination in star-forming galaxies,
as well as cooling emission from gas associated with accretion. When AGN are included in the model,
the fluorescence caused by AGN-driven ionization can be a significant contributor to the total
Lya luminosity as well. We propose that the presence of an AGN may be predicted from the Gini coefficient
of the blob's surface brightness. Within our modeled mass range, there are no obvious threshold
physical properties that predict appearance of LABs, and only weak correlations of the luminosity
with the physical properties of the host galaxy. This is because the emergent Lya luminosity from
a system is a complex function of the gas temperature, ionization state, and Lya escape fraction.
