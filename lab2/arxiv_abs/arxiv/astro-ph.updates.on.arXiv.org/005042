We present the results of a new study of the relationship between infrared excess (IRX), UV spectral
slope (beta) and stellar mass at redshifts 2<z<3, based on a deep Atacama Large Millimeter Array
(ALMA) 1.3-mm continuum mosaic of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). Excluding the most heavily-obscured
sources, we use a stacking analysis to show that z~2.5 star-forming galaxies in the mass range 9.25
<= log(M/Msun) <= 10.75 are fully consistent with the IRX-beta relation expected for a relatively
grey attenuation curve, similar to the commonly adopted Calzetti law. Based on a large, mass complete,
sample of 2 <= z <= 3 star-forming galaxies drawn from multiple surveys, we proceed to derive a new
empirical relationship between beta and stellar mass, making it possible to predict UV attenuation
(A_1600) and IRX as a function of stellar mass, for any assumed attenuation law. Once again, we find
that z~2.5 star-forming galaxies follow A_1600-mass and IRX-mass relations consistent with a
relatively grey attenuation law, and find no compelling evidence that star-forming galaxies at
this epoch follow a reddening law as steep as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve.
In fact, we use a simple simulation to demonstrate that previous determinations of the IRX-beta
relation may have been biased toward low values of IRX at red values of beta, mimicking the signature
expected for an SMC-like dust law. We show that this provides a plausible mechanism for reconciling
apparently contradictory results in the literature and that, based on typical measurement uncertainties,
stellar mass provides a cleaner prediction of UV attenuation than beta. Although the situation
at lower stellar masses remains uncertain, we conclude that for 2<z<3 star-forming galaxies with
log(M/Msun) >= 9.75, both the IRX-beta and IRX-mass relations are well described by a Calzetti-like
attenuation law.
