Our understanding of massive star evolution is in flux, due to recent upheavals in our view of mass
loss, and observations of a high binary fraction among O-type stars. Mass-loss rates for standard
metallicity-dependent winds of hot stars are now thought to be lower by a factor of 2-3 compared to
rates adopted in modern stellar evolution models, due to the influence of clumping. Weaker line-driven
winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal elsewhere, so that the dominant modes of mass loss are
the winds, pulsations, and eruptions of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass transfer. Studies
of stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer. Dramatic examples
of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which have massive shells ejected just a few
years before core collapse. The shifting emphasis from steady winds to episodic mass loss is a major
change for low-metallicity regions, since eruptions and binary mass transfer are less sensitive
to metallicity. We encounter the predicament that the most important modes of mass loss are also
the most uncertain, undermining the predictive power of single-star evolution models beyond core
H burning. Moreover, the influence of winds and rotation in models has been evaluated by testing
single-star models against observed statistics that, as it turns out, are heavily influenced by
binary evolution. This alters our view about the most basic outcomes of massive-star mass loss ---
are WR stars and SNe Ibc the products of single-star winds, or are they mostly the result of binary
evolution and eruptive mass loss? This paradigm shift has far-reaching impact on a number of other
areas of astronomy. (abridged)
