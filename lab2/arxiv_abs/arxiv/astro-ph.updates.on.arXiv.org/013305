We have revisited and updated the $uvby$ Str\"omgren colour and colour-index distributions of
A, F and early G-type main sequence stars. For this aim, we selected 7054 dwarf stars along with 65
MK standard stars within the same spectral range but covering all luminosity classes. The standard
stars were selected following the MK mandate strictly, using spectra taken at classification resolution
recorded on photographic plates. We used the colours of these stars to determine the effective temperature
and surface gravity. After correcting for systematic offsets using fundamental parameters and
considering a few exceptions, we find an one-to-one correspondence, among MK spectral types, Str\"omgren
photometry, and their associated physical properties. We have applied a principal component analysis
to the mean Str\"omgren indices for dwarf stars complemented by MK standards for higher luminosity
classes. We have used the projections to introduce three new photometric metaindices, namely SM1,
SM2, and SM3. We have defined a 3D-box, which allowed us to segregate dwarf stars from bright giants
and supergiant stars, with the aid of the metaindices. Two of the planes show that the projections
of dwarfs and supergiants are ordered by temperature; however, the temperature dependence for
the supergiants is not as well defined as for the dwarfs. Following the MK Process, we were able to
form an automatic classifier. We present some applications and assigned synthetical spectral
types. We suggest that our metaindices formalism allows the extension of Str\"omgren photometric
outside its original mandate (i.e., later types), without requiring the introduction of additional
photometric filters.
