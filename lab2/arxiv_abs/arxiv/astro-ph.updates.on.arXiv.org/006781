Baryonic effects on large-scale structure, if not accounted for, can significantly bias dark energy
constraints. As the detailed physics of the baryons is not yet well-understood, correcting for
baryon effects introduces additional parameters which must be marginalized over, increasing
the uncertainties on the inferred cosmological parameters. Forthcoming weak lensing surveys
are aiming for percent-level precision on the dark energy equation of state, so the problem must
be thoroughly examined. We use a halo model with analytic modifications which capture the impact
of adiabatic contraction of baryons and feedback on the matter power spectrum, and generalize the
Navarro-Frenk-White profile to account for a possible inner core. A Fisher analysis predicts degradations
of 40% in the $w_0$-$w_a$ Figure of Merit for a Euclid-like survey, and up to 80% for other cosmological
parameters. We forecast potential inner core constraints of a few $\mathrm{kpc}$, while for a fixed
inner core, adiabatic concentration and feedback parameters are constrained to a few percent.
We explore the scales where baryons and dark energy contribute most to the Fisher information, finding
that probing to increasingly non-linear scales does little to reduce degradation. Including external
baryon information improves our forecasts, but limiting degradation to 1% requires strong priors.
Adding Planck cosmic microwave background priors improves the Figure of Merit by a factor of 2.7
and almost completely recovers the individual marginalized errors on $w_0$ and $w_a$. We also quantify
the calibration of baryon modelling required to reduce biases of dark energy forecasts to acceptable
levels for forthcoming lensing surveys.
