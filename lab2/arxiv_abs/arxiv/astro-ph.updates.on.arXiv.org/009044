Background: low-mass stars are the dominant product of the star formation process, and they trace
star formation over the full range of environments, from isolated globules to clusters in the central
molecular zone. In the past two decades, our understanding of the spatial distribution and properties
of young low-mass stars and protostars has been revolutionized by sensitive space-based observations
at X-ray and IR wavelengths. By surveying spatial scales from clusters to molecular clouds, these
data provide robust measurements of key star formation properties. Goal: with their large numbers
and their presence in diverse environments, censuses of low mass stars and protostars can be used
to measure the dependence of star formation on environmental properties, such as the density and
temperature of the natal gas, strengths of the magnetic and radiation fields, and the density of
stars. Here we summarize how such censuses can answer three basic questions: i.) how is the star formation
rate influenced by environment, ii.) does the IMF vary with environment, and iii.) how does the environment
shape the formation of bound clusters? Answering these questions is an important step toward understanding
star and cluster formation across the extreme range of environments found in the Universe. Requirements:
sensitivity and angular resolution improvements will allow us to study the full range of environments
found in the Milky Way. High spatial dynamic range (< 1arcsec to > 1degree scales) imaging with space-based
telescopes at X-ray, mid-IR, and far-IR and ground-based facilities at near-IR and sub-mm wavelengths
are needed to identify and characterize young stars.
