We investigate the dichotomy between jetted and non-jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), focusing
on the fundamental differences of these two classes in the accretion physics onto the central supermassive
black hole (SMBH). Our aim is to study and constrain the structure, kinematics and physical state
of the nuclear environment in the Broad Line Radio Galaxy (BLRG) PKS 2251+11. The high X-ray luminosity
and the relative proximity make such AGN an ideal candidate for a detailed analysis of the accretion
regions in radio galaxies. We performed a spectral and timing analysis of a $\sim$64 ks observation
of PKS 2251+11 in the X-ray band with XMM-Newton. We modeled the spectrum considering an absorbed
power law superimposed to a reflection component. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis
to search for variability of the X-ray flux and of the individual spectral components. We found that
the power law has a photon index $\Gamma=1.8\pm 0.1$, absorbed by an ionized partial covering medium
with a column density $N_H=(10.1\pm 0.8) \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, a ionization parameter $\log{\xi}=1.3\pm
0.1$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm and a covering factor $f\simeq90\%$. Considering a density of the absorber
typical of the Broad Line Region (BLR), its distance from the central SMBH is of the order of $r\sim
0.1$ pc. An Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is found at 6.4 keV, whose intensity shows variability on time
scales of hours. We derived that the reflecting material is located at a distance $r\gtrsim600r_s$,
where $r_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius. Concerning the X-ray properties, we found that PKS 2251+11
does not differ significantly from the non-jetted AGNs, confirming the validity of the unified
model in describing the inner regions around the central SMBH, but the lack of information regarding
the state of the very innermost disk and SMBH spin still leave unconstrained the origin of the jet.
