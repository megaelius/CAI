We present photometry, spectra, and spectropolarimetry of supernova (SN) 2012ab, mostly obtained
over the course of $\sim 300$ days after discovery. SN 2012ab was a Type IIn (SN IIn) event discovered
near the nucleus of spiral galaxy 2MASXJ12224762+0536247. While its light curve resembles that
of SN 1998S, its spectral evolution does not. We see indications of CSM interaction in the strong
intermediate-width emission features, the high luminosity (peak at absolute magnitude $M=-19.5$),
and the lack of broad absorption features in the spectrum. The H$\alpha$ emission undergoes a peculiar
transition. At early times it shows a broad blue emission wing out to $-14{,}000$ km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$
and a truncated red wing. Then at late times ($>$ 100$\,$days) it shows a truncated blue wing and a
very broad red emission wing out to roughly $+20{,}000$ km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. This late-time broad
red wing probably arises in the reverse shock. Spectra also show an asymmetric intermediate-width
H$\alpha$ component with stronger emission on the red side at late times. The evolution of the asymmetric
profiles requires a density structure in the distant CSM that is highly aspherical. Our spectropolarimetric
data also suggest asphericity with a strong continuum polarization of $\sim 1-3$% and depolarization
in the H$\alpha$ line, indicating asphericity in the CSM at a level comparable to that in other SNe
IIn. We estimate a mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 0.050\, {\rm M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ for
$v_{\rm pre} = 100$$\,$km$\,$$\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ extending back at least 75$\,$yr prior to the
SN. The strong departure from axisymmetry in the CSM of SN 2012ab may suggest that the progenitor
was an eccentric binary system undergoing eruptive mass loss.
