Galaxy integrated H{\alpha} star formation rate-stellar mass relation, or SFR(global)-M*(global)
relation, is crucial for understanding star formation history and evolution of galaxies. However,
many studies have dealt with SFR using unresolved measurements, which makes it difficult to separate
out the contamination from other ionizing sources, such as active galactic nuclei and evolved stars.
Using the integral field spectroscopic observations from SDSS-IV MaNGA, we spatially disentangle
the contribution from different H{\alpha} powering sources for ~1000 galaxies. We find that, when
including regions dominated by all ionizing sources in galaxies, the spatially-resolved relation
between H{\alpha} surface density ({\Sigma}H{\alpha}(all)) and stellar mass surface density
({\Sigma}*(all)) progressively turns over at high {\Sigma}*(all) end for increasing M*(global)
and bulge dominance (bulge-to-total light ratio, B/T). This in turn leads to the flattening of the
integrated H{\alpha}(global)-M*(global) relation in the literature. By contrast, there is no
noticeable flattening in both integrated H{\alpha}(HII)-M*(HII) and spatially-resolved {\Sigma}H{\alpha}(HII)-{\Sigma}*(HII)
relations when only regions where star formation dominates the ionization are considered. In other
words, the flattening can be attributed to the increasing regions powered by non-star-formation
sources, which generally have lower ionizing ability than star formation. Analysis of the fractional
contribution of non-star-formation sources to total H{\alpha} luminosity of a galaxy suggests
a decreasing role of star formation as an ionizing source toward high-mass, high-B/T galaxies and
bulge regions. This result indicates that the appearance of the galaxy integrated SFR-M* relation
critically depends on their global properties (M*(global) and B/T) and relative abundances of
various ionizing sources within the galaxies.
