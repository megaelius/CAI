Spectral analysis of X-ray emission from ejecta in supernova remnants (SNRs) is hampered by the
low spectral resolution of CCD cameras, which creates a degeneracy between the best-fit values
of abundances and emission measure. The combined contribution of shocked ambient medium and ejecta
to the X-ray emission complicates the determination of the ejecta mass and chemical composition,
leading to big uncertainties in mass estimates and it can introduce a bias in the comparison between
the observed ejecta composition and the yields predicted by explosive nucleosynthesis. We explore
the capabilities of present and future spectral instruments with the aim of identifying a spectral
feature which may allow us to discriminate between metal-rich and pure-metal plasmas in X-ray spectra
of SNRs. We studied the behavior of the most common X-ray emission processes of an optically thin
plasma in the high-abundance regime. We investigated spectral features of bremsstrahlung, radiative
recombination continua (RRC) and line emission, by exploring a wide range of chemical abundances,
temperatures and ionization parameters. We synthesized X-ray spectra from a 3D hydrodynamic (HD)
simulation of Cas A, by using the response matrix from the Chandra/ACIS-S CCD detector and that of
the XRISM/Resolve X-ray calorimeter. We found that a bright RRC shows up when the plasma is made of
pure-metal ejecta, and a high spectral resolution is needed to identify this ejecta signature.
We verified the applicability of our novel diagnostic tool and we propose a promising target for
the future detection of such spectral feature: the southeastern Fe-rich clump of Cas A. While there
is no way to unambiguously reveal pure-metal ejecta emission with CCD detectors, X-ray calorimeters
will be able to pinpoint the presence of pure-metal RRC and to recover correctly absolute mass and
the chemical composition of the ejecta.
