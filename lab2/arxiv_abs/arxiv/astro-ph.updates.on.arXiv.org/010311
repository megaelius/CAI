Here were report on a laboratory study aiming to reproduce specificities of near-Earth Asteroid.
We study how the elevated surface temperature, their surface roughness (rock or regolith), as well
as observation geometry can affect the absorption features detected on asteroids. For that purpose,
we selected a recent carbonaceous chondrite fall, the Mukundpura CM2 chondrite which fell in India
in June 2017. Bidirectional reflectance spectroscopy was performed to analyze the effect of the
geometrical configuration (incidence, emergence and azimuth angle) on the measurement. Our results
show that reflectance spectra obtained under warm environment (NEA-like) tends to show shallower
absorption bands compared to low-temperature conditions (MBA-like), but still detectable in
our experiments under laboratory timescales. Irreversible alteration of the sample because of
the warm environment (from room temperature to 250{\deg}C) has been detected as an increase of the
spectral slope and a decrease of the band depths (at 0.7{\mu}m, 0.9{\mu}m and 2.7{\mu}m). Comparing
the meteoritic chip and the powdered sample, we found that surface texture strongly affects the
shape of the reflectance spectra of meteorites and thus of asteroids, where a dust-covered surface
presents deeper absorption features. We found that all spectral parameters, such as the reflectance
value, spectral slope and possible absorption bands are affected by the geometry of measurement.
We observed the disappearance of the 0.7 {\mu}m absorption feature at phase angle larger than 120{\deg},
but the 3{\mu}m band remains detectable on all measured spectra.
