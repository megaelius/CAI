Context: In the binary system LSI+61303 the peak flux density of the radio outburst, which is related
to the orbital period of 26.4960 +/- 0.0028d, exibits a modulation of 1667 +/- 8 d. The radio emission
at high spatial resolution appears structured in a precessing jet with a precessional period of
27-28 d. Aims: How close is the precessional period of the radio jet to the orbital period? Any periodicity
in the radio emission should be revealed by timing analysis. The aim of this work is to establish the
accurate value of the precessional period. Methods: We analyzed 6.7 years of the Green Bank Interferometer
database at 2.2 GHz and 8.3 GHz with the Lomb-Scargle and phase dispersion minimization (PDM) methods
and performed simulations. Results: The periodograms show two periodicities, P1 = 26.49 +/- 0.07
d (\nu1=0.03775 d^{-1}) and P2 = 26.92 +/- 0.07 d (\nu2 = 0.03715 d^{-1}). Whereas radio outbursts
have been known to have nearly orbital occurrence P1 with timing residuals exhibiting a puzzling
sawtooth pattern, we probe in this paper that they are actually periodical outbursts and that their
period is Paverage= (2/(\nu1 + \nu2)= 26.70 +/- 0.05 d. The period Paverage as well as the long-term
modulation Pbeat=1/(\nu1 - \nu2)=1667 +/- 393 d result from the beat of the two close periods, the
orbital P1 and the precessional P2 periods. Conclusions: The precessional period, indicated by
the astrometry to be of 27--28 d, is P2=26.92 d. The system \lsi seems to be one more case in astronomy
of beat, i.e., a phenomenon occurring when two physical processes create stable variations of nearly
equal frequencies. The very small difference in frequency creates a long-term variation of period
1/(\nu1-\nu2). The long-term modulation of 1667 d results from the beat of the two close orbital
and precessional rates.
