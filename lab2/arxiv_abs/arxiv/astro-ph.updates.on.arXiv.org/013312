The regulation of the baryonic content in dwarf galaxies is a long-standing problem. Supernovae
(SNe) are supposed to play a key role in forming large-scale galactic winds by removing important
amounts of gas from galaxies. SNe are efficient accelerators of non-thermal particles, so-called
cosmic rays (CRs), which can substantially modify the dynamics of the gas and conditions to form
large-scale galactic winds. We investigate how CR injection by SNe impacts the star formation and
the formation of large-scale winds in dwarf galaxies, and whether it can produce galaxy star formation
rates (SFR) and wind properties closer to observations. We run CR magneto-hydrodynamical simulations
of dwarf galaxies at high resolution (9 pc) with the adaptive mesh refinement code ramses. Those
disc galaxies are embedded in isolated halos of mass $10^{10}$ and $10^{11} \, \rm M_{\odot}$, and
CRs are injected by SNe. We include CR isotropic and anisotropic diffusion with various diffusion
coefficients, CR radiative losses, and CR streaming.The injection of CR energy into the interstellar
medium smooths out the highest gas densities, which reduces the SFR by a factor of 2-3. Mass outflow
rates are significantly greater with CR diffusion, by 2 orders of magnitudes for the higher diffusion
coefficients. Without diffusion and streaming, CRs are inefficient at generating winds. CR streaming
alone allows for the formation of winds but which are too weak to match observations. The formation
of galactic winds strongly depends on the diffusion coefficient: for low coefficients, CR energy
stays confined in high density regions where CR energy losses are highest, and higher coefficients,
which allow for a more efficient leaking of CRs out of dense gas, produce stronger winds. CR diffusion
leads to colder and denser winds than without CRs, and brings outflow rates and mass loading factors
much closer to observations.
