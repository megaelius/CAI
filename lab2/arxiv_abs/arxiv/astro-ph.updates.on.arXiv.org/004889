We have undertaken a multi-band observing program aimed at obtaining a complete census of winds
in a sample of WISE/SDSS selected hyper-luminous (WISSH) QSOs at z~2-4. We have analyzed the rest-frame
optical (LBT/LUCI and VLT/SINFONI) and UV (SDSS) spectra of 18 randomly selected WISSH QSOs to measure
the SMBH mass and study the properties of winds both in the NLR and BLR traced by blueshifted/skewed
[OIII] and CIV emission lines, respectively. These WISSH QSOs are powered by SMBH with masses $\ge$10$^9$
Msun accreting at 0.4<$\lambda_{Edd}$<3.1. We have found the existence of two sub-populations
characterized by the presence of outflows at different distances from the SMBH. One population
([OIII] sources) exhibits powerful [OIII] outflows, rest-frame EW (REW) of the CIV emission REW$_{CIV}\approx$20-40
A and modest CIV velocity shift (v$_{CIV}^{peak}$) with respect to the systemic redshift (<=2000
km/s). The second population (Weak [OIII] sources), representing ~70% of the analyzed WISSH QSOs,
shows weak/absent [OIII] emission and an extremely large v$_{CIV}^{peak}$ (up to ~8000 km/s and
REW$_{CIV}$<=20 A). We propose two explanations for the observed behavior of the strength of the
[OIII] emission in terms of orientation effects of the line of sight and ionization cone. The dichotomy
in the presence of BLR and NLR winds could be likely due to inclination effects considering a polar
geometry scenario for the BLR winds. We find a strong correlation with L$_{Bol}$ and an anti-correlation
with $\alpha_{ox}$, whereby the higher L$_{Bol}$, the steeper $\alpha_{ox}$ and the larger is
the v$_{CIV}^{peak}$. Finally, the observed dependence v$_{CIV}^{peak}\propto L_{Bol}^{0.28\pm0.04}$
is consistent with radiatively driven winds scenario, where strong UV continuum is necessary to
launch the wind and a weakness of the X-ray emission is fundamental to prevent overionization of
the wind itself.
