About a century ago, Jeans (1919) discovered that if binary stars reach a state approximating energy
equipartition, for example through many dynamical encounters that exchange energy, their eccentricity
distribution can be described by : dN/de = 2e. This is referred to as the thermal eccentricity distribution,
and has been widely used for initial conditions in theoretical investigations of binary stars.
However, observations suggest that the eccentricity distributions of most observed binaries,
and particularly those with masses < 5 Msun, are flatter than thermal and follow more closely to a
uniform distribution. Nonetheless, it is often argued that dynamical interactions in a star cluster
would quickly thermalize the binaries, which could justify imposing a thermal eccentricity distribution
at birth for all binaries. In this paper we investigate the validity of this assumption. We develop
our own rapid semi-analytic model for binary evolution in star clusters, and also compare with detailed
N-body and Monte Carlo star cluster models. We show that, for nearly all binaries, dynamical encounters
fail to convert an initially uniform eccentricity distribution to thermal within a star cluster's
lifetime. Thus, if a thermal eccentricity distribution is observed, it is likely imprinted upon
formation rather than through subsequent long-term dynamical processing. Theoretical investigations
that initialize all binaries with a thermal distribution will make incorrect predictions for the
evolution of the binary population. Such models may overpredict the merger rate for binaries with
modest orbital separations by a factor of about two.
