We present spectropolarimetric and spectrophotometric observations of the peculiar active galactic
nucleus (AGN) SDSS J120300.19+162443.7 (hereafter J1203+1624) at $z=0.1656$. Its optical total
flux spectra clearly show broad emission lines (BELs) in H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. After removal
of narrow emission lines (NELs), the full width at half maximum of the lorentzian BEL is $FWHM_{\rm
BEL} \approx 1,270$~\kms, fulfilling the conventional definition of a narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLS1)
galaxy. However, its NELs are unprecedentedly strong when compared to type 1AGNs. This, together
with its large MIR excess ($g-W_4 = 13.172$ mag), implies that the observer and the narrow emission
line region (NELR) might see a different ionization continuum. Our optical spectropolarimetry
confirms its type 2 nature by detecting a polarized blue continuum and Balmer BELs ($FWHM_{\rm Polarized~BEL}
\approx 1,183$~\kms), with a high polarization degree of $> 20$% in the blue wing. The mass and Eddington
rate of the central black hole is estimated based on both transmitted and scattered AGN radiation,
which is $M_{\bullet} < 2.9 \times 10^7 M_\odot$ and $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} > 1.5$. Severe extinction
of the AGN emission also enables a clear view of the compact host galaxy. Discovery of J1203+1624
suggests that NLS1 follows AGN unfication scheme, studying of its analogs could blaze a new trail
for exploring the connection between black hole growth and star formation in the host galaxy. Interesting
features of J1203+1624 like the peculiar NELs, inflowing scattering clouds within sublimation
radius are worth detailed follow-ups in the future.
