Narrow-line regions excited by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are important for studying AGN photoionization
and feedback. Their strong [O III] lines can be detected with broadband images, allowing morphological
studies of these systems with large-area imaging surveys. We develop a new technique to reconstruct
the [O III] images using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey aided with spectra from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The technique involves a careful subtraction of the galactic continuum
to isolate emission from the [O III]$\lambda$5007 and [O III]$\lambda$4959 lines. Compared to
traditional targeted observations, this technique is more efficient at covering larger samples
with less dedicated observational resources. We apply this technique to an SDSS spectroscopically
selected sample of 300 obscured AGN at redshifts 0.1 - 0.7, uncovering extended emission-line region
candidates with sizes up to tens of kpc. With the largest sample of uniformly derived narrow-line
region sizes, we revisit the narrow-line region size-luminosity relation. The area and radii of
the [O III] emission-line regions are strongly correlated with the AGN luminosity inferred from
the mid-infrared (15 $\mu$m rest-frame) with a power-law slope of $0.62^{+0.05}_{-0.06} \pm 0.10$
(statistical and systemic errors), consistent with previous spectroscopic findings. We discuss
the implications for the physics of AGN emission-line region and future applications of this technique,
which should be useful for current and next-generation imaging surveys to study AGN photoionization
and feedback with large statistical samples.
