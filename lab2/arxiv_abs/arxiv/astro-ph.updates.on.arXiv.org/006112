Diffuse soft X-ray line emission is commonly used to trace the thermal and chemical properties of
the hot interstellar medium, as well as its content, in nearby galaxies. Although resonant line
scattering complicates the interpretation of the emission, it also offers an opportunity to measure
the kinematics of the medium. We have implemented a direct Monte Carlo simulation scheme that enables
us to account for resonant scattering effect in the medium, in principle, with arbitrary spatial,
thermal, chemical, and kinematic distributions. Here we apply this scheme via dimensionless calculation
to an isothermal, chemically uniform, and spherically symmetric medium with a radial density distribution
characterized by a $\beta$-model. This application simultaneously account for both optical depth-dependent
spatial distortion and intensity change of the resonant line emission due to the scattering, consistent
with previous calculations. We further apply the modeling scheme to the OVII and OVIII emission
line complex observed in the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum of the M31 bulge. This modeling, though with
various limitations due to its simplicity, shows that the resonant scattering could indeed account
for much of the spatial distortion of the emission, as well as the relative strengths of the lines,
especially the large forbidden to resonant line ratio of the OVII He$\alpha$ triplet. We estimate
the isotropic turbulence Mach number of the medium in M31 as $\sim0.17$ for the first time and the
line-emitting gas temperature as $\sim2.3\times10^6$ K. We conclude that the resonant scattering
may in general play an important role in shaping the soft X-ray spectra of diffuse hot gas in normal
galaxies.
