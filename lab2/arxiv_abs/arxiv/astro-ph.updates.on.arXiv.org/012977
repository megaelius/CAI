Milky Way dwarf satellites are unique objects that encode the early structure formation and therefore
represent a window into the high redshift Universe. So far, their study was conducted using electromagnetic
waves only. The future Laser Interpreter Space Antenna (LISA) has the potential to reveal Milky
Way satellites in gravitational waves emitted by double white dwarf (DWD) binaries. We investigate
gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable by LISA as a possible tool for the identification and
characterisation of the Milky Way satellites. We use the binary population synthesis technique
to model the population of DWDs in dwarf satellites and we assess the impact on the number of LISA detections
when making changes to the total stellar mass, distance, star formation history and metallicity
of satellites. We calibrate predictions for the known Milky Way satellites on their observed properties.
We find that DWDs emitting at frequencies $\gtrsim 3\,$mHz can be detected in Milky Way satellites
at large galactocentric distances. The number of these high frequency DWDs per satellite primarily
depends on its mass, distance, age and star formation history, and only mildly depends on the other
assumptions regarding their evolution such as metallicity. We find that dwarf galaxies with $M_\star>10^6\,$M$_{\odot}$
can host detectable LISA sources with a number of detections that scales linearly with the satellite's
mass. We forecast that out of the known satellites, Sagittarius, Fornax, Sculptor and the Magellanic
Clouds can be detected with LISA. As an all-sky survey that does not suffer from contamination and
dust extinction, LISA will provide observations of the Milky Way and dwarf satellites galaxies
valuable for Galactic archaeology and near-field cosmology.
