The formation and assembly process of massive galaxies is a combination of two phases: an initial
in-situ-dominated one followed by an ex-situ-dominated evolution. Separating these two contributions
is therefore crucial to understand the baryonic cycle within massive halos. A recently discovered
population of so-called naked red nuggets, galaxies that shortcut the ex-situ stage preserving
their pristine properties, presents a unique opportunity to study in detail star formation in massive
galaxies without the confounding effect of later accretion. We investigate the spatially resolved
star formation histories of a sample of 12 naked red nuggets. We measure how their radial light distributions,
star formation rates and central densities evolved in time. We find that, while forming stars, red
nuggets become gradually more concentrated, reaching a maximum concentration at quenching. After
being quenched, they kept forming stars in a more disky-like configuration. Our measurements suggest
that super-massive black holes and host galaxies grow their mass in a self-regulated way until a
characteristic Mbh/Mhalo is reached. Once black holes are massive enough, red nuggets get quenched
and depart from the star formation main sequence. While in the main sequence, red nuggets evolve
at roughly constant star formation rate. This can explain up to ~0.3 dex of the scatter of the star
formation main sequence, as well as its higher normalization observed in the early Universe. Hence,
our results suggest that the main sequence is composed of populations of galaxies at different evolutionary
stages, and that the scatter is therefore due to secular processes.
