We present results of the combined photometric and spectroscopic analysis of three detached eclipsing
binaries, which secondary components are not visible or very hard to identify in the optical spectra
- ASAS J052743-0359.7, ASAS J065134-2211.5, and ASAS J073507-0905.7. The first one is a known visual
binary ADS 4022, and we found that it is a quadruple system, composed of two spectroscopic binaries,
one of which shows eclipses. None of the systems was previously recognized as a spectroscopic binary.
We collected a number of high-resolution optical and IR spectra to calculate the radial velocities
(RVs) and later combined them with MITSuME and ASAS photometry. The IR spectra were crucial for secure
identification of the cooler components' lines. RV measurements were done with the TODCOR technique,
and RV curves modelled with our own procedure V2FIT. Light curve modelling was performed with JKTEBOP
and PHOEBE codes. Temperatures and metallicities of two systems were estimated from spectra. For
the ADS 4022 system we also used the archival WDS data and new SOAR observations in order to derive
the orbit of the visual pair for the first time. Ages were estimated by comparing our results with
PARSEC isochrones. The eclipsing pair A052743 A ($P=5.27$ d) is composed of a 1.03(6) M$_\odot$,
1.03(2) R$_\odot$ primary and a 0.60(2) M$_\odot$, 0.59(2) R$_\odot$ secondary. The components
of the $P=21.57$ d non-eclipsing pair B likely have masses in between the two eclipsing components,
and both pairs are on a $\sim$188 yr orbit around their common centre of mass. The system A065134 ($P=8.22$
d) consists of a 0.956(12) M$_\odot$, 0.997(4) R$_\odot$ primary and a 0.674(5) M$_\odot$, 0.690(7)
R$_\odot$ secondary. Finally, A073507 ($P=1.45$ d), which consists of a 1.452(34) M$_\odot$,
1.635(12) R$_\odot$ primary and a 0.808(13) M$_\odot$, 0.819(11) R$_\odot$ secondary, is likely
a PMS system.
