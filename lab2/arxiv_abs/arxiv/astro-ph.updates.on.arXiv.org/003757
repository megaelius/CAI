We have run a new suite of simulations that solve hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simultaneously
to study helium II reionization. Our suite of simulations employs various models for populating
quasars inside of dark matter halos, which affect the He II reionization history. In particular,
we are able to explore the impact that differences in the timing and duration of reionization have
on observables. We examine the thermal signature that reionization leaves on the IGM, and measure
the temperature-density relation. As previous studies have shown, we confirm that the photoheating
feedback from helium II reionization raises the temperature of the IGM by several thousand kelvin.
To compare against observations, we generate synthetic Ly$\alpha$ forest sightlines on-the-fly
and match the observed effective optical depth $\tau_{\mathrm{eff}}(z)$ of hydrogen to recent
observations. We show that when the simulations have been normalized to have the same values of $\tau_\mathrm{eff}$,
the effect that helium II reionization has on observations of the hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ forest is
minimal. Specifically, the flux PDF and the one-dimensional power spectrum are sensitive to the
thermal state of the IGM, but do not show direct evidence for the ionization state of helium. We show
that the peak temperature of the IGM typically corresponds to the time of 90%-95% helium ionization
by volume, and is a relatively robust indicator of the timing of reionization. Future observations
of helium reionization from the hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ forest should thus focus on measuring the temperature
of the IGM, especially at mean density. Detecting the peak in the IGM temperature would provide valuable
information about the timing of the end of helium II reionization.
