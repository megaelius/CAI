Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and gravitational instability (GI) are the two principle
routes to turbulent angular momentum transport in accretion disks. Protoplanetary disks may develop
both. This paper aims to reinvigorate interest in the study of magnetized massive protoplanetary
disks, starting from the basic issue of stability. The local linear stability of a self-gravitating,
uniformly magnetized, differentially rotating, three-dimensional stratified disk subject
to axisymmetric perturbations is calculated numerically. The formulation includes resistivity.
It is found that the reduction in the disk thickness by self-gravity can decrease MRI growth rates;
the MRI becomes global in the vertical direction, and MRI modes with small radial length scales are
stabilized. The maximum vertical field strength that permits the MRI in a strongly self-gravitating
polytropic disk with polytropic index $\Gamma=1$ is estimated to be $B_{z,\mathrm{max}} \simeq
c_{s0}\Omega\sqrt{\mu_0/16\pi G} $, where $c_{s0}$ is the midplane sound speed and $\Omega$ is
the angular velocity. In massive disks with layered resistivity, the MRI is not well-localized
to regions where the Elsasser number exceeds unity. For MRI modes with radial length scales on the
order of the disk thickness, self-gravity can enhance density perturbations, an effect that becomes
significant in the presence of a strong toroidal field, and which depends on the symmetry of the underlying
MRI mode. In gravitationally unstable disks where GI and MRI growth rates are comparable, the character
of unstable modes can transition smoothly between MRI and GI. Implications for non-linear simulations
are discussed briefly.
