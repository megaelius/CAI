(Abridged for ArXiv) An injection of energy towards a magnetic null point can drive reversals of
current sheet polarity leading to time-dependent Oscillatory Reconnection, which is a possible
explanation of how periodic phenomena can be generated when reconnection occurs in the solar atmosphere.
However, the details of what controls the period of these oscillations is poorly understood, despite
being crucial in assessing whether OR can account for observed periodic behaviour. This paper aims
to highlight that different types of reconnection reversal are supported about null points, and
that these are distinct from the oscillation on the closed-boundary, linear systems considered
in the 1990s. In particular, we explore the features of a nonlinear oscillation local to the null
point, and examine the effect of resistivity and perturbation energy on the period, contrasting
it to the linear case. It is found that in the linear systems, the inverse Lundquist number dictates
the period, provided the perturbation energy is small relative to the inverse Lundquist number
defined on the boundary, regardless of the broadband structure of the initial perturbation. However,
when the perturbation energy exceeds the threshold required for 'nonlinear' null collapse to occur,
a complex oscillation of the magnetic field is produced which is, at best, only weakly-dependent
on the resistivity. The resultant periodicity is strongly influenced by the amount of free energy,
with more energetic perturbations producing higher-frequency oscillations. Crucially, with
regards to typical solar-based and astrophysical-based input energies, we demonstrate that the
majority far exceed the threshold for nonlinearity to develop. This substantially alters the properties
and periodicity of both null collapse and subsequent OR. Therefore, nonlinear regimes of OR should
be considered in solar and astrophysical contexts.
