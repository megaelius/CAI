Accreting stellar-mass black holes appear to populate two branches in a radio:X-ray luminosity
plane. We have investigated the X-ray variability properties of a large number of black hole low-mass
X-ray binaries, with the aim of unveiling the physical reasons underlying the radio-loud/radio-quiet
nature of these sources, in the context of the known accretion-ejection connection. A reconsideration
of the available radio and X-ray data from a sample of black hole X-ray binaries confirms that being
radio-quiet is the more normal mode of behaviour for black hole binaries. In the light of this we chose
to test, once more, the hypothesis that radio loudness could be a consequence of the inclination
of the X-ray binary. We compared the slope of the `hard-line' (an approximately linear correlation
between X-ray count rate and rms variability, visible in the hard states of active black holes),
the orbital inclination, and the radio-nature of the sources of our sample. We found that high-inclination
objects show steeper hard-lines than low-inclination objects, and tend to display a radio-quiet
nature (with the only exception of V404 Cyg), as opposed to low-inclination objects, which appear
to be radio-loud(er). While in need of further confirmation, our results suggest that - contrary
to what has been believed for years - the radio-loud/quiet nature of black-hole low mass X-ray binaries
might be an inclination effect, rather than an intrinsic source property. This would solve an important
issue in the context of the inflow-outflow connection, thus providing significant constraints
to the models for the launch of hard-state compact jets.
