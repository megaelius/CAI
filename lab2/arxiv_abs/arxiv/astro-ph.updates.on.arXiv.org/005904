The short Gamma-Ray Burst, GRB170817A, that followed the binary neutron star merger gravitational
waves signal, GW170817, is not a usual sGRB. It is weaker by three orders of magnitude than the weakest
sGRB seen before and its spectra, showing a hard early signal followed by a softer thermal spectrum,
is unique. We show, first, that the $\gamma$-rays must have emerged from at least mildly relativistic
outflow, implying that a relativistic jet was launched following the merger. We then show that the
observations are consistent with the predictions of a mildly relativistic shock breakout: a minute
$\gamma$-ray energy as compared with the total energy and a rather smooth light curve with a hard
to soft evolution. We present here a novel analytic study and detailed numerical 2D and 3D relativistic
hydrodynamic and radiation simulations that support the picture in which the observed $\gamma$-rays
arose from a shock breakout of a cocoon from the merger's ejecta (Kasliwal 2017). The cocoon can be
formed by either a choked jet which does not generate a sGRB (in any direction) or by a successful jet
which generates an undetected regular sGRB along the system's axis pointing away from us. Remarkably,
for the choked jet model, the macronova signal produced by the ejecta (which is partially boosted
to high velocities by the cocoon's shock) and the radio that is produced by the interaction of the
shocked cocoon material with the surrounding matter, agree with the observed UV/optical/IR emission
and with current radio observations. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the jet propagation
within the ejecta may photodissociate some of of the heavy elements and may affect the composition
of a fraction of ejecta and, in turn, the opacity and the early macronova light.
