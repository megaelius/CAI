Two-dimensional integral field surveys such as ATLAS^3D are producing rich observational data
sets yielding insights into galaxy formation. These new kinematic observations have highlighted
the need to understand the evolutionary mechanisms leading to a spectrum of fast-rotators and slow-rotators
in early-type galaxies. We address the formation of slow and fast rotators through a series of controlled,
comprehensive hydrodynamical simulations sampling idealized galaxy merger scenarios constructed
from model spiral galaxies. Idealized and controlled simulations of this sort complement the more
'realistic' cosmological simulations by isolating and analyzing the effects of specific parameters,
as we do in this paper. We recreate minor and major binary mergers, binary merger trees with multiple
progenitors, and multiple sequential mergers. Within each of these categories of formation history,
we correlate progenitor gas fraction, mass ratio, orbital pericenter, orbital ellipticity, and
spin with remnant kinematic properties. We create kinematic profiles of these 95 simulations comparable
to ATLAS^3D data. By constructing remnant profiles of the projected specific angular momentum
(lambda_R = <R|V|> / <sqrt(V^2+sigma^2)>, triaxiality, and measuring the incidences
of kinematic twists and kinematically decoupled cores, we distinguish between varying formation
scenarios. We find that binary mergers nearly always form fast rotators. Slow rotators can be formed
from zero initial angular momentum configurations and gas-poor mergers, but are not as round as
the ATLAS^3D galaxies. Remnants of binary merger trees are triaxial slow rotators. Sequential
mergers form round slow rotators that most resemble the ATLAS^3D rotators.
