We propose that chondrules and chondrites formed together during a brief radiative heating event
caused by the close encounter of a small (m to km-scale), primitive planetesimal (SPP) with incandescent
lava on the surface of a large (100 km-scale) differentiated planetesimal (LDP). In our scenario,
chondrite lithification occurs by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) simultaneously with chondrule
formation, in accordance with the constraints of complementarity and cluster chondrites. Thermal
models of LDPs formed near t=0 predict that there will be a very narrow window of time, coincident
with the chondrule formation epoch, during which crusts are thin enough to frequently rupture by
impact, volcanism and/or crustal foundering, releasing hot magma to their surfaces. The heating
curves we calculate are more gradual and symmetric than the "flash heating" characteristic of nebular
models, but in agreement with the constraints of experimental petrology. The SPP itself is a plausible
source of the excess O, Na and Si vapor pressure (compared to a solar nebula environment) that is required
by chondrule observations. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that FeO-poor porphyritic olivine
chondrules, the most voluminous type of chondrule, can be made using heating and cooling curves
predicted by the "flyby" model. If chondrules are a by-product of chondrite lithification, then
their high volume abundance within well-lithified chondritic material is not evidence that they
were once widespread within the Solar System. Relatively rare events, such as the flybys modeled
here, could account for their abundance in the meteorite record.
