We report on the $g$, $r$ and $i$ band observations of the Interstellar Object 1I/'Oumuamua taken
on 2017 October 29 from 04:28 to 08:40 UTC from the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5m telescope's
ARCTIC camera. We use these observations to estimate object colors, and find them to be $g-r=0.41\pm0.24$
and $r-i=0.23\pm0.25$, consistent with visible spectra (Masiero 2017; Ye et al. 2017; Fitzsimmons
et al. 2017) and most comparable to the population of Solar System C/D asteroids, Trojans, or comets,
although we find no evidence of any cometary activity, even 1.5 months after 1I/'Oumuamua's close
flyby of the Sun. Significant brightness variability was seen in the $r$ observations, with the
object becoming notably brighter towards the end of the run. By combining our APO photometric time
series data with the Discovery Chanel Telescope (DCT) data of Knight et al. 2017 taken 20 h later on
2017 October 30, we construct an almost complete lightcurve with a most probable lightcurve period
of $P \simeq 4~{\rm h}$, and reveal the most useful locations during 1I/'Oumuamua's rotation phase
for additional data to improve constraints on its lightcurve. This implies a double peaked rotation
period of 8.1 $\pm$ 0.02 h, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.5 - 2.1 mags. The two values imply that
1I/'Oumuamua has an axial ratio of 4.1 to 6.9 and is rotating below its critical break up limit for
most viable values of density and cohesive strength within the range of rotation periods and axial
ratios compatible with our data. Our results are compatible with 1I/'Oumuamua having a density
$>$ 1.0 g cm$^{-3}$ or having modest cohesive strength. Astrometry useful for constraining the
object's orbit was also obtained and published in Weaver et al. 2017.
