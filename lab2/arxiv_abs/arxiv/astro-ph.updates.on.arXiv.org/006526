We report the results of $EasyCritics$, a fully automated algorithm for the efficient search of
strong-lensing (SL) regions in wide-field surveys, applied to the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). By using only the photometric information of the brightest elliptical
galaxies distributed over a wide redshift range ($\smash{0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.9}$) and without
requiring the identification of arcs, our algorithm produces lensing potential models and catalogs
of critical curves of the entire survey area. We explore several parameter set configurations in
order to test the efficiency of our approach. In a specific configuration, $EasyCritics$ generates
only $\sim1200$ possibly super-critical regions in the CFHTLS area, drastically reducing the
effective area for inspection from $154$ sq. deg to $\sim0.623$ sq. deg, $i.e.$ by more than two orders
of magnitude. Among the pre-selected SL regions, we identify 32 of the 44 previously known lenses
on the group and cluster scale, and discover 9 new promising lens candidates. The detection rate
can be easily improved to $\sim82\%$ by a simple modification in the parameter set, but at the expense
of increasing the total number of possible SL candidates. Note that $EasyCritics$ is fully complementary
to other arc-finders since we characterize lenses instead of directly identifying arcs. Although
future comparisons against numerical simulations are required for fully assessing the efficiency
of $EasyCritics$, the algorithm seems very promising for upcoming surveys covering $\smash{10^{4}}$
sq. deg, such as the $Euclid$ mission and $LSST$, where the pre-selection of candidates for any kind
of SL analysis will be indispensable due to the expected enormous data volume.
