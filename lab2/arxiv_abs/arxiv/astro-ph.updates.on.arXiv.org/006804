Interstellar infrared observation shows featured spectrum due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
(PAH)at wavelength 3.3,6.2,7.6,7.8,8.6,and 11.3 micrometer,which are ubiquitously observed
in many astronomical dust clouds and galaxies. Our previous first principles calculation revieled
that viod induced coronene (C23H12)2+ and circumcoronene (C53H18)1+ could reproduce such spectrum
very well. In this study, quantum-mechanic origin was studied through atomic configuration change
and atomic vibration mode analysis. By a high speed particle attack, carbon void would be introduced
in PAH. Molecular configuration was deformed by the Jahn-Teller quantum effect. Carbon SP3 local
bond was created among SP2 graphene like carbon network. Also, carbon tetrahedron local structure
was created. Such peculiar structure is the quantum origin. Those metamorphosed molecules would
be photo-ionized by the central star strong photon irradiation resulting cation molecules. Atomic
vibration mode of cation molecule (C23H12)2+ was compared with that of neutral one (C23H12). At
3.3 micrometer, both molecules show show C-H stretching mode and give fairly large infrared intensity.
At 6.2,7.6,7.8, and 8.6 micrometer bands, cation molecule show complex C-C stretching and shrinking
mixing modes and remain large infrared emission. Whereas, neutral molecule gives harmonic motion,
which cancelles each other resulting very small infrared intensity. At 11.3 micrometer, both neutral
and cation molecules show C-H bending motion perpendicular to a molecular plane, which contributes
to strong emission. Actual observed spectrum would be a sum of such quantum-mechanic origined molecules.
