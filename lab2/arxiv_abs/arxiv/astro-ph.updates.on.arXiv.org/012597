We present a new pipeline for the efficient generation of synthetic observations of the extragalactic
microwave sky, tailored to large ground-based CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory,
Advanced ACTPol, SPT-3G, and CMB-S4. Such simulated observations are a key technical challenge
in cosmology because of the dynamic range and accuracy required. The first part of the pipeline generates
a random cosmological realization in the form of a dark matter halo catalog and matter displacement
field, as seen from a given position. The halo catalog and displacement field are modeled with ellipsoidal
collapse dynamics and Lagrangian perturbation theory, respectively. In the second part, the cosmological
realization is converted into a set of intensity maps over the range 10 - 10^3 GHz using models based
on existing observations and hydrodynamical simulations. These maps include infrared emission
from dusty star forming galaxies (CIB), Comptonization of CMB photons by hot gas in groups and clusters
through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ), Doppler boosting by Thomson scattering
of the CMB by bulk flows through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ), and weak gravitational
lensing of primary CMB anisotropies by the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe.
After describing the pipeline and its implementation, we present the Websky maps, created from
a realization of the cosmic web on our past light cone in the redshift interval 0<z<4.6 over the full-sky
and a volume of ~(600 Gpc/h)^3 resolved with ~10^12 resolution elements. The Websky maps and halo
catalog are publicly available at mocks.cita.utoronto.ca/websky.
