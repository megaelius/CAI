We present the discovery of the second binary with a Roche lobe-filling hot subdwarf transferring
mass to a white dwarf (WD) companion. This 56 minute binary was discovered using data from the Zwicky
Transient Facility. Spectroscopic observations reveal an He-sdOB star with an effective temperature
of $T_{\rm eff}=33,700\pm1000$ K and a surface gravity of $log(g)=5.54\pm0.11$. The GTC+HiPERCAM
light curve is dominated by the ellipsoidal deformation of the He-sdOB star and shows an eclipse
of the He-sdOB by an accretion disk as well as a weak eclipse of the WD. We infer a He-sdOB mass of $M_{\rm
sdOB}=0.41\pm0.04$ M$_\odot$ and a WD mass of $M_{\rm WD}=0.68\pm0.05$ M$_\odot$. The weak eclipses
imply a WD black-body temperature of $63,000\pm10,000$ K and a radius $R_{\rm WD}=0.0148\pm0.0020$
M$_\odot$ as expected for a WD of such high temperature. The He-sdOB star is likely undergoing hydrogen
shell burning and will continue transferring mass for $\approx1$ Myrs at a rate of $10^{-9} M_\odot
{\rm yr}^{-1}$ which is consistent with the high WD temperature. The hot subdwarf will then turn
into a WD and the system will merge in $\approx30$ Myrs. We suggest that Galactic reddening could
bias discoveries towards preferentially finding Roche lobe-filling systems during the short-lived
shell burning phase. Studies using reddening corrected samples should reveal a large population
of helium core-burning hot subdwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}\approx25,000$ K in binaries of 60-90 minutes
with WDs. Though not yet in contact, these binaries would eventually come into contact through gravitational
wave emission and explode as a sub-luminous thermonuclear supernova or evolve into a massive single
WD.
