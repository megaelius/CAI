We present ALMA observations of the mid-J 12CO emission from six single-dish selected 870-micron
sources in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS) and UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey (UDS) fields.
These six single-dish submillimetre sources were selected based on previous ALMA continuum observations,
which showed that each comprised a blend of emission from two or more individual submillimetre galaxies
(SMGs), separated on 5--10 arcsec scales. The six single-dish submillimetre sources targeted
correspond to a total of 14 individual SMGs, of which seven have previously-measured robust optical/near-infrared
spectroscopic redshifts, which were used to tune our ALMA observations. We detect CO(3-2) or CO(4-3)
at z=2.3--3.7 in seven of the 14 SMGs, and in addition serendipitously detect line emission from
three gas-rich companion galaxies, as well as identify four new 3.3-mm selected continuum sources
in the six fields. Joint analysis of our CO spectroscopy and existing data suggests that 64 \pm 18%
of the SMGs in blended submillimetre sources are unlikely to be physically associated. However,
three of the SMG fields (50%) contain new, serendipitously-detected CO-emitting (but submillimetre-faint)
sources at similar redshifts to the 870-micron selected SMGs we targeted. These data suggest that
the SMGs inhabit overdense regions, but that these are not sufficiently overdense on ~100 kpc scales
to influence the source blending given the short lifetimes of SMGs. We find that 21 \pm 12% of SMGs
have spatially-distinct and kinematically-close companion galaxies (~8--150 kpc and <~300 km/s),
which may have enhanced their star-formation via gravitational interactions.
