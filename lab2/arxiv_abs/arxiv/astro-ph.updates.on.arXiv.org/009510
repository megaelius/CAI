Observations of gravitational wave (GW) signals produced by coalescing binary neutron stars (NS),
like the GW event GW170817, can be exploited to constrain the equation of state (EoS) of matter in
the stars' inner core. The information on the internal structure and composition of the stars is
encoded in their tidal Love numbers, which leave an imprint in the waveform of the GW signal emitted
from the binary during the late inspiral phase. We extended the theory of tidal deformations of compact
objects by computing the spin-tidal corrections that affect the dynamics and the GW emission of
a binary system at the leading post-Newtonian (PN) order and to linear order in the spin. These corrections
are divided into two classes: terms due to the coupling between the standard tidal Love numbers and
the spins of the objects, and terms depending on the rotational tidal Love numbers. Both enter the
GW phase at 6.5PN order. We analysed the impact of the spin-tidal couplings by estimating the parameter
bias induced on GW170817-like events, assuming second- and third-generation ground based interferometers.
If relatively high spinning ($\chi \gtrsim 0.1$) NS binaries exist in nature, these effects might
be observed by the next generation of detectors. Lastly, we proved the feasibility of solving the
so-called inverse stellar problem using GW detections, i.e., reconstructing the EoS from the measurement
of NS masses and tidal Love numbers. Our results show that few observations of coalescing binary
NS by a network of advanced detectors would allow us to put interesting constraints on the phenomenological
parameters of a piecewise polytropic representation of the EoS, and to perform a model selection
among the realistic EoS proposed in the literature.
