As is the case for all techniques involved in the research for exoplanets, direct imaging has to take
into account the probability of so-called astrophysical false positives, which are phenomena
that mimic the signature of objects we are seeking. In this work we aim to present a case of a false positive
found during a direct imaging survey conducted with VLT/NACO. A promising exoplanet candidate
was detected around the K2-type star HD\,8049 in July 2010.Its contrast of $\Delta H$=7.05 at 1.57
arcsec allowed us to guess the presence of a 35 \MJup companion at 50 projected AU, for the nominal
system age and heliocentric distance.To check whether it was gravitationally bound to the host
star, as opposed to an unrelated background object, we re-observed the system one year later and
concluded a high probability of a bound system. We also used radial velocity measurements of the
host star, spanning a time range of $\sim$ 30 yr, to constrain the companion's mass and orbital properties,
as well as to probe the host star's spectral age indicators and general spectral energy distribution.
We also obtained for the companion $U$-band imaging with EFOSC and $NIR$ spectroscopy. Combining
all these information we conclude that the companion of HD\,8049 is a white dwarf (WD), with temperature
$T_{eff}=18800 \pm 2100$ K and mass $M_{WD}=0.56 \pm 0.08 M_{\odot}$. The significant radial velocity
trend coupled with the imaging data indicate that the most probable orbit has a semimajor axis of
about 50 AU.The discrepancy between the age indicators suggested against a bona-fide young star.
The moderately large level of chromospheric activity and fast rotation, mimicking the properties
of a young star, might be induced by the exchange of mass with the progenitor of the WD. This example
demonstrates some of the challenges in determining accurate age estimates and identifications
of faint companions.
