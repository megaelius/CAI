Context: The effective temperature is a key parameter governing the properties of a star. For stellar
chemistry, it has the strongest impact on the accuracy of the abundances derived. Since Cepheids
are pulsating stars, determining their effective temperature is more complicated that in the case
of non-variable stars. Aims: We want to provide a new temperature scale for classical Cepheids,
with a high precision and full control of the systematics. Methods: Using a data-driven machine
learning technique employing observed spectra, and taking great care to accurately phase single-epoch
observations, we have tied flux ratios to (label) temperatures derived using the infrared surface
brightness method. Results: We identified 143 flux ratios that allow us to determine the effective
temperature with a precision of a few K and an accuracy better than 150 K, which is in line with the most
accurate temperature measures available to date. The method does not require a normalization of
the input spectra and provides homogeneous temperatures for low- and high-resolution spectra,
even at the lowest signal-to-noise ratios. Due to the lack of a dataset of sufficient sample size
for Small Magellanic Cloud Cepheids, the temperature scale does not extend to Cepheids with [Fe/H]
< -0.6 dex but nevertheless provides an exquisite, homogeneous means of characterizing Galactic
and Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids. Conclusions: The temperature scale will be extremely useful
in the context of spectroscopic surveys for Milky Way archaeology with the WEAVE and 4MOST spectrographs.
It paves the way for highly accurate and precise metallicity estimates, which will allow us to assess
the possible metallicity dependence of Cepheids' period-luminosity relations and, in turn, to
improve our measurement of the Hubble constant H0.
