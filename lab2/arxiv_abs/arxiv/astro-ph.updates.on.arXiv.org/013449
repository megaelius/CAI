We study the dynamics and growth of dust particles in circumstellar disks of different masses that
are prone to gravitational instability during the critical first Myr of their evolution. The dust
component is made up of two different components: micron-sized dust and grown dust of evolving size.
For the dust component, we considered the dust coagulation, fragmentation, momentum exchange
with the gas, and dust self-gravity. We found that the micron-sized dust particles grow rapidly
in the circumstellar disk, reaching a few cm in size in the inner 100 au of the disk during less than
100 kyr after the disk formation, provided that fragmentation velocity is $30\rm~ms^{-1}$. Due
to the accretion of micron dust particles from the surrounding envelope, which serves as a micron
dust reservoir, the approximately cm-sized dust particles continue to be present in the disk for
more than 900 kyr after the disk formation and maintain a dust-to-gas ratio close to 0.01. We show
that a strong correlation exists between the gas and pebble fluxes in the disk. We find that radial
surface density distribution of pebbles in the disk shows power-law distribution with an index
similar to that of the Minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) regardless the disk mass. We also show that
the gas surface density in our models agrees well with measurements of dust in protoplanetary disks
of AS 209, HD 163296, and DoAr 25 systems. Pebbles are formed during the very early stages of protoplanetary
disk evolution. They play a crucial role in the planet formation process. Our disc simulations reveal
the early onset ($<10^5$ yr) of an inwards-drifting flux of pebble-sized particles that makes up
approximately between one hundredth and one tenth of the gas mass flux, which appears consistent
with mm-observations of discs. (Abridged)
