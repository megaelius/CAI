We present the discovery by the SPitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey (SPIRITS) of a likely
supernova (SN) in NGC 3556 at only 8.8 Mpc, which, despite its proximity, was not detected by optical
searches. A luminous infrared (IR) transient at $M_{[4.5]} = -16.7$ mag (Vega), SPIRITS 16tn is
coincident with a dust lane in the inclined, star-forming disk of the host. Using IR, optical, and
radio observations, we attempt to determine the nature of this event. We estimate $A_V \approx$
8 - 9 mag of extinction, placing it among the three most highly obscured IR-discovered SNe to date.
The [4.5] light curve declined at a rate of 0.013 mag day$^{-1}$, and the $[3.6] - [4.5]$ color grew
redder from 0.7 to $\gtrsim$ 1.0 mag by 184.7 days post discovery. Optical/IR spectroscopy shows
a red continuum, but no clearly discernible features, preventing a definitive spectroscopic classification.
Deep radio observations constrain the radio luminosity of SPIRITS 16tn to $L_{\nu} \lesssim 10^{24}$
erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ between 3 - 15 GHz, excluding many varieties of radio core-collapse SNe.
A type Ia SN is ruled out by the observed red IR color, and lack of features normally attributed to Fe-peak
elements in the optical and IR spectra. SPIRITS 16tn was fainter at [4.5] than typical stripped-envelope
SNe by $\approx$ 1 mag. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution to SNe II suggests SPIRITS
16tn was both highly obscured, and intrinsically dim, possibly akin to the low-luminosity SN 2005cs.
We infer the presence of an IR dust echo powered by a peak luminosity of the transient of $5 \times 10^{40}$
erg s$^{-1} < L_{\mathrm{peak}} < 4\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with the observed
range for SNe II. This discovery illustrates the power of IR surveys to overcome the compounding
effects of visible extinction and optically sub-luminous events in completing the inventory of
nearby SNe.
