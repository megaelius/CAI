The Sandage-Loeb (SL) test directly measures the expansion rate of the universe in the redshift
range of $2\lesssim z\lesssim 5$ by detecting redshift drift in the spectra of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest
of distant quasars. We discuss the impact of the future SL test data on parameter estimation for the
$\Lambda$CDM, the $w$CDM, and the $w_0w_a$CDM models. To avoid the potential inconsistency with
other observational data, we take the best-fitting dark energy model constrained by the current
observations as the fiducial model to produce 30 mock SL test data. The SL test data provide an important
supplement to the other dark energy probes, since they are extremely helpful in breaking the existing
parameter degeneracies. We show that the strong degeneracy between $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ in all
the three dark energy models is well broken by the SL test. Compared to the current combined data of
type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background, and Hubble constant,
the 30-yr observation of SL test could improve the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ by more than
60\% for all the three models. But the SL test can only moderately improve the constraint on the equation
of state of dark energy. We show that a 30-yr observation of SL test could help improve the constraint
on constant $w$ by about 25\%, and improve the constraints on $w_0$ and $w_a$ by about 20\% and 15\%,
respectively. We also quantify the constraining power of the SL test in the future high-precision
joint geometric constraints on dark energy. The mock future supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation
data are simulated based on the space-based project JDEM. We find that the 30-yr observation of SL
test would help improve the measurement precision of $\Omega_m$, $H_0$, and $w_a$ by more than 70\%,
20\%, and 60\%, respectively, for the $w_0w_a$CDM model.
