The characterization of the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) properties of high-redshift galaxy clusters
is fundamental to our understanding of large-scale structure formation processes. We present
the results of a multi-wavelength analysis of the very massive cluster MOO J1142$+$1527 at a redshift
$z = 1.2$ discovered as part of the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS). This analysis
is based on high angular resolution $Chandra$ X-ray and NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data. Although
the X-ray data have only about 1700 counts, we are able to determine the ICM thermodynamic radial
profiles, namely temperature, entropy, and hydrostatic mass. These have been obtained with unprecedented
precision at this redshift and up to $0.7R_{500}$, thanks to the combination of high-resolution
X-ray and SZ data. The comparison between the galaxy distribution mapped in infrared by $Spitzer$
and the morphological properties of the ICM derived from the combined analysis of the $Chandra$
and NIKA2 data leads us to the conclusion that the cluster is an on-going merger. We measure the hydrostatic
mass profile of the cluster in four angular sectors centered on the large-scale X-ray centroid.
This allows us to estimate a systematic uncertainty on the cluster total mass that characterizes
both the impact of the observed deviations from spherical symmetry and of the core dynamics on the
mass profile. We further combine the X-ray and SZ data at the pixel level to obtain maps of the temperature
and entropy distributions averaged along the line of sight. We find a relatively low entropy core
at the position of the X-ray peak and high temperature regions located on its south and west sides.
The increase in ICM temperature at the location of the SZ peak is expected given the merger dynamics.
