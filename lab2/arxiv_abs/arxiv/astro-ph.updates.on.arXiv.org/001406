This work focuses on the study of the aqueous alteration process which acted in the main belt and produced
hydrated minerals on the altered asteroids. The aqueous alteration is particularly important
for unraveling the processes occurring during the earliest times of the Solar System history, as
it can give information both on the asteroids thermal evolution and on the localization of water
sources in the asteroid belt. We present new spectral observations in the visible region of 80 asteroids
belonging to the primitive classes C, G, F, B and P. We combine the present observations with the visible
spectra of asteroids available in the literature for a total of 600 primitive main belt asteroids.
Our analysis shows that the aqueous alteration sequence starts from the P-type objects, practically
unaltered, and increases through the F, B, C, and G asteroids. Around 50% of the observed C-type asteroids
show absorption features in the vis. range due to hydrated silicates, implying that more than 70%
of them will have a 3 $\mu$m absorption band and thus hydrated minerals on their surfaces. The process
dominates in primitive asteroids located between 2.3 and 3.1 AU, that is at smaller heliocentric
distances than previously suggested. The aqueous alteration process dominates in the 50--240
km sized primitive asteroids, while it is less effective for bodies smaller than 50 km. No correlation
is found between the aqueous alteration process and the asteroids albedo or orbital elements. Comparing
the $\sim$ 0.7 $\mu$m band parameters of hydrated silicates and CM2 carbonaceous chondrites, we
see that the band center of meteorites is at longer wavelengths than that of asteroids. This difference
on center positions may be attributed to different minerals abundances, and to the fact that CM2
available on Earth might not be representative of the whole aqueous altered asteroids population.
