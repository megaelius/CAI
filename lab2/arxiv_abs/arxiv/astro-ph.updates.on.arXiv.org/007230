We present the first systematic study of both binary-single and binary-binary black hole interactions
with the inclusion of general relativity. By including general relativistic effects in the equations
of motion during strong encounters, the dissipation of orbital energy from the emission of gravitational
radiation can lead to inspirals and mergers with appreciable eccentricities when entering the
sensitive frequency ranges of the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. In this study,
we perform binary-binary and binary-single scattering experiments with general relativistic
dynamics up through the 2.5 post-Newtonian order included, both in a controlled setting to gauge
the importance of non-dissipative post-Newtonian terms and derive scaling relations for the cross-section
of inspirals, as well as experiments tuned to the strong interactions from state-of-the art globular
cluster models to assess the relative importance of the binary-binary channel at producing inspirals
and resultant eccentricity distributions. Although binary-binary interactions are 10-100 times
less frequent in globular clusters than binary-single interactions, their longer lifetime and
more complex dynamics leads to a higher probability for inspirals to occur during the encounter.
We find that binary-binary interactions contribute 25-45% of the eccentric mergers which occur
during strong black hole encounters in globular clusters, regardless of the properties of the cluster
environment. The inclusion of higher multiplicity encounters in globular clusters therefore
have major implications on the predicted rates of highly eccentric binaries potentially detectable
by the LIGO/Virgo network. As gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals are distinct from
those generated by merging binaries which have circularized, measurements of eccentricity in
such systems would highly constrain their formation scenario.
