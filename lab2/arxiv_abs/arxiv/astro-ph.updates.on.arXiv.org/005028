Reconstructed maps of the lensing convergence of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) will play
a major role in precision cosmology in coming years. CMB lensing maps will enable calibration of
the masses of high-redshift galaxy clusters and will yield precise measurements of the growth of
cosmic structure through cross-correlations with galaxy surveys. During the next decade, CMB
lensing reconstruction will rely heavily on temperature data, rather than polarization, thus
necessitating a detailed understanding of biases due to extragalactic foregrounds. In the near
term, the most significant bias among these is that due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ)
effect. Moreover, high-resolution observations will be available at only a few frequencies, making
full foreground cleaning challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate a solution to the foreground
bias problem that involves cleaning only the large-scale gradients of the CMB temperature map.
We show that the data necessary for tSZ-bias-free CMB lensing maps already exist in the form of large-scale
measurements of the CMB across multiple frequencies by the Planck and WMAP satellite experiments.
Specifically, we show that the bias to halo masses inferred from CMB lensing is eliminated by the
utilization of clean gradients obtained from multi-frequency component separation involving
Planck and WMAP data, and that special lensing maps for galaxy cross-correlations can be prepared
with only a small penalty in signal-to-noise while requiring no masking, in-painting, modeling,
or simulation effort for the tSZ bias. While we focus on cross-correlations, we also show that gradient
cleaning can mitigate biases to the CMB lensing autospectrum that arise from the presence of foregrounds
in temperature and polarization with minimal loss of signal-to-noise.
