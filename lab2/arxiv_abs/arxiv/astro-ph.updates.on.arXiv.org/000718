The Kepler mission is dramatically increasing the number of planets known in multi-planetary systems.
Many adjacent planets have orbital period ratios near resonant values, with a tendency to be larger
than required for exact first-order mean-motion resonances. This intriguing feature has been
shown to be a natural outcome of orbital circularization of resonant planetary pairs due to star-planet
tidal interactions. However, this feature holds in multi-planetary systems with periods longer
than ten days, for which tidal circularization is unlikely to provide efficient divergent evolution
of the planets orbits. Gravitational interactions between planets and their parent protoplanetary
disk may instead provide efficient divergent evolution. For a planet pair embedded in a disk, we
show that interactions between a planet and the wake of its companion can reverse convergent migration,
and significantly increase the period ratio from a near-resonant value. Divergent evolution due
to wake-planet interactions is particularly efficient when at least one of the planets opens a partial
gap around its orbit. This mechanism could help account for the diversity of period ratios in Kepler's
multiple systems comprising super-Earth to sub-jovian planets with periods greater than about
ten days. Diversity is also expected for planet pairs massive enough to merge their gap. The efficiency
of wake-planet interactions is then much reduced, but convergent migration may stall with a variety
of period ratios depending on the density structure in the common gap. This is illustrated for the
Kepler-46 system, for which we reproduce the period ratio of Kepler-46b and c.
