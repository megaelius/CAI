Context. Observations of polarized radio emission show that large-scale (regular) magnetic fields
in spiral galaxies are not axisymmetric, but generally stronger in interarm regions. In some nearby
galaxies such as NGC 6946 they are organized in narrow magnetic arms situated between the material
spiral arms. Aims. The phenomenon of magnetic arms and their relation to the optical spiral arms
(the material arms) call for an explanation in the framework of galactic dynamo theory. Several
possibilities have been suggested but are not completely satisfactory; here we attempt a consistent
investigation. Methods. We use a 2D mean-field dynamo model in the no-z approximation and add injections
of small-scale magnetic field, taken to result from supernova explosions, to represent the effects
of dynamo action on smaller scales. This injection of small scale field is situated along the spiral
arms, where star-formation mostly occurs. Results. A straightforward explanation of magnetic
arms as a result of modulation of the dynamo mechanism by material arms struggles to produce pronounced
magnetic arms, at least with realistic parameters, without introducing new effects such as a time
lag between Coriolis force and {\alpha}-effect. In contrast, by taking into account explicitly
the small-scale magnetic field that is injected into the arms by the action of the star forming regions
that are concentrated there, we can obtain dynamo models with magnetic structures of various forms
that can be compared with magnetic arms. (abbrev). Conclusions. We conclude that magnetic arms
can be considered as coherent magnetic structures generated by large-scale dynamo action, and
associated with spatially modulated small-scale magnetic fluctuations, caused by enhanced star
formation rates within the material arms.
