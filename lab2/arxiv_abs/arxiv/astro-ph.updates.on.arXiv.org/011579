Resonant dynamics plays a significant role in the past evolution and current state of our outer Solar
System. The population ratios and spatial distribution of Neptune's resonant populations are
direct clues to understanding the history of our planetary system. The orbital structure of the
objects in Neptune's 2:1 mean-motion resonance (\emph{twotinos}) has the potential to be a tracer
of planetary migration processes. Different migration processes produce distinct architectures,
recognizable by well-characterized surveys. However, previous characterized surveys only discovered
a few twotinos, making it impossible to model the intrinsic twotino population. With a well-designed
cadence and nearly 100\% tracking success, the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) discovered
838 trans-Neptunian objects, of which 34 are securely twotinos with well-constrained libration
angles and amplitudes. We use the OSSOS twotinos and the survey characterization parameters via
the OSSOS Survey Simulator to inspect the intrinsic population and orbital distributions of twotino.
The estimated twotino population, 4400$^{+1500}_{-1100}$ with $H_r<8.66$ (diameter$\sim$100km)
at 95\% confidence, is consistent with the previous low-precision estimate. We also constrain
the width of the inclination distribution to a relatively narrow value of $\sigma_i$=6$^\circ$$^{+1}_{-1}$,
and find the eccentricity distribution is consistent with a Gaussian centered on $e_\mathrm{c}=0.275$
with a width $e_\mathrm{w}=0.06$. We find a single-slope exponential luminosity function with
$\alpha=0.6$ for the twotinos. Finally, we for the first time meaningfully constrain the fraction
of symmetric twotinos, and the ratio of the leading asymmetric islands; both fractions are in a range
of 0.2--0.6. These measurements rule out certain theoretical models of Neptune's migration history.
