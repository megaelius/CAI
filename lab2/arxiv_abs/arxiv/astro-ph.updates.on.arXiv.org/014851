We study the large-scale magnetic field structure and its interplay with the gas dynamics in the
Monoceros OB1 East molecular cloud. We combine observations of dust polarised emission from the
Planck telescope and CO molecular line emission observations from the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory
14-metre telescope. We calculate the strength of the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field using a modified
Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and estimate mass over flux ratios in different regions of the cloud.
We use the comparison of the velocity and intensity gradients of the molecular line observations
with the polarimetric observations to trace dynamically active regions. The molecular complex
shows an ordered large-scale plane-of-the-sky magnetic field structure. In the Northern part,
it is mostly orientated along the filamentary structures while the Southern part shows at least
two regions with distinct magnetic field orientations. We find that in the Northern filaments the
magnetic field is unlikely to provide support against fragmentation at large scales. Our analysis
reveals a shock region in the Northern part of the complex right in-between two filamentary clouds
which were previously suggested to be in collision. Moreover, the shock seems to extend farther
towards the Western part of the complex. In the Southern part, we find that either the magnetic field
guides the accretion of interstellar matter towards the cloud or it was dragged by the matter towards
the densest regions. The large-scale magnetic field in Monoceros OB-1 East molecular clouds is
tightly connected to the global structure of the complex and, in the Northern part, it seems to be
dominated by gravity and turbulence, while in the Southern part it influences the structuring of
matter.
