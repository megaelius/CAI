We investigate the effects of AGN feedback on the cosmological evolution of an isolated elliptical
galaxy by performing two-dimensional high-resolution hydrodynamical numerical simulations.
The inner boundary of the simulation is chosen so that the Bondi radius is resolved, which is crucial
for the determination of the mass accretion rate of the AGN. According to the theory of black hole
accretion, there are two accretion modes, hot and cold, which correspond to different accretion
rates and have different radiation and wind outputs. In our simulations, the two modes are discriminated
and the feedback effects by radiation and wind in each mode are taken into account. The main improvement
of the present work compared to previous ones is that we adopt the most updated AGN physics, including
the descriptions of radiation and wind from the hot accretion flows and wind from cold accretion
disks. Physical processes like star formation, Type Ia and Type II supernovae are taken into account.
We study the AGN light curve, typical AGN lifetime, growth of the black hole mass, AGN duty-cycle,
star formation, and the X-ray surface brightness of the galaxy. We have compared our simulation
results with observations and found general consistency. Comparisons with previous simulation
works find significant differences, indicating the importance of AGN physics. The respective
roles of radiation and wind feedbacks are examined and it is found that they are different for different
problems of interest such as AGN luminosity and star formation. We find that it is hard to neglect
any of them, so we suggest to simply use the names of "cold feedback mode" and "hot feedback mode" to
replace the currently used names.
