The non-detection of dark matter (DM) particles in increasingly stringent laboratory searches
has encouraged alternative gravity theories where gravity is sourced only from visible matter.
Here, we consider whether such theories can pass a two-dimensional test posed by gravitational
lensing -- to reproduce a particularly detailed Einstein ring in the core of the galaxy cluster Abell
3827. We find that when we require the lensing mass distribution to strictly follow the shape (ellipticity
and position angle) of the light distribution of cluster member galaxies, intracluster stars,
and the X-ray emitting intracluster medium, we cannot reproduce the Einstein ring, despite allowing
the mass-to-light ratios of these visible components to freely vary with radius to mimic alternative
gravity theories. Alternatively, we show that the detailed features of the Einstein ring are accurately
reproduced by allowing a smooth, freely oriented DM halo in the lens model, with relatively small
contributions from the visible components at a level consistent with their observed brightnesses.
This dominant DM component is constrained to have the same orientation as the light from the intracluster
stars, indicating that the intracluster stars trace the gravitational potential of this component.
The Einstein ring of Abell 3827 therefore presents a new challenge for alternative gravity theories:
not only must such theories find agreement between the total lensing mass and visible mass, but they
must also find agreement between the projected sky distribution of the lensing mass and that of the
visible matter, a more stringent test than has hitherto been posed by lensing data.
