We extend the real-space mapping method developed in Shi et at. (2016) so that it can be applied to
flux-limited galaxy samples. We use an ensemble of mock catalogs to demonstrate the reliability
of this extension, showing that it allows for an accurate recovery of the real-space correlation
functions and galaxy biases. We also demonstrate that, using an iterative method applied to intermediate-scale
clustering data, we can obtain an unbiased estimate of the growth rate of structure $f\sigma_8$,
which is related to the clustering amplitude of matter, to an accuracy of $\sim 10\%$. Applying this
method to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7), we construct a real-space galaxy
catalog spanning the redshift range $0.01 \leq z \leq 0.2$, which contains 584,473 galaxies in the
north Galactic cap (NGC). Using this data, we infer $\fss$ at a median redshift $z=0.1$, which is
consistent with the WMAP9 cosmology at the $1\sigma$ level. By combining this measurement with
the real-space clustering of galaxies and with galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements for the
same sets of galaxies, we are able to break the degeneracy between $f$, $\sigma_8$, and $b$. From
the SDSS DR7 data alone, we obtain the following cosmological constraints at redshift $z=0.1$:
$f=$$0.464^{+0.040}_{-0.040}$, $\sigma_8=0.769^{+0.121}_{-0.089}$, and $b=1.910^{+0.234}_{-0.268}$,
$1.449^{+0.194}_{-0.196}$, $1.301^{+0.170}_{-0.177}$, and $1.196^{+0.159}_{-0.161}~$
for galaxies within different absolute magnitude bins $^{0.1}{\rm M}_r-5\log h=[-23,0, -22.0],
[-22,0, -21.0], [-21.0, -20.0]$ and $[-20.0, -19.0]$, respectively.
