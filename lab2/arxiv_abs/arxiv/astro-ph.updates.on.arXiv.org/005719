Umbral flashes (UFs) are most common phenomenon of wave processes in sunspots. Studying the relationship
between wave time dynamics and the origin of UFs requires further investigation of their fine spatial
and height structure. We investigated the association between a short time increase in the variations
of three-minute extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission at footpoints of coronal magnetic loops and
the UF emergence in sunspot umbra. We applied the pixelized wavelet filtering (PWF) technique to
analyse a cube of the images obtained by SDO/AIA at 1600A, 304A, and 171A to study the spatio-temporal
oscillation power distribution in individual magnetic loops. Time-distance plots were used to
obtain the wave front propagation velocity. For the first time, we obtained the 2D images of the fine
wave processes in magnetic structures of different spatial scales related to the UFs in sunspot.
We revealed two types of the UFs as background and local. The background UFs associated with random
increasing of separate parts of wave fronts. These UFs are seen as weak and diffuse details that ride
the wave fronts without stable shapes and localization in space. The local UFs sources mainly localize
near to the footpoint of magnetic loops, anchored in an umbra, along which the propagation of three-minute
waves was observed. It is shown that the maxima of three-minute oscillation trains coincide with
the peak intensity of UFs. The sunspot three-minute wave dynamics showed a relation between the
localization of oscillations power peak at the coronal magnetic loop footpoints and the UFs origin.
The spatial structure of the UFs sources, their power, and lifetime are determined by the cut-off
frequency of the waves for the detected waveguides. We concluded that UFs are a global process of
short-time increase of the wave activity.
