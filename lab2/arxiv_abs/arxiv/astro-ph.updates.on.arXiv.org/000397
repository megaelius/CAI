Context. The recent discovery of a large number of galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) effect has opened a new era on the study of the most massive clusters in the Universe. Multi-wavelength
analyses are required to understand the properties of these new sets of clusters, which are a sensitive
probe of cosmology. Aims. We aim at a multi-wavelength characterization of PLCK G004.5-19.5, one
of the most massive X-ray validated SZ effect-selected galaxy clusters discovered by the Planck
satellite. Methods. We have observed PLCK G004.5-19.5 with GMOS on the 8.1m-Gemini South Telescope
for optical imaging and spectroscopy, and performed a strong lensing analysis. We also searched
for associated radio emission in published catalogs. Results. An analysis of the optical images
confirms that this is a massive cluster, with a dominant central galaxy (the BCG) and an accompanying
red sequence of galaxies, plus many strongly lensed background galaxies including a 14"-long arc.
Longslit spectroscopy of 6 cluster members shows that the cluster is at z = 0.516+/-0.002. We also
targeted the most prominent lensed galaxy, and found z_arc = 1.601. From a strong lensing analysis
we measure a median Einstein radius theta_E=29" and estimate an enclosed mass M_E = (2.38+/-0.55)e14
Msun. By extrapolating an NFW profile we find a total mass M_500(SL) = 6.1(+2.3,-1.2)e14 Msun. This
mass is considerably lower than that implied by the SZ and X-ray observations, which may indicate
a departure from the NFW profile for PLCK G004.5-19.5. The analysis of archival radio data at 843
MHz and 1.4 GHz suggest that PLCK G004.5-19.5 hosts a powerful radio relic on scales <~1 Mpc.
