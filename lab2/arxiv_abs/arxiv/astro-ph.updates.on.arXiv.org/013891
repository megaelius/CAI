We investigate whether the hard X-ray photon index (${\Gamma}$) versus accretion rate correlation
for super-Eddington accreting quasars is different from that for sub-Eddington accreting quasars.
We construct a sample of 113 bright quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 quasar
catalog, including 38 quasars as the super-Eddington subsample and 75 quasars as the sub-Eddington
subsample. We derive black-hole masses using a simple-epoch virial mass formula based on the ${\rm
H\beta}$ lines, and we use the standard thin disk model to derive the dimensionless accretion rates
($\dot{\mathscr{M}}$) for our sample. The X-ray data for these quasars are collected from the Chandra
and XMM-Newton archives. We fit the hard X-ray spectra using a single power-law model to obtain ${\Gamma}$
values. We find a statistically significant ($R_{\rm S}=0.43$, $p=7.75\times{10}^{-3}$) correlation
between ${\Gamma}$ and $\dot{\mathscr{M}}$ for the super-Eddington subsample. The ${\Gamma}$-$\dot{\mathscr{M}}$
correlation for the sub-Eddington subsample is also significant, but weaker ($R_{\rm S}=0.30$,
$p=9.98\times{10}^{-3}$). Linear regression analysis shows that ${\rm \Gamma}=(0.34\pm0.11){\rm
log}{\dot{\mathscr{M}}}+(1.71\pm0.17)$ and ${\rm \Gamma}=(0.09\pm0.04){\rm log}{\dot{\mathscr{M}}}+(1.93\pm0.04)$
for the super- and sub-Eddington subsamples, respectively. The ${\Gamma}$-$\dot{\mathscr{M}}$
correlations of the two subsamples are different, suggesting different disk-corona connections
in these two types of systems. We propose one qualitative explanation of the steeper ${\Gamma}$-$\dot{\mathscr{M}}$
correlation in the super-Eddington regime that involves larger seed photon fluxes received by
the compact coronae from the thick disks in super-Eddington accreting quasars.
