This work aims at presenting the first two-dimensional models of an isolated rapidly rotating star
that include the derivation of the differential rotation and meridional circulation in a self-consistent
way.We use spectral methods in multidomains, together with a Newton algorithm to determine the
steady state solutions including differential rotation and meridional circulation for an isolated
non-magnetic, rapidly rotating early-type star. In particular we devise an asymptotic method
for small Ekman numbers (small viscosities) that removes the Ekman boundary layer and lifts the
degeneracy of the inviscid baroclinic solutions.For the first time, realistic two-dimensional
models of fast-rotating stars are computed with the actual baroclinic flows that predict the differential
rotation and the meridional circulation for intermediate-mass and massive stars. These models
nicely compare with available data of some nearby fast-rotating early-type stars like Ras Alhague
($\alpha$ Oph), Regulus ($\alpha$ Leo), and Vega ($\alpha$ Lyr). It is shown that baroclinicity
drives a differential rotation with a slow pole, a fast equator, a fast core, and a slow envelope.
The differential rotation is found to increase with mass, with evolution (here measured by the hydrogen
mass fraction in the core), and with metallicity. The core-envelope interface is found to be a place
of strong shear where mixing will be efficient.Two-dimensional models offer a new view of fast-rotating
stars, especially of their differential rotation, which turns out to be strong at the core-envelope
interface. They also offer more accurate models for interpreting the interferometric and spectroscopic
data of early-type stars.
