The Italian center for Astronomical Archives tries to provide astronomical data resources as interoperable
services based on IVOA standards. Its VO expertise and knowledge comes from active participation
within IVOA and VO at European and international level, with a double-fold goal: learn from the collaboration
and provide inputs to the community. The first solution to build an easy to configure and maintain
resource publisher conformant to VO standards proved to be too optimistic. For this reason it has
been necessary to re-think the architecture with a modular system built around the messaging concept,
where each modular component speaks to the other interested parties through a system of broker-managed
queues. The first implemented protocol, the Simple Cone Search, shows the messaging task architecture
connecting the parametric HTTP interface to the database backend access module, the logging module,
and allows multiple cone search resources to be managed together through a configuration manager
module. Even if relatively young, it already proved the flexibility required by the overall system
when the database backend changed from MySQL to PostgreSQL+PgSphere. Another implementation
test has been made to leverage task distribution over multiple servers to serve simultaneously:
FITS cubes direct linking, cubes cutout and cubes positional merging. Currently the implementation
of the SIA-2.0 standard protocol is ongoing while for TAP we will be adapting the TAPlib library.
Alongside these tools a first administration tool (TASMAN) has been developed to ease the build
up and maintenance of TAP_SCHEMA-ta including also ObsCore maintenance capability. Future work
will be devoted at widening the range of VO protocols covered by the set of available modules, improve
the configuration management and develop specific purpose modules common to all the service components.
