A new X-ray, {\it UBVR}$I_c$, and {\it JHK$s$} study of the young cluster Westerlund 2 was undertaken
to resolve discrepancies tied to the cluster's distance. Existing spectroscopic observations
for bright cluster members and new multi-band photometry imply a reddening relation towards Westerlund~2
described by $E_{U-B}/E_{B-V}=0.63 + 0.02\;E_{B-V}$. Variable-extinction analyses for Westerlund~2
and nearby IC 2581 based upon spectroscopic distance moduli and ZAMS fitting yield values of $R_V=A_V/E_{B-V}=3.88\pm0.18$
and $3.77\pm0.19$, respectively, and confirm prior assertions that anomalous interstellar extinction
is widespread throughout Carina (e.g., Turner 2012). The results were confirmed by applying the
color difference method to {\it UBVR$I_c$JH$K_s$} data for 19 spectroscopically-observed cluster
members, yielding $R_V=3.85\pm0.07$. The derived distance to Westerlund~2 of $d=2.85\pm0.43$
kpc places the cluster on the far side of the Carina spiral arm. The cluster's age is no more than $\tau
\sim2\times10^6$ yr as inferred from the cluster's brightest stars and an X-ray (Chandra) cleaned
analysis of its pre-main-sequence demographic. Four Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core and surrounding
corona (WR20a, WR20b, WR20c, and WR20aa) are likely cluster members, and their inferred luminosities
are consistent with those of other late-WN stars in open clusters. The color-magnitude diagram
for Westerlund~2 also displays a gap at spectral type B0.5 V with associated color spread at higher
and lower absolute magnitudes that might be linked to close binary mergers. Such features, in conjunction
with the evidence for mass loss from the WR stars, may help to explain the high flux of $\gamma$ rays,
cosmic rays, and X-rays from the direction towards Westerlund~2.
