Until recently, dust emission has been detected in very few host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBHs).
With Herschel, we have now observed 17 GRBHs up to redshift z~3 and detected seven of them at infrared
(IR) wavelengths. This relatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of our
sample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of dark GRBs. Although the numbers
are small, statistics suggest that dark GRBs are more likely to be detected in the IR than their optically-bright
counterparts. Combining our IR data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our own datasets
and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) which span up
to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. By fitting the SEDs, we have obtained stellar masses, dust
masses, star-formation rate (SFR), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. We find that GRBHs
are galaxies that tend to have a high specfic SFR (sSFR), and like other star-forming galaxies, their
ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlated with sSFR. We incorporate our Herschel sample
into a larger compilation of GRBHs, and compare this combined sample to SFR-weighted median stellar
masses of the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. This is done in order to establish whether or
not GRBs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmic comoving SFR density (SFRD) in the universe. In
contrast with previous results, this comparison shows that GRBHs are medium-sized galaxies with
relatively high sSFRs; stellar masses and sSFRs of GRBHs as a function of redshift are similar to
what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts. We conclude that there
is no strong evidence that GRBs are biased tracers of SFRD; thus they should be able to reliably probe
the SFRD to early epochs.
