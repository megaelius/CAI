We present a weak-lensing study of SPT-CLJ2040-4451 and IDCSJ1426+3508 at z=1.48 and 1.75, respectively.
The two clusters were observed in our "See Change" program, a HST survey of 12 massive high-redshift
clusters aimed at high-z supernova measurements and weak-lensing estimation of accurate cluster
masses. We detect weak but significant galaxy shape distortions using IR images from the WFC3, which
has not yet been used for weak-lensing studies. Both clusters appear to possess relaxed morphology
in projected mass distribution, and their mass centroids agree nicely with those defined by both
the galaxy luminosity and X-ray emission. Using an NFW profile, for which we assume that the mass
is tightly correlated with the concentration parameter, we determine the masses of SPT-CL J2040-4451
and IDCS J1426+3508 to be M_{200}=8.6_{-1.4}^{+1.7}x10^14 M_sun and 2.2_{-0.7}^{+1.1}x10^14
M_sun, respectively. The weak-lensing mass of SPT-CLJ2040-4451 shows that the cluster is clearly
a rare object. Adopting the central value, the expected abundance of such a massive cluster at z>1.48
is only ~0.07 in the parent 2500 sq. deg. survey. However, it is yet premature to claim that the presence
of this cluster creates a serious tension with the current LCDM paradigm unless that tension will
remain in future studies after marginalizing over many sources of uncertainties such as the accuracy
of the mass function and the mass-concentration relation at the high mass end. The mass of IDCSJ1426+3508
is in excellent agreement with our previous ACS-based weak-lensing result while the much higher
source density from our WFC3 imaging data makes the current statistical uncertainty ~40% smaller.
