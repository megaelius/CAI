The core-cusp problem is a widely cited motivation for the exploration of dark matter models beyond
standard CDM. One such alternative is ULDM; extremely light scalar particles exhibiting wavelike
properties on kiloparsec scales. Astrophysically realistic ULDM halos are expected to consist
of inner solitonic cores embedded in NFW-like outer halos. The presence of the solitonic core suggests
that ULDM may resolve the core-cusp discrepancy associated with pure NFW halos without recourse
to baryonic physics. However, it has been demonstrated that the density of ULDM halos can exceed
those of comparable NFW configurations at some radii and halo masses, apparently exacerbating
the problem rather than solving it. This situation arises because, although solitonic cores are
flat at their centres, they obey an inverse mass-radius scaling relationship. Meanwhile, the mass
of the inner soliton increases with the total halo mass, and therefore the inner core becomes more
peaked at large halo masses. We describe a parameterisation of the radial density profiles of ULDM
halos that allows for environmental variability of the core-halo mass relation in order to investigate
this issue in more detail. For halos up to 10^12 solar masses we find feasible ULDM profiles for which
the central density is lower than their NFW counterparts at astrophysically accessible radii.
However, comparisons to observed profiles do not strongly favour either option; both give reasonable
fits to subsets of the data for some parameter choices. Consequently, we find that robust tests of
the core-cusp problem in ULDM will require more comprehensive observational data and simulations
that include baryonic feedback.
