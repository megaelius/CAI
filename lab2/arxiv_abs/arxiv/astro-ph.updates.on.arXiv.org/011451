Cosmology and galaxy evolution studies with LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST, will require accurate redshifts
for the detected galaxies. In this study, we present improved photometric redshift estimates for
galaxies using a template library that populates three-color space and is constrained by HST/CANDELS
photometry. For the training sample, we use a sample of galaxies which have median photometric redshifts
derived by combining the results of different redshift-fitting codes. It allows us to train on a
large, unbiased galaxy sample having deep, unconfused photometry at optical-to-mid infrared
wavelengths. Galaxies in the training sample are assigned to cubes in three-dimensional color
space, V-H, I-J, and z-H. We then derive the best-fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the
training sample at the fixed CANDELS median photometric redshifts to construct the new template
library for each individual color cube (i.e. color-cube-based template library). We derive photometric
redshifts (photo-z) of our target galaxies in the GOODS-S and -N fields using our new color-cube-based
template library. We find that our method yields $\sigma_{NMAD}$ of 0.026 and an outlier fraction
of 6% using only photometry in the LSST and Euclid/WFIRST bands. This is an improvement of 10% on $\sigma_{NMAD}$
and a reduction in outlier fraction of 13% compared to other techniques. In particular, we improve
the photo-z precision by about 30% at 2 < z < 3. We also assess photo-z improvements by including K or
mid-infrared bands to the ugrizY JH photometry. Our color-cube-based template library is a powerful
tool to constrain photometric redshifts for future large surveys.
