We investigate the convective stability of two popular types of model of the gas distribution in
the hot Galactic halo. We first consider models in which the halo density and temperature decrease
exponentially with height above the disk. These halo models were created to account for the fact
that, on some sight lines, the halo's X-ray emission lines and absorption lines yield different
temperatures, implying that the halo is non-isothermal. We show that the hot gas in these exponential
models is convectively unstable if $\gamma<3/2$, where $\gamma$ is the ratio of the temperature
and density scale heights. Using published measurements of $\gamma$ and its uncertainty, we use
Bayes' Theorem to infer posterior probability distributions for $\gamma$, and hence the probability
that the halo is convectively unstable for different sight lines. We find that, if these exponential
models are good descriptions of the hot halo gas, at least in the first few kiloparsecs from the plane,
the hot halo is reasonably likely to be convectively unstable on two of the three sight lines for which
scale height information is available. We also consider more extended models of the halo. While
isothermal halo models are convectively stable if the density decreases with distance from the
Galaxy, a model of an extended adiabatic halo in hydrostatic equilibrium with the Galaxy's dark
matter is on the boundary between stability and instability. However, we find that radiative cooling
may perturb this model in the direction of convective instability. If the Galactic halo is indeed
convectively unstable, this would argue in favor of supernova activity in the Galactic disk contributing
to the heating the hot halo gas.
