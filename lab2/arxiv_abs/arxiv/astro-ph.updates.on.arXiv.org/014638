We analyse the clustering of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey Data Release 16 luminous red galaxy sample (DR16 eBOSS LRG) in combination with the high redshift
tail of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 12
(DR12 BOSS CMASS). We measure the redshift space distortions (RSD) and also extract the longitudinal
and transverse baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale from the anisotropic power spectrum
signal inferred from 377,458 galaxies between redshifts 0.6 and 1.0, with effective redshift of
$z_{\rm eff}=0.698$ and effective comoving volume of $2.72\,{\rm Gpc}^3$. After applying reconstruction
we measure the BAO scale and infer $D_H(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 19.30\pm 0.56$ and $D_M(z_{\rm
eff})/r_{\rm drag} =17.86 \pm 0.37$. When we perform a redshift space distortions analysis on the
pre-reconstructed catalogue on the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole we find, $D_H(z_{\rm
eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 20.18\pm 0.78$, $D_M(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} =17.49 \pm 0.52$ and $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm
eff})=0.454\pm0.046$. We combine both sets of results along with the measurements in configuration
space of \cite{LRG_corr} and report the following consensus values: $D_H(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm
drag} = 19.77\pm 0.47$, $D_M(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 17.65\pm 0.30$ and $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm
eff})=0.473\pm 0.044$, which are in full agreement with the standard $\Lambda$CDM and GR predictions.
These results represent the most precise measurements within the redshift range $0.6\leq z \leq
1.0$ and are the culmination of more than 8 years of SDSS observations.
