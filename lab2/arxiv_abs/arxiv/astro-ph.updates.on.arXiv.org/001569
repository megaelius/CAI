(Abridged) Atmospheric dispersion and field differential refraction impose severe constraints
on widefield MOS observations. Flux reduction and spectral distortions must be minimised by a careful
planning of the observations -- which is especially true for instruments that use slits instead
of fibres. This is the case of VIMOS at the VLT, where MOS observations have been restricted, since
the start of operations, to a narrow two-hour range from the meridian to minimise slit losses. We
revisit in detail the impact of atmospheric effects on the quality of VIMOS-MOS spectra. We model
slit losses across the entire VIMOS FOV as a function of target declination. We explore two different
slit orientations at the meridian: along the parallactic angle (North-South), and perpendicular
to it (East-West). We show that, for fields culminating at zenith distances larger than 20 deg, slit
losses are minimised with slits oriented along the parallactic angle at the meridian. The two-hour
angle rule holds for these observations using N-S orientations. Conversely, for fields with zenith
angles smaller than 20 deg at culmination, losses are minimised with slits oriented perpendicular
to the parallactic angle at the meridian. MOS observations can be effectively extended to plus/minus
three hours from the meridian in these cases. In general, night-long observations of a single field
will benefit from using the E-W orientation. All-sky or service mode observations, however, require
a more elaborate planning that depends on the target declination, and the hour angle of the observations.
We establish general rules for the alignment of slits in MOS observations that will increase target
observability, enhance the efficiency of operations, and speed up the completion of programmes
-- a particularly relevant aspect for the forthcoming spectroscopic public surveys with VIMOS.
