We present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio continuum images of the nuclei of Arp 220, the
nearest ultra-luminous infrared galaxy. These images have both the angular resolution to study
detailed morphologies of the two nuclei that power the system and sensitivity to a wide range of spatial
scales. At 33 GHz, and with a resolution of 0".081 x 0".063 (29.9 x 23.3 pc), we resolve the emission
surrounding both nuclei and conclude that is mostly synchrotron in nature. The spatial distributions
of radio emission in both nuclei are well described by exponential profiles. These have deconvolved
half-light radii of 51 and 35 pc for the eastern and western nuclei, and they match the number density
profile of radio supernovae observed with very long baseline interferometry. This similarity
might be due to the fast cooling of cosmic rays electrons caused by the presence of a strong (~ mG) magnetic
field in this system. We estimate high luminosity surface densities of $\mathrm{\Sigma_{IR} \sim
4.2^{+1.6}_{-0.7} \times 10^{13}}$ (east) and $\mathrm{\sim 9.7^{+3.7}_{-2.4} \times 10^{13}~(west)~L_{\odot}~kpc^{-2}}$,
and star formation rate surface densities of $\mathrm{\Sigma_{SFR} \sim 10^{3.7\pm0.1}}$ (east)
and $\mathrm{\sim 10^{4.1\pm0.1}~(west)~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}}$. These values, especially
for the western nucleus are, to our knowledge, the highest luminosity and star formation rate surface
densities measured for any star-forming system. Despite these high values, the nuclei lie below
the dusty Eddington limit in which radiation pressure is balanced only by self-gravity. The small
measured sizes also imply that the nuclei of Arp 220 are only transparent in the frequency range ~
5 to 350 GHz. Our results offer no clear evidence that an active galactic nucleus dominates the emission
from either nucleus at 33 GHz.
