Magnetic fields are hypothesized to inflate the radii of low-mass stars---defined as less massive
than 0.8$M_\odot$---in detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs). We investigate this hypothesis using
the recently introduced magnetic Dartmouth stellar evolution code. In particular, we focus on
stars thought to have a radiative core and convective outer envelope by studying in detail three
individual DEBs: UV Psc, YY Gem, and CU Cnc. The results suggest that the stabilization of thermal
convection by a magnetic field is a plausible explanation for the observed model-radius discrepancies.
However, surface magnetic field strengths required by the models are significantly stronger than
those estimated from the observed coronal X-ray emission. Agreement between model predicted surface
magnetic field strengths and those inferred from X-ray observations can be found by assuming that
the magnetic field sources its energy from convection. This approach makes the transport of heat
by convection less efficient and is akin to reduced convective mixing length methods used in other
studies. Predictions for the metallicity and magnetic field strengths of the aforementioned systems
are reported. We also develop an expression relating a reduction in the convective mixing length
to a magnetic field strength in units of the equipartition value. Our results are compared with those
from previous investigations to incorporate magnetic fields to explain the low-mass DEB radius
inflation. Finally, we explore how the effects of magnetic fields might affect mass determinations
using asteroseismic data and the implication of magnetic fields on exoplanet studies.
