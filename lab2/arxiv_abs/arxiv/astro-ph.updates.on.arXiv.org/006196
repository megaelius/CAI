Galaxy groups and clusters are formidable cosmological probes. They permit studying the environmental
effects on galaxy formation. A reliable detection of galaxy groups is an open problem and is important
for ongoing and future cosmological surveys. We propose a new galaxy group detection algorithm
based on a marked point processes with interactions. The pattern of galaxy groups in a catalogue
is seen as a random set of interacting objects. The positions and the interactions of these objects
are governed by a probability density. The parameters of the probability density are chosen using
a priori knowledge. The estimator of the unknown cluster pattern is given by the configuration of
objects maximising the proposed probability density. Adopting the Bayesian framework, the proposed
probability density is maximised using a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. At fixed temperature,
the SA algorithm is a Monte Carlo sampler of the probability density. To test the feasibility of the
proposed methodology, we applied it to the well-studied 2MRS data set. Compared to previously published
Friends-of-Friends (FoF) group finders, the proposed Bayesian group finder gives overall similar
results. However for specific applications, like the reconstruction of the local Universe, the
details of the grouping algorithms are important. The proposed Bayesian group finder is tested
on a galaxy redshift survey, but more detailed analyses are needed to understand the actual capabilities
of the algorithm regarding upcoming cosmological surveys. The presented mathematical framework
permits adapting it easily for other data sets (in astronomy and in other fields of sciences). In
cosmology, one promising application is the detection of galaxy groups in photometric galaxy redshift
surveys, while taking into account the full photometric redshift posteriors.
