Most models for the connection between galaxies and their haloes ignore the possibility that galaxy
properties may be correlated with halo properties other than mass, a phenomenon known as galaxy
assembly bias. Yet, it is known that such correlations can lead to systematic errors in the interpretation
of survey data. At present, the degree to which galaxy assembly bias may be present in the real Universe,
and the best strategies for constraining it remain uncertain. We study the ability of several observables
to constrain galaxy assembly bias from redshift survey data using the decorated halo occupation
distribution (dHOD), an empirical model of the galaxy--halo connection that incorporates assembly
bias. We cover an expansive set of observables, including the projected two-point correlation
function $w_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{p}})$, the galaxy--galaxy lensing signal $\Delta \Sigma(r_{\mathrm{p}})$,
the void probability function $\mathrm{VPF}(r)$, the distributions of counts-in-cylinders
$P(N_{\mathrm{CIC}})$, and counts-in-annuli $P(N_{\mathrm{CIA}})$, and the distribution
of the ratio of counts in cylinders of different sizes $P(N_2/N_5)$. We find that despite the frequent
use of the combination $w_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{p}})+\Delta \Sigma(r_{\mathrm{p}})$ in
interpreting galaxy data, the count statistics, $P(N_{\mathrm{CIC}})$ and $P(N_{\mathrm{CIA}})$,
are generally more efficient in constraining galaxy assembly bias when combined with $w_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{p}})$.
Constraints based upon $w_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{p}})$ and $\Delta \Sigma(r_{\mathrm{p}})$
share common degeneracy directions in the parameter space, while combinations of $w_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{p}})$
with the count statistics are more complementary. Therefore, we strongly suggest that count statistics
should be used to complement the canonical observables in future studies of the galaxy--halo connection.
