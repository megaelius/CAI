In this work we introduce an effective model of $f(R)$ gravity containing a non-minimal coupling
to the axion scalar field. The axion field is described by the misalignment model, in which the primordial
$U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken during inflation and the $f(R)$ gravity is described by
the $R^2$ model, and in addition, the non-minimal coupling has the form $\sim h(\phi)R^{\gamma}$,
with $0<\gamma<0.75$. By appropriately constraining the non-minimal coupling at early times,
the axion field remains frozen in its primordial vacuum expectation value, and the $R^2$ gravity
dominates the inflationary era. As the Universe expands, when $H$ equals the axion mass $m_a$ and
for cosmic times for which $m_a\gg H$, the axion field oscillates. By assuming a slowly varying evolution
of the axion field, the axion energy density scales as $\rho_a\sim a^{-3}$, where $a$ is the scale
factor, regardless of the background Hubble rate, thus behaving as cold dark matter. At late times,
the axion still evolves as $\rho_a\sim a^{-3}$, however the Hubble rate of the expansion and thus
the dynamical evolution of the Universe is controlled by terms containing the higher derivatives
of $\sim R^{\gamma}$, which are related to the non-minimal coupling, and as we demonstrate, the
resulting solution of the Friedman equation at late times is an approximate de Sitter evolution.
The late-time de Sitter Hubble rate scales as $H\sim \Lambda^{1/2}$, where $\Lambda$ is an integration
constant of the theory, which has its allowed values very close to the current value of the cosmological
constant. Finally, the theory has a prediction for the existence of a pre-inflationary primordial
stiff era, in which the energy density of the axion scales as $\rho_a\sim a^{-6}$.
