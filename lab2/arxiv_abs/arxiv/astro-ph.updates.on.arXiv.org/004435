NGC 796 is a massive young cluster located 59 kpc from us in the diffuse intergalactic medium of the
1/5-1/10 $Z_{\odot}$ Magellanic Bridge, allowing to probe variations in star formation and stellar
evolution processes as a function of metallicity in a resolved fashion, providing a link between
resolved studies of nearby solar-metallicity and unresolved distant metal-poor clusters located
in high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, we present adaptive optics $gri$H$\alpha$ imaging of
NGC 796 (at 0.5", which is ~0.14 pc at the cluster distance) along with optical spectroscopy of two
bright members to quantify the cluster properties. Our aim is to explore if star formation and stellar
evolution varies as a function of metallicity by comparing the properties of NGC 796 to higher metallicity
clusters. We find from isochronal fitting of the cluster main sequence in the colour-magnitude
diagram an age of 20$^{+12}_{-5}$ Myr. Based on the cluster luminosity function, we derive a top-heavy
stellar initial mass function (IMF) with a slope $\alpha$ = 1.99$\pm$0.2, hinting at an metallicity
and/or environmental dependence of the IMF which may lead to a top-heavy IMF in the early Universe.
Study of the H$\alpha$ emission line stars reveals that Classical Be stars constitute a higher fraction
of the total B-type stars when compared with similar clusters at greater metallicity, providing
some support to the chemically homogeneous theory of stellar evolution. Overall, NGC 796 has a total
estimated mass of 990$\pm200$ $M_{\odot}$, and a core radius of 1.4$\pm$0.3 pc which classifies
it as a massive young open cluster, unique in the diffuse interstellar medium of the Magellanic Bridge.
