We analyzed the daily sunspot-group data reported by the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results
(GPR) during the period 1874-1976 and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) during the period
1977-2017 and studied North-South asymmetry in the maxima and minima of the Solar Cycles 12-24.
We derived the time series of the 13-month smoothed monthly mean corrected whole-spot areas of the
sunspot groups in the Sun's whole sphere (WSGA), northern hemisphere (NSGA), and southern hemisphere
(SSGA). From these smoothed time series we obtained the values of the maxima and minima, and the corresponding
epochs, of the WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA Cycles 12-24. We find that there exists a 44-66 years periodicity
in the North-South asymmetry of the minimum. A long periodicity (130-140 years) may exist in the
asymmetry of the maximum. A statistically significant correlation exists between the maximum
of SSGA Cycle n and the rise time of WSGA Cycle n + 2. A reasonably significant correlation also exists
between the maximum of WSGA Cycle n and the decline time of WSGA Cycle n + 2. These relations suggest
that the solar dynamo carries memory over at least three solar cycles. Using these relations we obtained
the values 11.7 + or - 0.15 years, 11.2 + or - 0.2 years, and 11.45 + or - 0.3 years for the lengths of WSGA
Cycles 24, 25, and 26, respectively, and hence, July 2020, October 2031, and March 2043 for the minimum
epochs (start dates) of WSGA Cycles 25, 26, and 27, respectively. We also obtained May 2025 and March
2036 for the maximum epochs of WSGA Cycles 25 and 26, respectively. It seems during the late Maunder
minimum sunspot activity was absent around the epochs of the maxima of the NSGA-cycles and the minima
of the SSGA-cycles, and some activity was present at the epochs of the maxima of some SSGA-cycles
and the minima of some NSGA-cycles.
