High-precision astrometry can identify exoplanets and measure their orbits and masses, while
coronagraphic imaging enables detailed characterization of their physical properties and atmospheric
compositions through spectroscopy. In a previous paper, we showed that a diffractive pupil telescope
(DPT) in space can enable sub-microarcsecond accuracy astrometric measurements from wide-field
images by creating faint but sharp diffraction spikes around the bright target star. The DPT allows
simultaneous astrometric measurement and coronagraphic imaging, and we discuss and quantify
in this paper the scientific benefits of this combination for exoplanet science investigations:
identification of exoplanets with increased sensitivity and robustness, and ability to measure
planetary masses to high accuracy. We show how using both measurements to identify planets and measure
their masses offers greater sensitivity and provides more reliable measurements than possible
with separate missions, and therefore results in a large gain in mission efficiency. The combined
measurements reliably identify potentially habitable planets in multiple systems with a few observations,
while astrometry or imaging alone would require many measurements over a long time baseline. In
addition, the combined measurement allows direct determination of stellar masses to percent-level
accuracy, using planets as test particles. We also show that the DPT maintains the full sensitivity
of the telescope for deep wide-field imaging, and is therefore compatible with simultaneous scientific
observations unrelated to exoplanets. We conclude that astrometry, coronagraphy, and deep wide-field
imaging can be performed simultaneously on a single telescope without significant negative impact
on the performance of any of the three techniques.
