The [CII] 158 micron line is one of the strongest emission lines observed in star-forming galaxies,
and has been empirically measured to correlate with the star formation rate (SFR) globally and on
~kpc scales. However, due to the multi-phase origins of [CII], one might expect this relation to
break down at small scales. We investigate the origins of [CII] emission by examining high spatial
resolution observations of [CII] in M31, with the Survey of Lines in M31 (SLIM). We present five ~700x700
pc (3"x3") Fields mapping the [CII] emission, Halpha emission, combined with ancillary infrared
(IR) data. We spatially separate star-forming regions from diffuse gas and dust emission on ~50
pc scales. We find that the [CII] - SFR correlation holds even at these scales, although the relation
typically has a flatter slope than found at larger (~kpc) scales. While the Halpha emission in M31
is concentrated in the SFR regions, we find that a significant amount (~20-90%) of the [CII] emission
comes from outside star-forming regions, and that the total IR (TIR) emission has the highest diffuse
fraction of all SFR tracers. We find a weak correlation of the [CII]/TIR to dust color in each Field,
and find a large scale trend of increasing [CII]/TIR with galactocentric radius. The differences
in the relative diffuse fractions of [CII], Halpha and IR tracers are likely caused by a combination
of energetic photon leakage from HII regions and heating by the diffuse radiation field arising
from older (B-star) stellar populations. However, we find that by averaging our measurements over
~kpc scales, these effects are minimized, and the relation between [CII] and SFR found in other nearby
galaxy studies is retrieved.
