Opacity-driven shifts of the apparent VLBI core position with frequency (the "core shift" effect)
is a promising tool to probe physical conditions in the innermost parts of radio jets in active galactic
nuclei. We present the first detailed investigation of the core shift effect in the brightest gamma-ray
blazar 3C 454.3 using multiple techniques: direct core position and size measurements with simultaneous
4.6--43 GHz VLBA observations and a time lag analysis of 4.8--37 GHz radio lightcurves obtained
with the 26 m UMRAO, 22 m CrAO, and 14 m Metsahovi radio telescopes in 2007--2009. The remarkable agreement
found between the results obtained with different techniques supports the standard Konigl model
as an appropriate description of jet physics in the VLBI core region. The distance of the core from
the jet origin r_c(f), the core size W(f), and the lightcurve time lag \Delta T(f) all depend on the
observing frequency f as r_c(f) ~ W(f) ~ \Delta T(f) ~ f^-1/k. We find the value of the coefficient
to be in the range k=0.6--0.8, consistent with the synchrotron self-absorption being the dominating
opacity mechanism in the jet. No difference between the frequency dependence of r_c(f) and W(f)
is observed, which suggests that the external pressure is not significant for the jet geometry in
the cm-band core region of 3C 454.3. Assuming equipartition, we estimate the magnetic field strength
at 1 pc from the jet origin to be B_1 ~ 0.4 G, and it scales with distance r as B = 0.4(r/r_1)^-0.8 G. The
total kinetic power of the jet, assuming that it is composed of pair plasma, is about 10^44 ergs/s.
An electron/proton jet would be about two thousand times more powerful.
