The intracluster medium of galaxy clusters is permeated by {\mu}G magnetic fields. Observations
with current and future facilities have the potential to illuminate the role of these magnetic fields
play in the astrophysical processes of galaxy clusters. To obtain a greater understanding of how
the initial seed fields evolve to the magnetic fields in the intracluster medium requires magnetohydrodynamic
simulations. We critically assess the current Smoothed Particle Magneto-Hydrodynamics (SPMHD)
schemes, especially highlighting the impact of a hyperbolic divergence cleaning scheme and artificial
resistivity switch on the magnetic field evolution in cosmological simulations of the formation
of a galaxy cluster using the N-body/SPMHD code gcmhd++. The impact and performance of the cleaning
scheme and two different schemes for the artificial resistivity switch is demonstrated via idealized
test cases and cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that the hyperbolic divergence cleaning
scheme is effective at suppressing the growth of the numerical divergence error of the magnetic
field and should be applied to any SPMHD simulation. Although the artificial resistivity is important
in the strong field regime, it can suppress the growth of the magnetic field in the weak field regime,
such as galaxy clusters. With sufficient resolution, simulations with divergence cleaning can
reproduce observed magnetic fields. We conclude that the cleaning scheme alone is sufficient for
galaxy cluster simulations, but our results indicate that the SPMHD scheme must be carefully chosen
depending on the regime of the magnetic field.
