The relationship between galaxies and the state/chemical enrichment of the warm-hot intergalactic
medium (WHIM) expected to dominate the baryon budget at low-z provides sensitive constraints on
structure formation and galaxy evolution models. We present a deep redshift survey in the field
of 1ES1553+113, a blazar with a unique combination of UV+X-ray spectra for surveys of the circum-/intergalactic
medium (CGM/IGM). Nicastro et al. 2018 reported the detection of two O VII WHIM absorbers at $z=0.4339$
and $0.3551$ in its spectrum, suggesting that the WHIM is metal-rich and sufficient to close the
missing baryons problem. Our survey indicates that the blazar is a member of a $z=0.433$ group and
that the higher-$z$ O VII candidate arises from its intragroup medium. The resulting bias precludes
its use in baryon censuses. The $z=0.3551$ candidate occurs in an isolated environment 630 kpc from
the nearest galaxy (with stellar mass $\log M_*/M_\odot \approx 9.7$) which we show is unexpected
for the WHIM. Finally, we characterize the galactic environments of broad H I Ly$\alpha$ absorbers
(Doppler widths of $b=40-80$ \kms; $T\lesssim4\times10^5$ K) which provide metallicity independent
WHIM probes. On average, broad Ly$\alpha$, absorbers are ${\approx}2\times$ closer to the nearest
luminous ($L>0.25 L_*$) galaxy (700 kpc) than narrow ($b<30$ \kms; $T\lesssim4\times10^5$ K)
ones (1300 kpc) but ${\approx}2\times$ further than O\,VI absorbers (350 kpc). These observations
suggest that gravitational collapse heats portions of the IGM to form the WHIM but with feedback
that does not enrich the IGM far beyond galaxy/group halos to levels currently observable in UV/X-ray
metal lines.
