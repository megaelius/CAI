The physical mechanisms that produce the slow solar wind are still highly debated. Parker Solar
Probe's (PSP's) second solar encounter provided a new opportunity to relate in situ measurements
of the nascent slow solar wind with white-light images of streamer flows. We exploit data taken by
the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO)
and the Wide Imager on Solar Probe to reveal for the first time a close link between imaged streamer
flows and the high-density plasma measured by the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP)
experiment. We identify different types of slow winds measured by PSP that we relate to the spacecraft's
magnetic connectivity (or not) to streamer flows. SWEAP measured high-density and highly variable
plasma when PSP was well connected to streamers but more tenuous wind with much weaker density variations
when it exited streamer flows. STEREO imaging of the release and propagation of small transients
from the Sun to PSP reveals that the spacecraft was continually impacted by the southern edge of streamer
transients. The impact of specific density structures is marked by a higher occurrence of magnetic
field reversals measured by the FIELDS magnetometers. Magnetic reversals originating from the
streamers are associated with larger density variations compared with reversals originating
outside streamers. We tentatively interpret these findings in terms of magnetic reconnection
between open magnetic fields and coronal loops with different properties, providing support for
the formation of a subset of the slow wind by magnetic reconnection.
