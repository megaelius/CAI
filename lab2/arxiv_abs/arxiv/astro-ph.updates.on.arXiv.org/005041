This paper presents the Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue of Non-thermal (i.e., synchrotron-dominated)
Sources (PMNT) observed between 30 and 857 GHz by ESA's Planck mission. This catalogue has been constructed
by selecting objects detected in the full mission all-sky temperature maps at 30 and 143 GHz, with
a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)>3 in at least one of the two channels after filtering with a particular
Mexican-hat wavelet. As a result, 29400 source candidates have been selected. Then, a multi-frequency
analysis has been performed using the Matrix Filters methodology at the position of these objects,
and flux densities and errors have been calculated for all of them in the nine Planck channels. This
catalogue has been built using a different methodology than the one adopted for the previous Planck
Catalogues of Compact Sources (PCCS and PCCS2), although the initial detection is done with the
same pipeline that was used to produce them. The present catalogue is the first unbiased, full-sky
catalogue of synchrotron-dominated sources published at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths
and constitutes a powerful database for statistical studies of non-thermal extragalactic sources,
whose emission is dominated by the central active galactic nucleus. Together with the full multi-frequency
catalogue, we also define the so-called Bright Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue of Non-thermal
Sources (B-PMNT), where only those objects with a S/N>4 at both 30 and 143 GHz have been selected.
In this catalogue 1146 compact sources are detected outside the adopted Planck GAL070 mask. We also
flag the so-called high-significance subsample (HS-PMNT), a subset of 151 sources that are detected
with S/N>4 in all nine Planck channels, out of which 75 are found outside the Planck mask adopted here.
The remaining 76 sources inside the Galactic mask are very likely Galactic objects.
