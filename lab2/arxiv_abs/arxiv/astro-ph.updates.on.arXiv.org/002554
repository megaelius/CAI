In light of the tension in cosmological constraints reported by the Planck team between their SZ-selected
cluster counts and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropies, we compare the
Planck cluster mass estimates with robust, weak-lensing mass measurements from the Weighing the
Giants (WtG) project. For the 22 clusters in common between the Planck cosmology sample and WtG,
we find an overall mass ratio of $\left< M_{Planck}/M_{\rm WtG} \right> = 0.688 \pm 0.072$.
Extending the sample to clusters not used in the Planck cosmology analysis yields a consistent value
of $\left< M_{Planck}/M_{\rm WtG} \right> = 0.698 \pm 0.062$ from 38 clusters in common.
Identifying the weak-lensing masses as proxies for the true cluster mass (on average), these ratios
are $\sim 1.6\sigma$ lower than the default mass bias of 0.8 assumed in the Planck cluster analysis.
Adopting the WtG weak-lensing-based mass calibration would substantially reduce the tension
found between the Planck cluster count cosmology results and those from CMB temperature anisotropies,
thereby dispensing of the need for "new physics" such as uncomfortably large neutrino masses (in
the context of the measured Planck temperature anisotropies and other data). We also find modest
evidence (at 95 per cent confidence) for a mass dependence of the calibration ratio and discuss its
potential origin in light of systematic uncertainties in the temperature calibration of the X-ray
measurements used to calibrate the Planck cluster masses. Our results exemplify the critical role
that robust absolute mass calibration plays in cluster cosmology, and the invaluable role of accurate
weak-lensing mass measurements in this regard.
