Using the latest sample of 48 spiral galaxies having a directly-measured supermassive black hole
mass, $M_{BH}$, we determine how the maximum disk rotational velocity, $v_{max}$ (and the implied
dark matter halo mass, $M_{DM}$), correlates with $M_{BH}$, central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$),
and spiral arm pitch angle ($\phi$). We find that $M_{BH}\propto v_{max}^{10.58\pm1.35}\propto
M_{DM}^{4.34\pm0.65}$, significantly steeper than previously reported, and with a total root
mean square scatter ($0.63\,{\rm dex}$) equal to that about the $M_{BH}$-$\sigma_0$ relation
for spiral galaxies - in stark antithesis with claims that $M_{BH}$ does not correlate with disks.
Moreover, this $M_{BH}$-$v_{max}$ relation is consistent with the unification of the Tully-Fisher
relation (involving the total stellar mass, $M_{\rm *,tot}$) and the steep $M_{BH}\propto M_{\rm
*,tot}^{3.05\pm0.53}$ relation observed in spiral galaxies. We also find that $\sigma_0\propto
v_{max}^{1.54\pm0.25}\propto M_{DM}^{0.63\pm0.11}$, consistent with past studies connecting
stellar bulges (with $\sigma_0\gtrsim100\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$), dark matter halos, and a non-constant
$v_{max}/\sigma_0$ ratio. Finally, we report that $\tan|\phi|\propto(-1.17\pm0.19)\log{v_{max}}\propto(-0.48\pm0.09)\log
M_{DM}$, providing a novel formulation between the geometry (i.e., the logarithmic spiral arm
pitch angle) and kinematics of spiral galaxy disks. While the $v_{max}$-$\phi$ relation may facilitate
distance estimations to face-on spiral galaxies, via the Tully-Fisher relation and using $\phi$
as a proxy for $v_{max}$, the $M_{DM}$-$\phi$ relation provides a path for determining dark matter
halo masses from imaging data alone. Furthermore, based on a spiral galaxy sample size which is double
that used previously, the self-consistent relations presented here provide dramatically revised
constraints for theory and simulations.
