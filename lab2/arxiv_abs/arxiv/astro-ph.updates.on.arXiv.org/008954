Space-borne missions CoRoT and Kepler have provided a rich harvest of high-quality photometric
data for solar-like pulsators. It is now possible to measure damping rates for hundreds of main-sequence
and thousands of red-giant. However, among the seismic parameters, mode damping rates remain poorly
understood and thus barely used for inferring the physical properties of stars. Previous approaches
to model mode damping rates were based on mixing-length theory or a Reynolds-stress approach to
model turbulent convection. While able to grasp the main physics of the problem, those approaches
are of little help to provide quantitative estimates as well as a definitive answer on the relative
contribution of each physical mechanism. Our aim is thus to assess the ability of 3D hydrodynamical
simulations to infer the physical mechanisms responsible for damping of solar-like oscillations.
To this end, a solar high-spatial resolution and long-duration hydrodynamical 3D simulation computed
with the ANTARES code allows probing the coupling between turbulent convection and the normal modes
of the simulated box. Indeed, normal modes of the simulation experience realistic driving and damping
in the super-adiabatic layers of the simulation. Therefore, investigating the properties of the
normal modes in the simulation provides a unique insight into the mode physics. We demonstrate that
such an approach provides constraints on the solar damping rates and is able to disentangle the relative
contribution related to the perturbation of the turbulent pressure, the gas pressure, the radiative
flux, and the convective flux contributions. Finally, we conclude that using the normal modes of
a 3D numerical simulation is possible and is potentially able to unveil the respective role of the
different physical mechanisms responsible for mode damping provided the time-duration of the
simulation is long enough.
