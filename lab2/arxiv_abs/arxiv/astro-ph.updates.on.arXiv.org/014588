We present new arcminute-resolution maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization
anisotropy from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, using data taken from 2013-2016 at 98 and 150 GHz.
The maps cover more than 17,000 deg$^2$, the deepest 600 deg$^2$ with noise levels below $10$ $\mu$K-arcmin.
We use the power spectrum derived from almost 6,000 deg$^2$ of these maps to constrain cosmology.
The ACT data enable a measurement of the angular scale of features in both the divergence-like polarization
and the temperature anisotropy, tracing both the velocity and density at last-scattering. From
these one can derive the distance to the last-scattering surface and thus infer the local expansion
rate, $H_0$. By combining ACT data with large-scale information from WMAP we measure $H_0=67.6\pm
1.1$ km/s/Mpc, at 68% confidence, in excellent agreement with the independently-measured Planck
satellite estimate (from ACT alone we find $H_0=67.9\pm 1.5$ km/s/Mpc). The $\Lambda$CDM model
provides a good fit to the ACT data, and we find no evidence for deviations: both the spatial curvature,
and the departure from the standard lensing signal in the spectrum, are zero to within 1$\sigma$;
the number of relativistic species, the primordial Helium fraction, and the running of the spectral
index are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions to within 1.5-2$\sigma$. We compare ACT, WMAP,
and Planck at the parameter level and find good consistency; we investigate how the constraints
on the correlated spectral index and baryon density parameters readjust when adding CMB large-scale
information that ACT does not measure. The DR4 products presented here will be publicly released
on the NASA Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis.
