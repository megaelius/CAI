We study the evolution of a mini-filament eruption in a quiet region at the center of the solar disk
and its impact on the ambient atmosphere. We used high-spectral resolution imaging spectroscopy
in H$\alpha$ acquired by the echelle spectrograph of the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT), Tenerife,
Spain, photospheric magnetic field observations from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI),
and UV/EUV imaging from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). The H$\alpha$ line profiles were noise-stripped using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and then inverted to produce physical and cloud model parameter maps. The minifilament formed between
small-scale, opposite-polarity magnetic features through a series of small reconnection events
and it erupted within an hour after its appearance in H$\alpha$. Its development and eruption exhibited
similarities with large-scale erupting filaments, indicating the action of common mechanisms.
Its eruption took place in two phases, namely a slow rise and a fast expansion, and it produced a coronal
dimming, before the minifilament disappeared. During its eruption we detected a complicated velocity
pattern, indicative of a twisted, thread-like structure. Part of its material returned to the chromosphere
producing observable effects on nearby low-lying magnetic structures. Cloud model analysis showed
that the minifilament was initially similar to other chromospheric fine structures, in terms of
optical depth, source function and Doppler width, but it resembled a large-scale filament on its
course to eruption. High spectral resolution observations of the chromosphere can provide a wealth
of information regarding the dynamics and properties of minifilaments and their interactions
with the surrounding atmosphere.
