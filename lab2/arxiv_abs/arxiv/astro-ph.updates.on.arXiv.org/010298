Over 2,000 stars were observed for one month with a high enough cadence in order to look for acoustic
modes during the survey phase of the Kepler mission. Solar-like oscillations have been detected
in about 540 stars. The question of why no oscillations were detected in the remaining stars is still
open. Previous works explained the non-detection of modes with the high level of magnetic activity.
However, the studied stars contained some classical pulsators and red giants that could have biased
the results. In this work, we revisit this analysis on a cleaner sample of 1,014 main-sequence solar-like
stars. First we compute the predicted amplitude of the modes. We find that the stars with detected
modes have an amplitude to noise ratio larger than 0.94. We measure reliable rotation periods and
the associated photometric magnetic index for 684 stars and in particular for 323 stars where the
mode amplitude is predicted to be high enough to be detected. We find that among these 323 stars 32%
have a magnetic activity level larger than the Sun at maximum activity, explaining the non-detection
of p modes. Interestingly, magnetic activity cannot be the primary reason responsible for the absence
of detectable modes in the remaining 68% of the stars without p modes detected and with reliable rotation
periods. Thus, we investigate metallicity, inclination angle, and binarity as possible causes
of low mode amplitudes. Using spectroscopic observations for a subsample, we find that a low metallicity
could be the reason for suppressed modes. No clear correlation with binarity nor inclination is
found. We also derive the lower limit for our photometric activity index (of 20-30 ppm) below which
rotation and magnetic activity are not detected. Finally with our analysis we conclude that stars
with a photometric activity index larger than 2,000 ppm have 98.3% probability of not having oscillations
detected.
