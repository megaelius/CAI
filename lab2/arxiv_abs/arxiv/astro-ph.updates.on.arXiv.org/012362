While it is clear that Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are the result of thermonuclear explosions in C/O
white dwarfs (WDs), a great deal remains uncertain about the binary companion that facilitates
the explosive disruption of the WD. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of a unique, and large,
data set of 127 SNe Ia with exquisite coverage by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). High-cadence
(6 observations per night) ZTF observations allow us to measure the SN rise time and examine its initial
evolution. We develop a Bayesian framework to model the early rise as a power-law in time, which enables
the inclusion of priors in our model. For a volume-limited subset of normal SNe Ia, we find the mean
power-law index is consistent with 2 in the $r_\mathrm{ztf}$-band ($\alpha_r = 2.01\pm0.02$),
as expected in the expanding fireball model. There are, however, individual SNe that are clearly
inconsistent with $\alpha_r=2$. We estimate a mean rise time of 18.5$\,$d (with a range extending
from $\sim$15$-$22$\,$d), though this is subject to the adopted prior. We identify an important,
previously unknown, bias whereby the rise times for higher redshift SNe within a flux-limited survey
are systematically underestimated. This effect can be partially alleviated if the power-law index
is fixed to $\alpha=2$, in which case we estimate a mean rise time of 21.0$\,$d (with a range from $\sim$18$-$23$\,$d).
The sample includes a handful or rare and peculiar SNe Ia. Finally, we conclude with a discussion
of lessons learned from the ZTF sample that can eventually be applied to Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
observations.
