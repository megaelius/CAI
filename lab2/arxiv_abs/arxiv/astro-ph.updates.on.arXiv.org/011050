Redshift-space clustering distortions provide one of the most powerful probes to test the gravity
theory on the largest cosmological scales. In this paper we perform a systematic validation study
of the state-of-the-art statistical methods currently used to constrain the linear growth rate
from redshift-space distortions in the galaxy two-point correlation function. The numerical
pipelines are tested on mock halo catalogues extracted from large N-body simulations of the standard
cosmological framework, in the redshift range $0.5\lesssim z\lesssim2$. We consider both the
monopole and quadrupole multipole moments of the redshift-space two-point correlation function,
as well as the radial and transverse clustering wedges, in the comoving scale range $10<r[$\Mpch$]<55$.
Moreover, we investigate the impact of redshift measurement errors, up to $\delta z \sim 0.5\%$,
which introduce spurious clustering anisotropies. We quantify the systematic uncertainties
on the growth rate and linear bias measurements due to the assumptions in the redshift-space distortion
model. Considering both the dispersion model and two widely-used models based on perturbation
theory, that is the Scoccimarro model and the TNS model, we find that the linear growth rate is underestimated
by about $5-10\%$ at $z<1$, while limiting the analysis at larger scales, $r>30$ \Mpch, the discrepancy
is reduced below $5\%$. At higher redshifts, we find instead an overall good agreement between measurements
and model predictions. The TNS model is the one which performs better, with growth rate uncertainties
below about $3\%$. The effect of redshift errors is degenerate with the one of small-scale random
motions, and can be marginalised over in the statistical analysis, not introducing any statistically
significant bias in the linear growth constraints, especially at $z\geq1$.
