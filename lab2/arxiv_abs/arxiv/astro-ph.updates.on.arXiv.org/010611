Context. Supersonic disordered flows accompany the formation and evolution of MCs. It has been
argued that turbulence can support against gravitational collapse and form hierarchical sub-structures.
Aims. We study the time evolution of simulated MCs to investigate: What physical process dominates
the driving of turbulent flows? How can these flows be characterised? Do the simulated flows agree
with observations? Methods. We analyse three MCs that have formed self-consistently within kpc-scale
numerical simulations of the ISM. The simulated ISM evolves under the influence of physical processes
including self-gravity, stratification, magnetic fields, supernova-driven turbulence, and
radiative heating and cooling. We characterise the flows using VSFs with/out density weighting
or a density cutoff, and computed in one or three dimensions. Results. In regions with sufficient
resolution, the density-weighted VSFs initially appear to follow the expectations for uniform
turbulence consistent with Larson's size-velocity relationship. SN blast wave impacts produce
short-lived coherent motions at large scales, increasing the scaling exponents for a crossing
time. Gravitational contraction drives small-scale motions, producing scaling coefficients
that drop or even turn negative as small scales become dominant. Conclusions. We conclude that two
different effects coincidentally reproduce Larson's size velocity relationship. Initially,
uniform turbulence dominates, so the energy cascade produces VSFs consistent with Larson's relationship.
Later, contraction dominates, the density-weighted VSFs become much shallower or even inverted,
but the relationship of the global average velocity dispersion of the MCs to their radius follows
Larson's relationship, reflecting virial equilibrium or free-fall collapse. The injection of
energy by shocks is visible in the VSFs, but decays within a crossing time.
