We estimate the mass of the inner ($<20$ kpc) Milky Way and the axis ratio of its dark matter halo using
globular clusters as tracers. At the same time, we constrain the phase-space distribution of the
globular cluster system. We use the Gaia DR2 catalogue of 75 globular clusters' proper motions and
recent measurements of the proper motions of another 20 distant clusters obtained with the Hubble
Space Telescope. We describe the globular cluster system with a 2-component distribution function
(DF), with a flat, rotating disc and a rounder, more extended halo. While fixing the Milky Way's disc
and bulge, we let the mass and shape of the dark matter halo and we fit these two parameters, together
with other six describing the DF, with a Bayesian method. We find the mass of the Galaxy within 20 kpc
to be $M(<20{\,\rm kpc})=1.91^{+0.18}_{-0.17} \times 10^{11} M_\odot$, of which $M_{\rm DM}(<20{\,\rm
kpc})=1.37^{+0.18}_{-0.17}\times 10^{11}M_\odot$ is in dark matter, and the density axis ratio
of the dark matter halo to be $q=1.30 \pm 0.25$. This implies a virial mass $M_{\rm via} = 1.3 \pm 0.3
\times 10^{12} M_\odot$. Our analysis rules out oblate ($q<0.8$) and strongly prolate halos ($q>1.9$)
with 99\% probability. Our preferred model reproduces well the observed phase-space distribution
of globular clusters and has a disc component that closely resembles that of the Galactic thick disc.
The halo component follows a power-law density profile $\rho \propto r^{-3.3}$, has a mean rotational
velocity of $V_{\rm rot}\simeq -14\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ at 20 kpc, and has a mildly radially biased
velocity distribution ($\beta\simeq 0.2 \pm 0.07$, fairly constant outside 15 kpc). We also find
that our distinction between disc and halo clusters resembles, although not fully, the observed
distinction in metal-rich ([Fe/H]$>-0.8$) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\leq-0.8$) cluster populations.
