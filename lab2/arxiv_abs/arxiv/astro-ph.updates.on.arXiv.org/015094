The propagation of radio waves from distant compact radio sources through turbulent interstellar
plasma in our Galaxy causes these sources to twinkle, a phenomenon called interstellar scintillation.
Such scintillations are a unique probe of the micro-arcsecond structure of radio sources as well
as of the sub-AU-scale structure of the Galactic interstellar medium. Weak scintillations (i.e.
an intensity modulation of a few percent) on timescales of a few days or longer are commonly seen at
centimetre wavelengths and are thought to result from the line-of-sight integrated turbulence
in the interstellar plasma of the Milky Way. So far, only three sources were known that show more extreme
variations, with modulations at the level of some dozen percent on timescales shorter than an hour.
This requires propagation through nearby (d <~10 pc) anomalously dense (n_e ~10^2 cm^-3) plasma
clouds. Here we report the discovery with Apertif of a source (J1402+5347) showing extreme (~50%)
and rapid variations on a timescale of just 6.5 minutes in the decimetre band (1.4 GHz). The spatial
scintillation pattern is highly anisotropic, with a semi-minor axis of about 20,000 km. The canonical
theory of refractive scintillation constrains the scattering plasma to be within the Oort cloud.
The sightline to J1402+5347, however, passes unusually close to the B3 star Alkaid (eta UMa) at a
distance of 32 pc. If the scintillations are associated with Alkaid, then the angular size of J1402+5347
along the minor axis of the scintels must be smaller than ~10 micro arcsec yielding an apparent brightness
temperature for an isotropic source of >~ 10^ 14K. }
