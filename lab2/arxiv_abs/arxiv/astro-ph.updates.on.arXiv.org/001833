We have used optical observations of resolved stars from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury
(PHAT) to measure the recent (< 500 Myr) star formation histories (SFHs) of 33 FUV-bright regions
in M31. The region areas ranged from ~$10^4$ to $10^6$ pc$^2$, which allowed us to test the reliability
of FUV flux as a tracer of recent star formation on sub-kpc scales. The star formation rates (SFRs)
derived from the extinction-corrected observed FUV fluxes were, on average, consistent with the
100-Myr mean SFRs of the SFHs to within the 1$\sigma$ scatter. Overall, the scatter was larger than
the uncertainties in the SFRs and particularly evident among the smallest regions. The scatter
was consistent with an even combination of discrete sampling of the initial mass function and high
variability in the SFHs. This result demonstrates the importance of satisfying both the full-IMF
and the constant-SFR assumptions for obtaining precise SFR estimates from FUV flux. Assuming a
robust FUV extinction correction, we estimate that a factor of 2.5 uncertainty can be expected in
FUV-based SFRs for regions smaller than $10^5$ pc$^2$, or a few hundred pc. We also examined ages
and masses derived from UV flux under the common assumption that the regions are simple stellar populations
(SSPs). The SFHs showed that most of the regions are not SSPs, and the age and mass estimates were correspondingly
discrepant from the SFHs. For those regions with SSP-like SFHs, we found mean discrepancies of 10
Myr in age and a factor of 3 to 4 in mass. It was not possible to distinguish the SSP-like regions from
the others based on integrated FUV flux.
