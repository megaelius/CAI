Interferometric arrays seeking to measure the 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization must contend
with overwhelmingly bright emission from foreground sources. Accurate recovery of the 21 cm signal
will require precise calibration of the array, and several new avenues for calibration have been
pursued in recent years, including methods using redundancy in the antenna configuration. The
newly upgraded Phase II of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is the first interferometer that has
large numbers of redundant baselines while retaining good instantaneous UV-coverage. This array
therefore provides a unique opportunity to compare redundant calibration with sky-model based
algorithms. In this paper, we present the first results from comparing both calibration approaches
with MWA Phase II observations. For redundant calibration, we use the package OMNICAL, and produce
sky-based calibration solutions with the analysis package Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD).
There are three principal results. (1) We report the success of OMNICAL on observations of ORBComm
satellites, showing substantial agreement between redundant visibility measurements after
calibration. (2) We directly compare OMNICAL calibration solutions with those from FHD, and demonstrate
these two different calibration schemes give extremely similar results. (3) We explore improved
calibration by combining OMNICAL and FHD. We evaluate these combined methods using power spectrum
techniques developed for EoR analysis and find evidence for marginal improvements mitigating
artifacts in the power spectrum. These results are likely limited by signal-to-noise in the six
hours of data used, but suggest future directions for combining these two calibration schemes.
