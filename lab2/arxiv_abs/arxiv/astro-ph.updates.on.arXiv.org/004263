We measured the emission lines in the spaxel spectra of MaNGA galaxies in order to determine the abundance
distributions therein. It has been suggested that the strength of the low-ionization lines, R_2,
N_2, and S_2 may be increased (relative to Balmer lines) in (some) spaxel spectra of the MaNGA survey
due to a contribution of the radiation of the diffuse ionized gas. Consequently, the abundances
derived from the spaxel spectra through strong-line methods may suffer from large errors. We examined
this expectation by comparing the behaviour of the line intensities and the abundances estimated
through different calibrations for slit spectra of HII regions in nearby galaxies, for fibre spectra
from the SDSS, and for spaxel spectra of the MaNGA survey. We found that the S_2 strength is increased
significantly in the fibre and spaxel spectra. The mean enhancement changes with metallicity and
can be as large as a factor of 2. The mean distortion of R_2 and N_2 is less than a factor of 1.3. This suggests
that Kaufmann et al.'s demarcation line between AGNs and HII regions in the BPT diagram is a useful
criterion to reject spectra with significantly distorted strengths of the N_2 and R_2 lines. We
find that the three-dimensional R calibration, which uses the N_2 and R_2 lines, produces reliable
abundances in the MaNGA galaxies. The one-dimensional N2 calibration produces either reliable
or wrong abundances depending on whether excitation and N/O abundance ratio in the target region
(spaxel) are close to or differ from those parameters in the calibrating points located close to
the calibration relation. We then determined abundance distributions within the optical radii
in the discs of 47 MaNGA galaxies. The optical radii of the galaxies were estimated from the surface
brightness profiles constructed based on the MaNGA observations.
