Binary neutron star mergers are believed to be potential candidates to eject significant masses
with different velocities. Once this ejected material begins to be decelerated by a homogeneous
medium, a power-law distribution of electrons is cooled down by synchrotron radiation generating
a multiwavelength long-lived afterglow. Analytic and numerical methods illustrate that the outermost
spherical layer so-called merger shock-breakout material can be described with a kinetic energy
$\propto (\beta\Gamma)^{-\alpha_s}$ with $\alpha_s$ varying since 1.1(1.6) for $\beta\Gamma\gg$
1 up to 5.2(6.9) for $\beta\Gamma\ll$ 1 when the polytropic index is $n_p=3$(3/2). Considering
the material fraction moving towards the observer which dominates the observed emission, the kinetic
energy associated to it becomes much smaller $E\propto \Gamma^{-\delta}$, the bulk Lorentz factor
decays slower $\Gamma \propto t^{-\frac{3}{\delta+8}}$, the cooling spectral break evolves
as $\epsilon_c\propto t^{-\frac{2\delta+4}{\delta +8}}$ and the light curves in the fully adiabatic
regime that explains the multiwavelength observations is $F_\nu \propto t^{\frac{3\delta-6(p-1)}{\delta+8}}\,E_\gamma^{-\frac{p-1}{2}}$
with $\delta=\alpha_s+2$. As a particular case, we describe the X-ray, optical and radio light
curves and the spectral energy distribution at 15 and 110 days from the discovered gravitational-wave
transient GW170817 when the merger shock-breakout material viewed on axis moves with middle relativistic
velocities near-Newtonian phase $\Gamma\sim 3$ ($\alpha_s=4.2$ for $n_p=$3/2). It is shown that
the peak energy evolution in GBM data is consistent with the early evolution of the cooling spectral
break. Our model predicts that whereas the X-ray flux does not take long to vary its slope (from $\sim
0.8$ to $\sim 0.5$), optical and radio fluxes will keep increasing up to reach the Newtonian regime.
