The stellar birth environment can significantly shorten protoplanetary disc (PPD) lifetimes
due to the influence of stellar feedback mechanisms. The degree to which these mechanisms suppress
the time and mass available for planet formation is dependent on the local far-ultraviolet (FUV)
field strength, stellar density, and ISM properties. In this work, we present the first theoretical
framework quantifying the distribution of PPD dispersal time-scales as a function of parameters
that describe the galactic environment. We calculate the probability density function for FUV
flux and stellar density in the solar neighbourhood. In agreement with previous studies, we find
that external photoevaporation is the dominant environment-related factor influencing local
stellar populations after the embedded phase. Applying our general prescription to the Central
Molecular Zone of the Milky Way (i.e. the central ~250 pc), we predict that 90% of PPDs in the region
are destroyed within 1 Myr of the dispersal of the parent molecular cloud. Even in such dense environments,
we find that external photoevaporation is the dominant disc depletion mechanism over dynamical
encounters between stars. PPDs around low-mass stars are particularly sensitive to FUV-induced
mass loss, due to a shallower gravitational potential. For stars of mass ~1 $M_\odot$, the solar
neighbourhood lies at approximately the highest gas surface density for which PPD dispersal is
still relatively unaffected by external FUV photons, with a median PPD dispersal timescale of ~4
Myr. We highlight the key questions to be addressed to further contextualise the significance of
the local galactic environment for planet formation.
