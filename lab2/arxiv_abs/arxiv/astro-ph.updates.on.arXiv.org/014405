We study the projected spatial offset between the ultraviolet continuum and Ly$\alpha$ emission
for a sample of 65 lensed and unlensed galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (5<z<7), the first such
study at these redshifts, in order to understand the potential for these offsets to confuse estimates
of the Ly$\alpha$ properties of galaxies observed in slit spectroscopy. While we find that ~40%
of galaxies in our sample show significant projected spatial offsets ($|\Delta_{Ly\alpha-UV}|$),
we find a modest average offset of 0.61$\pm$0.08 kpc. A small fraction of our sample, ~10%, exhibits
offsets of 2-4 kpc, sizes that are larger than the effective radii of typical galaxies at these redshifts.
An internal comparison and a comparison to studies at lower redshift yielded no significant evidence
of evolution of $|\Delta_{Ly\alpha-UV}|$ with redshift. In our own sample, UV-bright galaxies
showed offsets a factor of three greater than their fainter counterparts, 0.89$\pm$0.18 vs. 0.27$\pm$0.05
kpc, respectively. We argue that offsets are likely not the result of merging processes, but are
rather due to anisotropic internal processes internal to the galaxies as a result of stellar feedback,
which facilitates Ly$\alpha$ fluorescence and/or backscattering from nearby or outflowing gas.
The reduction in the Ly$\alpha$ flux due to offset effects for various observational setups was
quantified through mock observations of simple simulations. It was found that the loss of Ly$\alpha$
photons for galaxies with average offsets is not, if corrected for, a limiting factor for all but
the narrowest slit widths (<0.4''). However, for the largest offsets, if such offsets are mostly
perpendicular to the slit major axis, slit losses were found to be extremely severe in cases where
slit widths of $\le$1'' were employed, such as those planned for James Webb Space Telescope/NIRSpec
observations. (abridged)
