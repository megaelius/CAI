Our aim was to directly detect the thermal emission of the putative exoring system responsible for
the complex deep transits observed in the light curve for the young Sco-Cen star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6
(V1400 Cen, hereafter J1407), confirming it as the occulter seen in May 2007, and to determine its
orbital parameters with respect to the star. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) to observe the field centred on J1407 in the 340 GHz (Band 7) continuum in order to determine
the flux and astrometric location of the ring system relative to the star. We used the VLT/NACO camera
to observe the J1407 system in March 2019 and to search for the central planetary mass object at thermal
infrared wavelengths. We detect no point source at the expected location of J1407, and derive an
upper limit $3\sigma$ level of $57.6~\mu\rm{Jy}$. There is a point source detected at an angular
separation consistent with the expected location for a free-floating ring system that occulted
J1407 in May 2007, with a flux of $89~\mu\rm{Jy}$ consistent with optically thin dust surrounding
a massive substellar companion. At 3.8 microns with the NACO camera, we detect the star J1407 but
no other additional point sources within 1.3 arcseconds of the star, with a lower bound on the sensitivity
of $6M_{Jup}$ at the location of the ALMA source, and down to $4M_{Jup}$ in the sky background limit.
The ALMA upper limit at the location of J1407 implies that a hypothesised bound ring system is composed
of dust smaller than $1\rm{~mm}$ in size, implying a young ring structure. The detected ALMA source
has multiple interpretations, including: (i) it is an unbound substellar object surrounded by
warm dust in Sco-Cen with an upper mass limit of $6M_{Jup}$, or (ii) it is a background galaxy.
