The main goal of this research is to determine the angular size and the atmospheric structures of
cool giant stars and to compare them with hydrostatic stellar model atmospheres, to estimate the
fundamental parameters, and to obtain a better understanding of the circumstellar environment.
We conducted spectro-interferometric observations of epsilon Oct, beta Peg, NU Pav, and psi Peg
in the near-infrared K band (2.13-2.47 microm), and gamma Hya (1.9-2.47 microm) with the VLTI/AMBER
instrument at medium spectral resolution. To obtain the fundamental parameters, we compared our
data with hydrostatic atmosphere models (PHOENIX). We estimated the Rosseland angular diameters
of epsilon Oct, beta Peg, NU Pav, psi Peg, and gamma Hya. Together with distances and bolometric fluxes,
we estimated radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities of our targets. In the beta Peg visibility,
we observed a molecular layer of CO with a size similar to that modeled with PHOENIX. However, there
is an additional slope in absorption starting around 2.3 microm. This slope is possibly due to a shell
of water that is not modeled with PHOENIX. The visibility of psi Peg shows a low increase in the CO bands,
compatible with the modeling of the PHOENIX model. The visibility data of the other sources show
no increase in molecular bands. The spectra and visibilities predicted by the PHOENIX atmospheres
agree with the spectra and the visibilities observed in our stars (except for beta Peg). This indicates
that the opacity of the molecular bands is adequately included in the model, and the atmospheres
of our targets have an extension similar to the modeled atmospheres. The atmosphere of beta Peg is
more extended than that predicted by the model. The targets are located close to the red limits of
the evolutionary tracks of the STAREVOL model.
