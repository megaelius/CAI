Camera lenses are increasingly used in wide-field astronomical surveys due to their high performance,
wide field-of-view (FOV) unreachable from traditional telescope optics, and modest cost. The
machining and assembly tolerances for commercially available optical systems cause a slight misalignment
(tilt) between the lens and CCD, resulting in PSF degradation. We have built an automated alignment
system (Robotilters) to solve this challenge, optimizing 4 degrees of freedom - 2 tilt axes, a separation
axis (the distance between the CCD and lens), and the lens focus (the built-in focus of the lens by
turning the lens focusing ring which moves the optical elements relative to one another) in a compact
and low-cost package. The Robotilters remove tilt and optimize focus at the sub 10 micron level,
are completely automated, take 2 hours to run, and remain stable for multiple years once aligned.
The Robotilters were built for the Evryscope telescope (a 780 MPix 22-camera array with an 8150 sq.deg.
field of view and continuous 2-minute cadence) designed to detect short timescale events across
extremely large sky areas simultaneously. Variance in quality across the image field, especially
the corners and edges compared to the center, is a significant challenge in wide-field astronomical
surveys like the Evryscope. The individual star PSFs (which typically extend only a few pixels)
are highly susceptible to slight increases in optical aberrations in this situation. The Robotilter
solution resulted in a limiting magnitude improvement of .5 mag in the center of the image and 1.0
mag in the corners for typical Evryscope cameras, with less distorted and smaller PSFs (half the
extent in the corners and edges in many cases). In this paper we describe the Robotilter mechanical
and software design, camera alignment results, long term stability, and image improvement.
