We present elemental abundance results from high resolution spectral analysis of three nitrogen-enhanced
barium stars. The analysis is based on spectra obtained with the FEROS attached to 1.52m telescope
at ESO, Chile. The spectral resolution is R~48000 and the spectral coverage spans from 3500-9000\AA\,.
For the objects HD 51959 and HD 88035, we present the first time abundance analyses results. Although
a few studies are available in literature on the object HD 121447, the results are significantly
different from each other. We have therefore carried out a detailed chemical composition study
for this object based on a high resolution spectrum with high S/N ratio, for a better understanding
of the origin of the abundance patterns observed in this star. Stellar atmospheric parameters,
the effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulence and metallicity of the stars are
determined from the LTE analysis using model atmospheres. The metallicity of HD 51959 and HD 88035
are found to be near-solar; they exhibit enhanced abundances of neutron-capture elements. HD 121447
is found to be moderately metal-poor with [Fe/H]=-0.65. While carbon is near-solar in the other
two objects, HD 121447 shows carbon enhancement at a level, [C/Fe]=0.82. Neutron-capture elements
are highly enhanced with [X/Fe]>2 (X: Ba, La, Pr, Nd, Sm) in this object. The alpha- and iron-peak
elements show abundances very similar to field giants with the same metallicity. From kinematic
analysis all the three objects are found to be members of thin disk population with a high probability
of 0.99, 0.99 and 0.92 for HD 51959, HD 88035 and HD 121447 respectively.
