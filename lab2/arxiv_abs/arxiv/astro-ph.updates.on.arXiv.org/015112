Exoplanet research is now target rich with a wide diversity of systems making it difficult for high
demand observatories to undertake follow up observations over extended periods of time. We investigate
the effectiveness of using 0.4m-class telescopes for monitoring transiting hot Jupiters and their
host stars. We consider two representative case studies: WASP-52b with 13 new transits, and HAT-P-23b
with 17 new transits and concurrent photometric monitoring covering 78 days. We present updated
system parameters and combine our new transit times with previously published results to calculate
new ephemerides for both systems. Our analysis of transit mid-times for WASP-52b results in a slight
preference for a quadratic ephemeris ($\Delta\chi_{\nu}^2 = 0.07$, $\Delta BIC = 1.53$ over a linear
ephemeris. We discuss the reality of this quadratic ephemeris indicating a period change of $ \delta
P / \delta t = -38.6\pm4{\rm ms~yr^{-1}}$ and consider possible causes. WASP-52 is known to be an
active star with previous publications reporting many spot crossing events, however no such events
are seen in our new photometry. Our analysis shows that WASP-52 is still active and that the latitude
of the spots has likely migrated away from the transit chord. We confirm the inflated nature and circular
orbit for HAT-P-23b. Our monitoring of HAT-P-23 reveals a periodicity of 7.015 days with an amplitude
of 0.011 mag which we interpret as the rotation period of HAT-P-23. The photometric and transit timing
precision achieved in the case studies shows that this class of telescope is capable of precise characterisation
and long-term monitoring of transiting hot Jupiters in support of dedicated ongoing and future
ground and space based observations.
