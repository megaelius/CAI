We found that the disk appearance is notably time-variable with spiral arms, dusty rings, and clumps,
constantly forming, evolving, and decaying. As a consequence, the total dust-to-gas mass ratio
is highly non-homogeneous throughout the disk extent, showing order-of-magnitude local deviations
from the canonical 1:100 value. Gravitationally bound clumps formed through gravitational fragmentation
have a velocity pattern that deviates notably from the Keplerian rotation. Small dust is efficiently
converted into grown dust in the clump interiors, reaching a maximum radius of several decimeters.
Concurrently, grown dust drifts towards the clump center forming a massive compact central condensation
(70-100 $M_\oplus$). We argue that protoplanets may form in the interiors of inward migrating clumps
before they disperse through the action of tidal torques. We foresee the formation of protoplanets
at orbital distances of several tens of au with initial masses of gas and dust in the protoplanetary
seed in the (0.25-1.6) $M_{\rm Jup}$ and (1.0-5.5) $M_\oplus$ limits, respectively. The final
masses of gas and dust in the protoplanets may however be much higher due to accretion from surrounding
massive metal-rich disks/envelopes. Dusty rings formed through tidal dispersal of inward-migrating
clumps may have a connection to ring-like structures found in youngest and massive protoplanetary
disks. Numerical disk models with a dust component that can follow the evolution of gravitationally
bound clumps through their collapse phase to the formation of protoplanets are needed to make firm
conclusions on the characteristics of planets forming through gravitational fragmentation.
