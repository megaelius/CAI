We present results of controlled N-body simulations of isolated mergers used to study the evolution
of disc galaxies in group environments, under the effect of both the global tidal field and close-encounters
between galaxies. We improve upon previous implementations by modelling all group members as multi-component
systems (dark matter and stars), and using a number of group members and a stellar mass distribution
consistent with recent observations. We examine the evolution of disc galaxies infalling from
the virial radius of the group halo, covering a parameter space of different disc inclinations,
initial orbital eccentricities, and the presence of a central bulge. We also explore the influence
of different number of group galaxies, initial orbital parameters, relative mass distribution
and total mass of the galaxy population. We find that close-range encounters between galaxies are
less frequent and less damaging to disc galaxies than originally expected, since they mostly occur
when group members have lost a significant fraction of their initial mass to tidal stripping. We
also find that group members mostly affect the disc galaxy indirectly by modifying their common
global tidal field. Different initial orbital parameters of group members introduce a significant
"scatter" in the evolution of general properties of disc galaxies around a "median" evolution that
is similar to when only the effect of the global tidal field is included. Close-encounters introduce
a high variability in the properties of disc galaxies, even slowing their evolution in some cases,
and could wash out correlations between galaxy properties and the group total mass. The combined
effect of the global tidal field and close-encounters appears to be inefficient at forming/enhancing
central stellar bulges. This implies that bulges of S0 galaxies should be mostly composed by young
stars. [Abridged]
