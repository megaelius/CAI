We present the results of Very Large Array NH$_{3}$ $(J,K)=(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ observations of the
HH 111/HH 121 protostellar system. HH 111, with a spectacular collimated optical jet, is one of the
most well-known Herbig-Haro objects. We report the detection of a new source (NH$_{3}-$S) in the
vicinity of HH 111/HH 121 ($\sim$0.03 pc from the HH 111 jet source) in two epochs of the ammonia observations.
This constitutes the first detection of this source, in a region which has been thoroughly covered
previously by both continuum and spectral line interferometric observations. We study the kinematic
and physical properties of HH 111 and the newly discovered NH$_{3}-$S. We also use HCO$^{+}$ and
HCN $(J=4-3)$ data obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array $^{13}$CO, $^{12}$CO, and C$^{18}$O $(J=2-1)$, N$_2$D$^{+}$ $(J=3-2)$, and $^{13}$CS
$(J=5-4)$ data to gain insight into the nature of NH$_{3}-$S. The chemical structure of NH$_3-$S
shows evidence for "selective freeze-out", an inherent characteristic of dense cold cores. The
inner part of NH$_3-$S shows subsonic non-thermal velocity dispersions indicating a "coherent
core", while they increase in the direction of the jets. Archival near- to far-infrared data show
no indication of any embedded source in NH$_3-$S. The properties of NH$_3-$S and its location in
the infrared dark cloud suggest that it is a starless core located in a turbulent medium with turbulence
induced by Herbig-Haro jets and associated outflows. More data is needed to fully understand the
physical and chemical properties of NH$_3-$S and if/how its evolution is affected by nearby jets.
