We observed the galaxy cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 with the Sardinia Radio Telescope to provide new
constraints on its spectral properties at high frequency. We conducted observations in three frequency
bands centred at 1.4 GHz, 6.6 GHz and 19 GHz, resulting in beam resolutions of 14$^{\prime}$, 2.9$^{\prime}$
and 1$^{\prime}$ respectively. These single-dish data were also combined with archival interferometric
observations at 1.4 and 1.7 GHz. From the combined images, we measured a flux density of ${\rm S_{1.4GHz}=(158.3\pm9.6)\,mJy}$
for the central radio halo and ${\rm S_{1.4GHz}=(126\pm8)\,mJy}$ and ${\rm S_{1.4GHz}=(11.7\pm0.7)\,mJy}$
for the northern and the southern relic respectively. After the spectral modelling of the discrete
sources, we measured at 6.6 GHz ${\rm S_{6.6GHz}=(17.1\pm1.2)\,mJy}$ and ${\rm S_{6.6GHz}=(0.6\pm0.3)\,mJy}$
for the northern and southern relic respectively. Assuming simple diffusive shock acceleration,
we interpret measurements of the northern relic with a continuous injection model represented
by a broken power-law. This yields an injection spectral index ${\rm \alpha_{inj}=0.7\pm0.1}$
and a Mach number ${\rm M=3.3\pm0.9}$, consistent with recent X-ray estimates. Unlike other studies
of the same object, no significant steepening of the relic radio emission is seen in data up to 8.35
GHz. By fitting the southern relic spectrum with a simple power-law (${\rm S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-\alpha}}$)
we obtained a spectral index ${\rm \alpha\approx1.9}$ corresponding to a Mach number (${\rm M\approx1.8}$)
in agreement with X-ray estimates. Finally, we evaluated the rotation measure of the northern relic
at 6.6 GHz. These results provide new insights on the magnetic structure of the relic, but further
observations are needed to clarify the nature of the observed Faraday rotation.
