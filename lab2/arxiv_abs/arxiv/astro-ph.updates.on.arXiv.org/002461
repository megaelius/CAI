We present the first 3-dimensional, fully compressible gas-dynamics simulations in $4\pi$ geometry
of He-shell flash convection with proton-rich fuel entrainment at the upper boundary. This work
is motivated by the insufficiently understood observed consequences of the H-ingestion flash
in post-AGB stars (Sakurai's object) and metal-poor AGB stars. Our investigation is focused on
the entrainment process at the top convection boundary and on the subsequent advection of H-rich
material into deeper layers, and we therefore ignore the burning of the proton-rich fuel in this
study. We find that, for our deep convection zone, coherent convective motions of near global scale
appear to dominate the flow. At the top boundary convective shear flows are stable against Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities. However, such shear instabilities are induced by the boundary-layer separation
in large-scale, opposing flows. This links the global nature of thick shell convection with the
entrainment process. We establish the quantitative dependence of the entrainment rate on grid
resolution. With our numerical technique simulations with $1024^3$ cells or more are required
to reach a numerical fidelity appropriate for this problem. However, only the result from the $1536^3$
simulation provides a clear indication that we approach convergence with regard to the entrainment
rate. Our results demonstrate that our method, which is described in detail, can provide quantitative
results related to entrainment and convective boundary mixing in deep stellar interior environments
with veryvstiff convective boundaries. For the representative case we study in detail, we find
an entrainment rate of $4.38 \pm 1.48 \times 10^{-13}M_\odot \mathrm{/s}$.
