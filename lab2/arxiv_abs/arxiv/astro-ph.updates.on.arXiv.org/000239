We show that direct detection and measurement of the vertically thickened parts of bars (so-called
"boxy" or "peanut-shaped" bulges) is possible not only for edge-on galaxies but also for galaxies
with moderate inclinations (i < 70 deg), and that examples are relatively common in the nearby
universe. Analysis of a sample of 78 nearby, moderately inclined (i < 65 deg) early-type (S0--Sb)
barred galaxies shows that the isophotal signature of the box/peanut can usually be detected for
inclinations as low as i ~ 40 deg -- and in exceptional cases down to i ~ 30 deg. In agreement with the
predictions from N-body simulations, the signature is most easily detectable when the bar's position
angle is within ~ 50 deg of the galaxy major axis; in particular, galaxies where the bar lies very close
to the minor axis do not show the signature clearly or at all. For galaxies with i = 40--65 deg and relative
angles < 45 deg, we find evidence for the signature ~ 2/3 of the time; the true frequency of box/peanut
structures in bars may be higher. Comparison with N-body models also allows us to link observed photometric
morphology with 3D physical structures, and thus estimate the relative sizes of box/peanut structures
and bars. For our local sample, we find that box/peanut structures range in radial size (measured
along the bar major axis) from 0.4--3.8 kpc (mean = 1.5 +/- 0.9 kpc) and span 0.26--0.58 of the bar length
(mean of 0.38 +/- 0.08). This is a clear observational confirmation that when bars thicken, it is
not the entire bar which does so, but only the inner part. This technique can also be used to identify
galaxies with bars which have not vertically thickened. We suggest that NGC 3049 and IC 676 may be
particularly good examples, and that the fraction of S0--Sb bars which lack box/peanut structures
is at least ~ 13%.
