The combination of different cosmological probes offers stringent tests of the $\Lambda$CDM model
and enhanced control of systematics. For this purpose, we present an extension of the lightcone
generator UFalcon first introduced in Sgier et al. 2019 (arXiv:1801.05745), enabling the simulation
of a self-consistent set of maps for different cosmological probes. Each realization is generated
from the same underlying simulated density field, and contains full-sky maps of different probes,
namely weak lensing shear, galaxy overdensity including RSD, CMB lensing, and CMB temperature
anisotropies from the ISW effect. The lightcone generation performed by UFalcon is parallelized
and based on the replication of a large periodic volume simulated with the GPU-accelerated $N$-Body
code PkdGrav3. The post-processing to construct the lightcones requires only a runtime of about
1 walltime-hour corresponding to about 100 CPU-hours. We use a randomization procedure to increase
the number of quasi-independent full-sky UFalcon map-realizations, which enables us to compute
an accurate multi-probe covariance matrix. Using this framework, we forecast cosmological parameter
constraints by performing a multi-probe likelihood analysis for a combination of simulated future
stage-IV-like surveys. We find that the inclusion of the cross-correlations between the probes
significantly increases the information gain in the parameter constraints. We also find that the
use of a non-Gaussian covariance matrix is increasingly important, as more probes and cross-correlation
power spectra are included. A version of the UFalcon package currently including weak gravitational
lensing is publicly available.
