A long-standing issue in the theory of low mass stars is the discrepancy between predicted and observed
radii and effective temperatures. In spite of the increasing availability of very precise radius
determinations from eclipsing binaries and interferometric measurements of radii of single stars,
there is no unanimous consensus on the extent (or even the existence) of the discrepancy and on its
connection with other stellar properties (e.g. metallicity, magnetic activity). We investigate
the radius discrepancy phenomenon using the best data currently available (accuracy about 5%).
We have constructed a grid of stellar models covering the entire range of low mass stars (0.1-1.25
M_sun) and various choices of the metallicity and of the mixing length parameter \alpha. We used
an improved version of the Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code (YREC), implementing surface
boundary conditions based on the most up-to-date PHOENIX atmosphere models. Our models are in good
agreement with others in the literature and improve and extend the low mass end of the Yale-Yonsei
isochrones. Our calculations include rotation-related quantities, such as moments of inertia
and convective turnover time scales, useful in studies of magnetic activity and rotational evolution
of solar-like stars. Consistently with previous works, we find that both binaries and single stars
have radii inflated by about 3% with respect to the theoretical models; among binaries, the components
of short orbital period systems are found to be the most deviant. We conclude that both binaries and
single stars are comparably affected by the radius discrepancy phenomenon.
