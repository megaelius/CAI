(Abridged) We use Herschel PACS observations at 70 and 160$\mu$m to probe the protoplanetary disks
around young stars in the CepOB2 clusters Tr37 and NGC7160 and to trace the small-scale cloud structure.
We detect 95 protoplanetary disks at 70$\mu$m, 41 at 160$\mu$m, and obtain upper limits for over
130 objects. The detection fraction at 70$\mu$m depends on the spectral type (88% for K4 or earlier,
17% for M3 or later stars) and on the disk type ($\sim$50% for full and pre-transitional disks, $\sim$35%
for transitional disks, no low-excess/depleted disks detected). Non-accreting disks are consistent
with significantly lower masses. Accreting transition and pre-transition disks have higher 70$\mu$m
excesses than full disks, suggestive of more massive, flared and/or thicker disks. Herschel data
also reveal several mini-clusters in Tr37, small, compact structures containing a few young stars
surrounded by nebulosity. Far-IR data are an excellent probe of the evolution of disks that are too
faint for submillimetre observations. We find a strong link between far-IR emission and accretion,
and between the inner and outer disk structure. Herschel confirms the dichotomy between accreting
and non-accreting transition disks. Substantial mass depletion and global evolution need to occur
to shut down accretion in a protoplanetary disk, even if the disk has inner holes. Disks likely follow
different evolutionary paths: Low disk masses do not imply opening inner holes, and having inner
holes does not require low disk masses. The mini-clusters reveal multi-episodic star formation
in Tr37. The long survival of mini-clusters suggest that they formed from the fragmentation of the
same core. Their various morphologies favour different formation/triggering mechanisms acting
within the same cluster. Herschel also unveils what could be the first heavy mass loss episode of
the O6.5 star HD206267.
