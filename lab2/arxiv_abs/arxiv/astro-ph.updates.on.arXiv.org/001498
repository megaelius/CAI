We present results of our time variability studies of Mg II and Al III absorption lines in a sample
of 22 Low Ionization Broad Absorption Line QSOs (LoBAL QSOs) at 0.2 <= zem <= 2.1 using the 2m
telescope at IUCAA Girawali Observatory over a time-scale of 10 days to 7.69 years in the QSO's rest
frame. Spectra are analysed in conjunction with photometric light curves from Catalina Real-Time
Transient Survey. Long time-scale (i.e >= 1 year) absorption line variability is seen in 8 cases
(36% systems) while only 4 of them (i.e 18% systems) show variability over short time-scales (i.e
< 1 year). We notice a tendency of highly variable LoBAL QSOs to have high ejection velocity, low
equivalent width and low redshift. The detection rate of variability in LoBAL QSOs showing Fe fine-structure
lines (FeLoBAL QSOs) is less than that seen in non-Fe LoBAL QSOs. Absorption line variability is
more frequently detected in QSOs having continuum dominated by Fe emission lines compared to rest
of the QSOs. Confirming these trends with a bigger sample will give vital clues for understanding
the physical distinction between different BAL QSO sub-classes. We correlate the absorption line
variability with various parameters derived from continuum light curves and find no clear correlation
between continuum flux and absorption line variabilities. However, sources with large absorption
line variability also show large variability in their light curves. We also see appearance/disappearance
of absorption components in 2 cases and clear indications for profile variations in 4 cases. The
observed variability can be best explained by a combination of process driven by continuum variations
and clouds transiting across the line of sight.
