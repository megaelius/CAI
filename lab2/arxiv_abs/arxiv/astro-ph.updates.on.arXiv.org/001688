Super-Alfv\'enic shock waves associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can produce radio
emission known as Type II bursts. In the absence of direct imaging, accurate estimates of coronal
electron densities, magnetic field strengths and Alfv\'en speeds are required in order to calculate
the kinematics of shocks. To date, 1D radial models have been used, but these are not appropriate
for shocks propagating in non-radial directions. Here, we study a coronal shock wave associated
with a CME and Type II radio burst using 2D electron density and Alfv\'en speed maps to determine the
locations that shocks are excited as the CME expands through the corona. Coronal density maps were
obtained from emission measures derived from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the
Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) and polarized brightness measurements from the Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Alfv\'en
speed maps were calculated using these density maps and magnetic field extrapolations from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI). The computed density and Alfv\'en speed maps were
then used to calculate the shock kinematics in non-radial directions. Using the kinematics of the
Type II burst and associated shock, we find our observations to be consistent with the formation
of a shock located at the CME flanks where the Alfv\'en speed has a local minimum. 1D density models
are not appropriate for shocks that propagate non-radially along the flanks of a CME. Rather, the
2D density, magnetic field and Alfv\'en speed maps described here give a more accurate method for
determining the fundamental properties of shocks and their relation to CMEs.
