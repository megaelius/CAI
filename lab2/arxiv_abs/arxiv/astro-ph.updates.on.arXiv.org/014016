Cold dark matter as the sum of different mass Primordial Black Holes (PBH) can explain a number of
unsolved astrophysical mysteries. Here I assume a broad PBH mass distribution providing the bulk
of the dark matter, consistent with all constraints and estimate the baryon accretion onto PBH contributing
to cosmic background radiations, mainly the correlation signal between the Cosmic X-ray and the
Cosmic infrared background fluctuations in deep Chandra and Spitzer surveys. I assume Bondi capture
and advection dominated disk accretion with reasonable baryon densities and effective relative
velocities between baryons and PBH, as well as appropriate accretion and radiation efficiencies,
and integrate over the PBH mass spectrum and cosmic time. The X-ray contribution is indeed consistent
with the residual X-ray background signal and the X-ray/infrared fluctuations. The flux peaks
at z~17-30, consistent with constraints requiring the signal to come from high redshifts. The PBH
contribution to the infrared background fluctuations is only about 1%. Magnetic fields are an essential
ingredient in the Bondi capture process, and PBH can play a role in amplifying early seed fields and
maintaining them until the galactic dynamo processes set in. The contribution of the assumed PBH
population to the re-ionization history of the universe does not conflict with the Planck ionization
limits. X-ray heating from PBH can provide a contribution to the entropy floor in groups of galaxies.
The tantalizing EDGES redshifted 21-cm absorption line feature can be connected to the radio contribution
to the cosmic background radiation. Finally, the number of intermediate-mass black holes and the
diffuse X-ray emission in the Galactic Center are consistent with the assumed PBH dark matter. Some
of the discrete sources in the deepest Chandra observations of the Galactic Ridge could indeed be
accreting PBH.
