The (re)ionisation of hydrogen in the early universe has a profound effect on the formation of the
first galaxies: by raising the gas temperature and pressure, it prevents gas from cooling into small
haloes thus affecting the abundance of present-day small galaxies. Using the Galform semi-analytic
model of galaxy formation, we show that two key aspects of the reionisation process -- when reionisation
takes place and the characteristic scale below which it suppresses galaxy formation -- are imprinted
in the luminosity function of dwarf galaxies. We focus on the luminosity function of satellites
of galaxies like the Milky Way and the LMC, which is easier to measure than the luminosity function
of the dwarf population as a whole. Our results show that the details of these two characteristic
properties of reionisation determine the shape of the luminosity distribution of satellites in
a unique way, and is largely independent of the other details of the galaxy formation model. Our models
generically predict a bimodality in the distribution of satellites as a function of luminosity:
a population of faint satellites and population of bright satellites separated by a 'valley' forged
by reionisation. We show that this bimodal distribution is present at high statistical significance
in the combined satellite luminosity function of the Milky Way and M31. We make predictions for the
expected number of satellites around LMC-mass dwarfs where the bimodality may also be measurable
in future observational programmes. Our preferred model predicts a total of $26 \pm 10$ (68 per cent
confidence) satellites brighter than ${\rm M}_V=0$ in LMC-mass systems.
