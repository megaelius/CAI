Taking the 32 storm sudden commencements (SSCs) listed by ISGI during 2002 as a starting point, we
performed a multi-criterion analysis based on observations (propagation time, velocity comparisons,
sense of the magnetic field rotation, radio waves) to associate them with solar sources. We identified
their effects in the interplanetary medium, and looked at the response of the terrestrial ionized
and neutral environment. We find that 28 SSCs can be related to 44 coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
15 with a unique CME and 13 with a series of multiple CMEs, among which 19 involved halo CMEs; 12 of the
19 fastest CMEs with speeds greater than 1000 km/s are halo CMEs. The probability for an SSC to occur
is 75% if the CME is a halo CME. The complex interactions between two CMEs and the modification of their
trajectories have been examined using joint white-light and multiple-wavelength radio observations.
The solar-wind structures at L1 after the shocks leading the 32 SSCs are 12 magnetic clouds (MCs),
6 interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) without an MC structure, 4 miscellaneous structures, which cannot
unambiguously be classified as ICMEs, 5 corotating or stream interaction regions (CIRs/SIRs),
and 4 isolated shock events; note than one CIR caused two SSCs. The 11 MCs listed in 3 or more MC catalogs
covering the year 2002 are associated with SSCs. For the 3 most intense geomagnetic storms related
to MCs, we note 2 sudden increases of the Dst, at the arrival of the sheath and the arrival of the MC itself.
The most geoeffective events are MCs, since 92% of them trigger moderate or intense storms, followed
by ICMEs (33%). At best, CIRs/SIRs only cause weak storms. We show that these geoeffective events
(ICMEs or MCs) trigger or reinforce terrestrial radiowave activity in the magnetosphere, an enhanced
convection in the ionosphere, and a stronger response in the thermosphere.
