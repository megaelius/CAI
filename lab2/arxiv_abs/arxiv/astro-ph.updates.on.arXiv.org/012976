Alfv\'en-wave-driven 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models, which are increasingly used to predict
stellar wind properties, contain unconstrained parameters and rely on low-resolution stellar
magnetograms. We explore the effects of the input Alfv\'en wave energy flux and the surface magnetogram
on the wind properties predicted by the Alfv\'en Wave Solar Model (AWSoM). We lowered the resolution
of two solar magnetograms during solar cycle maximum and minimum using spherical harmonic decomposition.
The Alfv\'en wave energy was altered based on non-thermal velocities determined from a far ultraviolet
(FUV) spectrum of the solar twin 18 Sco. Additionally, low-resolution magnetograms of three solar
analogues were obtained using Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI). Finally, the simulated wind properties
were compared to Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) observations. AWSoM simulations using well
constrained input parameters taken from solar observations can reproduce the observed solar wind
mass and angular momentum loss rates. The resolution of the magnetogram has a small impact on the
wind properties and only during cycle maximum. However, variation in Alfv\'en wave energy influences
the wind properties irrespective of the solar cycle activity level. Furthermore, solar wind simulations
carried out using the low-resolution magnetogram of the three stars instead of the solar magnetogram
could lead to an order of a magnitude difference in the simulated wind properties. The choice in Alfv\'en
energy has a stronger influence on the wind output compared to the magnetogram resolution. The influence
could be even stronger for stars whose input boundary conditions are not as well constrained as those
of the Sun. Unsurprisingly, replacing the solar magnetogram with a stellar magnetogram could lead
to completely inaccurate solar wind properties, and should be avoided in solar and stellar wind
simulations.
