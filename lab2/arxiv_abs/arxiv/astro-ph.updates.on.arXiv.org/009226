Aims. In this letter, we calculate for the first time the full transonic hydrodynamic escape of an
Earth-like atmosphere. We consider the case of an Earth-mass planet with an atmospheric composition
identical to that of the current Earth orbiting at 1 AU around a young and very active solar mass star.
Methods. To model the upper atmosphere, we used the Kompot Code, which is a first-principles model
that calculates the physical structures of the upper atmospheres of planets, taking into account
hydrodynamics and the main chemical and thermal processes taking place in the upper atmosphere
of a planet. This model enabled us to calculate the 1D vertical structure of the atmosphere using
as input the high-energy spectrum of a young and active Sun. Results. The atmosphere has the form
of a transonic hydrodynamic Parker wind, which has an outflow velocity at the upper boundary of our
computational domain that exceeds the escape velocity. The outflowing gas is dominated by atomic
nitrogen and oxygen and their ion equivalents and has a maximum ionization fraction of 20%. The mass
outflow rate is found to be 1.8x10^9 g s^-1, which would erode the modern Earth's atmosphere in less
than 0.1 Myr. Conclusions. This extreme mass loss rate suggests that an Earth-like atmosphere cannot
form when the planet is orbiting within the habitable zone of a very active star. Instead, such an
atmosphere can only form after the activity of the star has decreased to a much lower level. This happened
in the early atmosphere of the Earth, which was likely dominated by other gases such as CO2. Since
the time it takes for the activity of a star to decay is highly dependent on its mass, this is important
for understanding possible formation timescales for planets orbiting low-mass stars.
