The Mid-Infrared instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope will perform the first
ever characterization of young giant exoplanets observed by direct imaging in the 5-28 microns
spectral range. This wavelength range is key for both determining the bolometric luminosity of
the cool known exoplanets and for accessing the strongest ammonia bands. In conjunction with shorter
wavelength observations, MIRI will enable a more accurate characterization of the exoplanetary
atmospheric properties. Here we consider a subsample of the currently known exoplanets detected
by direct imaging and we discuss their detectability with MIRI, either using the coronagraphic
or the spectroscopic modes. By using the Exo-REM atmosphere model we calculate the mid-infrared
emission spectra of fourteen exoplanets, and we simulate MIRI coronagraphic or spectroscopic
observations. Specifically we analyze four coronagraphic observational setups, which depend
on (i) the target-star and reference-star offset (0, 3, 14 mas), (ii) the wave-front-error (130,
204 nm rms), (iii) the telescope jitter amplitude (1.6, 7 mas). We then determine the signal-to-noise
and integration time values for the coronagraphic targets whose planet-to-star contrasts range
from 3.9 to 10.1 mag. We conclude that all the MIRI targets should be observable with different degrees
of difficulty, which depends on the final in-flight instrument performances. Furthermore, we
test for detection of ammonia in the atmosphere of the coolest targets. Finally, we present the case
of HR 8799 b to discuss what MIRI observations can bring to the knowledge of a planetary atmosphere,
either alone or in combination with shorter wavelength observations.
