The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is an ongoing sensitive, high-resolution 120-168MHz survey
of the entire northern sky for which observations are now 20% complete. We present our first full-quality
public data release. For this data release 424 square degrees, or 2% of the eventual coverage, in
the region of the HETDEX Spring Field (right ascension 10h45m00s to 15h30m00s and declination 45$^\circ$00$'$00$''$
to 57$^\circ$00$'$00$''$) were mapped using a fully automated direction-dependent calibration
and imaging pipeline that we developed. A total of 325,694 sources are detected with a signal of at
least five times the noise, and the source density is a factor of $\sim 10$ higher than the most sensitive
existing very wide-area radio-continuum surveys. The median sensitivity is S$_{\rm 144 MHz} =
71\,\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and the point-source completeness is 90% at an integrated flux density
of 0.45mJy. The resolution of the images is 6$''$ and the positional accuracy is within 0.2$''$.
This data release consists of a catalogue containing location, flux, and shape estimates together
with 58 mosaic images that cover the catalogued area. In this paper we provide an overview of the data
release with a focus on the processing of the LOFAR data and the characteristics of the resulting
images. In two accompanying papers we provide the radio source associations and deblending and,
where possible, the optical identifications of the radio sources together with the photometric
redshifts and properties of the host galaxies. These data release papers are published together
with a further $\sim$20 articles that highlight the scientific potential of LoTSS.
