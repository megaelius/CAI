IUCAA Digital Sampling Array Controller (IDSAC) is a flexible and generic yet powerful CCD controller
which can handle a wide range of scientific detectors. Based on an easily scalable modular backplane
architecture consisting of Single Board Controllers (SBC), IDSAC can control large detector arrays
and mosaics. Each of the SBCs offers the full functionality required to control a CCD independently.
The SBCs can be cold swapped without the need to reconfigure them. Each SBC can handle data from up
to four video channels with or without dummy outputs at speeds up to 500 kilo Pixels Per Second (kPPS)
Per Channel with a resolution of 16 bits. Communication with Linux based host computer is through
a USB3.0 interface, with the option of using copper or optical fibers. A Field Programmable Gate
Array (FPGA) is used as the master controller in each SBC which allows great flexibility in optimizing
performance by adjusting gain, timing signals, bias levels, etc. using user-editable configuration
files without altering the circuit topology. Elimination of thermal kTC noise is achieved via Digital
Correlated Double Sampling (DCDS). We present the results of noise performance characterization
of IDSAC through simulation, theoretical modeling, and actual measurements. The contribution
of different types of noise sources is modeled using a tool to predict noise of a generic DCDS signal
chain analytically. The analytical model predicts the net input referenced noise of the signal
chain to be 5 electrons for 200k pixels per second per channel readout rate with 3 samples per pixel.
Using a cryogenic test set up in the lab, the noise is measured to be 5.4 e (24.3 \muV), for the same readout
configuration.
