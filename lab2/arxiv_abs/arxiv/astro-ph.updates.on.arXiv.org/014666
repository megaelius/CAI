At low redshifts, the observed baryonic density falls far short of the total number of baryons predicted.
Cosmological simulations suggest that these baryons reside in filamentary gas structures, known
as the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). As a result of the high temperatures of these filaments,
the matter is highly ionised such that it absorbs and emits far-UV and soft X-ray photons. Athena,
the proposed European Space Agency X-ray observatory, aims to detect the `missing' baryons in the
WHIM up to redshifts of $z=1$ through absorption in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst afterglow
spectra, allowing for the study of the evolution of these large-scale structures of the Universe.
This work simulates WHIM filaments in the spectra of GRB X-ray afterglows with Athena using the SImulation
of X-ray TElescopes (SIXTE) framework. We investigate the feasibility of their detection with
the X-IFU instrument, through O VII ($E=573$ eV) and O VIII ($E=674$ eV) absorption features, for
a range of equivalent widths imprinted onto GRB afterglow spectra of observed starting fluxes ranging
between $10^{-12}$ and $10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, in the 0.3-10 keV energy band. The analyses
of X-IFU spectra by blind line search show that Athena will be able to detect O VII-O VIII absorption
pairs with EW$_\mathrm{O VII} > 0.13$ eV and EW$_\mathrm{O VIII} > 0.09$ eV for afterglows with $F>2
\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. This allows for the detection of $\approx$ 45-137 O VII-O
VIII absorbers during the four-year mission lifetime. The work shows that to obtain an O VII-O VIII
detection of high statistical significance, the local hydrogen column density should be limited
at $N_\mathrm{H}<8 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$.
