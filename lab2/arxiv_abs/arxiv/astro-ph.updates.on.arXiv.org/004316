The origin of Phobos and Deimos in a giant impact generated disk is gaining larger attention. Although
this scenario has been the subject of many studies, an evaluation of the chemical composition of
the Mars' moons in this framework is missing. The chemical composition of Phobos and Deimos is unconstrained.
The large uncertainty about the origin of the mid-infrared features, the lack of absorption bands
in the visible and near-infrared spectra, and the effects of secondary processes on the moons' surface
make the determination of their composition very difficult from remote sensing data. Simulations
suggest a formation of a disk made of gas and melt with their composition linked to the nature of the
impactor and Mars. Using thermodynamic equilibrium we investigate the composition of dust (condensates
from gas) and solids (from a cooling melt) that result from different types of Mars impactors (Mars-,
CI-, CV-, EH-, comet-like). Our calculations show a wide range of possible chemical compositions
and noticeable differences between dust and solids depending on the considered impactors. Assuming
Phobos and Deimos as result of the accretion and mixing of dust and solids, we find that the derived
assemblage (dust rich in metallic-iron, sulphides and/or carbon, and quenched solids rich in silicates)
can be compatible with the observations. The Java's MM (Martian Moons exploration) mission will
investigate the physical and chemical properties of the Maroons, especially sampling from Phobos,
before returning to Earth. Our results could be then used to disentangle the origin and chemical
composition of the pristine body that hit Mars and suggest guidelines for helping in the analysis
of the returned samples.
