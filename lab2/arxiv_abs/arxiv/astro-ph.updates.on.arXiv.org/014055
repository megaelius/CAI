This is the third paper of a series where we study the stellar population gradients (SP; ages, metallicities,
$\alpha$-element abundance ratios and stellar initial mass functions) of early type galaxies
(ETGs) at $z\le 0.08$ from the MaNGA-DR15 survey. In this work we focus on the S0 population and quantify
how the SP varies across the population as well as with galactocentric distance. We do this by measuring
Lick indices and comparing them to stellar population synthesis models. This requires spectra
with high signal-to-noise which we achieve by stacking in bins of luminosity (L$_r$) and central
velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$). We find that: 1) There is a bimodality in the S0 population: S0s
more massive than $3\times 10^{10}M_\odot$ show stronger velocity dispersion and age gradients
(age and $\sigma_r$ decrease outwards) but little or no metallicity gradient, while the less massive
ones present relatively flat age and velocity dispersion profiles, but a significant metallicity
gradient (i.e. [M/H] decreases outwards). Above $2\times10^{11}M_\odot$ the number of S0s drops
sharply. These two mass scales are also where global scaling relations of ETGs change slope. 2) S0s
have steeper velocity dispersion profiles than fast rotating elliptical galaxies (E-FRs) of the
same luminosity and velocity dispersion. The kinematic profiles and stellar population gradients
of E-FRs are both more similar to those of slow rotating ellipticals (E-SRs) than to S0s, suggesting
that E-FRs are not simply S0s viewed face-on. 3) At fixed $\sigma_0$, more luminous S0s and E-FRs
are younger, more metal rich and less $\alpha$-enhanced. Evidently for these galaxies, the usual
statement that 'massive galaxies are older' is not true if $\sigma_0$ is held fixed.
