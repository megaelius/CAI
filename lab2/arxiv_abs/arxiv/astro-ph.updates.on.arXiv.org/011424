Slitless spectroscopy has long been considered as a complicated and confused technique. Nonetheless,
with the advent of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) instruments characterized by a low sky background
level and a high spatial resolution (most notably WFC3), slitless spectroscopy has become an adopted
survey tool to study galaxy evolution from space. We investigate its application to single object
studies to measure not only redshift and integrated spectral features, but also spatially resolved
quantities such as galaxy kinematics. We build a complete forward model to be quantitatively compared
to actual slitless observations. This model depends on a simplified thin cold disk galaxy description
-- including flux distribution, intrinsic spectrum and kinematic parameters -- and on the instrumental
signature. It is used to improve redshifts and constrain basic rotation curve parameters, i.e.
plateau velocity $v_{0}$ (in $\rm km.s^{-1}$) and central velocity gradient $w_{0}$ (in $\rm km.s^{-1}.arcsec^{-1}$).
The model is tested on selected observations from 3D-HST and GLASS surveys, to estimate redshift
and kinematic parameters on several galaxies measured with one or more roll angles. Our forward
approach allows to mitigate the self-contamination effect, a primary drawback of slitless spectroscopy,
and therefore has the potential to increase precision on redshifts. In a limited sample of well-resolved
spiral galaxies from HST surveys, it is possible to significantly constrain galaxy rotation curve
parameters. This proof-of-concept work is promising for future large slitless spectroscopic
surveys such as EUCLID and WFIRST.
