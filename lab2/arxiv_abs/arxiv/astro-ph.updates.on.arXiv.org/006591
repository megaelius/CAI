The HR8799 planetary system with four ~10 mJup planets in wide orbits up to 70 au, and periods up to
500 yr has been detected with the direct imaging. Its intriguing orbital architecture is not fully
resolved due to time-limited astrometry covering ~20 years. Earlier, we constructed a heuristic
model of the system based on rapid, convergent migration of the planets. We developed a better structured
and CPU-efficient variant of this model. We re-analyzed the self-consistent, homogeneous astrometric
dataset in Konopacky (2016). The best-fitting configuration agrees with our earlier findings.
The planets are likely involved in dynamically robust Laplace resonance chain. Hypothetical planets
with masses below the current detection limit of 0.1-3 Jupiter masses, within the observed inner,
or beyond the outer orbit, respectively, do not influence the long term stability of the system.
We predict positions of such non-detected objects. The long-term stable orbital model of the observed
planets helps to simulate the dynamical structure of debris disks in the system. A CPU-efficient
fast indicator technique makes it possible to reveal their complex, resonant shape in 10^6 particles
scale. We examine the inner edge of the outer disk detected between 90-145 au. We also reconstruct
the outer disk assuming that it has been influenced by convergent migration of the planets. A complex
shape of the disk strongly depends on various dynamical factors, like orbits and masses of non-detected
planets. It may be highly non-circular and its models are yet non-unique, regarding both observational
constraints, as well as its origin.
