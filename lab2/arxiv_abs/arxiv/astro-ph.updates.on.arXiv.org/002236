The High Energy cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD) facility is one of several space astronomy payloads
of the cosmic lighthouse program onboard China's Space Station, which is planned for operation
starting around 2020 for about 10 years. The main scientific objectives of HERD are indirect dark
matter search, precise cosmic ray spectrum and composition measurements up to the knee energy,
and high energy gamma-ray monitoring and survey. HERD is composed of a 3-D cubic calorimeter (CALO)
surrounded by microstrip silicon trackers (STKs) from five sides except the bottom. CALO is made
of about 10$^4$ cubes of LYSO crystals, corresponding to about 55 radiation lengths and 3 nuclear
interaction lengths, respectively. The top STK microstrips of seven X-Y layers are sandwiched
with tungsten converters to make precise directional measurements of incoming electrons and gamma-rays.
In the baseline design, each of the four side SKTs is made of only three layers microstrips. All STKs
will also be used for measuring the charge and incoming directions of cosmic rays, as well as identifying
back scattered tracks. With this design, HERD can achieve the following performance: energy resolution
of 1\% for electrons and gamma-rays beyond 100 GeV, 20\% for protons from 100 GeV to 1 PeV; electron/proton
separation power better than $10^{-5}$; effective geometrical factors of $>$3 ${\rm m}^{2}{\rm
sr}$ for electron and diffuse gamma-rays, $>$2 $ {\rm m}^{2}{\rm sr}$ for cosmic ray nuclei.
R\&D is under way for reading out the LYSO signals with optical fiber coupled to image intensified
CCD and the prototype of one layer of CALO.
