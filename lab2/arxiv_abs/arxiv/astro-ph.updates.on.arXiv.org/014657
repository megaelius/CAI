The inner regions of protoplanetary discs (from $\sim$ 0.1 to 10 au) are the expected birthplace
of planets, especially telluric. In those high temperature regions, solids can experience cyclical
annealing, vaporisation and recondensation. Hot and warm dusty grains emits mostly in the infrared
domain, notably in N-band (8 to 13~$\mu$m). Studying their fine chemistry through mid-infrared
spectro-interferometry with the new VLTI instrument MATISSE, which can spatially resolve these
regions, requires detailed dust chemistry models. Using radiative transfer, we derived infrared
spectra of a fiducial static protoplanetary disc model with different inner disc ($< 1$ au) dust
compositions. The latter were derived from condensation sequences computed at LTE for three initial
$C/O$ ratios: subsolar ($C/O=0.4$), solar ($C/O=0.54$), and supersolar ($C/O=1$). The three
scenarios return very different N-band spectra, especially when considering the presence of sub-micron-sized
dust grains. MATISSE should be able to detect these differences and trace the associated sub-au-scale
radial changes. We propose a first interpretation of N-band `inner-disc' spectra obtained with
the former VLTI instrument MIDI on three Herbig stars (HD142527, HD144432, HD163296) and one T Tauri
star (AS209). Notably, we could associate a supersolar (`carbon-rich') composition for HD142527
and a subsolar (`oxygen-rich') one for HD1444432. We show that the inner disc mineralogy can be very
specific and not related to the dust composition derived from spatially unresolved mid-infrared
spectroscopy. We highlight the need for including more complex chemistry when interpreting solid-state
spectroscopic observations of the inner regions of discs, and for considering dynamical aspects
for future studies.
