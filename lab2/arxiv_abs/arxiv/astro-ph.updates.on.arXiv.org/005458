We study halo assembly bias for cluster-sized halos. Previous work has found little evidence for
correlations between large-scale bias and halo mass assembly history for simulated cluster-sized
halos, in contrast to the significant correlation found between bias and concentration for halos
of this mass. This difference in behavior is surprising, given that both concentration and assembly
history are closely related to the same properties of the linear-density peaks that collapse to
form halos. Using publicly available simulations, we show that significant assembly bias is indeed
found in the most massive halos with $M\sim 10^{15}M_\odot$, using essentially any definition
of halo age. For lower halo masses $M\sim 10^{14}M_\odot$, no correlation is found between bias
and the commonly used age indicator $a_{0.5}$, the half-mass time. We show that this is a mere accident,
and that significant assembly bias exists for other definitions of halo age, including those based
on the time when the halo progenitor acquires some fraction $f$ of the ultimate mass at $z=0$. For
halos with $M_{\rm vir}\sim 10^{14}M_\odot$, the sense of assembly bias changes sign at $f=0.5$.
We explore the origin of this behavior, and argue that it arises because standard definitions of
halo mass in halo finders do not correspond to the collapsed, virialized mass that appears in the
spherical collapse model used to predict large-scale clustering. Because bias depends strongly
on halo mass, these errors in mass definition can masquerade as or even obscure the assembly bias
that is physically present. More physically motivated halo definitions using splashback should
be free of this particular defect of standard halo finders.
