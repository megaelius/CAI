We report a solar coronal split-band type II radio burst that was observed on 2016 March 16 with the
Gauribidanur Radio Spectro-Polarimeter (GRASP) in the frequency range $\approx$\,90\,-\,50
MHz, and the Gauribidanur RadioheliograPH (GRAPH) at two discrete frequencies, viz. 80 MHz and
53.3 MHz. Observations around the same epoch in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and white-light show
that the above burst was associated with a flux rope structure and a coronal mass ejection (CME),
respectively. The combined height-time plot generated using EUV, radio, and whitelight data suggest
that the different observed features (i.e. the flux rope, type II burst and the CME) are all closely
associated. We constructed an empirical model for the coronal electron density distribution ($N_{e}(r)$,
where $r$ is the heliocentric distance) from the above set of observations themselves and used it
to estimate the coronal magnetic field strength ($B$) over the range of $r$ values in which the respective
events were observed. The $B$ values are consistent with each other. They vary as $B(r)\,=\,2.61
\times r^{-2.21}$ \textrm{G} in the range $r \approx$\,1.1\,-\,2.2$\rm R_{\odot}$. As far as
we know, similar `direct' estimates of $B$ in the near-Sun corona without assuming a model for $N_{e}(r)$,
and by combining co-temporal set of observations in two different regions (radio and whitelight)
of the electromagnetic spectrum, have rarely been reported. Further, the present work is a novel
attempt where the characteristics of a propagating EUV flux rope structure, considered to be the
signature of a CME close the Sun, have been used to estimate $B(r)$ in the corresponding distance
range.
