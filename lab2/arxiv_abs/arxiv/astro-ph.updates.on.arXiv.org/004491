Insights into the processes of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) propagation are essential for understanding
how solar eruptions affect the radiation environment of near-Earth space. SEP propagation is influenced
by turbulent magnetic fields in the solar wind, resulting in stochastic transport of SEPs to Earth.
Multi-spacecraft observations suggest that the cross-field propagation shapes the SEP fluxes
at Earth strongly. However, modelling SEP cross-field transport as spatial diffusion has been
shown to be insufficient without use of unrealistically large cross-field diffusion coefficients.
Recent work has shown that the early-time propagation of energetic particles across the mean field
direction in turbulent fields is not diffusive, as the particles propagating along meandering
field lines. This early-time transport mode results in fast access of the particles across the mean
field direction, in agreement with the SEP observations. In this work, we demonstrate the significance
of turbulence strength on evolution of the SEP radiation environment near Earth. We calculate the
transport parameters with a turbulence transport model, parametrised by the SEP parallel scattering
mean free path at 1~AU, $\lambda_{\parallel}^{*}$, and show that the parallel and cross-field
transport are connected, with conditions resulting in slow parallel transport corresponding
to wider events. We find a scaling $\sigma_{\phi,\, \mathrm{max}}\propto (1/\lambda_{\parallel}^{*})^{1/4}$
for the Gaussian fitting of the longitudinal distribution of maximum intensities. The longitudes
with highest intensities are shifted towards the west for strong scattering conditions. Our results
emphasise the importance of understanding both the SEP transport and the interplanetary turbulence
conditions for modelling and predicting the SEP radiation environment at Earth.
