We present a numerical analysis supporting the evidence that the redshift evolution of the drifting
coefficient of the field cluster mass function is capable of breaking several cosmic degeneracies.
This evidence is based on the data from the CoDECS and DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder simulations performed
separately for various non-standard cosmologies including coupled dark energy, $f(R)$ gravity
and combinations of $f(R)$ gravity with massive neutrinos as well as for the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. We first numerically determine the field cluster mass functions at various redshifts
in the range of $0\le z\le 1$ for each cosmology. Then, we compare the analytic formula developed
in previous works with the numerically obtained field cluster mass functions by adjusting its drifting
coefficient, $\beta$, at each redshift. It is found that the analytic formula with the best-fit
coefficient provides a good match to the numerical results at all redshifts for all of the cosmologies.
The empirically determined redshift evolution of the drifting coefficient, $\beta(z)$, turns
out to significantly differ among different cosmologies. It is also shown that even without using
any prior information on the background cosmology the drifting coefficient, $\beta(z)$, can discriminate
with high statistical significance the degenerate non-standard cosmologies not only from the
$\Lambda$CDM but also from one another. It is concluded that the evolution of the departure from
the Einstein-de Sitter state and spherically symmetric collapse processes quantified by $\beta(z)$
is a powerful probe of gravity and dark sector physics.
