Asteroid pairs had a single progenitor that split due to rotational-fission of a weak, rubble-pile
structured body. By constructing shape models of asteroid pairs from multiple-apparition observations
and using a lightcurve inversion technique, we mapped the gravitational and rotational accelerations
on the surfaces of these asteroids. This allows us to construct a map of local slopes on the asteroids'
surfaces. In order to test for frictional failure, we determine the maximum rotation rate at which
an area larger than half the surface area of the secondary member (assumed to be the ejected component)
has a slope value greater than 40 degrees, the angle of friction of lunar regolith, where loose material
will begin sliding. We use this criterion to constrain the failure stress operating on the body,
just before disruption at the commonly observed spin barrier of 2.2 h. Our current sample includes
shape models of eleven primary members of asteroid pairs, observed from the Wise Observatory in
the last decade. In the studied parameter space we find that the shape models only reach the spin barrier
when their bulk density is larger than the ~2 gr cm-3 measured for the rubble pile structured 25143
Itokawa, suggesting that km-sized asteroid pairs are dense compared to sub-km bodies. Assuming
ejection of secondary components that are larger than those observed (up to the maximal size allowing
separation), can also increase the spin barrier of the asteroids, thus supporting the previously
suggested scenario of continuous disruption of the secondary. In addition, cohesion levels of
hundreds of Pascals are also required to prevent these shape models from disrupting at spin rates
slower than the usual spin barrier.
