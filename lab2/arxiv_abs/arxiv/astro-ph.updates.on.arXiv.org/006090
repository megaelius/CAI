In this study, we present CCD UBV photometry of poorly studied open star clusters, Dolidze 36, NGC
6728, NGC 6800, NGC 7209, and Platais 1, located in the first and second Galactic quadrants. Observations
were obtained with T100, the 1-m telescope of the TUBITAK National Observatory. Using photometric
data, we determined several astrophysical parameters such as reddening, distance, metallicity
and ages and from them, initial mass functions, integrated magnitudes and colours. We took into
account the proper motions of the observed stars to calculate the membership probabilities. The
colour excesses and metallicities were determined independently using two-colour diagrams.
After obtaining the colour excesses of the clusters Dolidze 36, NGC 6728, NGC 6800, NGC 7209, and
Platais 1 as $0.19\pm0.06$, $0.15\pm0.05$, $0.32\pm0.05$, $0.12\pm0.04$, and $0.43\pm0.06$
mag, respectively, the metallicities are found to be $0.00\pm0.09$, $0.02\pm0.11$, $0.03\pm0.07$,
$0.01\pm0.08$, and $0.01\pm0.08$ dex, respectively. Furthermore, using these parameters, distance
moduli and age of the clusters were also calculated from colour-magnitude diagrams simultaneously
using PARSEC theoretical models. The distances to the clusters Dolidze 36, NGC 6728, NGC 6800, NGC
7209, and Platais 1 are $1050\pm90$, $1610\pm190$, $1210\pm150$, $1060\pm 90$, and $1710\pm250$
pc, respectively, while corresponding ages are $400\pm100$, $750\pm150$, $400\pm100$, $600\pm100$,
and $175\pm50$ Myr, respectively. Our results are compatible with those found in previous studies.
The mass function of each cluster is derived. The slopes of the mass functions of the open clusters
range from 1.31 to 1.58, which are in agreement with Salpeter's initial mass function. We also found
integrated absolute magnitudes varying from -4.08 to -3.40 for the clusters.
