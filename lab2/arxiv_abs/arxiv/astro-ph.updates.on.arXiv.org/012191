Several chemical networks have been developed to study warm (exo)planetary atmospheres. The kinetics
of the reactions related to the methanol chemistry included in these schemes have been questioned.
The goal of this paper is to update the methanol chemistry for such chemical networks thanks to recent
publications in the combustion literature. We aim also at studying the consequences of this update
on the atmospheric compositions of (exo)planetary atmospheres and brown dwarfs. We have performed
an extensive review of combustion experimental studies and revisited the sub-mechanism describing
methanol combustion in the scheme of Venot et al. (2012, A&A 624, A58). The updated scheme involves
108 species linked by a total of 1906 reactions. We have then applied our 1D kinetic model with this
new scheme to several case studies (HD 209458b, HD 189733b, GJ 436b, GJ 1214b, ULAS J1335+11, Uranus,
Neptune), and compared the results obtained with those obtained with the former scheme. The update
of the scheme has a negligible impact on hot Jupiters atmospheres. However, the atmospheric composition
of warm Neptunes and brown dwarfs is modified sufficiently to impact observational spectra in the
wavelength range JWST will operate. Concerning Uranus and Neptune, the update of the chemical scheme
modifies the abundance of CO and thus impacts the deep oxygen abundance required to reproduce the
observational data. For future 3D kinetics models, we also derived a reduced scheme containing
44 species and 582 reactions. Chemical schemes should be regularly updated in order to maintain
a high level of reliability on the results of kinetic models and be able to improve our knowledge on
planetary formation.
