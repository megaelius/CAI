Recently, the nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) has been gaining attention to generate primordial
magnetic fields in the Universe and also to resolve singularity problems. Moreover, recent works
have shown the crucial role of the NED on the inflation. This paper provides a new approach based on
a new model of NED as a source of gravitation to remove the cosmic singularity at the big bang and explain
the cosmic acceleration during the inflation era on the background of stochastic magnetic field.
Also, we found a realization of a cyclic Universe, free of initial singularity, due to the proposed
NED energy density. In addition, we explore whether a NED field without or with matter can be the origin
of the late-time acceleration. For this we obtain explicit equations for $H(z)$ and perform a MCMC
analysis to constrain the NED parameters by using $31$ observational Hubble data (OHD) obtained
from cosmic chronometers covering the redshift range $0 < z < 1.97$; and with the joint-light-analysis
(JLA) SNIa compilation consisting in $740$ data points in the range $0.01<z<1.2$. All our constraints
on the current magnetic field give $B_{0}\sim 10^{-31}\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which are larger than
the upper limit $10^{-33}\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ by the Planck satellite implying that NED cosmologies
could not be suitable to explain the Universe late-time dynamics. However, the current data is able
to falsify the scenario at late times. Indeed, one is able to reconstruct the deceleration parameter
$q(z)$ using the best fit values of the parameters obtained from OHD and SNIa data sets. If the matter
component is not included, the data sets predict an accelerated phase in the early Universe, but
a non accelerated Universe is preferred in the current epoch...
