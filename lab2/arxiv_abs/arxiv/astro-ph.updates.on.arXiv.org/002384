Radio synchrotron emission is expected as a natural by-product of the self-annihilation of super-symmetric
dark matter particles. In this work we discuss the general properties of the radio emission expected
in a wide range of dark matter halos, from local dwarf spheroidal galaxies to large and distant galaxy
clusters with the aim to determine the neutralino dark matter detection prospects of the Square
Kilometre Array (SKA). The analysis of the SKA detection of DM-induced radio emission is presented
for structures spanning a wide range of masses and redshifts, and we also analyze the limits that
the SKA can set on the thermally averaged neutralino annihilation cross-section in the event of
non-detection. To this end, we construct a model of the redshift evolution of the radio emissions
of dark matter halos and apply it to generate predicted fluxes from a range of neutralino masses and
annihilation channels for the dark matter halos surrounding dwarf galaxies, galaxies and galaxy
clusters. Using the available SKA performance predictions and its ability to determine an independent
measure of the magnetic field in cosmic structures, we explore both the detailed detection prospects
and the upper-bounds that might be placed on the neutralino annihilation cross-section in the event
of non-detection. We find that the SKA can access a neutralino parameter space far larger than that
of any preceding indirect-detection experiment, also improving on the realistic CTA detection
prospects, with the possibility of setting cross-section upper-bounds up to four orders of magnitude
below the thermal relic density bound. Additionally, we find that neutralino radio emissions carry
redshift-independent signatures of the dominant annihilation channel and of neutralino mass,
offering therefore a means to identify such non-thermal emissions within the observing frequency
range of the SKA.
