We investigate the relationship between radio power and properties related to active galactic
nuclei (AGNs). Radio power at 1.4 or 5 GHz, which has been used in many studies, can be affected by synchrotron
self-absorption and free-free absorption in a dense region. On the other hand, these absorption
effects get smaller at higher frequencies. Thus, we performed simultaneous observations at 22
and 43 GHz using the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) radio telescope based on a sample of 305 AGN candidates
residing in elliptical galaxies from the overlap between the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data
Release 7 and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST). About 37% and 22% of the
galaxies are detected at 22 and 43 GHz, respectively. Assuming no flux variability between the FIRST
and KVN observation, spectral indices were derived from FIRST and KVN data and we found that over
70% of the detected galaxies have flat or inverted spectra, implying the presence of optically thick
compact regions near the centres of the galaxies. Core radio power does not show a clear dependence
on black hole mass at either low (1.4 GHz) or high (22 and 43 GHz) frequencies. However, we found that
the luminosity of the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 emission line and the Eddington ratio correlate with
radio power more closely at high frequencies than at low frequencies. This suggests that radio observation
at high frequencies can be an appropriate tool for unveiling the innermost region. In addition,
the luminosity of the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 emission line and the Eddington ratio can be used as a
tracer of AGN activity. Our study suggests a causal connection between high frequency radio power
and optical properties of AGNs.
