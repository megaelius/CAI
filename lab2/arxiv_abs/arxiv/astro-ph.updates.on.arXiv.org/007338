(Abridged) The detection of forming planets in disks around young stars remains elusive, and state-of-the-art
observational techniques provide somewhat ambiguous results. It has been reported that the pre-transitional
T Tauri star LkCa 15 could host three planets; candidate planet b is in the process of formation, as
inferred from its H$\alpha$ emission. However, a more recent work casts doubts on the planetary
nature of the previous detections. We have observed LkCa 15 with ISIS/WHT. The spectrograph's slit
was oriented towards the last reported position of LkCa 15 b (parallel direction) and 90degr from
that (perpendicular). The photocenter and full width half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussians fitting
the spatial distribution at H$\alpha$ and the adjacent continuum were measured. A well-known binary
(GU CMa) was used as a calibrator to test the spectro-astrometric performance of ISIS/WHT, recovering
consistent photocenter and FWHM signals. However, the photocenter shift predicted for LkCa 15
b is not detected, but the FWHM in H$\alpha$ is broader than in the continuum for both slit positions.
Our simulations show that the photocenter and FWHM observations cannot be explained simultaneously
by an accreting planet. In turn, both spectro-astrometric observations are naturally reproduced
from a roughly symmetric Halpha emitting region centered on the star and extent comparable to the
orbit originally attributed to the planet at several au. The extended H$\alpha$ emission around
LkCa 15 could be related to a variable disk wind, but additional multi-epoch data and detailed modeling
are necessary to understand its physical nature. Spectro-astrometry in H$\alpha$ is able to test
the presence of accreting planets and can be used as a complementary technique to survey planet formation
in circumstellar disks.
