We study the size and the specific angular momentum of galaxies in a state-of-the-art semi-analytic
model. Our model includes a specific treatment for the exchange of angular momentum between different
galactic components. Disk scale radii are estimated from the angular momentum of the gaseous/stellar
disk, while bulge sizes are estimated using energy conservation arguments. The predicted size-mass
and angular momentum-mass relations are in good agreement with observational measurements in
the local Universe, provided a treatment for gas dissipation during major mergers is included.
Our treatment for disk instability leads to unrealistically small radii of bulges formed predominantly
through disk instability, and predicts an offset between the size-mass relations predicted for
central and satellite early-type galaxies, that is not observed in real samples. The model reproduces
well the observed dependence on morphology, and predicts a strong correlation between the specific
angular momentum of galaxies and their cold gas content. We find that this correlation is a natural
consequence of galaxy evolution: gas-rich galaxies form in smaller halos, and form stars gradually
until present day, while gas-poor ones reside in large halos, and form most of their stars at early
epochs, when the angular momentum of their parent halos is low. The dynamical and structural properties
of galaxies in the local Universe can be strongly affected by a different treatment for stellar feedback,
as this would modify the star formation history of model galaxies. A higher angular momentum for
gas accreted through rapid mode does not affect significantly the properties of massive galaxies
today, but has a more important effect on low-mass galaxies and at higher redshift.
