In this paper, we first revisit Parker's [5] ingenious supersonic stellar wind model with a view
to shed further light on some basic aspects of the underlying hydro- and magnetohydrodynamics.
We show that the visualization of an effective de Laval type nozzle associated with Parker's hydrodynamic
model is however valid only in a superficial way, and discrepancies arise with regard to the density
variation aspect. For moderate rotators, the new critical point r=r=(GM/\Omega_*^2)^1/3, which
is totally determined by the basic stellar parameters like the mass M and the angular velocity Omega_*,
supersedes the critical point determined by the speed of sound a in the stellar wind in Parker's hydrodynamic
model. Keplerian-orbit conditions are found to prevail near even moderated rotators. Indeed,
if r<r_*, which corresponds to a critical point low in corona, the stellar wind then experiences
a stronger afterburner (as in an aircraft jet engine) action in the corona and turns out to be tenuous
and fast. We then make analytic considerations on the Weber-Davis [18] magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
extension of Parker's hydrodynamic model with a view to provide a qualitative understanding of
the coupling between the magnetic field and the plasma motion in the stellar wind. We find that, *
the angular velocity of the stellar wind falls off more slowly than the inverse-square radial dependence
corresponding to motion with constant angular momentum; * the asymptotic MHD azimuthal velocity
profile actually resembles that for hydrodynamic Burgers vortex, in consistency with the numerical
results of Weber and Davis [18]; * hydrodynamic Parker-type scenario seems to reappear in the strong
magnetization regime, in consistency with the numerical results of Weber and Davis [18].
