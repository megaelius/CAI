We investigate the influence of the geomagnetic field (GF) on the Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope
technique for two northern (Tenerife and San Pedro Martir) and three southern (Salta, Leoncito
and Namibia (the H.E.S.S.-site)) site candidates for Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatories.
We use the CORSIKA and sim_telarray programs for Monte Carlo simulations of gamma ray showers, hadronic
background and the telescope response. We focus here on gamma ray measurements in the low energy,
sub-100 GeV, range. Therefore, we only consider the performance of arrays of several large telescopes.
Neglecting the GF effect, we find (in agreement with previous studies) that such arrays have lower
energy thresholds, and larger collection areas below 30 GeV, when located at higher altitudes.
We point out, however, that in the considered ranges of altitudes and magnetic field intensities,
1800-3600 m a.s.l. and 0-40 uT, respectively, the GF effect has a similar magnitude to this altitude
effect. We provide the trigger-level performance parameters of the observatory affected by the
GF effect, in particular the collection areas, detection rates and the energy thresholds for all
five locations, which information may be useful in the selection of sites for CTA. We also find simple
scaling of these parameters with the magnetic field strength, which can be used to assess the magnitude
of the GF effect for other sites; in this work we use them to estimate the performance parameters for
five sites: South Africa-Beaufort West, USA-Yavapai Ranch, Namibia-Lalapanzi, Chile-La Silla
and India-Hanle. We roughly investigate the impact of the geophysical conditions on gamma/hadron
separation procedures involving image shape and direction cuts.
