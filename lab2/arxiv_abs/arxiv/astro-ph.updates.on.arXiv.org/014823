PHASECam is the fringe tracker for the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI). It is a
near-infrared camera which is used to measure both tip/tilt and fringe phase variations between
the two adaptive optics (AO) corrected apertures of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Tip/tilt
and phase sensing are currently performed in the $H$ (1.65 $\mu$m) and $K$ (2.2 $\mu$m) bands at 1
kHz, but only the $K$-band phase telemetry is used to send corrections to the system in order to maintain
fringe coherence and visibility. However, due to the cyclic nature of the fringe phase, only the
phase, modulo 360 deg, can be measured. PHASECam's phase unwrapping algorithm, which attempts
to mitigate this issue, occasionally fails in the case of fast, large phase variations or low signal-to-noise
ratio. This can cause a fringe jump, in which case the OPD correction will be incorrect by a wavelength.
This can currently be manually corrected by the operator. However, as the LBTI commissions further
modes which require robust, active phase control and for which fringe jumps are harder to detect,
including multi-axial (Fizeau) interferometry and dual-aperture non-redundant aperture masking
interferometry, a more reliable and automated solution is desired. We present a multi-wavelength
method of fringe jump capture and correction which involves direct comparison between the $K$-band
and $H$-band phase telemetry. We demonstrate the method utilizing archival PHASECam telemetry,
showing it provides a robust, reliable way of detecting fringe jumps which can potentially recover
a significant fraction of the data lost to them.
