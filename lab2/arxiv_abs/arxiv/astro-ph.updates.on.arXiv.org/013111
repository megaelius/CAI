Star formation is one of the key factors that shapes galaxies. This process is relatively well understood
from both simulations and observations on a small "local" scale of individual giant molecular clouds
and also on a "global" galaxy-wide scale (e.g. the Kennicutt-Schmidt law). However, there is still
no understanding on how to connect global to local star formation scales and whether this connection
is at all possible. Here we analyze spatially resolved kinematics and the star formation rate density
$\Sigma_{SFR}$ for a combined sample of 17 nearby spiral galaxies obtained using our own optical
observations in H$\alpha$ for 9 galaxies and neutral hydrogen radio observations combined with
a multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution analysis for 8 galaxies from the THINGS project.
We show that the azimuthally averaged normalized star formation rate density in spiral galaxies
on a scale of a few hundred parsecs is proportional to the kinetic energy of giant molecular cloud
collisions due to differential rotation of the galactic disc. This energy is calculated from the
rotation curve using the two Oort parameters A and B as $\log (\Sigma_{SFR} / SFR_{tot}) \propto
\log[2 A^2+ 5 B^2]$. The total kinetic energy of collision is defined by the shear velocity that is
proportional to A and the rotational energy of a cloud proportional to the vorticity B. Hence, shear
does not act as a stabilizing factor for the cloud collapse thus reducing star formation but rather
increases it by boosting the kinetic energy of collisions. This result can be a tool through which
one can predict a radial distribution of star formation surface density using only a rotation curve.
