McVittie spacetimes embed the vacuum Schwarzschild(-(anti) de Sitter) spacetime in an isotropic
FLRW background universe. We study the global structure of McVittie spacetimes with spatially
non-flat FLRW backgrounds. This requires the extension of the definition of such spacetimes, previously
given only for the flat and open cases, to the closed case. We revisit this definition and show how
it gives rise to a unique spacetime (given the FLRW background, the mass parameter $M$ and the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$) in the open and flat cases. In the closed case, an additional free function of
the cosmic time arises. We derive some basic results on the metric, curvature and matter content
of McVittie spacetimes and derive a representation of the line element that makes the study of their
global properties possible. In the closed case (independently of the free function mentioned above),
the spacetime is confined (at each instant of time) to a region bounded by a minimum and a maximum area
radius, and is bounded either to the future or to the past by a scalar curvature singularity. This
allowed region only exists when the background scale factor is above a certain minimum. In the open
case, radial null geodesics originate in finite affine time in the past at a boundary formed by the
union of the Big Bang singularity of the FLRW background and a non-singular hypersurface of varying
causal character. Furthermore, in the case of eternally expanding open universes, we show that
black holes are ubiquitous: ingoing radial null geodesics extend in finite affine time to a hypersurface
that forms the boundary of the region from which photons can escape to future null infinity. We revisit
the black hole interpretation of McVittie spacetimes in the spatially flat case, and show that this
interpretation holds also in the case of a vanishing cosmological constant, contrary to a previous
claim of ours.
