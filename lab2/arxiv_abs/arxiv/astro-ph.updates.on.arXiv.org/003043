This paper presents the spatially resolved star formation history (2D-SFH) of a small sample of
four local mergers: the early-stage mergers IC1623, NGC6090, and the Mice, and the more advanced
merger NGC2623, by analyzing IFS data from the CALIFA survey and PMAS in LArr mode. Full spectral
fitting techniques are applied to the datacubes to obtain the spatially resolved mass growth histories,
the time evolution of the star formation rate intensity ($\Sigma_{SFR}$), and the local specific
star formation rate, over three different timescales (30 Myr, 300 Myr, and 1 Gyr). The results are
compared with non-interacting Sbc--Sc galaxies, to quantify if there is an enhancement of the star
formation and to trace its time scale and spatial extent. Our results for the three LIRGs (IC1623W,
NGC6090, and NGC2623) show that a major phase of star formation is occurring in time scales of 10$^{7}$
yr to few 10$^{8}$ yr, with global SFR enhancements of $\sim$2--6 with respect to main-sequence
star forming (MSSF) galaxies. In the two early-stage mergers IC1623W and NGC6090, which are between
first pericenter passage and coalescence, the most remarkable increase of the SFR with respect
to non-interacting spirals occurred in the last 30 Myr, and it is spatially extended, with enhancements
of factors 2--7 both in the centres ($r <$ 0.5 half light radius, HLR), and in the disks ($r >$ 1 HLR).
In the more advanced merger NGC 2623 an extended phase of star formation occurred on a longer time-scale
of $\sim$1 Gyr, with a SFR enhancement of a factor $\sim$2--3 larger than the one in Sbc--Sc MSSF galaxies
over the same period, probably relic of the first pericenter passage epoch. A SFR enhancement in
the last 30 Myr is also present, but only in NGC2623 centre, by a factor 3. In general, the spatially
resolved SFHs of the LIRG-mergers are consistent with the predictions from high spatial resolution
simulations.
