High-angular-resolution observations of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars often reveal non-spherical
morphologies for the gas and dust envelopes. We aim to make a pilot study to quantify the impact of
different geometries (spherically symmetric, spiral-shaped, and disc-shaped) of the dust component
of AGB envelopes on spectral energy distributions (SEDs), mass estimates, and subsequent mass-loss
rate (MLR) estimates. We also estimate the error made on the MLR if the SED is fitted by an inappropriate
geometrical model. We use the 3D Monte-Carlo-based radiative-transfer code RADMC-3D to simulate
emission from dusty envelopes with different geometries (but fixed spatial extension). We compare
these predictions with each other, and with the SED of the AGB star EP Aqr that we use as a benchmark
since its envelope is disc-like and known to harbour spiral arms, as seen in CO. The SEDs involving
the most massive envelopes are those for which the different geometries have the largest impact,
primarily on the silicate features at 10 and 18 um. These different shapes originate from large differences
in optical depths. Massive spirals and discs appear akin to black bodies. Optically thick edge-on
spirals and discs (with dust masses of 1e-4 and 1e-5 Msun) exhibit black-body SEDs that appear cooler
than those from face-on structures and spheres of the same mass, while optically thick face-on distributions
appear as warmer emission. We find that our more realistic models, combined spherical and spiral
distributions, are 0.1 to 0.5 times less massive than spheres with similar SEDs. More extreme, less
realistic scenarios give that spirals and discs are 0.01 to 0.05 times less massive than corresponding
spheres. This means that adopting the wrong geometry for an AGB circumstellar envelope may result
in a MLR that is incorrect by as much as 1 to 2 orders of magnitude when derived from SED fitting.
