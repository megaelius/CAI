We present the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances of up to 10 chemical species
in a sample of very metal-poor (VMP, -4 < [Fe/H] < -2) stars in seven dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs)
and in the Milky Way (MW) halo. Our results are based on high-resolution spectroscopic datasets
and homogeneous and accurate atmospheric parameters determined in PaperI. We show that once the
NLTE effects are properly taken into account, all massive galaxies in our sample, that is, the MW
halo and the classical dSphs Sculptor, Ursa Minor, Sextans, and Fornax, reveal a similar plateau
at [alpha/Fe] ~ 0.3 for each of the alpha-process elements: Mg, Ca, and Ti. We put on a firm ground the
evidence for a decline in alpha/Fe with increasing metallicity in the BootesI ultra-faint dwarf
galaxy (UFD), that is most probably due to the ejecta of type Ia supernovae. For Na/Fe, Na/Mg, and
Al/Mg, the MW halo and all dSphs reveal indistinguishable trends with metallicity, suggesting
that the processes of Na and Al synthesis are identical in all systems, independent of their mass.
The dichotomy in the [Sr/Ba] versus [Ba/H] diagram is observed in the classical dSphs, similarly
to the MW halo, calling for two different nucleosynthesis channels for Sr. We show that Sr in the massive
galaxies is well correlated with Mg suggesting a strong link to massive stars and that its production
is essentially independent of Ba, for most of the [Ba/H] range. Our three UFDs, that is BootesI, UMaII,
and LeoIV, are depleted in Sr and Ba relative to Fe and Mg, with very similar ratios of [Sr/Mg] ~ -1.3
and [Ba/Mg] ~ -1 on the entire range of their Mg abundances. The subsolar Sr/Ba ratios of Bootes I and
UMa II indicate a common r-process origin of their neutron-capture elements. Sculptor remains
the classical dSph, in which the evidence for inhomogeneous mixing in the early evolution stage,
at [Fe/H] < -2, is the strongest.
