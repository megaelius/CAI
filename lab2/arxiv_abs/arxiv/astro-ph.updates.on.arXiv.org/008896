Gyrosynchrotron radiation is produced by solar flares, and can be used to infer properties of the
accelerated electrons and magnetic field of the flaring region. This microwave emission is highly
dependent on many local plasma parameters, and the viewing angle. To correctly interpret observations,
detailed simulations of the emission are required. Additionally, gyrosynchrotron emission from
the chromosphere has been largely ignored in modelling efforts, and recent studies have shown the
importance of thermal emission at millimetric wavelengths. Thyr is a new tool for modelling microwave
emission from three-dimensional flaring loops with spatially varying atmosphere and increased
resolution in the lower corona and chromosphere. Thyr is modular and open-source, consisting of
separate components to compute the thermal and non-thermal microwave emission coefficients and
perform three-dimensional radiative transfer (in local thermodynamic equilibrium). The radiative
transfer integral is computed by a novel ray-marching technique to efficiently compute the contribution
of many volume elements. This technique can also be employed on a variety of astrophysics problems.
Herein we present a review of the theory of gyrosynchrotron radiation, and two simulations of identical
flare loops in low- and high-resolution performed with Thyr, with a spectral imaging analysis of
differing regions. The high-resolution simulation presents a spectral hardening at higher frequencies.
This hardening originates around the top of the chromosphere due to the strong convergence of the
magnetic field, and is not present in previous models due to insufficient resolution. This hardening
could be observed with a coordinated flare observation from active radio observatories.
