Photoheating associated with reionization suppressed star formation in low-mass galaxies. Reionization
was inhomogeneous, however, affecting different regions at different times. To establish the
causal connection between reionization and suppression, we must take this local variation into
account. We analyze the results of CoDa (`Cosmic Dawn') I, the first fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamical
simulation of reionization and galaxy formation in the Local Universe, in a volume large enough
to model reionization globally but with enough resolving power to follow all atomic-cooling galactic
halos in that volume. For every halo identified at a given time, we find the redshift at which the surrounding
IGM reionized, along with its instantaneous star formation rate (`SFR') and baryonic gas-to-dark
matter ratio ($M_\text{gas}/M_\text{DM}$). The average SFR per halo with $M < 10^9 \text{ M}_\odot$
was steady in regions not yet reionized, but declined sharply following local reionization. For
$M > 10^{10} \text{ M}_\odot$, this SFR continued through local reionization, increasing with
time, instead. For $10^9 < M < 10^{10} \text{ M}_\odot$, the SFR generally increased modestly through
reionization, followed by a modest decline. In general, halo SFRs were higher for regions that reionized
earlier. A similar pattern was found for $M_\text{gas}/M_\text{DM}$, which declined sharply
following local reionization for $M < 10^9 \text{ M}_\odot$. Local reionization time correlates
with local matter overdensity, which determines the local rates of structure formation and ionizing
photon consumption. The earliest patches to develop structure and reionize ultimately produced
more stars than they needed to finish and maintain their own reionization, exporting their `surplus'
starlight to help reionize regions that developed structure later.
