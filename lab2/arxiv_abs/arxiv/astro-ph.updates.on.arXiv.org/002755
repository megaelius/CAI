POLARBEAR-2 is a next-generation receiver for precision measurements of the polarization of the
cosmic microwave background (Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)). Scheduled to deploy in early
2015, it will observe alongside the existing POLARBEAR-1 receiver, on a new telescope in the Simons
Array on Cerro Toco in the Atacama desert of Chile. For increased sensitivity, it will feature a larger
area focal plane, with a total of 7,588 polarization sensitive antenna-coupled Transition Edge
Sensor (TES) bolometers, with a design sensitivity of 4.1 uKrt(s). The focal plane will be cooled
to 250 milliKelvin, and the bolometers will be read-out with 40x frequency domain multiplexing,
with 36 optical bolometers on a single SQUID amplifier, along with 2 dark bolometers and 2 calibration
resistors. To increase the multiplexing factor from 8x for POLARBEAR-1 to 40x for POLARBEAR-2 requires
additional bandwidth for SQUID readout and well-defined frequency channel spacing. Extending
to these higher frequencies requires new components and design for the LC filters which define channel
spacing. The LC filters are cold resonant circuits with an inductor and capacitor in series with
each bolometer, and stray inductance in the wiring and equivalent series resistance from the capacitors
can affect bolometer operation. We present results from characterizing these new readout components.
Integration of the readout system is being done first on a small scale, to ensure that the readout
system does not affect bolometer sensitivity or stability, and to validate the overall system before
expansion into the full receiver. We present the status of readout integration, and the initial
results and status of components for the full array.
