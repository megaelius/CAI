Motivated by the discovery of large-scale ionized clouds around AGN host galaxies, and particularly
the large fraction of those which are consistent with photoionized gaseous tidal debris, we have
searched for [O III] emission over wide fields around a set of Seyfert galaxies previously mapped
in H I, many of which show extended gas features. The detection threshold was designed to reach mean
emission-line surface brightness 10 times fainter than seen in such AGN-ionized clouds as Hanny's
Voorwerp, so that similar structures at larger distances (and ages) could be detected. Of 24 Seyfert
galaxies, we find one extended emission feature, a discrete cloud projected 12 kpc from the center
of Mkn 1 and spanning a transverse extent of 8 kpc. Optical spectroscopy of the Mkn 1 cloud confirms
its redshift association with the Mkn 1- NGC 451 galaxy pair, shows it to closely match the kinematics
of nearby H I, and reveals emission-line ratios requiring photoionization by the AGN at roughly
the direct observed luminosity of the nucleus. Given the small fraction of H I features with detected
[O III] emission, we constrain the typical opening angle of ionization cones in Seyfert galaxies
to be of order 20 deg, if active episodes are long compared to the light-travel times involved. An
appendix presents a derivation of an analytical expression for the probability of intersection
of a cone with randomly oriented arcs, approximating the geometry of H I clouds and tails exposed
to ionization cones. For the entire sample, the full opening angle of bicones must be <20 deg if the
AGN are continuously bright for scales longer than the light-travel times across the H I structures.
Since many ionization cones are observed to be much broader than this, our low detection fraction
may add to evidence for the ubiquity of strong variations in AGN luminosity on scales 10,000-100,000
years.
