In recent years the global seismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power and for the
large frequency separation have caught the attention of various fields of astrophysics. With the
exquisite photometry of \textit{Kepler}, the uncertainties in the seismic observables are small
enough to estimate masses and radii with a precision of only a few per cent. Even though this seems
to work quite well for main-sequence stars, there is empirical evidence, mainly from studies of
eclipsing binary systems, that the seismic scaling relations overestimate the mass and radius
of red giants by about 15 and 5\%, respectively. Model-based corrections of the $\Delta\nu -$scaling
reduce the problem but do not solve it. We re-examine the global oscillation parameters of the giants
in the binary systems in order to determine their seismic fundamental parameters and find them to
agree with the dynamic parameters from the literature if we adopt nonlinear scalings. We note that
a curvature and glitch corrected $\Delta\nu_\mathrm{cor}$ should be preferred over a local or
average values. We then compare the observed seismic parameters of the cluster giants to those scaled
from independent measurements and find the same nonlinear behaviour as for the eclipsing binaries.
Our final proposed scaling relations are based on both samples and cover a broad range of evolutionary
stages from RGB to RC stars: $g/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{eff}} = (\nu_\mathrm{max}/\nu_\mathrm{max,\odot})^{1.0075\pm0.0021}$
and $\sqrt{\bar\rho} = (\Delta\nu_\mathrm{cor}/\Delta\nu_\mathrm{cor,\odot})[\eta - (0.0085\pm0.0025)
\log^2 (\Delta\nu_\mathrm{cor}/\Delta\nu_\mathrm{cor,\odot})]^{-1}$, where $g$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$,
and $\bar\rho$ are in solar units, $\nu_\mathrm{max,\odot}=3140\pm5\mu$Hz and $\Delta\nu_\mathrm{cor,\odot}=135.08\pm0.02\mu$Hz
, and $\eta$ is equal to one in case of RGB stars and $1.04\pm0.01$ for RC stars.
