Multi-instrument observations of two filament eruptions on 24 February and 11 May 2011 suggest
the following updated scenario for eruptive flare, CME and shock wave evolution. An initial destabilization
of a filament results in stretching out of magnetic threads belonging to its body and rooted in the
photosphere along the inversion line. Their reconnection leads to i) heating of parts of the filament
or its environment, ii) initial development of the flare arcade cusp and ribbons, and iii) increasing
similarity of the filament to a curved flux rope and its acceleration. Then the pre-eruption arcade
enveloping the filament gets involved in reconnection according to the standard model and continues
to form the flare arcade and ribbons. The poloidal magnetic flux in the curved rope developing from
the filament progressively increases and forces its toroidal expansion. This flux rope impulsively
expands and produces an MHD disturbance, which rapidly steepens into a shock. The shock passes through
the arcade expanding above the filament and then freely propagates ahead of the CME like a decelerating
blast wave for some time. If the CME is slow, then the shock eventually decays. Otherwise, the frontal
part of the shock changes into the bow-shock regime. This was observed for the first time in the 24
February 2011 event. When reconnection ceases, the flux rope relaxes and constitutes the CME core-cavity
system. The expanding arcade develops into the CME frontal structure. We also found that reconnection
in the current sheet of a remote streamer forced by the shock's passage results in a running flare-like
process within the streamer responsible for a type II burst. The development of dimming and various
associated phenomena are discussed.
