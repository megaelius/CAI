We present a large homogeneous set of stellar parameters and abundances across a broad range of metallicities,
involving $13$ classical dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and ultra-faint dSph (UFD) galaxies. In total
this study includes $380$ stars in Fornax, Sagittarius, Sculptor, Sextans, Carina, Ursa Minor,
Draco, Reticulum II, Bootes I, Ursa Major II, Leo I, Segue I, and Triangulum II. This sample represents
the largest, homogeneous, high-resolution study of dSph galaxies to date. With our homogeneously
derived catalog, we are able to search for similar and deviating trends across different galaxies.
We investigate the mass dependence of the individual systems on the production of $\alpha$-elements,
but also try to shed light on the long-standing puzzle of the dominant production site of r-process
elements. We use data from the Keck observatory archive and the ESO reduced archive to reanalyze
stars from these $13$ dSph galaxies. We automatize the step of obtaining stellar parameters, but
run a full spectrum synthesis to derive all abundances except for iron. The homogenized set of abundances
yielded the unique possibility to derive a relation between the onset of type Ia supernovae and the
stellar mass of the galaxy. Furthermore, we derived a formula to estimate the evolution of $\alpha$-elements.
Placing all abundances consistently on the same scale is crucial to answer questions about the chemical
history of galaxies. By homogeneously analysing Ba and Eu in the 13 systems, we have traced the onset
of the s-process and found it to increase with metallicity as a function of the galaxy's stellar mass.
Moreover, the r-process material correlates with the $\alpha$-elements indicating some co-production
of these, which in turn would point towards rare core-collapse supernovae rather than binary neutron
star mergers as host for the r-process at low [Fe/H] in the investigated dSph systems.
