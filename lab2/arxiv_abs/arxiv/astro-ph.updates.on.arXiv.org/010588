Exoplanet science is one of the most thriving fields of modern astrophysics. A major goal is the atmospheric
characterization of dozens of small, terrestrial exoplanets in order to search for signatures
in their atmospheres that indicate biological activity, assess their ability to provide conditions
for life as we know it, and investigate their expected atmospheric diversity. None of the currently
adopted projects or missions, from ground or in space, can address these goals. In this White Paper
we argue that a large space-based mission designed to detect and investigate thermal emission spectra
of terrestrial exoplanets in the MIR wavelength range provides unique scientific potential to
address these goals and surpasses the capabilities of other approaches. While NASA might be focusing
on large missions that aim to detect terrestrial planets in reflected light, ESA has the opportunity
to take leadership and spearhead the development of a large MIR exoplanet mission within the scope
of the "Voyage 2050" long-term plan establishing Europe at the forefront of exoplanet science for
decades to come. Given the ambitious science goals of such a mission, additional international
partners might be interested in participating and contributing to a roadmap that, in the long run,
leads to a successful implementation. A new, dedicated development program funded by ESA to help
reduce development and implementation cost and further push some of the required key technologies
would be a first important step in this direction. Ultimately, a large MIR exoplanet imaging mission
will be needed to help answer one of mankind's most fundamental questions: "How unique is our Earth?"
