We present a statistical study on the orientation of outflows with respect to large-scale filaments
and the magnetic fields. Although filaments are widely observed toward Galactic star-forming
regions, the exact role of filaments in star formation is unclear. Studies toward low-mass star-forming
regions revealed both preferred and random orientation of outflows respective to the filament
long-axes, while outflows in massive star-forming regions mostly oriented perpendicular to the
host filaments, and parallel to the magnetic fields at similar physical scales. Here, we explore
outflows in a sample of 11 protoclusters in HII regions, a more evolved stage compared to IRDCs, using
ALMA CO (3-2) line observations. We identify a total of 105 outflow lobes in these protoclusters.
Among the 11 targets, 7 are embedded within parsec-scale filamentary structures detected in $^{13}$CO
line and 870 $\mu m$ continuum emissions. The angles between outflow axes and corresponding filaments
($\gamma_\mathrm{Fil}$) do not show any hint of preferred orientations (i.e., orthogonal or parallel
as inferred in numerical models) with respect to the position angle of the filaments. Identified
outflow lobes are also not correlated with the magnetic fields and Galactic plane position angles.
Outflows associated with filaments aligned along the large-scale magnetic fields are also randomly
orientated. Our study presents the first statistical results of outflow orientation respective
to large-scale filaments and magnetic fields in evolved massive star-forming regions. The random
distribution suggests a lack of alignment of outflows with filaments, which may be a result of the
evolutionary stage of the clusters.
