As part of our effort to search for circumstellar disks around high-mass stellar objects, we observed
the well-known core G31.41+0.31 with ALMA at 1.4 mm with an angular resolution of~0.22" (~1700 au).
The dust continuum emission has been resolved into two cores namely Main and NE. The Main core, which
has the stronger emission and is the more chemically rich, has a diameter of ~5300 au, and is associated
with two free-free continuum sources. The Main core looks featureless and homogeneous in dust continuum
emission and does not present any hint of fragmentation. Each transition of CH3CN and CH3OCHO, both
ground and vibrationally excited, as well as those of CH3CN isotopologues, shows a clear velocity
gradient along the NE-SW direction, with velocity linearly increasing with distance from the center,
consistent with solid-body rotation. However, when comparing the velocity field of transitions
with different upper level energies, the rotation velocity increases with increasing energy of
the transition, which suggests that the rotation speeds up towards the center. Spectral lines towards
the dust continuum peak show an inverse P-Cygni profile that supports the existence of infall in
the core. The infall velocity increases with the energy of the transition suggesting that the infall
is accelerating towards the center of the core, consistent with gravitational collapse. Despite
the monolithic appearance of the Main core, the presence of red-shifted absorption, the existence
of two embedded free-free sources at the center, and the rotational spin-up are consistent with
an unstable core undergoing fragmentation with infall and differential rotation due to conservation
of angular momentum. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the monolithic morphology is that
the large opacity of the dust emission prevents the detection of any inhomogeneity in the core.
