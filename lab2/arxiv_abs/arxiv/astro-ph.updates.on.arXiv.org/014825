RE J1034+396 displays the so far detected most significant X-ray Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO)
in AGN. We perform a detailed spectral-timing analysis on the data using recent simultaneous XMM-Newton,
NuSTAR and Swift observations. We present the detailed energy dependence of the QPO's frequency,
rms, coherence and phase lag. We construct various frequency-resolved variability spectra, which
are modelled together with the time-averaged spectra. Our study shows that four components are
required to fit all the spectra, including an inner disc component (diskbb), two warm corona components
(CompTT-1 and CompTT-2) and a hot corona component (nthComp). An important discovery is that within
the two warm corona components, CompTT-2 (the hotter, less luminous component) contains the QPO
signal, while the stochastic variability is concentrated in CompTT-1. These components also allow
us to fit the lag-energy spectra, as well as being able to describe the previous observation of a strong
QPO in 2007, and the absent QPO observations, by varying only the relative normalizations of these
components. Our multi-wavelength study shows that the QPO's detectability does not depend on the
contemporaneous mass accretion rate through the outer disc as estimated from the UV flux. We do not
detect a significant Iron K$\alpha$ line, nor any significant reflection component hump. Finally,
we show that the rms and lag spectra of RE J1034+396 in the recent observation are very similar to the
67 Hz QPO in the micro-quasar GRS 1915+105. These new results reinforce the physical analogy between
the two sources. We speculate that the QPO in both sources is due to expansion/contraction of the
inner disc vertical structure.
