A new non-hydrostatic and cloud-resolving atmospheric model is developed for studying moist convection
and cloud formation in planetary atmospheres. It is built on top of the Athena++ framework, utilizing
its static/adaptive mesh-refinement, parallelization, curvilinear geometry, and dynamic task
scheduling. We extend the original hydrodynamic solver to vapors, clouds, and precipitation.
Microphysics is formulated generically so that it can be applied to both Earth and Jovian planets.
We implemented the Low Mach number Approximate Riemann Solver (LMARS) for simulating low speed
atmospheric flows in addition to the usual Roe and HLLC Riemann solvers. Coupled with a fifth-order
Weighted Essentially Nonoscillatory (WENO) subgrid-reconstruction method, the sharpness of
critical fields such as clouds is well-preserved, and no extra hyperviscosity or spatial filter
is needed to stabilize the model. Unlike many atmospheric models, total energy is used as the prognostic
variable of the thermodynamic equation. One significant advantage of using total energy as a prognostic
variable is that the entropy production due to irreversible mixing process can be properly captured.
The model is designed to provide a unified framework for exploring planetary atmospheres across
various conditions, both terrestrial and Jovian. First, a series of standard numerical tests for
Earth's atmosphere is carried out to demonstrate the performance and robustness of the new model.
Second, simulation of an idealized Jovian atmosphere in radiative-convective equilibrium shows
that 1) the temperature gradient is superadiabatic near the water condensation level because of
the changing of the mean molecular weight, and 2) the mean profile of ammonia gas shows a depletion
in the subcloud layer down to nearly 10 bars. Relevance to the recent Juno observations is discussed.
