While the importance of detecting the Global spectral signatures of the red-shifted 21-cm line
of atomic hydrogen from the very early epochs cannot be overstated, the associated challenges primarily
include isolating the weak signal of interest from the orders of magnitude brighter foregrounds,
and extend equally to reliably establishing the origin of the {\it apparent} global signal to the
very early epochs. This letter presents a novel model-independent path toward isolating the foreground
contribution, and proposes a critical test that the measurements of the monopole component of the
spectrum of interest should necessarily pass. Our foreground estimator uses the diurnal pattern
readily apparent in drift-scan observations. Our criterion for validating the monopole signature
is based on a unique correspondence between the intrinsic monopole spectrum and the differential
spectrum as an imprint of dipole anisotropy resulting from motion of observer with respect to the
rest frame of our source (such as that of our Solar system, interpreted from the dipole anisotropy
in CMBR). More importantly, the spectral manifestation of the dipole anisotropy gets {\it amplified}
by a significant factor, depending on the monopole spectral slopes, rendering it feasible to measure.
We describe details of such a test, and illustrate its application with the help of simulations.
Such foreground estimation technique, combined with the dipole qualifier for the monopole spectrum
is expected to pave way for in situ validation of spectral signatures from early epochs, important
to presently reported and future detections of EoR signal.
