Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) are generally thought to result from the merger of two neutron stars
or the merger of a neutron star with a black hole. It is becoming standard practise to model these mergers
with hydrodynamical simulations that employ equations of state that are derived, for example,
for determining the behaviour of matter in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), and which therefore
make use of the assumption that the matter is hot and in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). In
this Letter we draw attention to the fact that the hydrodynamical timescale (roughly the gravitational
timescale of the neutron star) may be several orders of magnitude shorter than the timescale on which
such equilibrium can be re-established in the tidal debris ejected during a sGRB, and that on the
initial decompression timescales the unshocked tidal ejecta may remain sufficiently cool that
the employed equations of state are not appropriate for modelling the dynamics of this part of the
flow. On timescales short compared with the timescale on which NSE can be (re)established, the equation
of state can remain relatively stiff and thus the stream of tidal debris can remain narrow and vulnerable
to gravitational instability, as has recently been suggested. These findings suggest that estimates
of the type and abundances of heavy elements formed in short gamma-ray bursts need to be revisited.
We suggest that the most direct method of testing the physical and dynamical properties of tidal
ejecta in sGRBs will come from modelling of their light curves, which provides the cleanest source
of information on the system dynamics.
