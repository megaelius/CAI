Observations reveal a correspondence between chromospheric type II spicules and bright upwardly
moving fronts in the corona observed in the EUV band. However, theoretical considerations suggest
that these flows are unlikely to be the main source of heating in coronal magnetic loops. We investigate
the propagation of high-speed chromospheric flows into coronal magnetic flux tubes, and the possible
production of emission in the EUV band. We simulate the propagation of a dense $10^4$ K chromospheric
jet upwards along a coronal loop, by means of a 2-D cylindrical MHD model, including gravity, radiative
losses, thermal conduction and magnetic induction. The jet propagates in a complete atmosphere
including the chromosphere and a tenuous cool ($\sim 0.8$ MK) corona, linked through a steep transition
region. In our reference model, the jet's initial speed is 70 km/s, its initial density is $10^{11}$
cm$^{-3}$, and the ambient uniform magnetic field is 10 G. We explore also other values of jet speed
and density in 1-D, and of magnetic field in 2-D, and the jet propagation in a hotter ($\sim 1.5$ MK)
background loop. While the initial speed of the jet does not allow it to reach the loop apex, a hot shock
front develops ahead of it and travels to the other extreme of the loop. The shock front compresses
the coronal plasma and heats it to about $10^6$ K. As a result, a bright moving front becomes visible
in the 171 \AA\ channel of the SDO/AIA mission. This result generally applies to all the other explored
cases, except for the propagation in the hotter loop. For a cool, low-density initial coronal loop,
the post-shock plasma ahead of upward chromospheric flows might explain at least part of the observed
correspondence between type II spicules and EUV emission excess.
