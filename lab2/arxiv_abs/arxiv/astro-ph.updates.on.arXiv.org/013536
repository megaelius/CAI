Context: Dust in late-type galaxies in the local Universe is responsible for absorbing approximately
one third of the energy emitted by stars. It is often assumed that dust heating is mainly attributable
to the absorption of UV and optical photons emitted by the youngest (<= 100 Myr) stars. Consequently,
thermal re-emission by dust at FIR wavelengths is often linked to the star-formation activity of
a galaxy. However, several studies argue that the contribution to dust heating by much older stars
might be more significant. Advances in radiation transfer (RT) simulations finally allow us to
actually quantify the heating mechanisms of diffuse dust by the stellar radiation field. Aims:
As one of the main goals in the DustPedia project, we have constructed detailed 3D stellar and dust
RT models for nearby galaxies. We analyse the contribution of the different stellar populations
to the dust heating in four face-on barred galaxies: NGC1365, M83, M95, and M100. We aim to quantify
the fraction directly related to young stars, both globally and on local scales, and to assess the
influence of the bar on the heating fraction. Results: We derive global attenuation laws for each
galaxy and confirm that galaxies of high sSFR have shallower attenuation curves and weaker UV bumps.
On average, 36.5% of the bolometric luminosity is absorbed by dust. We report a clear effect of the
bar structure on the radial profiles of the dust-heating fraction by the young stars, and the dust
temperature. We find that the young stars are the main contributors to the dust heating, donating,
on average ~59% of their luminosity to this purpose throughout the galaxy. This dust-heating fraction
drops to ~53% in the bar region and ~38% in the bulge region where the old stars are the dominant contributors
to the dust heating. We also find a strong link between the heating fraction by the young stars and
the sSFR.
