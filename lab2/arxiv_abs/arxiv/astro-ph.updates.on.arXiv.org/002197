The measurement of the anisotropy in the arrival direction of cosmic rays is complementary to the
study of their energy spectrum and chemical composition to understand their origin and propagation.
It is also a tool to probe the structure of the magnetic fields through which cosmic rays travel. As
cosmic rays are mostly charged nuclei, their trajectories are deflected by the action of galactic
magnetic field they propagate through before reaching the Earth atmosphere, so that their detection
carries directional information only up to distances as large as their gyro-radius. If cosmic rays
below $10^{15}{\rm\,eV}$ are considered and the local galactic magnetic field ($\sim3{\rm\,\mu
G}$) is accounted for, gyro-radii are so short that isotropy is expected. At most, a weak di-polar
distribution may exist, reflecting the contribution of the closest CR sources. However, a number
of experiments observed an energy-dependent \emph{"large scale"} anisotropy in the sidereal
time frame with an amplitude of about 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-3}$, revealing the existence of two distinct
broad regions: an excess distributed around 40$^{\circ}$ to 90$^{\circ}$ in Right Ascension (commonly
referred to as "tail.in" excess) and a deficit (the "loss cone") around 150$^{\circ}$ to 240$^{\circ}$
in Right Ascension. In recent years the Milagro and ARGO-YBJ collaborations reported the of a "medium"
scale anisotropy inside the tail-in region. The observation of such small features has been recently
claimed by the IceCube experiment also in the Southern hemisphere. So far, no theory of cosmic rays
in the Galaxy exists which is able to explain the origin of these different anisotropies leaving
the standard model of cosmic rays and that of the galactic magnetic field unchanged at the same time.
