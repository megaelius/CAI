The spectrum of an exoplanet reveals the physical, chemical, and biological processes that have
shaped its history and govern its future. However, observations of exoplanet spectra are complicated
by the overwhelming glare of their host stars. This review chapter focuses on high resolution spectroscopy
(HRS; R=25,000-100,000), which helps to disentangle and isolate the exoplanet's spectrum. At
high spectral resolution, molecular features are resolved into a dense forest of individual lines
in a pattern that is unique for a given molecule. For close-in planets, the spectral lines undergo
large Doppler shifts during the planet's orbit, while the host star and Earth's spectral features
remain essentially stationary, enabling a velocity separation of the planet. For slower-moving,
wide-orbit planets, HRS aided by high contrast imaging instead isolates their spectra using their
spatial separation. The lines in the exoplanet spectrum are detected by comparing them with high
resolution spectra from atmospheric modelling codes; essentially a form of fingerprinting for
exoplanet atmospheres. This measures the planet's orbital velocity, and helps define its true
mass and orbital inclination. Consequently, HRS can detect both transiting and non-transiting
planets. It also simultaneously characterizes the planet's atmosphere due to its sensitivity
to the depth, shape, and position of the planet's spectral lines. These are altered by the planet's
atmospheric composition, structure, clouds, and dynamics, including day-to-night winds and
its rotation period. This chapter describes the HRS technique in detail, highlighting its successes
in exoplanet detection and characterization, and concludes with the future prospects of using
HRS to identify biomarkers on nearby rocky worlds, and map features in the atmospheres of giant exoplanets.
