The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expected to enable transformational progress in studying
galaxy populations in the very early Universe, during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). A critical
parameter for understanding the sources that reionized the Universe is the Lyman-continuum production
efficiency, $\xi_{\rm ion}$, defined as the rate of production of ionizing photons divided by the
intrinsic UV luminosity. In this work, we combine self-consistent star formation and chemical
enrichment histories predicted by semi-analytic models of galaxy formation with stellar population
synthesis (SPS) models to predict the expected dependence of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ on galaxy properties
and cosmic epoch from $z=4-10$. We then explore the sensitivity of the production rate of ionizing
photons, $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$, to the choice of SPS model and the treatment of stellar feedback in
our galaxy formation model. We compare our results to those of other simulations, constraints from
empirical models, and observations. We find that adopting SPS models that include binary stars
predict about a factor of two more ionizing radiation than models that only assume single stellar
populations. We find that UV-faint, low-mass galaxies have values of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ about 0.25
dex higher than those of more massive galaxies, but find weak evolution with cosmic time, about 0.2
dex from $z\sim 12-4$ at fixed rest-UV luminosity. We provide predictions of $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$
as a function of $M_{\rm h}$ and a number of other galaxy properties. All results presented in this
