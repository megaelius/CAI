The hypothesis of the self-induced collapse of the inflaton wave function was introduced as a candidate
for the physical process responsible for the emergence of inhomogeneity and anisotropy at all scales.
In particular, we consider different proposal for the precise form of the dynamics of the inflaton
wave function: i) the GRW-type collapse schemes proposals based on spontaneous individual collapses
which generate non-vanishing expectation values of various physical quantities taken as ansatz
modifications of the standard inflationary scenario; ii) the proposal based on a Continuous Spontaneous
Localization (CSL) type modification of the Schr\"odinger evolution of the inflaton wave function,
based on a natural choice of collapse operator. We perform a systematic analysis within the semi-classical
gravity approximation, of the standing of those models considering a full quasi-de sitter expansion
scenario. We note that the predictions for the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and
polarization spectrum differ slightly from those of the standard cosmological model. We also analyse
these proposals with a Bayesian model comparison using recent CMB and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations
(BAO) data. Our results show a moderate preference of the joint CMB and BAO data for one of the studied
collapse schemes model over the $\Lambda$CDM one, while there is no preference when only CMB data
are considered. Additionally, analysis using CMB data provide the same Bayesian evidence for both
the CSL and standard models, i.e. the data have not preference between the simplicity of the LCDM
model and the complexity of the collapse scenario.
