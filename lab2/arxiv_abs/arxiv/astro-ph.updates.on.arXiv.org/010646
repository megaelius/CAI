A quasar main sequence is widely believed to reveal itself through objects represented in a plane
spanned by two parameters: the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of H$\beta{}$, and the ratio of
Fe II to H$\beta{}$ equivalent width. This sequence is related to the application to quasar properties
of principal component analysis (PCA), which reveals that the main axis of variance (Eigenvector
1) is co-directional with a strong anti-correlation between these two measurements. We aim to determine
whether the dominance of two Eigenvectors, originally discovered over two decades ago, is replicated
in newer high-quality quasar samples. If so, we aim to test if a non-linear approach is an improvement
on the linear PCA method by finding two new parameters which represent a more accurate projection
of the variances than the Eigenvectors recovered from PCA. We selected quasars from the XSHOOTER
archive and a major quasar catalog to build high quality samples. These samples were tested with
PCA. We find that the new high-quality samples do indeed have two dominant Eigenvectors as originally
discovered. Subsequently we find that the fitting of a non-linear decay curve to the main sequence
allows a new plane spanned by linearly independent axes to be defined, based on the distance along
the decay curve as the main axis and the distance of each quasar datapoint from the curve as the secondary
axis respectively. The results show that it is possible to define a new plane based on the quasar main
sequence which accounts for the majority of the variance. The most likely candidate for the new main
axis is an anti-correlation with black hole mass. In this case the secondary axis likely represents
luminosity. However, given the results of previous studies, inclination angle likely plays a role
in H$\beta{}$ width.
