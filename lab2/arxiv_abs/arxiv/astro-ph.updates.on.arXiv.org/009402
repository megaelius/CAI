We present deep continuum observations at a wavelength of 2mm centered on the COSMOS field using
the Goddard IRAM Superconducting Millimeter Observer (GISMO) at the IRAM 30m-telescope. These
data constitute the widest deep 2mm survey to-date, reaching a uniform $\sigma\sim0.23$mJy beam$^{-1}$
sensitivity over $\sim250$arcmin$^2$ at $\sim\,24''$ resolution. We detect four sources at high
significance (S/N$\,\geq\,$4.4) with an expected number of false detection of 0.09 sources, and
five sources at $4.4>\,$S/N$\,\geq\,3.7$ with an expected number of false detection of 1.65 sources.
Combined with deep GISMO observations in GOODS-N, we constrain the 2mm number counts over one decade
in flux density. These measurements agree with most galaxy evolution models tested here, except
those with large population of dusty star-forming galaxies at $z>7$. Five GISMO sources have counterparts
in (sub-)millimeter catalogs available in COSMOS. Their redshifts suggest that all but one lie
above $z\sim3$. These four high-redshift ($z>3$) galaxies have $\tilde{z}=3.9$, SFRs $\sim\,$400
- 1200M$_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$ and $M_{\rm dust}\sim10^{9.5}\,$M$_{\odot}$. They provide a
relatively complete selection ($\sim66\%$) of the most luminous ($L_{\rm IR}>10^{12.6}\,$L$_{\odot}$)
and highest redshift ($z>3$) galaxies detected within our survey area by AzTEC at 1.1mm. We thus
conclude that 2mm surveys favor the selection of massive, vigorously star-forming, high-redshift
galaxies. This is corroborated by GISMO-C4, a source with a low false detection probability ($\sim\,6.2\%$),
for which the absence of a (sub-)millimeter counterpart supports a high redshift origin ($z\gtrsim3$).
