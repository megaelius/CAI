We present a catalog of RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) observed by the Xuyi Schmidt Telescope Photometric
Survey (XDSS). The area we consider is located in the North Galactic Cap, covering 376.75 sq deg at
RA $\approx$ 150 deg and Dec $\approx$ 27 deg down to a magnitude limit of i $\approx$ 19. Using the
variability information afforded by the multi-epoch nature of our XDSS data, combined with colors
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we are able to identify candidate RRLs. We find 318 candidates,
derive distances to them and estimate the detection efficiency. The majority of our candidates
have more than 12 observations and for these we are able to calculate periods. These also allows us
to estimate our contamination level, which we predict is between 30% to 40%. Finally we use the sample
to probe the halo density profile in the 9-49 kpc range and find that it can be well fitted by a double
power law. We find good agreement between this model and the models derived for the South Galactic
Cap using the Watkins et al. (2009) and Sesar et al. (2010) RRL data-sets, after accounting for possible
contamination in our data-set from Sagittarius stream members. We consider non-spherical double
power law models of the halo density profile and again find agreement with literature data-sets,
although we have limited power to constrain the flattening due to our small survey area. Much tighter
constraints will be placed by current and future wide-area surveys, most notably ESA's astrometric
Gaia mission. Our analysis demonstrates that surveys with a limited number of epochs can effectively
be mined for RRLs. Our complete sample is provided as accompanying online material.
