Astrometric and spectroscopic monitoring of individual stars orbiting the supermassive black
hole in the Galactic Center offer a promising way to detect general relativistic effects. While
low-order effects are expected to be detected following the periastron passage of S2 in Spring 2018,
detecting higher-order effects due to black hole spin will require the discovery of closer stars.
In this paper, we set out to determine the requirements such a star would have to satisfy to allow the
detection of black hole spin. We focus on the instrument GRAVITY, which saw first light in 2016 and
which is expected to achieve astrometric accuracies $10-100 \mu$as. For an observing campaign
with duration $T$ years, $N_{obs}$ total observations, astrometric precision $\sigma_x$ and
normalized black hole spin $\chi$, we find that $a_{orb}(1-e^2)^{3/4} \lesssim 300 R_S \sqrt{\frac{T}{4
\text{years}}} \left(\frac{N_{obs}}{120}\right)^{0.25} \sqrt{\frac{10 \mu as}{\sigma_x}}
\sqrt{\frac{\chi}{0.9}}$ is needed. For $\chi=0.9$ and a potential observing campaign with $\sigma_x
= 10 \mu$as, 30 observations/year and duration 4-10 years, we expect $\sim 0.1$ star with $K<19$
satisfying this constraint based on the current knowledge about the stellar population in the central
1". We also propose a method through which GRAVITY could potentially measure radial velocities
with precision $\sim 50$ km/s. If the astrometric precision can be maintained, adding radial velocity
information increases the expected number of stars by roughly a factor of two. While we focus on GRAVITY,
the results can also be scaled to parameters relevant for future extremely large telescopes.
