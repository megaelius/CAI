The Zombie Vortex Instability (ZVI) occurs in the dead zones of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) where
perturbations excite baroclinic critical layers, generating "zombie" vortices and turbulence.
In this work, we investigate ZVI with nonuniform vertical stratification; while ZVI is triggered
in the stratified regions away from the midplane, the subsequent turbulence propagates into and
fills the midplane. ZVI turbulence alters the background Keplerian shear flow, creating a steady-state
zonal flow. Intermittency is observed, where the flow cycles through near-laminar phases of zonal
flow punctuated by chaotic bursts of new vortices. ZVI persists in the presence of radiative damping,
as long as the thermal relaxation timescale is more than a few orbital periods. We refute the premature
claim by Lesur & Latter (2016) that radiative damping inhibits ZVI for disk radii r>0.3 au. Their
conclusions were based on unrealistically short cooling times using opacities with virtually
no grain growth. We explore different grain growth and vertical settling scenarios, and find that
the gas and dust in off-midplane regions are not necessarily in local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE) with each other. In such cases, thermal relaxation timescales can be orders of magnitude longer
than the optically thin cooling times assuming LTE because of the finite time for energy to be exchanged
between gas and dust grains via collisions. With minimal amounts of grain growth and dust settling,
the off-midplane regions of disks are susceptible to ZVI and much of the planet-forming regions
can be filled with zombie vortices and turbulence.
