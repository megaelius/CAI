We present scaling relations between the integrated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) signal,
$Y_{\rm SZ}$, its X-ray analogue, $Y_{\rm X}$$\equiv$$M_{\rm gas}$$T_{\rm X}$, and total mass,
$M_{\rm tot}$, for the 45 galaxy clusters in the Bolocam X-ray-SZ (BOXSZ) sample. All parameters
are integrated within $r_{2500}$. $Y_{2500}$ values are measured using SZE data collected with
Bolocam, operating at 140 GHz at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). The temperature,
$T_{\rm X}$, and mass, $M_{\rm gas,2500}$, of the intracluster medium are determined using X-ray
data collected with \emph{Chandra}, and $M_{\rm tot}$ is derived from $M_{\rm gas}$ using a constant
gas mass fraction. Our analysis accounts for several potential sources of bias, including: selection
effects, contamination from radio point sources, and the loss of SZE signal due to noise filtering
and beam-smoothing effects. We measure the $Y_{2500}$-$Y_{\rm X}$ scaling to have a logarithmic
slope of $0.84\pm0.07$, and a fractional intrinsic scatter in $Y_{2500}$ of $21\pm7%$ at fixed
$Y_{\rm X}$, both of which are consistent with previous analyses. We also measure the scaling between
$Y_{2500}$ and $M_{2500}$, finding a logarithmic slope of $1.06\pm0.12$ and a fractional scatter
in $Y_{2500}$ at fixed mass of $25\pm9%$. While recent SZE scaling relations using X-ray mass proxies
have found slopes consistent with the self-similar prediction of 5/3, our measurement stands apart
by differing from the self-similar prediction by approximately 5$\sigma$. Given the good agreement
between the measured $Y_{2500}$-$Y_{\rm X}$ scalings, much of this discrepancy appears to be caused
by differences in the calibration of the X-ray mass proxies adopted for each particular analysis.
