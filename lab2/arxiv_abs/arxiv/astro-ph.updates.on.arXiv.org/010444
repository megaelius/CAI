We numerically explore how the subhalo mass-loss evolution is affected by the tidal coherences
measured along different eigenvector directions. The mean virial-to-accretion mass ratios of
the subhalos are used to quantify the severity of their mass-loss evolutions within the hosts, and
the tidal coherence is expressed as an array of three numbers each of which quantifies the alignment
between the tidal fields smoothed on the scales of $2$ and $30\,h^{-1}$Mpc in each direction of three
principal axes. Using a Rockstar halo catalog retrieved from a N-body simulation, we investigate
if and how the mass-loss evolutions of the subhalos hosted by distinct halos at fixed mass scale of
[$1$-$3$]$10^{14}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ are correlated with three components of the tidal coherence.
The tides coherent along different eigenvector directions are found to have different effects
on the subhalo mass-loss evolution, which cannot be ascribed to the differences in the densities
and ellipticities of the local environments. It is shown that the substructures surrounded by the
tides highly coherent along the first eigenvector direction and highly {\it incoherent} along
the third eigenvector direction experience the least severe mass-loss evolution, while the tides
highly {\it incoherent} only along the first eigenvector direction is responsible for the most
severe mass-loss evolution of the subhalos. Explaining that the coherent tides have an obstructing
effect on the satellite infalls onto their hosts and that the strength of the obstruction effect
depends on which directions the tides are coherent or {\it incoherent} along, we suggest that the
multidimensional dependence of the substructure evolution on the tidal coherence should be deeply
related to the complex nature of the large-scale assembly bias.
