We characterised five transiting planetary systems (HAT-P-3, HAT-P-12, HAT-P-22, WASP-39 and
WASP-60) and determined their sky-projected planet orbital obliquity through the measurement
of the RM effect. We used HARPS-N high-precision radial velocity measurements, gathered during
transit events, to measure the RM effect in the target systems and determine the sky-projected angle
between the planetary orbital plane and the stellar equator. The characterisation of stellar atmospheric
parameters was performed exploiting the HARPS-N spectra, using line equivalent width ratios,
and spectral synthesis methods. Photometric parameters of the five transiting exoplanets were
re-analysed through 17 new light curves, obtained with an array of medium-class telescopes, and
other light curves from the literature. Survey-time-series photometric data were analysed for
determining the rotation periods of the five stars and their spin inclination. From the analysis
of the RM effect we derived a sky-projected obliquity of 21.2 degree, -54 degree, -2.1 degree, 0 degree
and -129 degree for HAT-P-3b, HAT-P-12b, HAT-P-22b, WASP-39b and WASP-60b, respectively. The
latter value indicates that WASP-60b is moving on a retrograde orbit. These values represent the
first measurements of \lambda for the five exoplanetary systems under study. The stellar activity
of HAT-P-22 indicates a rotation period of 28.7 days, which allowed us to estimate the true misalignment
angle of HAT-P-22b, \psi=24 degree. The revision of the physical parameters of the five exoplanetary
systems returned values fully compatible with those existing in the literature, with the exception
of the WASP-60 system, for which, based on higher quality spectroscopic and photometric data, we
found a more massive and younger star, and a larger and hotter planet.
