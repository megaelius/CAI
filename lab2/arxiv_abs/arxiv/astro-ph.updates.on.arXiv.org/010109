The most accessible method to measure polarization features of the CMB radiation is by means of a
Stokes Polarimeter based on the rotation of an Half Wave Plate. The current observational cosmology
is starting to be limited by the presence of systematic effects. The Stokes polarimeter with a rotating
Half Wave Plate (HWP) has the advantage of mitigating a long list of potential systematics, by modulation
of the linearly polarized component of the radiation, but the presence of the rotating HWP can by
itself introduce new systematic effects, which must be under control, representing one of the most
critical part in the design of a B-Modes experiment. In this paper we present, simulate and analyse
the spurious signal arising from the precession of a rotating HWP. We first find an analytical formula
for the impact of the systematic effect induced by the HWP precession on the propagating radiation,
using the 3D generalization of the Muller formalism. We then perform several numerical simulations,
showing the effect induced on the Stokes parameters by this systematic. We also derive and discuss
the impact into B-modes measured by a satellite experiment. We find the analytical formula for the
Stokes parameters from a Stokes polarimeter where the HWP follows a precessional motion with an
angle $\theta_0$. We show the result depending on the HWP inertia tensor, spinning speed and on $\theta_0$.
The result of numerical simulations is reported as a simple timeline of the electric fields. Finally,
assuming to observe all the sky with a satellite mission, we analyze the effect on B-modes measurements.
The effect is not negligible giving the current B-modes experiments sensitivity, therefore it
is a systematic which needs to be carefully considered for future experiments.
