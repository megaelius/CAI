We present the results of a Keck/NIRSPEC follow-up survey of thirteen late-type T dwarfs (T6-T9),
twelve of which have unusually red or blue J-H colors. Previous work suggests that J-H color outliers
may represent the high-gravity, low-metallicity (old) and low-gravity, solar-metallicity (young)
extremes of the late-type T dwarf population. We use medium-resolution Y- and H-band spectroscopy
to probe regions of T dwarf atmospheres that are more sensitive to gravity and metallicity variations
than the J band. We find that the spectral morphologies of our sample are largely homogeneous, with
peak-normalized, Y- and H-band morphologies consistent with spectral standards. However, three
objects stand out as potentially old, with overluminous Y-band spectra compared to their respective
spectral standards, and a fourth object stands out as potentially young, with an underluminous
Y band. Of these four objects, three have been previously identified as potential metallicity/gravity
outliers, including the one object in our sample with a normal J-H color. We fit publicly available
atmospheric model grids to our spectra and find that the best-fit physical parameters vary depending
on the model used. As we continue to probe the characteristics of the late-T population, differences
in synthetic spectra of ~10-20% in the blue wing of the Y band and ~45% at 1.65 microns, for the same
physical parameters, must be reconciled. Further development and public availability of nonsolar
metallicity models is also recommended. Future progress toward deciphering the impacts of gravity,
metallicity, and variability in the late-type T dwarf population will also require high signal-to-noise,
multiwavelength and multi-epoch photometry and spectroscopy.
