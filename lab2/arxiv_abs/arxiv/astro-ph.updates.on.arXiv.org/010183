Combing Gaia DR2 with LAMOST DR5, we spectroscopically identified 924 hot subdwarf stars, among
which 32 stars exhibit strong double-lined composite spectra. We measured the effective temperature
$T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity $\log\,g$, helium abundance $y=n{\rm He}/n{\rm H}$, and radial
velocities of 892 non-composite spectra hot subdwarf stars by fitting LAMOST observations with
Tlusty/Synspec non-LTE synthetic spectra. We outlined four different groups in the $T_{\rm eff}-\log\,g$
diagram with our helium abundance classification scheme and two nearly parallel sequences in the
$T_{\rm eff}-\log(y)$ diagram. 3D Galactic space motions and orbits of 747 hot subdwarf stars with
$(G_{BP}-G_{RP})_{0}<-0.36$ mag were computed using LAMOST radial velocities and Gaia parallaxes
and proper motions. Based on the $U-V$ velocity diagram, $J_{z}-$eccentricity diagram, and Galactic
orbits, we derived Galactic population classifications and the fractional distributions of the
four hot subdwarf helium groups in the halo, thin disk and thick disk. Comparisons with the predictions
of binary population synthesis calculations (Han 2008) suggest that He-rich hot subdwarf stars
with $\log(y)\ge0$ are from the double helium white dwarfs merger, He-deficient hot subdwarf stars
with $-2.2\le\log(y)<-1$ from the common envelope ejection, and He-deficient hot subdwarf stars
with $\log(y)<-2.2$ from the stable Roche lobe overflow channels. The relative number of He-rich
hot subdwarf stars with $-1\le\log(y)<0$ and $\log(y)\ge0$ in the halo is more than twice the prediction
of Zhang et al.(2017), even more than six times in the thin disk, which implies that the mergers of
helium white dwarfs with low mass main sequence stars may not be the main formation channel of He-rich
hot subdwarf stars with $-1\le\log(y)<0$, specially in younger environments.
