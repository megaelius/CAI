Arabia Terra is a region of Mars where signs of past-water occurrence are recorded in several landforms.
Broad and local scale geomorphological, compositional and hydrological analyses point towards
pervasive fluid circulation through time. In this work we focus on mound fields located in the interior
of three casters larger than 40 km (Firsoff, Kotido and unnamed crater 20 km to the east) and showing
strong morphological and textural resemblance to terrestrial mud volcanoes and spring-related
features. We infer that these landforms likely testify the presence of a pressurized fluid reservoir
at depth and past fluid upwelling. We have performed morphometric analyses to characterize the
mound morphologies and consequently retrieve an accurate automated mapping of the mounds within
the craters for spatial distribution and fractal clustering analysis. The outcome of the fractal
clustering yields information about the possible extent of the percolating fracture network at
depth below the craters. We have been able to constrain the depth of the pressurized fluid reservoir
between ~2.5 and 3.2 km of depth and hence, we propose that mounds and mounds alignments are most likely
associated to the presence of fissure ridges and fluid outflow. Their process of formation is genetically
linked to the formation of large intra-crater bulges previously interpreted as large scale spring
deposits. The overburden removal caused by the impact crater formation is the inferred triggering
mechanism for fluid pressurization and upwelling, that through time led to the formation of the
intra-crater bulges and, after compaction and sealing, to the widespread mound fields in their
surroundings.
