The Galactic Plane Infrared Polarization Survey (GPIPS) seeks to characterize the magnetic field
in the dusty Galactic disk using near-infrared stellar polarimetry. All GPIPS observations were
completed using the 1.83 m Perkins telescope and Mimir instrument. GPIPS observations surveyed
76 sq-deg of the northern Galactic plane, from Galactic longitudes 18 to 56 deg and latitudes -1 to
+1 deg, in the H-band (1.6 um). Surveyed stars span 7th to 16th mag, resulting in nearly 10 million
stars with measured linear polarizations. Of these stars, ones with m_H < 12.5 mag and polarization
percentage uncertainties under 2% were judged to be high quality and number over one million. GPIPS
data reveal plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations for numerous interstellar clouds for AV
values to ~30 mag. The average sky separation of stars with m_H < 12.5 mag is about 30arcsec, or about
60 per Planck polarization resolution element. Matching to Gaia DR2 showed the brightest GPIPS
stars are red giants with distances in the 0.6-7.5 kpc range. Polarization orientations are mostly
parallel to the Galactic disk, with some zones showing significant orientation departures. Changes
in orientations are stronger as a function of Galactic longitude than of latitude. Considered at
10 arcmin angular scales, directions that show the greatest polarization fractions and narrowest
polarization position angle distributions are confined to about ten large, coherent structures
that are not correlated with star forming clouds. The GPIPS polarimetric and photometric data products
(Data Release 4 catalogs and images) are publicly available for over 13million stars.
