Photochemical hazes have been frequently used to interpret exoplanet transmission spectra that
show an upward slope towards shorter wavelengths and weak molecular features. While previous studies
have only considered spherical haze particles, photochemical hazes composed of hydrocarbon aggregate
particles are common throughout the solar system. We use an aerosol microphysics model to investigate
the effect of aggregate photochemical haze particles on transmission spectra of warm exoplanets.
We find that the wavelength dependence of the optical depth of aggregate particle hazes is flatter
than for spheres since aggregates grow to larger radii. As a result, while spherical haze opacity
displays a scattering slope towards shorter wavelengths, aggregate haze opacity can be gray in
the optical and NIR, similar to those assumed for condensate cloud decks. We further find that haze
opacity increases with increasing production rate, decreasing eddy diffusivity, and increasing
monomer size, though the magnitude of the latter effect is dependent on production rate and the atmospheric
pressure levels probed. We generate synthetic exoplanet transmission spectra to investigate
the effect of these hazes on spectral features. For high haze opacity cases, aggregate hazes lead
to flat, nearly featureless spectra, while spherical hazes produce sloped spectra with clear spectral
features at long wavelengths. Finally, we generate synthetic transmission spectra of GJ 1214b
for aggregate and spherical hazes and compare them to space-based observations. We find that aggregate
hazes can reproduce the data significantly better than spherical hazes, assuming a production
rate limited by delivery of methane to the upper atmosphere.
