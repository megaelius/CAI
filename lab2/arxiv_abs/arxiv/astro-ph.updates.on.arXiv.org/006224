Context. PKS 1510-089 is a flat spectrum radio quasar strongly variable in the optical and GeV range.
So far, very-high-energy (VHE) emission has been observed from this source during either long high
states of optical and GeV activity or during short flares. Aims. We search for low-state VHE gamma-ray
emission from PKS 1510-089. We aim to characterize and model the source in a broad-band context,
which would provide a baseline over which high states and flares could be better understood. Methods.
PKS 1510-089 has been monitored by the MAGIC telescopes since 2012. We use daily binned Fermi-LAT
flux measurements of PKS 1510-089 to characterize the GeV emission and select the observation periods
of MAGIC during low state of activity. For the selected times we compute the average radio, IR, optical,
UV, X-ray and gamma-ray emission to construct a low-state spectral energy distribution of the source.
The broadband emission is modelled within an External Compton scenario with a stationary emission
region through which plasma and magnetic field are flowing. Results. The MAGIC telescopes collected
75 hrs of data during times when the Fermi-LAT flux measured above 1 GeV was below 3x10 -8 cm -2 s -1 ,
which is the threshold adopted for the definition of a low gamma-ray activity state. The data show
a strongly significant (9.5{\sigma}) VHE gamma-ray emission at the level of (4.27 +- 0.61 stat )
x 10 -12 cm -2 s -1 above 150 GeV, a factor 80 smaller than the highest flare observed so far from this
object. Despite the lower flux, the spectral shape is consistent with earlier detections in the
VHE band. The broad-band emission is compatible with the External Compton scenario assuming a large
emission region located beyond the broad line region.
