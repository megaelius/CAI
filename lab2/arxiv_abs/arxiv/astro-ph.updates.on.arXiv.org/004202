The orbital parameters of binaries at intermediate periods ($10^2$--$10^3$ d) are difficult to
measure with conventional methods and are very incomplete. We have undertaken a new survey, applying
our pulsation timing method to {\it Kepler} light curves of 2224 main-sequence A/F stars and found
341 non-eclipsing binaries. We calculate the orbital parameters for 317 PB1 systems (single-pulsator
binaries) and 24 PB2s (double-pulsators). The method reaches down to small mass ratios $q=0.02$
and yields a highly homogeneous sample. We parametrize the mass-ratio distribution using both
inversion and MCMC forward-modelling techniques, and find it to be skewed towards low-mass companions,
peaking at $q=0.2$. While solar-type primaries show a brown dwarf desert across intermediate periods,
we find a small but significant (2.6$\sigma$) population of extreme-mass-ratio companions ($q<0.1$)
to our intermediate-mass primaries. Across periods of 100--1500 d and at $q>0.1$, we measure the
binary fraction of current A/F primaries to be 15.4%$\pm$1.4%, though we find that a large fraction
of the companions (21%$\pm$6%) are white dwarfs in post-mass-transfer systems with primaries
that are now blue stragglers, some of which are the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, barium stars,
symbiotics, and related phenomena. Excluding these white dwarfs, we find the binary fraction of
original A/F primaries to be 13.9%$\pm$2.1% over the same parameter space. Combining literature
measurements with ours, we find the binary fraction across these periods is a constant 5% for primaries
$M_1<0.8$ M$_{\odot}$, but then increases linearly with $\log M_1$, demonstrating that natal
discs around more massive protostars $M_1>1$ M$_{\odot}$ become increasingly more prone to fragmentation.
Finally, we find the eccentricity distribution of the main-sequence pairs to be much less eccentric
than the thermal distribution.
