We utilize the hydrodynamic and N-body code GIZMO, coupled with newly developed sub-grid Legacy
models for Population~III (Pop~III) and Population~II (Pop~II), specifically designed for meso-scale
cosmological volume simulations, to study the legacy of star formation in the pre-reionization
Universe. We find that the Pop~II star formation rate density (SFRD), produced in our simulation
($\sim 10^{-2}\ M_\odot{\rm yr^{-1}\, Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z\simeq10$), matches the total SFRD inferred
from observations within a factor of $<2$ at $7\lesssim z \lesssim10$. The Pop~III SFRD reaches
a plateau at $\sim10^{-3}\ M_\odot{\rm yr^{-1}\, Mpc^{-3}}$ by $z~10$, and remains largely unaffected
by the presence of Pop~II feedback. At $z$=7.5, $\sim20\%$ of Pop~III star formation occurs in dark
matter haloes which are isolated, and have never experienced any Pop~II star formation (i.e. primordial
haloes). We predict that Pop~III-only galaxies exist at magnitudes $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim-11$, beyond
the limits for direct detection with the James Webb Space Telescope. We assess that our stellar mass
function (SMF) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) agree well with the observed low mass/faint-end
behaviour at $z=8$ and $10$. However, beyond the current limiting magnitudes, we find that both
our SMF and UVLF demonstrate a deviation/turnover from the expected power-law slope ($M_{\rm UV,turn}=
-13.4\pm1.1$ at $z$=10). Our measured turnover implies that observational studies which integrate
their observed luminosity functions by extrapolating the observed faint-end slope beyond their
detection limit may overestimate the true SFRD by a factor of $2 (10)$ when integrating to $M_{\rm
UV} = -$12($-$8) at $z\sim10$. Our turnover correlates well with the transition from dark matter
haloes dominated by molecular cooling to those dominated by atomic cooling, for a mass $M_{\rm halo}\approx10^{8}M_\odot$
at $z\simeq10$.
