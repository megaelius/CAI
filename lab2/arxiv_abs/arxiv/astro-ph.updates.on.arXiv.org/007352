Exoplanet interior modelling usually makes the assumption that the elemental abundances of a planet
are identical to those of its host star. Host stellar abundances are good proxies of planetary abundances,
but only for refractory elements. This is particularly true for terrestrial planets, as evidenced
by the relative differences in bulk chemical composition between the Sun and the Earth and other
inner solar system bodies. The elemental abundances of a planet host star must therefore be devolatilised
in order to correctly represent the bulk chemical composition of its terrestrial planets. Furthermore,
nickel and light elements make an important contribution alongside iron to the core of terrestrial
planets. We therefore adopt an extended chemical network of the core, constrained by an Fe/Ni ratio
of 18 $\pm$ 4 (by number). By applying these constraints to the Sun, our modelling reproduces the
composition of the mantle and core, as well as the core mass fraction of the Earth. We also apply our
modelling to four exoplanet host stars with precisely measured elemental abundances: Kepler-10,
Kepler-20, Kepler-21 and Kepler-100. If these stars would also host terrestrial planets in their
habitable zone, we find that such planets orbiting Kepler-21 would be the most Earth-like, while
those orbiting Kepler-10 would be the least. To assess the similarity of a rocky exoplanet to the
Earth in terms of interior composition and structure, high-precision host stellar abundances
are critical. Our modelling implies that abundance uncertainties should be better than $\sim$
0.04 dex for such an assessment to be made.
