Although initially thought to be promising for production of the r-process nuclei, standard models
of neutrino-heated winds from proto-neutron stars (PNSs) do not reach the requisite neutron-to-seed
ratio for production of the lanthanides and actinides. However, the abundance distribution created
by the r-, rp-, or $\nu p$-processes in PNS winds depends sensitively on the entropy and dynamical
expansion timescale of the flow, which may be strongly affected by high magnetic fields. Here, we
present results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of non-rotating neutrino-heated PNS winds
with strong dipole magnetic fields from $10^{14}-10^{16}$ G, and assess their role in altering
the conditions for nucleosynthesis. The strong field forms a closed zone and helmet streamer configuration
at the equator, with episodic dynamical mass ejections in toroidal plasmoids. We find dramatically
enhanced entropy in these regions and conditions favorable for third-peak r-process nucleosynthesis
if the wind is neutron-rich. If instead the wind is proton-rich, the conditions will affect the abundances
from the $\nu p$-process. We quantify the distribution of ejected matter in entropy and dynamical
expansion timescale, and the critical magnetic field strength required to affect the entropy.
For $B\gtrsim10^{15}$ G, we find that $\gtrsim10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ and up to $\sim10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$
of high entropy material is ejected per highly-magnetized neutron star birth in the wind phase,
providing a mechanism for prompt heavy element enrichment of the universe. Former binary companions
identified within (magnetar-hosting) supernova remnants, the remnants themselves, and runaway
stars may exhibit overabundances. We provide a comparison with a semi-analytic model of plasmoid
eruption and discuss implications and extensions.
