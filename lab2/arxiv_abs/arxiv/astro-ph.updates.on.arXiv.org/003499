We report on the second installment of an X-ray monitoring project of seven luminous radio-quiet
quasars (RQQs). New {\sl Chandra} observations of four of these, at $4.10\leq z\leq4.35$, yield
a total of six X-ray epochs, per source, with temporal baselines of $\sim850-1600$ days in the rest
frame. These data provide the best X-ray light curves for RQQs at $z>4$, to date, enabling qualitative
investigations of the X-ray variability behavior of such sources for the first time. On average,
these sources follow the trend of decreasing variability amplitude with increasing luminosity,
and there is no evidence for X-ray variability increasing toward higher redshifts, in contrast
with earlier predictions of potential evolutionary scenarios. An ensemble variability structure
function reveals that their variability level remains relatively flat across $\approx20 - 1000$
days in the rest frame and it is generally lower than that of three similarly luminous RQQs at $1.33\leq
z\leq 2.74$ over the same temporal range. We discuss possible explanations for the increased variability
of the lower-redshift subsample and, in particular, whether higher accretion rates play a leading
role. Near-simultaneous optical monitoring of the sources at $4.10\leq z\leq 4.35$ indicates
that none is variable on $\approx1$-day timescales, although flux variations of up to $\sim25$\%
are observed on $\approx100$-day timescales, typical of RQQs at similar redshifts. Significant
optical-X-ray spectral slope variations observed in two of these sources are consistent with the
levels observed in luminous RQQs and are dominated by X-ray variations.
