We study the spatially resolved stellar kinematics of two star-forming galaxies at z = 0.1 from the
larger DYnamics of Newly Assembled Massive Objects (DYNAMO) sample. These galaxies, which have
been characterized by high levels of star formation and large ionized gas velocity dispersions,
are considered possible analogs to high-redshift clumpy disks. They were observed using the GMOS
instrument in integral field spectroscopy (IFS) mode at the Gemini Observatory with high spectral
resolution (R=5400, equivalent to 24 km/s at the observed wavelengths) and 6 hour exposure times
in order to measure the resolved stellar kinematics via absorption lines. We also obtain higher-quality
emission line kinematics than previous observations. The spatial resolution (1.2 kpc) is sufficient
to show that the ionized gas in these galaxies (as traced by H-beta emission) is morphologically
irregular, forming multiple giant clumps while stellar continuum light is smooth and well described
by an exponential profile. Clumpy gas morphologies observed in IFS data are confirmed by complementary
narrow band H-alpha imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope. Morphological differences between
the stars and ionized gas are not reflected dynamically as stellar kinematics are found the be closely
coupled to the kinematics of the ionized gas: both components are smoothly rotating with large velocity
dispersions (~40 km/s) suggesting that the high gas dispersions are not primarily driven by star-formation
feedback. In addition, the stellar population ages of these galaxies are estimated to be quite young
(60-500 Myr). The large velocity dispersions measured for these young stars suggest that we are
seeing the formation of thick disks and/or stellar bulges in support of recent models which produce
these from clumpy galaxies at high redshift.
