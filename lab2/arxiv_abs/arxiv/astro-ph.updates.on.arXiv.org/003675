We present the design and commissioning of Project Solaris, a global network of autonomous observatories.
Solaris is a Polish scientific undertaking aimed at the detection and characterization of circumbinary
exoplanets and eclipsing binary stars. To accomplish this, a network of four fully autonomous observatories
has been deployed in the Southern Hemisphere: Solaris-1 and Solaris-2 in the South African Astronomical
Observatory in South Africa; Solaris-3 in Siding Spring Observatory in Australia; and Solaris-4
in Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito in Argentina. The four stations are nearly identical and are
equipped with 0.5-m Ritchey-Cr\'etien (f/15) or Cassegrain (f/9, Solaris-3) optics and high-grade
2 K x 2 K CCD cameras with Johnson and Sloan filter sets. We present the design and implementation of
low-level security; data logging and notification systems; weather monitoring components; all-sky
vision system, surveillance system; and distributed temperature and humidity sensors. We describe
dedicated grounding and lighting protection system design and robust fiber data transfer interfaces
in electrically demanding conditions. We discuss the outcomes of our design, as well as the resulting
software engineering requirements. We describe our system's engineering approach to achieve
the required level of autonomy, the architecture of the custom high-level industry-grade software
that has been designed and implemented specifically for the use of the network. We present the actual
status of the project and first photometric results; these include data and models of already studied
systems for benchmarking purposes (Wasp-4b, Wasp-64b, and Wasp-98b transits, PG 1663-018, an
eclipsing binary with a pulsator) as well J024946-3825.6, an interesting low-mass binary system
for which a complete model is provided for the first time.
