UV bursts are transients in the solar atmosphere with an increased impulsive emission in the extreme
UV lasting for one to several tens of minutes. They often show spectral profiles indicative of a bi-directional
outflow in response to magnetic reconnection. To understand UV bursts, we study how motions of magnetic
elements at the surface can drive the self-consistent formation of a current sheet resulting in
plasmoid-mediated reconnection. In particular, we want to study the role of the height of the reconnection
in the atmosphere. We conducted numerical experiments solving the 2D MHD equations from the solar
surface to the upper atmosphere. Motivated by observations, we drove a small magnetic patch embedded
in a larger system of magnetic field of opposite polarity. This configuration creates an X-type
neutral point in the initial potential field. The models are characterized by the plasma-beta at
the height of this X point. The driving at the surface stretches the X-point into a current sheet,
where plasmoids appear, and a bi-directional jet forms. This is consistent with what is expected
for UV bursts or explosive events, and we provide a self-consistent model of the formation of the
reconnection region in such events. The gravitational stratification gives an explanation for
why explosive events are restricted to a temperature range around a few 0.1 MK, and the presence of
plasmoids in the reconnection process provides an understanding of the observed variability during
the transient events on a timescale of minutes. Our numerical experiments provide a comprehensive
understanding of UV bursts and explosive events, in particular of how the atmospheric response
changes if the reconnection happens at different plasma-beta, that is, at different heights in
the atmosphere. This analysis also gives new insight into how UV bursts might be related to the photospheric
Ellerman bombs.
