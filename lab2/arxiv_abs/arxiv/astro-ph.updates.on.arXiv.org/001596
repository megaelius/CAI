The success of the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse supernovae relies on the supporting action
of two hydrodynamic instabilities: neutrino-driven convection and the Standing Accretion Shock
Instability (SASI). Depending on the structure of the stellar progenitor, each of these instabilities
can dominate the evolution of the gain region prior to the onset of explosion, with implications
for the ensuing asymmetries. Here we examine the flow dynamics in the neighborhood of explosion
by means of parametric two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations for which the
linear stability properties are well understood. We find that systems for which the convection
parameter is sub-critical (SASI-dominated) develop explosions once large-scale, high-entropy
bubbles are able to survive for several SASI oscillation cycles. These long-lived structures are
seeded by the SASI during shock expansions. Finite-amplitude initial perturbations do not alter
this outcome qualitatively, though they can lead to significant differences in explosion times.
Supercritical systems (convection-dominated) also explode by developing large-scale bubbles,
though the formation of these structures is due to buoyant activity. Non-exploding systems achieve
a quasi-steady state in which the time-averaged flow adjusts itself to be convectively sub-critical.
We characterize the turbulent flow using a spherical Fourier-Bessel decomposition, identifying
the relevant scalings and connecting temporal and spatial components. Finally, we verify the applicability
of these principles on the general relativistic, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of Mueller,
Janka, & Heger (2012), and discuss implications for the three-dimensional case.
