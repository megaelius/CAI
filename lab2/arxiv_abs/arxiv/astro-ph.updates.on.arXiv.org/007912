We present a suite of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of isolated field dwarf galaxies,
all with masses of $M_\mathrm{halo} \approx 10^{10}\,$M$_\odot$ at $z=0$, across a range of dark
matter models. For the first time, we compare how both self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and/or
warm dark matter (WDM) models affect the assembly histories as well as the central density structure
in fully hydrodynamical simulations of dwarfs. Overall, the inclusion of self-interactions does
little to affect the mass assembly of these halos (both dark matter and baryonic), while WDM models
generally delay dark matter halo formation and reduce galaxies' stellar masses at $z=0$. Dwarfs
with smaller stellar half-mass radii (r$_{1/2}<500$ pc) have lower $\sigma_\star/V_\mathrm{max}$
ratios, reinforcing the idea that smaller dwarfs may reside in halos that are more massive than is
naively expected. Surprisingly, the majority of dwarfs simulated with self-interactions (regardless
of the warmth of the dark matter) actually experience contraction of their inner density profiles
with the addition of baryons relative to the cores produced in dark-matter-only runs, though the
simulated dwarfs are always less centrally dense than in $\Lambda$CDM. Our V$_{1/2}-$r$_{1/2}$
relation is overall consistent with observations of Local Field dwarfs, though compact objects
such as Tucana provide a unique challenge. Spatially-resolved rotation curves in the central regions
($<400$ pc) of small dwarfs could provide a way to distinguish between CDM, WDM, and SIDM: at the masses
probed in this simulation suite, cored density profiles in dwarfs with small r$_{1/2}$ values can
only originate from dark matter self-interactions.
