Following Fermi and NOT observations, Ruffini et al. (2019b) soon identified GRB 190114C as BdHN
I at z=0.424, it has been observed since, with unprecedented accuracy, [...] all the way to the successful
optical observation of our predicted supernova (SN). This GRB is a twin of GRB 130427A. Here we take
advantage of the GBM data and identify in it three different Episodes. Episode 1 represents the precursor
which includes the SN breakout and the creation of the new neutron star ($\nu$NS), the hypercritical
accretion of the SN ejecta onto the NS binary companion, exceeding the NS critical mass at $t_{rf}=1.9$s.
Episode 2 starting at $t_{rf}=1.9$s includes three major events: the formation of the BH, the onset
of the GeV emission and the onset of the ultra-relativistic prompt emission (UPE), which extends
all the way up to $t_{rf}=3.99$s. Episode 3 which occurs at times following $t_{rf}=3.99$s reveals
the presence of a cavity carved out in the SN ejecta by the BH formation. We perform an in depth time-resolved
spectral analysis on the entire UPE with the corresponding determination of the spectra best fit
by a cut-off power-law and a black body (CPL+BB) model, and then we repeat the spectral analysis in
5 successive time iterations in increasingly shorter time bins: we find a similarity in the spectra
in each stage of the iteration revealing clearly a self-similar structure. We find a power-law dependence
of the BB temperature with index $-1.56\pm0.38$, a dependence with index $-1.20\pm0.26$ for the
gamma-ray luminosity confirming a similar dependence with index $-1.20\pm0.36$ which we find
as well in the GeV luminosity, both expressed in the rest-frame. We thus discover in the realm of relativistic
astrophysics the existence of a self-similar physical process and power-law dependencies, extensively
described in the micro-physical world by the classical works of Heisenberg-Landau-Wilson.
