We present the analysis of Chandra and NuSTAR spectra of NGC 4968, a local (D$\sim$44 Mpc) 12$\mu$m-selected
Seyfert 2 galaxy, enshrouded within Compton-thick layers of obscuring gas. We find no evidence
of variability between the Chandra and NuSTAR observations (separated by 2 years), and between
the two NuSTAR observations (separated by 10 months). Using self-consistent X-ray models, we rule
out the scenario where the obscuring medium is nearly spherical and uniform, contradicting the
results implied by the $<$10 keV Chandra spectrum. The line-of-sight column density, from intervening
matter between the source and observer that intercepts the intrinsic AGN X-ray emission, is well
within the Compton-thick regime, with a minimum column density of $2\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$.
The average global column density is high ($> 3\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), with both Compton-thick
and Compton-thin solutions permitted depending on the X-ray spectral model. The spectral models
provide a range of intrinsic AGN continuum parameters and implied 2-10 keV luminosities ($L_{\rm
2-10keV,intrinsic}$), where the higher end of $L_{\rm 2-10keV,intrinsic}$ is consistent with
expectations from the 12$\mu$m luminosity ($L_{\rm 2-10keV,intrinisc} \sim 7\times10^{42}$
erg s$^{-1}$). Compared with Compton-thick AGN previously observed by {\it NuSTAR}, NGC 4968 is
among the most intrinsically X-ray luminous. However, despite its close proximity and relatively
high intrinsic X-ray luminosity, it is undetected by the 105 month Swift-BAT survey, underscoring
the importance of multi-wavelength selection for obtaining the most complete census of the most
hidden black holes.
