Molecular oxygen, nitrogen, and ozone have been detected in the Solar System. They are also expected
to be present in ice-grain mantles within star-forming regions. Laboratory experiments that simulate
energetic processing (ions, photons, and electrons) of ices are essential for interpreting and
directing future astronomical observations. We provide VUV photoabsorption spectroscopic data
of energetically processed nitrogen- and oxygen-rich ices that will help to identify absorption
bands and/or spectral slopes observed on icy objects in the Solar System and on ice-grain mantles
of the interstellar medium. We present VUV photoabsorption spectra of frozen O2 and N2, a 1:1 mixture
of both, and a new systematic set of pure and mixed nitrogen oxide ices. Spectra were obtained at 22
K before and after 1 keV electron bombardment of the ice sample. Ices were then annealed to higher
temperatures to study their thermal evolution. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
was used as a secondary probe of molecular synthesis to better identify the physical and chemical
processes at play. Our VUV data show that ozone and the azide radical (N3) are observed in our experiments
after electron irradiation of pure O2 and N2 ices, respectively. Energetic processing of an O2:N2
= 1:1 ice mixture leads to the formation of ozone along with a series of nitrogen oxides. The electron
irradiation of solid nitrogen oxides, pure and in mixtures, induces the formation of new species
such as O2, N2 , and other nitrogen oxides not present in the initial ice. Results are discussed here
in light of their relevance to various astrophysical environments. Finally, we show that VUV spectra
of solid NO2 and water can reproduce the observational VUV profile of the cold surface of Enceladus,
Dione, and Rhea, strongly suggesting the presence of nitrogen oxides on the surface of the icy Saturn
moons.
