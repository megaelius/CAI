Shock-induced changes in ordinary chondrite meteorites related to impacts or planetary collisions
are known to be capable of altering their optical properties. Thus, one can hypothesize that a significant
portion of the ordinary chondrite material may be hidden within the observed dark C/X asteroid population.
The exact pressure-temperature conditions of the shock-induced darkening are not well constrained.
Thus, we experimentally investigate the gradual changes in the chondrite material optical properties
as a function of the shock pressure. A spherical shock experiment with Chelyabinsk LL5 was performed
in order to study the changes in its optical properties. The spherical shock experiment geometry
allows for a gradual increase of shock pressure from $\sim$15 GPa at a rim toward hundreds of gigapascals
in the center. Four distinct zones were observed with an increasing shock load. The optical changes
are minimal up to $\sim$50 GPa. In the region of $\sim$50--60 GPa, shock darkening occurs due to the
troilite melt infusion into silicates. This process abruptly ceases at pressures of $\sim$60 GPa
due to an onset of silicate melting. At pressures higher than $\sim$150 GPa, recrystallization
occurs and is associated with a second-stage shock darkening due to fine troilite-metal eutectic
grains. The shock darkening affects the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared (UV, VIS, and
NIR) region while changes to the MIR spectrum are minimal. Shock darkening is caused by two distinct
mechanisms with characteristic pressure regions, which are separated by an interval where the
darkening ceases. This implies a reduced amount of shock-darkened material produced during the
asteroid collisions.
