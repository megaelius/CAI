{We combine the results of our earlier study of the UV characteristics of 18 classical novae (CNe)
with data from the literature and with the recent precise distance determinations from the Gaia
satellite to investigate the statistical properties of old novae. All final parameters for the
sample include a detailed treatment of the errors and their propagation. The physical properties
reported here include the absolute magnitudes at maximum and minimum, a new maximum magnitude versus
rate of decline (MMRD) relation, and the inclination-corrected 1100--6000-\AA\ accretion disk
luminosity. Most importantly, these data have allowed us to derive a homogenous set of accretion
rates in quiescence for the 18 novae. All novae in the sample were super-Eddington during outburst,
with an average absolute magnitude at maximum of $-7.5\pm1.0$. The average absolute magnitude
at minimum corrected for inclination is $3.9\pm1.0$. The median mass accretion rate is $\log\dot{M}_{1M\odot}=-8.52$
(using $1M\odot$ as WD mass for all novae) or $\log\dot{M}_{M_{WD}}=-8.48$ (using the individual
WD masses). These values are lower than those assumed in studies of CNe evolution and appear to attenuate
the need for a hibernation hypothesis to interpret the nova phenomenon. We identified a number of
correlations among the physical parameters of the quiescent and eruptive phases, some already
known but others new and even surprising. Several quantities correlate with the speed class $t_3$
including, unexpectedly, the mass accretion rate ($\dot{M)}$. This rate correlates also with
the absolute magnitude at minimum corrected for inclination, and with the outburst amplitude,
providing new and simple ways to estimate $\dot{M}$ through its functional dependence on (more)
easily observed quantities. There is no correlation between $\dot{M}$ and the orbital period.}
