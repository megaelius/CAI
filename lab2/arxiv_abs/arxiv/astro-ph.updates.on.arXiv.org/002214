We present a velocity dispersion-based mass calibration of the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect survey (SPT-SZ) galaxy cluster sample. Using a homogeneously selected sample of 100 cluster
candidates from 720 deg2 of the survey along with 63 velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and 16 X-ray
Yx measurements of sample clusters, we simultaneously calibrate the mass-observable relation
and constrain cosmological parameters. The calibrations using $\sigma_v$ and Yx are consistent
at the $0.6\sigma$ level, with the $\sigma_v$ calibration preferring ~16% higher masses. We use
the full cluster dataset to measure $\sigma_8(\Omega_ m/0.27)^{0.3}=0.809\pm0.036$. The SPT
cluster abundance is lower than preferred by either the WMAP9 or Planck+WMAP9 polarization (WP)
data, but assuming the sum of the neutrino masses is $\sum m_\nu=0.06$ eV, we find the datasets to
be consistent at the 1.0$\sigma$ level for WMAP9 and 1.5$\sigma$ for Planck+WP. Allowing for larger
$\sum m_\nu$ further reconciles the results. When we combine the cluster and Planck+WP datasets
with BAO and SNIa, the preferred cluster masses are $1.9\sigma$ higher than the Yx calibration and
$0.8\sigma$ higher than the $\sigma_v$ calibration. Given the scale of these shifts (~44% and ~23%
in mass, respectively), we execute a goodness of fit test; it reveals no tension, indicating that
the best-fit model provides an adequate description of the data. Using the multi-probe dataset,
we measure $\Omega_ m=0.299\pm0.009$ and $\sigma_8=0.829\pm0.011$. Within a $\nu$CDM model
we find $\sum m_\nu = 0.148\pm0.081$ eV. We present a consistency test of the cosmic growth rate.
Allowing both the growth index $\gamma$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ to vary,
we find $\gamma=0.73\pm0.28$ and $w=-1.007\pm0.065$, demonstrating that the expansion and the
growth histories are consistent with a LCDM model ($\gamma=0.55; \,w=-1$).
