C-cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN), existing in the two $Z$ and $E$ isomeric forms, is a key prebiotic
molecule, but, so far, only the $E$ isomer has been detected toward the massive star-forming region.
Sagittarius B2(N) using transitions in the radio wavelength domain. With the aim of detecting HNCHCN
in Sun-like-star forming regions, the laboratory investigation of its rotational spectrum has
been extended to the millimeter-/submillimeter-wave (mm-/submm-) spectral window in which several
unbiased spectral surveys have been already carried out. High-resolution laboratory measurements
of the rotational spectrum of C-cyanomethanimine were carried out in the 100-420 GHz range using
a frequency-modulation absorption spectrometer. We then searched for the C-cyanomethanimine
spectral features in the mm-wave range using the high-sensitivity and unbiased spectral surveys
obtained with the IRAM 30-m antenna in the ASAI context, the earliest stages of star formation from
starless to evolved Class I objects being sampled. For both the $Z$ and $E$ isomers, the spectroscopic
work has led to an improved and extended knowledge of the spectroscopic parameters, thus providing
accurate predictions of the rotational signatures up to $\sim$700 GHz. So far, no C-cyanomethanimine
emission has been detected toward the ASAI targets, and upper limits of the column density of $\sim$
10$^{11}$--10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ could only be derived. Consequently, the C-cyanomethanimine
abundances have to be less than a few 10$^{-10}$ for starless and hot-corinos. A less stringent constraint,
$\leq$ 10$^{-9}$, is obtained for shocks sites. The combination of the upper limits of the abundances
of C-cyanomethanimine together with accurate laboratory frequencies up to $\sim$ 700 GHz poses
the basis for future higher sensitivity searches around Sun-like-star forming regions.
