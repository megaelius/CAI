We present the results of a new study investigating the relationship between Ly$\alpha$ equivalent
width ($W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$)) and the metallicity of the ionizing stellar population ($Z_{\star}$)
for a sample of $768$ star-forming galaxies at $3 \leq z \leq 5$ drawn from the VANDELS survey. Dividing
our sample into quartiles of rest-frame $W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$) across the range $-58 \unicode{xC5}
\lesssim$ $W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$) $\lesssim 110 \unicode{xC5}$ we determine $Z_{\star}$
from full spectral fitting of composite far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra and find a clear anti-correlation
between $W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$) and $Z_{\star}$. Our results indicate that $Z_{\star}$ decreases
by a factor $\gtrsim 3$ between the lowest $W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$) quartile ($\langle$$W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$)$\rangle=-18\unicode{xC5}$)
and the highest $W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$) quartile ($\langle$$W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$)$\rangle=24\unicode{xC5}$).
Similarly, galaxies typically defined as Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs; $W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$)
$>20\unicode{xC5}$) are, on average, metal poor with respect to the non-LAE galaxy population
($W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$) $\leq20\unicode{xC5}$) with $Z_{\star}$$_{\rm{non-LAE}}\gtrsim
2 \times$ $Z_{\star}$$_{\rm{LAE}}$. Finally, based on the best-fitting stellar models, we estimate
that the increasing strength of the stellar ionizing spectrum towards lower $Z_{\star}$ is responsible
for $\simeq 15-25\%$ of the observed variation in $W_{\lambda}$(Ly$\alpha$) across our sample,
with the remaining contribution ($\simeq 75-85\%$) being due to a decrease in the HI/dust covering
fractions in low $Z_{\star}$ galaxies.
