Observations of the redshifted 21 cm line with upcoming radio telescopes promise to transform our
understanding of the cosmic reionization. To unravel the underlying physical process, we investigate
the 21 cm structures of three different ionizing sources, Population (Pop) III stars, the first
galaxies, and the first quasars, by using radiative transfer simulations that include both ionization
of neutral hydrogen and resonant scattering of Lya photons. We find that Pop III stars and quasars
produce a smooth transition from an ionized and hot state to a neutral and cold one, owing to their
hard spectral energy distribution with abundant ionizing photons, in contrast to the sharp transition
in galaxies. Furthermore, Lya scattering plays a dominant role in producing the 21 cm signal as it
determines the relation between hydrogen spin temperature and gas kinetic temperature. This effect,
also called Wouthuysen-Field coupling, depends strongly on the ionizing source. It is the strongest
around galaxies, where the spin temperature is highly coupled to that of the gas, resulting in extended
absorption troughs in the 21 cm brightness temperature. On the other hand, in the case of Pop III stars,
the 21 cm signal shows both emission and absorption regions around a small HII bubble. For quasars,
a large emission region in the 21 cm signal is produced, and the absorption region decreases as the
size of the HII bubble becomes large due to the limited traveling time of photons. We predict that
future surveys from large radio arrays such as MWA, LOFAR and SKA may be able to detect the 21 cm signals
of primordial galaxies and quasars, but not likely Pop III stars due to its small angular diameter.
