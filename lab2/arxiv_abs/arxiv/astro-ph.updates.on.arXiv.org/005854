The shape alignment of satellite galaxies around isolated central galaxy has been confirmed by
a lot of previous works, both in simulations and observations. While for the shape alignment in a
more complex system, such as galaxy pair like our Local group, is poorly studied. In this study, we
investigate the shape alignment of satellite galaxies in the system of galaxy pairs similar to Local
Group in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 13 (SDSS DR13). By stacking tens of thousands satellites
around galaxy pairs, we found statistically strong signals of tangential alignment of the major
axes of the satellites in the facing area (projected areas between two primaries in the sky plane)
and radial alignment in the away area (areas in the opposite sides of facing area), at $\sim5\sigma$
levels. Furthermore, the major axes of late-type satellites in facing area show a stronger signal
($\sim27\%$ over the uniform distribution) of tangential alignment, while those of early-type
satellites in away area show a stronger signal of radial alignment ($\sim29\%$). The alignment
signal increases with the increasing of the brightness of primaries, the decreasing of pair separation
or the distance between satellites and their primaries. The alignment signal for galaxy pairs and
satellites is found stronger in the large scale filament environments than the alignment signal
of those systems not in the filaments, which shows the alignment of the major axes of satellites can
be enhanced in the filament environments. These findings will help to understand the mechanisms
of how satellites are affected by the tidal force in galaxy pairs. Besides, this statistical alignment
signal can be important for the analyses of weak gravitational lensing.
