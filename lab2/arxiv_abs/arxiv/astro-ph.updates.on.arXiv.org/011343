Grain growth and fragmentation are important processes in building up large dust aggregates in
protoplanetary discs. Using a 3D two-phase (gas-dust) SPH code, we investigate the combined effects
of growth and fragmentation of a multi-phase dust with different fragmentation thresholds in a
time-evolving disc. We find that our fiducial disc, initially in a fragmentation regime, moves
toward a pure-growth regime in a few thousands years. Timescales change as a function of the disc
and dust properties. When fragmentation is efficient, it produces, in different zones of the disc,
Fe/Si and rock/ice ratios different from those predicted when only pure growth is considered. Chemical
fractionation and the depletion/enrichment in iron observed in some chondrites can be linked to
the size-density sorting and fragmentation properties of precursor dusty grains . We suggest that
aggregation of chondritic components could have occurred where/when fragmentation was not efficient
if their aerodynamical sorting has to be preserved. Chondritic components would allow aerodynamical
sorting in a fragmentation regime only if they have similar fragmentation properties. We find that,
in the inner disc, and for the same interval of time, fragmenting dust can grow larger when compared
to the size of grains predicted by pure growth. This counter-intuitive behaviour is due to the large
amount of dust which piles up in a fragmenting zone followed by the rapid growth that occurs when this
zone transitions to a pure growth regime. As an important consequence, dust can overcome the radial-drift
barrier within a few thousands years.
