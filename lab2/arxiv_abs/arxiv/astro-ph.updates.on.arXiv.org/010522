In this paper we present new optical observations of the galaxy NGC 185 intended to reveal the status
of supernova remnants (SNRs) in this dwarf companion of the Andromeda galaxy. Previously, it was
reported that this galaxy hosts one SNR. Our deep photometric study with the 2m telescope at Rozhen
National Astronomical Observatory using narrow-band H$\alpha$ and [SII] filters revealed complex
structure of the interstellar medium in the center of the galaxy. To confirm the classification
and to study the kinematics of the detected nebulae, we carried out spectroscopic observations
using the SCORPIO multi-mode spectrograph at the 6m telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory
of the Russian Academy of Science, both in low- and high-resolution modes. We also searched the archival
X-ray and radio data for counterparts of the candidate SNRs identified by our optical observations.
Our observations imply the presence of one more SNR, one possible HII region previously cataloged
as part of an SNR, and the presence of an additional source of shock ionization in one low-brightness
PN. We detected enhanced [SII]/H_alpha and [NII]/H_alpha line ratios, as well as relatively high
(up to 90 km s$^{-1}$) expansion velocities of the two observed nebulae, motivating their classification
as SNRs (with diameters of 45 pc and 50 pc), confirmed by both photometric and spectral observations.
The estimated electron density of emission nebulae is 30 - 200 cm$^{-3}$. Archival XMM-Newton observations
indicate the presence of an extended, low-brightness, soft source in projection of one of the optical
SNRs, whereas the archival VLA radio image shows weak, unresolved emission in the center of NGC 185.
