We have performed Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations in $^{12}$CO($J=2-1$),
$^{13}$CO($J=2-1$), C$^{18}$O($J=2-1$), $^{12}$CO($J=3-2$), $^{13}$CO($J=3-2$), and CS($J=7-6$)
lines toward the active star-forming region N83C in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), whose metallicity
is $\sim$ 1/5 of the Milky Way (MW). The ALMA observations first reveal sub-pc scale molecular structures
in $^{12}$CO($J=2-1$) and $^{13}$CO($J=2-1$) emission. We found strong CO peaks associated with
young stellar objects (YSOs) identified by the $Spitzer$ Space Telescope, and also found that overall
molecular gas is distributed along the edge of the neighboring HII region. We derived a gas density
of $\sim 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ in molecular clouds associated with YSOs based on the virial mass estimated
from $^{12}$CO($J=2-1$) emission. This high gas density is presumably due to the effect of the HII
region under the low-metallicity (accordingly small-dust content) environment in the SMC; far-UV
radiation from the HII region can easily penetrate and photo-dissociate the outer layer of $^{12}$CO
molecules in the molecular clouds, and thus only the innermost parts of the molecular clouds are
observed even in $^{12}$CO emission. We obtained the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor $X_{\rm CO}$
of $7.5 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ in N83C based on virial masses and CO luminosities,
which is four times larger than that in the MW, 2 $\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$.
We also discuss the difference in the nature between two high-mass YSOs, each of which is associated
with a molecular clump with a mass of about a few $\times 10^3 M_{\odot}$.
