We present 88 multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images (most at an observing frequency
of 8 GHz), of 20 TeV blazars, all of the HBL class, that have not been previously studied at multiple
epochs on the parsec scale. From these 20 sources, we analyze the apparent speeds of 43 jet components
that are all detected at four or more epochs. As has been found for other TeV HBLs, the apparent speeds
of these components are relatively slow. About two-thirds of the components have an apparent speed
that is consistent (within two-sigma) with no motion; and some of these components may be stationary
patterns whose apparent speed does not relate to the underlying bulk flow speed. In addition, a superluminal
tail to the apparent speed distribution of the TeV HBLs is detected for the first time, with eight
components in seven sources having a two-sigma lower limit on the apparent speed exceeding 1c. We
combine the data from these 20 sources with an additional 18 sources from the literature to analyze
the complete apparent speed distribution of all 38 TeV HBLs that have been studied with VLBI at multiple
epochs. The highest two-sigma apparent speed lower limit considering all sources is 3.6c. This
suggests that bulk Lorentz factors of up to about 4, but probably not much higher, exist in the parsec-scale
radio emitting regions of these sources, consistent with estimates obtained in the radio by other
means such as brightness temperatures. This can be reconciled with the high Lorentz factors estimated
from the high-energy data if the jet has velocity structures consisting of different emission regions
with different Lorentz factors. In particular, we analyze the current apparent speed data for the
TeV HBLs in the context of a model with a fast central spine and a slower outer layer.
