An essential part of the paradigm describing active galactic nuclei is the alignment between the
radio jet and the associated rotation axis of the sub-pc sized accretion disks. Because of the small
linear and angular scales involved, this alignment has not yet been checked in a sufficient number
of Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs). The project intends to examine the validity
of this paradigm by measuring the radio continuum on the same physical scale as the accretion disks,
to investigate any possible connection between these disks and the radio continuum. We observed
a sample of 18 LLAGNs in the 4.8 GHz (6 cm) radio continuum using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
with 3.3 to 6.5 milliarcseconds resolution. The sources were selected to show both an edge-on accretion
disk revealed by 22 GHz H$_{2}$O megamaser emission and signatures of a radio jet. Furthermore,
the sources were previously detected in 33GHz radio continuum observations made with the Very Large
Array. Five out of 18 galaxies observed were detected at 8 sigma or higher levels (Mrk0001, Mrk1210,
Mrk1419, NGC2273 and UGC3193). While all these sources are known to have maser disks, four of these
five sources exhibit a maser disk with known orientation. For all four sources, the radio continuum
is misaligned relative to the rotation axis of the maser disk, but with a 99.1% confidence level,
the orientations are not random and are confined to a cone within 32 degree of the maser disk's normal.
Among the four sources the misalignment of the radio continuum with respect to the normal vector
to the maser disk is smaller when the inner radius of the maser disk is larger. Furthermore, a correlation
is observed between the 5 GHz VLBA radio continuum and the [OIII] luminosity and also with the H$_{2}$O
maser disk's inner radius.
