Since the discovery of kiloparsec-scale X-ray emission from quasar jets, the physical processes
responsible for their high-energy emission have been poorly defined. A number of mechanisms are
under active debate, including synchrotron radiation, inverse-Comptonized CMB (IC/CMB) emission,
and other Comptonization processes. In a number of cases, the optical and X-ray emission of jet regions
are inked by a single spectral component, and in those, high- resolution multi-band imaging and
polarimetry can be combined to yield a powerful diagnostic of jet emission processes. Here we report
on deep imaging photometry of the jet of PKS 1136$-$135 obtained with the {\it Hubble Space Telescope.}
We find that several knots are highly polarized in the optical, with fractional polarization $\Pi>30%$.
When combined with the broadband spectral shape observed in these regions, this is very difficult
to explain via IC/CMB models, unless the scattering particles are at the lowest-energy tip of the
electron energy distribution, with Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 1$, and the jet is also very highly
beamed ($\delta \geq 20$) and viewed within a few degrees of the line of sight. We discuss both the
IC/CMB and synchrotron interpretation of the X-ray emission in the light of this new evidence, presenting
new models of the spectral energy distribution and also the matter content of this jet. The high polarizations
do not completely rule out the possibility of IC/CMB optical-to-X-ray emission in this jet, but
they do strongly disfavor the model. We discuss the implications of this finding, and also the prospects
for future work.
