Any considerations on propagation of particles through the Universe must involve particle interactions:
processes leading to production of particle cascades. While one expects existence of such cascades,
the state of the art cosmic-ray research is oriented purely on a detection of single particles, gamma
rays or associated extensive air showers. The natural extension of the cosmic-ray research with
the studies on ensembles of particles and air showers is being proposed by the CREDO Collaboration.
Within the CREDO strategy the focus is put on generalized super-preshowers (SPS): spatially and/or
temporally extended cascades of particles originated above the Earth atmosphere, possibly even
at astrophysical distances. With CREDO we want to find out whether SPS can be at least partially observed
by a network of terrestrial and/or satellite detectors receiving primary or secondary cosmic-ray
signal. This paper addresses electromagnetic SPS, e.g. initiated by VHE photons interacting with
the cosmic microwave background, and the SPS signatures that can be seen by gamma-ray telescopes,
exploring the exampleof Cherenkov Telescope Array. The energy spectrum of secondary electrons
and photons in an electromagnetic super-preshower might be extended over awide range of energy,
down to TeV or even lower, as it is evident from the simulation results. This means that electromagnetic
showers induced by such particles in the Earth atmosphere could be observed by imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes. We present preliminary results from the study of response of the Cherenkov
Telescope Array to SPS events, including the analysis of the simulated shower images on the camera
focal plane and implementedgeneric reconstruction chains based on the Hillas parameters.
