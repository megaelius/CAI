[Abridged] Ensemble studies of red-giant stars with exquisite asteroseismic, spectroscopic,
and astrometric constraints offer a novel opportunity to recast and address long-standing questions
concerning the evolution of stars and of the Galaxy. Here, we infer masses and ages for nearly 5400
giants with available Kepler light curves and APOGEE spectra, and discuss some of the systematics
that may affect the accuracy of the inferred stellar properties. First, we look at age-chemical-abundances
relations. We find a dearth of young, metal-rich stars, and the existence of a significant population
of old (8-9 Gyr), low-[$\alpha$/Fe], super-solar metallicity stars, reminiscent of the age and
metallicity of the well-studied open cluster NGC6791. The age-chemo-kinematic properties of
these stars indicate that efficient radial migration happens in the thin disk. We find that ages
and masses of the nearly 400 $\alpha$-element-rich red-giant-branch (RGB) stars in our sample
are compatible with those of an old (~11 Gyr), nearly coeval, chemical-thick disk population. Using
a statistical model, we show that 95% of the population was born within ~1.5 Gyr. Moreover, we find
a difference in the vertical velocity dispersion between low- and high-[$\alpha$/Fe] populations,
confirming their different chemo-dynamical histories. We then exploit the almost coeval $\alpha$-rich
population to gain insight into processes that may have altered the mass of a star along its evolution,
which are key to improve the mapping of the observed stellar mass to age. We find evidence for a mean
integrated RGB mass loss <$\Delta$M>= 0.10 $\pm$ 0.02 Msun and that the occurrence of massive (M
$\gtrsim$ 1.1 Msun) $\alpha$-rich stars is of the order of 5% on the RGB, and significantly higher
in the RC, supporting the scenario in which most of these stars had undergone interaction with a companion.
