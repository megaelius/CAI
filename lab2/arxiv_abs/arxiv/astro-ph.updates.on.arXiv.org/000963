This analysis offers evidence of characteristic scale sizes in solar wind charge state data measured
in-situ for thirteen quiet-sun Carrington rotations in 2008. Using a previously established novel
methodology, we analyze the wavelet power spectrum of the charge state ratio C$^{6+}$/C$^{4+}$
measured in-situ by ACE/SWICS for 2-hour and 12-minute cadence. We construct a statistical significance
level in the wavelet power spectrum to quantify the interference effects arising from filling missing
data in the time series (Edmondson et al. 2013), allowing extraction of significant power from the
measured data to a resolution of 24 mins. We analyze each wavelet power spectra for transient coherency,
and global periodicities resulting from the superposition of repeating coherent structures.
From the significant wavelet power spectra, we find evidence for a general upper-limit on individual
transient coherency of $\sim$10 days. We find evidence for a set of global periodicities between
4-5 hours and 35-45 days. We find evidence for the distribution of individual transient coherency
scales consisting of two distinct populations. Below the $\sim$2 day time scale the distribution
is reasonably approximated by an inverse power law, whereas for scales $\gtrsim$2 days, the distribution
levels off showing discrete peaks at common coherency scales. In addition, by organizing the transient
coherency scale distributions by wind type, we find these larger, common coherency scales are more
prevalent and well-defined in coronal hole wind. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results
for current theories of solar wind generation and describe future work for determining the relationship
between the coherent structures in our ionic composition data and the structure of the coronal magnetic
field.
