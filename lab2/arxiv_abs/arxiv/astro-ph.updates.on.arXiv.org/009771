We present a new Chandra observation (performed in July 2016) of the neutron star X-ray transient
IGR J17480-2446, located in the globular cluster Terzan 5. We study the continued cooling of the
neutron star crust in this system that was heated during the 2010 outburst of the source. This new
observation was performed two years after the last observation of IGR J17480-2446, hence, significantly
extending the cooling baseline. We reanalysed all available Chandra observations of the source
(but excluding observations during which one of the known transients in Terzan 5 was in outburst)
and fitted the obtained cooling curve with our cooling code NSCool, which allows for much improved
modelling than what was previously performed for the source. The data and our fit models indicate
that the crust was still cooling ~5.5 years after the outburst ended. The neutron star crust has likely
not reached crust-core thermal equilibrium yet, and further cooling is predicted (which can be
confirmed with additional Chandra observations in >5 years). Intriguingly, we find indications
that the thermal conductivity might be relatively low in part of the crust compared to what has been
inferred for other crust-cooling sources and tentatively suggest that this layer might be located
around the neutron drip. The reason for this difference is unclear, but might be related to the fact
that IGR J17480-2446 harbours a relatively slowly rotating neutron star (with a spin of 11 Hz) that
has a relatively strong inferred surface magnetic field ($10^{9-10}$ Gauss) compared to what is
known or typically assumed for other cooling sources.
