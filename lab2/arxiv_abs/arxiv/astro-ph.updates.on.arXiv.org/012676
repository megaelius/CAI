We present improved photometric measurements for the host galaxies of 206 spectroscopically confirmed
type Ia supernovae discovered by the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) and used in the
first DES-SN cosmological analysis. Fitting spectral energy distributions to the $griz$ photometric
measurements of the DES-SN host galaxies, we derive stellar masses and star-formation rates. For
the DES-SN sample, when considering a 5D ($z$, $x_1$, $c$, $\alpha$, $\beta$) bias correction,
we find evidence of a Hubble residual `mass step', where SNe Ia in high mass galaxies ($>10^{10} \textrm{M}_{\odot}$)
are intrinsically more luminous (after correction) than their low mass counterparts by $\gamma=0.040\pm0.019$mag.
This value is larger by $0.031$mag than the value found in the first DES-SN cosmological analysis.
This difference is due to a combination of updated photometric measurements and improved star formation
histories and is not from host-galaxy misidentification. When using a 1D (redshift-only) bias
correction the inferred mass step is larger, with $\gamma=0.066\pm0.020$mag. The 1D-5D $\gamma$
difference for DES-SN is $0.026\pm0.009$mag. We show that this difference is due to a strong correlation
between host galaxy stellar mass and the $x_1$ component of the 5D distance-bias correction. To
better understand this effect, we include an intrinsic correlation between light-curve width
and stellar mass in simulated SN Ia samples. We show that a 5D fit recovers $\gamma$ with $-9$mmag
bias compared to a $+2$mmag bias for a 1D fit. This difference can explain part of the discrepancy
seen in the data. Improvements in modeling correlations between galaxy properties and SN is necessary
to determine the implications for $\gamma$ and ensure unbiased precision estimates of the dark
energy equation-of-state as we enter the era of LSST.
