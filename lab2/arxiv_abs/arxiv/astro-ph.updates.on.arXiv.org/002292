We study the total density distribution in the central regions (~ 1 effective radius, $R_e$) of early-type
galaxies (ETGs), using data from SPIDER and $\rm ATLAS^{3D}$. Our analysis extends the range of
galaxy stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) probed by gravitational lensing, down to ~ $10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$.
We model each galaxy with two components (dark matter halo + stars), exploring different assumptions
for the dark matter (DM) halo profile (i.e. NFW, NFW-contracted, and Burkert profiles), and leaving
stellar mass-to-light ($M_{\star}/L$) ratios as free fitting parameters to the data. For all plausible
halo models, the best-fitting $M_{\star}/L$, normalized to that for a Chabrier IMF, increases
systematically with galaxy size and mass. For an NFW profile, the slope of the total mass profile
is non-universal, independently of several ingredients in the modeling (e.g., halo contraction,
anisotropy, and rotation velocity in ETGs). For the most massive ($M_{\star}$ ~ $10^{11.5} \, M_{\odot}$)
or largest ($R_{\rm e}$ ~ $15 \, \rm kpc$) ETGs, the profile is isothermal in the central regions (~$R_{\rm
e}/2$), while for the low-mass ($M_{\star}$ ~ $10^{10.2} \, M_\odot$) or smallest ($R_{\rm e}$
~ $0.5 \, \rm kpc$) systems, the profile is steeper than isothermal, with slopes similar to those
for a constant-$M/L$ profile. For a steeper concentration-mass relation than that expected from
simulations, the correlation of density slope with galaxy mass tends to flatten, while correlations
with $R_{\rm e}$ and velocity dispersions are more robust. Our results clearly point to a "non-homology"
in the total mass distribution of ETGs, which simulations of galaxy formation suggest may be related
to a varying role of dissipation with galaxy mass.
