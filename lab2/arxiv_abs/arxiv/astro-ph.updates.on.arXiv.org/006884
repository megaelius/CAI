The shape of low-frequency radio continuum spectra of normal galaxies is not well understood, the
key question being the role of physical processes such as thermal absorption in shaping them. In
this work we take advantage of the LOFAR Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) to investigate
such spectra for a large sample of nearby star-forming galaxies. Using the measured 150MHz flux
densities from the LOFAR MSSS survey and literature flux densities at various frequencies we have
obtained integrated radio spectra for 106 galaxies. The spectra are explained through the use of
a three-dimensional model of galaxy radio emission, and radiation transfer dependent on the galaxy
viewing angle and absorption processes. Spectra of our galaxies are generally flatter at lower
compared to higher frequencies but as there is no tendency for the highly inclined galaxies to have
more flattened low-frequency spectra, we argue that the observed flattening is not due to thermal
absorption, contradicting the suggestion of Israel & Mahoney (1990). According to our modelled
radio maps for M51-like galaxies, the free-free absorption effects can be seen only below 30MHz
and in the global spectra just below 20MHz, while in the spectra of starburst galaxies, like M82,
the flattening due to absorption is instead visible up to higher frequencies of about 150MHz. Locally,
within galactic disks, the absorption effects are distinctly visible in M51-like galaxies as spectral
flattening around 100-200MHz in the face-on objects, and as turnovers in the edge-on ones, while
in M82-like galaxies there are strong turnovers at frequencies above 700MHz, regardless of viewing
angle. Our modelling suggests that the weak spectral flattening observed in the nearby galaxies
studied here results principally from synchrotron spectral curvature due to cosmic ray energy
losses and propagation effects.
