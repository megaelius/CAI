Aims: We study single and binary white dwarfs in the inner halo of the Milky Way in order to learn more
about the conditions under which the population of halo stars was born, such as the initial mass function
(IMF), the star formation history, or the binary fraction. Methods: We simulate the evolution of
low-metallicity halo stars at distances up to ~ 3 kpc using the binary population synthesis code
SeBa. We use two different white dwarf cooling models to predict the present-day luminosities of
halo white dwarfs. We determine the white dwarf luminosity functions (WDLFs) for eight different
halo models and compare these with the observed halo WDLF of white dwarfs in the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey.
Furthermore, we predict the properties of binary white dwarfs in the halo and determine the number
of halo white dwarfs that is expected to be observed with the Gaia satellite. Results: By comparing
the WDLFs, we find that a standard IMF matches the observations more accurately than a top-heavy
one, but the difference with a bottom-heavy IMF is small. A burst of star formation 13 Gyr ago fits
slightly better than a star formation burst 10 Gyr ago and also slightly better than continuous star
formation $10-13$ Gyrs ago. Gaia will be the first instrument to constrain the bright end of the field
halo WDLF, where contributions from binary WDs are considerable. Many of these will have He cores,
of which a handful have atypical surface gravities ($\log g < 6$) and reach luminosities $\log(L/L_\odot)
> 0$ in our standard model for WD cooling. These so called pre-WDs, if observed, can help us to constrain
white dwarf cooling models and might teach us something about the fraction of halo stars that reside
in binaries.
