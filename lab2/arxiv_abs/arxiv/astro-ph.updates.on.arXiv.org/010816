The implementation of a new particle module describing the physics of dust grains coupled to the
gas via drag forces is the subject of this work. The proposed particle-gas hybrid scheme has been
designed to work in Cartesian as well as in cylindrical and spherical geometries. The numerical
method relies on a Godunov-type second-order scheme for the fluid and an exponential midpoint rule
for dust particles which overcomes the stiffness introduced by the linear coupling term. Besides
being time-reversible and globally second-order accurate in time, the exponential integrator
provides energy errors which are always bounded and it remains stable in the limit of arbitrarily
small particle stopping times yielding the correct asymptotic solution. Such properties make
this method preferable to the more widely used semi-implicit or fully implicit schemes at a very
modest increase in computational cost. Coupling between particles and grid quantities is achieved
through particle deposition and field-weighting techniques borrowed from Particle-In-Cell
simulation methods. In this respect, we derive new weight factors in curvilinear coordinates that
are more accurate than traditional volume- or area-weighting. A comprehensive suite of numerical
benchmarks is presented to assess the accuracy and robustness of the algorithm in Cartesian, cylindrical
and spherical coordinates. Particular attention is devoted to the streaming instability which
is analyzed in both local and global disk models. The module is part of the PLUTO code for astrophysical
gas-dynamics and it is mainly intended for the numerical modeling of protoplanetary disks in which
solid and gas interact via aerodynamic drag.
