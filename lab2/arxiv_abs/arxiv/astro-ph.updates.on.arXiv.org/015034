We outline a flagship-class mission concept focused on studying Titan as a global system, with particular
emphasis on the polar regions. Investigating Titan from the unique standpoint of a polar orbit would
enable comprehensive global maps to uncover the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere, and the
topography and geophysical environment of the surface and subsurface. The mission includes two
key elements: (1) an orbiter spacecraft, which also acts as a data relay, and (2) one or more small
probes to directly investigate Titan's seas and make the first direct measurements of their liquid
composition and physical environment. The orbiter would carry a sophisticated remote sensing
payload, including a novel topographic lidar, a long-wavelength surface-penetrating radar,
a sub-millimeter sounder for winds and for mesospheric/thermospheric composition, and a camera
and near-infrared spectrometer. An instrument suite to analyze particles and fields would include
a mass spectrometer to focus on the interactions between Titan's escaping upper atmosphere and
the solar wind and Saturnian magnetosphere. The orbiter would enter a stable polar orbit around
1500 to 1800 km, from which vantage point it would make global maps of the atmosphere and surface.
One or more probes, released from the orbiter, would investigate Titan's seas in situ, including
possible differences in composition between higher and lower latitude seas, as well as the atmosphere
during the parachute descent. The number of probes, as well as the instrument complement on the orbiter
and probe, remain to be finalized during a mission study that we recommend to NASA as part of the NRC
Decadal Survey for Planetary Science now underway, with the goal of an overall mission cost in the
"small flagship" category of ~$2 bn. International partnerships, similar to Cassini-Huygens,
may also be included for consideration.
