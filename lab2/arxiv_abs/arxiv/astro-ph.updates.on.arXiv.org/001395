The Scripted E-merlin Rfi-mitigation PipelinE for iNTerferometry (SERPent) is an automated reduction
and RFI-mitigation procedure utilising the SumThreshold methodology (Offringa et al. 2010b),
originally developed for the LOFAR pipeline. SERPent is written in the Parseltongue language enabling
interaction with the Astronomical Image Processing Software (AIPS) program. Moreover, SERPent
is a simple "out of the box" Python script, which is easy to set up and is free of compilers. In addition
to the flagging of RFI affected visibilities, the script also flags antenna zero-amplitude dropouts
and Lovell telescope phase calibrator stationary scans inherent to the e-MERLIN system. Both the
flagging and computational performances of SERPent are presented here, for e-MERLIN commissioning
datasets for both L-band (1.3 - 1.8 GHz) and C-band (4 - 8 GHz) observations. RFI typically amounts
to < 20 - 25% for the more problematic L-band observations and < 5% for the generally RFI quieter
C-band. The level of RFI detection and flagging is more accurate and delicate than visual manual
flagging, with the output immediately ready for AIPS calibration. SERPent is fully parallelised
and has been tested on a range of computing systems. The current flagging rate is at 110 GB/day on a
"high-end" computer (16 CPUs, 100 GB memory) which amounts to ~ 6.9 GB/CPU/day, with an expected
increase in performance when e-MERLIN has completed its commissioning. The refining of automated
reduction and calibration procedures is essential for the e-MERLIN legacy projects and future
interferometers such as the SKA and the associated pathfinders (MeerKAT and ASKAP), where the vast
data sizes (> TB) make traditional astronomer interactions unfeasible.
