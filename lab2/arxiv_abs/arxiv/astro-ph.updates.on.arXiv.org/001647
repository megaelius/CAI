We present new observations of the (6,6) and (9,9) inversion transitions of the hydronium ion toward
Sagittarius B2(N) and W31C. Sensitive observations toward Sagittarius B2(N) show that the high,
~ 500 K, rotational temperatures characterizing the population of the highly-excited metastable
H3O+ rotational levels are present over a wide range of velocities corresponding to the Sagittarius
B2 envelope, as well as the foreground gas clouds between the Sun and the source. Observations of
the same lines toward W31C, a line of sight that does not intersect the Central Molecular Zone, but
instead traces quiescent gas in the Galactic disk, also imply a high rotational temperature of ~
380 K, well in excess of the kinetic temperature of the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium. While
it is plausible that some fraction of the molecular gas may be heated to such high temperatures in
the active environment of the Galactic center, characterized by high X-ray and cosmic ray fluxes,
shocks and high degree of turbulence, this is unlikely in the largely quiescent environment of the
Galactic disk clouds. We suggest instead that the highly-excited states of the hydronium ion are
populated mainly by exoergic chemical formation processes and temperature describing the rotational
level population does not represent the physical temperature of the medium. The same arguments
may be applicable to other symmetric top rotors, such as ammonia. This offers a simple explanation
to the long-standing puzzle of the presence of a pervasive, hot molecular gas component in the central
region of the Milky Way. Moreover, our observations suggest that this is a universal process, not
limited to the active environments associated with galactic nuclei.
