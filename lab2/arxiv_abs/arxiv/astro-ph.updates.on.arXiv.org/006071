The concordance $\Lambda$CDM Cosmology predicts tens of satellite galaxies distributed in the
inner region ($<40$ kpc) of the Milky Way (MW), yet only $7$ were discovered at present day, including
3 discovered recently by Dark Energy Survey (DES). We use $5$ ultra-high resolution simulations
of MW sized dark matter haloes from the $Aquarius$ project, combined with $GalForm$ semi-analytical
galaxy formation model, to investigate properties of the model satellite galaxy population inside
$40$ kpc of MW sized haloes. On average, in each halo this model predicts about $20$ inner satellite
galaxies , among them $5$ are comparable to the classic satellites in the luminosity, these are in
stark contrast to the corresponding numbers in observations. We further investigate the survivability
of these model inner satellites in the presence of a central stellar disk with a set of ideal simulations.
These are done by re-evolving a quarter (30) of the whole $Aquarius$ inner satellite galaxies (121)
by including a static disk potential in addition to the MW halo. Our finding is that, while the additional
disk can completely disrupt some satellites with very close percentres, 60 percent of them could
still survive to the present day. This results in $14$ satellite galaxies within the $40$ kpc of each
$Aquarius$ when taking into account of the MW disk, still a factor of 2 more abundant than the observed
number. Therefore, unless half a dozen satellite galaxies could be discovered within $40$ kpc of
the MW by future surveys, the deficiency in the inner satellite galaxy population may post a serious
challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM theory.
