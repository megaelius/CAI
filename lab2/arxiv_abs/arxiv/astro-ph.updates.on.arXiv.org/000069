Minor mergers frequently occur between giant and gas-rich low mass galaxies and can provide significant
amounts of interstellar matter to refuel star formation and power AGN in the giant systems. Major
starbursts and/or AGN result when fresh gas is transported and compressed in the central regions
of the giant galaxy. This is the situation in NGC1614, whose molecular medium we explore at half arcsecond
angular resolution through our observations of 12CO(2-1) emission using the SMA. We compare our
maps with optical and Pa alpha, HST and high angular resolution radio continuum images to study the
relationships between dense molecular gas and the starburst region. The most intense CO emission
occurs in a partial ring with ~230pc radius around the center, with an extension to the north-west
into the dust lane that contains diffuse molecular gas. We resolve 10 GMAs in the ring which has an
integrated molecular mass of ~8x10^8M_sun. Our observations filter out a large part of the CO(1-0)
emission mapped at shorter spacings, indicating that most of the molecular gas is diffuse and that
GMAs only exist near and within the circumnuclear ring. The molecular ring is uneven with most of
the mass on the western side, which also contains GMAs extending into a pronounced tidal dust lane.
The spatial and kinematic patterns suggest that the northwest extension of the ring is a cosmic umbilical
cord that is feeding molecular gas associated with the dust lane and tidal debris into the nuclear
ring. The astrophysical process for producing a ring structure is not fully understood, but the
presence of numerous GMAs suggests an orbit crowding or resonance phenomenon. There is some evidence
that star formation is progressing radially outwards within the ring, indicating that a self-triggering
mechanism may also affect these processes.
