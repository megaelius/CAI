Although petrologic, chemical and isotopic studies of ordinary chondrites and meteorites in general
have largely helped establish a chronology of the earliest events of planetesimal formation and
their evolution, there are several questions that cannot be resolved via laboratory measurements
and/or experiments only. Here we propose rationale for several new constraints on the formation
and evolution of ordinary chondrite parent bodies (and by extension most planetesimals) from newly
available spectral measurements and mineralogical analysis of main belt S-type asteroids (83
objects) and unequilibrated ordinary chondrite meteorites (53 samples). Based on the latter,
we suggest spectral data may be used to distinguish whether an ordinary chondrite was formed near
the surface or in the interior of its parent body. If these constraints are correct, the suggested
implications include that: i) large groups of compositionally similar asteroids are a natural
outcome of planetesimal formation and, consequently, meteorites within a given class can originate
from multiple parent bodies; ii) the surfaces of large (up to ~200km) S-type main-belt asteroids
expose mostly the interiors of the primordial bodies, a likely consequence of impacts by small asteroids
(D<10km) in the early solar system (Ciesla et al. 2013); iii) the duration of accretion of the
H chondrite parent bodies was likely short (instantaneous or in less then ~10^5 yr but certainly
not as long as 1 Myr); iv) LL-like bodies formed closer to the Sun than H-like bodies, a possible consequence
of radial mixing and size sorting of chondrules in the protoplanetary disk prior to accretion.
