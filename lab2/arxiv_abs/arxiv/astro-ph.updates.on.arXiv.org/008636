Pebble accretion is an efficient mechanism able to build up the core of the giant planets within the
lifetime of the protoplanetary disc gas-phase. The core grows via this process until the protoplanet
reaches its pebble isolation mass and starts to accrete gas. During the growth, the protoplanet
undergoes a rapid, large-scale, inward migration due to the interactions with the gaseous protoplanetary
disc. In our work, we investigate how this early migration would have affected the minor body populations
in our solar system. In particular, we focus on the Jupiter Trojans and the Hildas asteroids. We found
that a massive and eccentric Hilda group is captured during the migration from a region between 5
and 8 au and subsequently depleted during the late instability of the giant planets. Our simulations
also show that inward migration of the giant planets always produces a Jupiter Trojans' leading
swarm more populated than the trailing one, with a ratio comparable to the current observed Trojan
asymmetry ratio. The in situ formation of Jupiter, on the other hand, produces symmetric leading/trailing
swarms. The reason for the asymmetry is the relative drift between the migrating planet and the particles
in the coorbital resonance. The capture happens during the growth of Jupiter's core and Trojan asteroids
are afterwards carried along during the giant planet's migration to their final orbits. The asymmetry
and eccentricity of the captured Trojans correspond well to observations, but their inclinations
are near zero and their total mass is 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than the current population.
Future modelling will be needed to understand whether the dynamical evolution of the Trojans over
billions of years will raise the inclinations and deplete the masses to observed values.
