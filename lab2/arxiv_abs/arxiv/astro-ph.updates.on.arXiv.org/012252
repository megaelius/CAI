Galactic cosmic-ray source compositions, (Z/H)GCRS from H to Pb and ~10^8 - 10^14 eV, differ from
solar-local interstellar, (Z/H)SS or (Z/H)ISM by ~20-200x. Both are mostly just mixes of core collapse
(CCSN) and thermonuclear (SN Ia) supernova ejecta. The (Z/H)ISM come from steady unbiased accumulation
over Gyrs. But the cosmic ray mass mixing ratio, universal ISM/CCSN ~4:1 of swept-up ISM and ~10x
metallicity ejecta show that (Z/H)GCRS come from basic Sedov-Taylor bulk mixing of homologous,
expanding CCSN in their OB cluster self-generated superbubbles, further enriched by highly biased
grain-sputtering injection during diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Moreover, this mixing
ratio now reveals that the cosmic rays are primarily accelerated as their evolving reverse shock
radius and energy passes through their maxima. Refractories and volatiles, first deposited in
fast ejecta and ISM grains in freely expanding ejecta, are simultaneously Coulomb-sputtered FCS
by turbulent H and He as suprathermal ions into DSA that carries them to cosmic-ray energies. This
bulk mixing selectively increases source mix abundancies (Z/H)SM / (Z/H)SS by ~2-10; and injection
by grain condensation and implantation fractions FGC, by another ~6, while Z^0.67 Coulomb grain
sputtering enrichments FCS give an added ~4-20. Applying these basic processes of mixing and injection
to solar system (Z/H)SS produces grain-injected, source-mix (Z/H)SMGI that match major cosmic
ray abundances (Z/H)GCRS to within 35 % with no free parameters. Independently confirming grain
injection, (Z/H)GCRS shows no detectable contribution of Fe from SN Ia, although producing ~1/2
Fe in ISM, but there is also no dust in SN Ia remnants, unlike CCSN.
