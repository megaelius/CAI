We study how diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measured toward distance-distributed target stars
can be used to locate dense interstellar (IS) clouds in the Galaxy and probe a line-of-sight (LOS)
kinematical structure, a potential useful tool when gaseous absorption lines are saturated or
not available in the spectral range. Cool target stars are numerous enough for this purpose. We have
devised automated DIB fitting methods appropriate to cool star spectra and multiple IS components.
The data is fitted with a combination of a synthetic stellar spectrum, a synthetic telluric transmission,
and empirical DIB profiles. In parallel, stellar distances and extinctions are estimated self-consistently
by means of a 2D Bayesian method, from spectroscopically-derived stellar parameters and photometric
data. We have analyzed Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) and previously recorded spectra that probe between
$\sim$ 2 and 10 kpc long LOS in five different regions of the Milky Way. Depending on the observed spectral
intervals, we extracted one or more of the following DIBs: $\lambda\lambda$ 6283.8, 6613.6 and
8620.4. For each field, we compared the DIB strengths with the Bayesian distances and extinctions,
and the DIB Doppler velocities with the HI emission spectra. For all fields, the DIB strength and
the target extinction are well correlated. In case of targets widely distributed in distance, marked
steps in DIBs and extinction radial distance profiles match with each other and broadly correspond
to the expected locations of spiral arms. For all fields, the DIB velocity structure agrees with
HI emission spectra and all detected DIBs correspond to strong NaI lines. This illustrates how DIBs
can be used to locate the Galactic interstellar gas and to study its kinematics at the kpc scale.
