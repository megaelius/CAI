We study the structure of compact objects that contain non-self annihilating, self-interacting
dark matter admixed with ordinary matter made of neutron star and white dwarf materials. We extend
the previous work Phys. Rev. D 92 123002 (2015) on these dark compact objects by analyzing the effect
of weak and strongly interacting dark matter with particle masses in the range of 1-500 GeV, so as
to set some constraints in the strength of the interaction and the mass of the dark matter particle.
We find that the total mass of the compact objects increases with decreasing dark matter particle
mass. In the strong interacting case and for dark matter particle masses in the range 1-10 GeV, the
total mass of the compact objects largely exceeds the $2M_\odot$ constraint for neutron star masses
and the nominal $1M_\odot$for white dwarfs, while for larger dark matter particle masses or in the
weakly interacting case the compact objects show masses in agreement or smaller than these constraints,
thus hinting at the exclusion of strongly self-interacting dark matter of masses 1-10 GeV in the
interior of these compact objects. Moreover, we observe that the smaller the dark matter particle
mass, the larger the quantity of dark matter captured is, putting constraints on the dark matter
mass trapped in the compact objects so as to fullfill $\simeq 2M_\odot$ observations. Finally,
the inhomogeneity of distribution of dark matter in the Galaxy implies a mass dependence of compact
objects from the environment which can be used to put constraints on the characteristics of the Galaxy
halo DM profile and on particle mass. In view of the these results, we discuss the formation of the
dark compact objects in an homogeneous and non-homogeneous dark matter environment.
