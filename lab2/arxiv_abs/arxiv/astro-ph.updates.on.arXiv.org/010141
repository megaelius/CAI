We investigate the silicate feature of the two Class I components of HH250-IRS, a resolved binary
system with a separation of $0''53$ driving a Herbig-Haro flow. Each component has its own circumstellar
envelope, and the system is surrounded by a circumbinary disk. We have carried out low resolution
spectroscopy in the 8-13$\mu$m range using VISIR at ESO's Very Large Telescope. The silicate features
of both sources are clearly different. The NW component has a broad, smooth absorption profile lacking
structure. The SE component shows the silicate feature in emission, with structure longwards of
9.5$\mu$m indicating the presence of crystalline dust in the dominant form of forsterite. The apparent
lack of an absorption feature caused by foreground dust is probably due to the filling of the band
with emission by amorphous silicates in the envelope of the object. Despite their virtually certain
coevality, the differences in the components of the HH250-IRS binary are most likely due to markedly
different circumstellar environments. The NW component displays an unevolved envelope, whereas
dust growth and crystallization has taken place in the SE component. The weak or absent signatures
of enstatite in the latter are fairly unusual among envelopes with crystalline dust, and we tentatively
relate it to a possible wide gap or an inner truncation of the disk already hinted in previous observations
by a drop in the $L'$-band flux, which might indicate that the SE component could actually be a very
close binary. We speculate that the clear differences between the silicate feature spectra of both
components of HH250-IRS may be due either to disk evolution sped up by multiplicity, or by accretion
variability leading to episodes of crystal formation.
