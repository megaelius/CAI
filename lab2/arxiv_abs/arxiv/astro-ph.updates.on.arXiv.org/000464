We present a study of multiwavelength X-ray and weak lensing scaling relations for a sample of 50
clusters of galaxies. Our analysis combines Chandra and XMM-Newton data using an energy-dependent
cross-calibration. After considering a number of scaling relations, we find that gas mass is the
most robust estimator of weak lensing mass, yielding 15 +/- 6% intrinsic scatter at r500 (the pseudo-pressure
YX has a consistent scatter of 22%+/-5%). The scatter does not change when measured within a fixed
physical radius of 1 Mpc. Clusters with small BCG to X-ray peak offsets constitute a very regular
population whose members have the same gas mass fractions and whose even smaller <10% deviations
from regularity can be ascribed to line of sight geometrical effects alone. Cool-core clusters,
while a somewhat different population, also show the same (<10%) scatter in the gas mass-lensing
mass relation. There is a good correlation and a hint of bimodality in the plane defined by BCG offset
and central entropy (or central cooling time). The pseudo-pressure YX does not discriminate between
the more relaxed and less relaxed populations, making it perhaps the more even-handed mass proxy
for surveys. Overall, hydrostatic masses underestimate weak lensing masses by 10% on the average
at r500; but cool-core clusters are consistent with no bias, while non-cool-core clusters have
a large and constant 15-20% bias between r2500 and r500, in agreement with N-body simulations incorporating
unthermalized gas. For non-cool-core clusters, the bias correlates well with BCG ellipticity.
We also examine centroid shift variance and and power ratios to quantify substructure; these quantities
do not correlate with residuals in the scaling relations. Individual clusters have for the most
part forgotten the source of their departures from self-similarity.
