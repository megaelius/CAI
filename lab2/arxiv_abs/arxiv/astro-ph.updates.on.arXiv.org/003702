Following extensive tests on analytical toy-catalogues (paper III), we present the results of
a more realistic study over a 711 deg2 template-based cosmological simulation. Dark matter halos
from the Aardvark simulation have been ascribed luminosities, temperatures and core-radii, using
local scaling relations and assuming self-similar evolution. Predicted X-ray sky-maps are converted
into XMM event lists using an instrumental simulator. The XXL pipeline run on the resulting sky images,
produces an 'observed' cluster catalogue over which the tests have been performed. This allowed
us to investigate the relative power of various combinations of count-rate, hardness-ratio, apparent-size
and redshift information. Two fitting methods were used : a traditional MCMC approach and a simple
minimisation procedure (Amoeba) whose mean uncertainties are a posteriori evaluated by means
of synthetic catalogues. Results were analysed and compared to the predictions from a Fisher analysis
(FA). For this particular catalogue realisation, assuming perfectly known scaling relations,
the CR-HR combination gives $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ at the 10% level, while CR-HR-r$_c$-z improves
this to $\leq$ 3%. Adding a second hardness ratio improves results from the CR-HR1-r$_c$ combination,
but to a lesser extent than adding redshift information. When all coefficients of the M-T relation
(including scatter) are also fitted, cosmological parameters are constrained to within 5-10%,
and larger for the M-T coefficients (up to a factor of two for the scatter). Errors returned by the
MCMC, by Amoeba, and by FA predictions, are in most cases in excellent agreement and always within
a factor of two. We also study the impact of the scatter of the M-Rc relation on the number of detected
clusters: for the cluster typical sizes usually assumed, the larger the scatter, the lower the number
of detected objects.
