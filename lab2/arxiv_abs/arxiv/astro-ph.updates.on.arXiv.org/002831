The Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) may preserve evidence of planet building in their orbital and
size-distributions. While all populations show steep size-distributions for large objects,
recently relative deficit of Neptunian Trojans and scattering objects with diameters $D<100\,\mathrm{km}$
were detected. We have investigated this deficit with a 32 square degree survey, detecting 77 TNOs
to a limiting $r$-band magnitude of 24.6. Our Plutinos sample (18 objects in 3:2 mean motion resonance
with Neptune) also shows a deficit of $D<100\,\mathrm{km}$ objects. We reject a single power-law
size-distribution and find that the Plutinos favour a divot. The Plutinos are thus added the list
of populations with a deficit of $D<100\,\mathrm{km}$ objects. The fact that three independent
samples of three different populations show this trend suggests that it is a real feature, possibly
shared by all hot TNO populations as a remnant of "born big" planetesimal formation processes. We
surmise the existence of $9000\pm3000$ Plutinos with $H_r\leq8.66$ and $37000^{+12000}_{-10000}$
Plutinos with $H_r\leq10.0$. Our survey also discovered one temporary Uranian Trojan, one temporary
Neptunian Trojans and one stable Neptunian Trojan, from which we derive populations of $110^{+500}_{-100}$,
$210^{+900}_{-200}$ and $150^{+600}_{-140}$ , respectively, with $H_r\leq10.0$. The Neptunian
Trojans are thus less numerous than the main belt asteroids, which has over 700 asteroids with $H_r\leq10.0$.
With such numbers, the temporary Neptunian Trojans cannot be previously stable Trojans that happen
to be escaping the resonance now; they must be captured from another reservoir. With three 3:1 and
one 4:1 resonators, we add to the growing evidence that the high-order resonances are more populated
than expected.
