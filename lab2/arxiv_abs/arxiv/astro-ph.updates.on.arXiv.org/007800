Centrally located diffuse radio emission has been observed in both merging and non-merging galaxy
clusters. Depending on their morphology and size, we distinguish between giant radio haloes, which
occur predominantly in merging clusters, and mini haloes, which are found in non-merging, cool-core
clusters. Low-frequency sensitive observations are required to assess whether the emission discovered
in these few cases is common in galaxy clusters or not. With this aim, we carried out a campaign of observations
with the LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR) in the frequency range 120 - 168 MHz of nine massive clusters selected
from the \textit{Planck} SZ catalogue, which had no sign of major mergers. In this paper, we discuss
the results of the observations that have led to the largest cluster sample studied within the LOFAR
Two-metre Sky Survey, and we present Chandra X-ray data used to investigate the dynamical state
of the clusters, verifying that the clusters are currently not undergoing major mergers, and to
search for traces of minor or off-axis mergers. We discover large-scale steep-spectrum emission
around mini haloes in the cool-core clusters PSZ1G139 and RXJ1720, which is not observed around
the mini halo in the non-cool-core cluster A1413. We also discover a new 570 kpc-halo in the non-cool-core
cluster RXCJ0142. We derived new upper limits to the radio power for clusters in which no diffuse
radio emission was found, and we discuss the implication of our results to constrain the cosmic-ray
energy budget in the ICM. We conclude that radio emission in non-merging massive clusters is not
common at the sensitivity level reached by our observations and that no clear connection with the
cluster dynamical state is observed. Our results might indicate that the sloshing of a dense cool
core could trigger particle acceleration on larger scales and generate steep-spectrum radio emission.
