Hanle scattering is an important diagnostic tool to study weak solar magnetic fields. Partial frequency
redistribution (PRD) is necessary to interpret the linear polarization observed in strong resonance
lines. Usually angle-averaged PRD functions are used to analyze linear polarization. However
it is established that angle-dependent PRD functions are often necessary to interpret polarization
profiles formed in the presence of weak magnetic fields. Our aim is to present an efficient decomposition
technique, and the numerical method to solve the concerned angle-dependent line transfer problem.
Together with the standard Stokes decomposition technique we employ Fourier expansion over the
outgoing azimuth angle to express in a more convenient form, the angle-dependent PRD function for
the Hanle effect. It allows the use of angle-dependent frequency domains of Bommier to solve the
Hanle transfer problem. Such an approach is self-consistent and accurate compared to a recent approach
where angle-averaged frequency domains were used to solve the same problem. We show that it is necessary
to incorporate angle-dependent frequency domains instead of angle-averaged frequency domains
to solve the Hanle transfer problem accurately, especially for the Stokes U parameter. The importance
of using angle-dependent domains has been highlighted by taking the example of Hanle effect in the
case of line transfer with vertical magnetic fields in a slab atmosphere. We have also studied the
case of polarized line formation when micro-turbulent magnetic fields are present. The difference
between angle-averaged and angle-dependent solutions is enhanced by the presence of micro-turbulent
fields.
