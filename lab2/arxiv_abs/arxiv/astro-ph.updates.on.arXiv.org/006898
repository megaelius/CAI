The HELP project focuses on the data from ESA's Herschel mission, which covered over 1300$deg^2$
and is preparing to publish a multi-wavelength catalogue of millions of objects. Our main goal is
to find the best approach to simultaneously fitting SEDs of millions of galaxies across a wide redshift
range to obtain homogeneous estimates of the main physical parameters of detected IR galaxies.
We perform SED fitting on the UV/NIR to FIR emission of 42 047 galaxies from the pilot HELP field: ELAIS
N1. We use the latest release of CIGALE, a galaxy SED fitting code relying on energy balance, to deliver
the main physical parameters such as $M_{star}$, SFR, and $L_{dust}$. We implement additional
quality criteria to the fits by calculating $\chi^2$ values for the stellar and dust part of the spectra
independently. These criteria allow us to identify the best fits and to identify peculiar galaxies.
We perform the SED fitting by assuming three different dust attenuation laws separately allowing
us to test the impact of the assumed law on estimated physical parameters. We implemented two additional
quality value checks for the SED fitting method based on $M_{star}$ estimation and energy budget.
This method allows us to identify possible objects with incorrect matching in the catalogue and
peculiar galaxies; we found 351 possible candidates of lensed galaxies using two complementary
$\chi^2$s criteria (stellar and IR) and $z_{phot}$ calculated for the IR part of the spectrum only.
We find that the attenuation law has an important impact on the $M_{star}$ estimate (on average leading
to disparities of a factor of two). We derive the relation between $M_{star}$ estimates obtained
by different attenuation laws and we find the best recipe for our sample. We also make independent
estimates of the total $L_{dust}$ parameter from stellar emission by fitting the galaxies with
and without IR data separately.
