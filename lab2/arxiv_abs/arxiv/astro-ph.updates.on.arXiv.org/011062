Using the HST/ACS $I_{\rm F814W}$-band data, we investigated distribution of apparent axial ratios
of $\sim21000$ galaxies with $M_{V}<-20$ at $0.2<z<1.0$ in the COSMOS field as a function of stellar
mass, specific star formation rate (sSFR), and redshift. We statistically estimated intrinsic
3-dimensional shapes of these galaxies by fitting the axial-ratio distribution with triaxial
ellipsoid models characterized by face-on (middle-to-long) and edge-on (short-to-long) axial
ratios $B/A$ and $C/A$. We found that the transition from thin disk to thick spheroid occurs at $\Delta$MS
$\sim-1$ dex, i.e., 10 times lower sSFR than that of the main sequence for galaxies with $M_{\rm star}
= 10^{10}$--$10^{11} M_{\odot}$ at $0.2<z<1.0$. Furthermore, the intrinsic thickness ($C/A$)
of passively evolving galaxies with $M_{\rm star}=10^{10}$--$10^{11}M_{\odot}$ significantly
decreases with time from $C/A \sim 0.40$ -- $0.50$ at $z\sim 0.8$ to $C/A\sim0.33$ -- $0.37$ at $z\sim0.4$,
while those galaxies with $M_{\rm star}>10^{11}M_{\odot}$ have $C/A\sim0.5$ irrespective of
redshift. On the other hand, star-forming galaxies on the main sequence with $10^{9.5}$--$10^{11}M_{\odot}$
show no significant evolution in their shape at $0.2<z<1.0$, but their thickness depends on stellar
mass;more massive star-forming galaxies tend to have lower $C/A$ (thinner shape) than low-mass
ones. These results suggest that some fraction of star-forming galaxies with a thin disk, which
started to appear around $z\sim1$, quench their star formation without violent morphological
change, and these newly added quiescent galaxies with a relatively thin shape cause the significant
evolution in the axial-ratio distribution of passively evolving galaxies with $M_{\rm star}<10^{11}M_{\odot}$
at $z<1$.
