We present a size analysis of a sample of $\sim$ 49,000 galaxies from the CANDELS GOODS North and South
fields using redshift-independent relative surface brightness metrics to determine an unbiased
measure of the differential size evolution of galaxies at $1 \leq z \leq 7$. We introduce a novel method
of removing foreground objects from distant galaxy ($z > 3$) images that makes use of the Lyman-break
at 912{\AA}, in what we call `2-D Lyman-Break Imaging'. The images used are in the rest-frame optical
at $z < 3$ and progressively bluer bands at $z > 3$. They are therefore subject to K-correction and
cosmological dimming effects which are tested and corrected for. We separately consider a mass-selected
sample (with masses in the range 10$^9$M$_{\odot}$$\leq$M$_*$$\leq$10$^{10.5}$M$_{\odot}$)
and a number density selected sample (using a constant number density of $n = 1\times10^{-4}$Mpc$^{-3}$).
Instead of utilising the commonly used, but potentially biased, effective radii for size measurements,
we measure the redshift-independent Petrosian radius, defined by the parameter $\eta$, for each
galaxy for three values of $\eta$ and use this as a proxy for size. The evolution of the measured radii
can be described by a power-law of the form $R_{Petr} = \alpha(1+z)^\beta$kpc where $\beta < 0$.
We find that the outer radius increases more rapidly, suggesting that as a galaxy grows mass is added
to its outer regions via an inside-out growth. This growth is stronger for the number density selected
sample, with a growth rate of nearly three in the outer radii compared to the inner. We test and confirm
these results using a series of image simulations.
