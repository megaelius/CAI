[Abridged] We present a systematic study of gas density perturbations in cool cores of high-mass
clusters. We select 12 relaxed clusters from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble
(CLASH) sample and analyze their cool core features observed with Chandra. Here we focus on the X-ray
residual image characteristics after subtracting their global profile of the X-ray surface brightness.
We find that all the clusters in our sample have, at least, both one positive and one negative excess
regions in the X-ray residual image, which indicates the presence of gas density perturbations
in their cool core. We identify and characterize the locally perturbed regions using our detection
algorithm, and extract X-ray spectra of the intracluster medium (ICM) from each region. The ICM
temperature in the positive excess region is lower than that in the negative excess region, whereas
the ICM in both regions is in pressure equilibrium in a systematic manner. These results indicate
that gas sloshing in cool cores takes place in more than 80% of relaxed clusters (95% CL). We confirm
this physical picture by analyzing synthetic X-ray observations of a cool-core cluster from a hydrodynamic
simulation, finding that our detection algorithm can accurately extract both the positive and
negative excess regions in the simulated X-ray images and can reproduce the temperature difference.
We compare the contrast of gas density perturbations with the cluster mass and concentration parameter
derived from the CLASH survey. The contrast is found to anti-correlate with the cluster mass, whereas
it has a positive correlation with the concentration parameter. Our findings support the picture
that the gas density perturbations are induced by gas sloshing, and a large fraction of cool-core
clusters have undergone gas sloshing, indicating that gas sloshing is capable of suppressing runaway
cooling of the ICM.
