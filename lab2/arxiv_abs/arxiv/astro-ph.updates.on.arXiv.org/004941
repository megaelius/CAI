A warm/hot dust component (at temperature $>$ 300K) has been detected around $\sim$ 20% of stars.
This component is called "exozodiacal dust" as it presents similarities with the zodiacal dust
detected in our Solar System, even though its physical properties and spatial distribution can
be significantly different. Understanding the origin and evolution of this dust is of crucial importance,
not only because its presence could hamper future detections of Earth-like planets in their habitable
zones, but also because it can provide invaluable information about the inner regions of planetary
systems. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the observational techniques used in
the detection and characterisation of exozodiacal dust clouds ("exozodis") and the results they
have yielded so far, in particular regarding the incidence rate of exozodis as a function of crucial
parameters such as stellar type and age, or the presence of an outer cold debris disc. We also present
the important constraints that have been obtained, on dust size distribution and spatial location,
by using state-of-the-art radiation transfer models on some of these systems. Finally, we investigate
the crucial issue of how to explain the presence of exozodiacal dust around so many stars (regardless
of their ages) despite the fact that such dust so close to its host star should disappear rapidly due
to the coupled effect of collisions and stellar radiation pressure. Several potential mechanisms
have been proposed to solve this paradox and are reviewed in detail in this paper. The review finishes
by presenting the future of this growing field.
