Neutron stars are thought to be excellent laboratories for determining the equation of state (EoS)
of cold dense matter. Their strong gravity suggests that they can also be used to constrain gravity
models. The two observables of neutron stars-mass and radius (M-R), both depend on the choice of
EoS and relativistic gravity, meaning that neutron stars cannot be simultaneously good laboratories
for both of these questions. A measurement of mass and/or radius would constrain the less well known
physics input. The most common assumption-namely that M-R measurements can be used to constrain
EoS presumes general relativity (GR) is the ultimate model of gravity in the classical regime. We
calculate the radial profile of compactness and curvature (square root of the full contraction
of the Weyl tensor) within a neutron star and determine the domain not probed by the Solar system tests
of GR. We find that, except for a tiny sphere of radius less than a millimeter at the center, the curvature
is several orders of magnitude above the values present in Solar system tests. The compactness is
beyond the solar surface value for $r>10$ m, increases by 5 orders of magnitude towards the surface.
With the density being only an order of magnitude higher than that probed by nuclear scattering experiments,
our results suggest that the employment of GR as the theory of gravity describing the hydrostatic
equilibrium of the neutron stars is a rather remarkable extrapolation from the regime of tested
validity, as opposed to that of EoS models. Our larger ignorance of gravity within neutron stars
suggests that a measurement of mass and/or radius constrains gravity rather than the EoS, and given
that the EoS has yet to be determined by nucleon scattering experiments, M-R measurements cannot
tightly constrain the gravity models either.
