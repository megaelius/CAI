Neutrinos are densely populated deep inside the core of massive stars after their gravitational
collapse to produce supernova explosions and form compact stars such as neutron stars (NS) and black
holes (BH). It has been considered that they may change their flavor identities through so-called
fast-pairwise conversions induced by mutual forward scatterings. If that is really the case, the
dynamics of supernova explosion will be influenced, since the conversion may occur near the neutrino
sphere, from which neutrinos are effectively emitted. In this paper, we conduct a pilot study of
such possibilities based on the results of fully self-consistent, realistic simulations of a core-collapse
supernova explosion in two spatial dimensions under axisymmetry. As we solved the Boltzmann equations
for neutrino transfer in the simulation not as a post-process but in real time, the angular distributions
of neutrinos in momentum space for all points in the core at all times are available, a distinct feature
of our simulations. We employ some of these distributions extracted at a few selected points and
times from the numerical data and apply linear analysis to assess the possibility of the conversion.
We focus on the vicinity of the neutrino sphere, where different species of neutrinos move in different
directions and have different angular distributions as a result. This is a pilot study for a more
thorough survey that will follow soon. We find no positive sign of conversion unfortunately at least
for the spatial points and times we studied in this particular model. We hence investigate rather
in detail the condition for the conversion by modifying the neutrino distributions rather arbitrarily
by hand.
