Motivated by GW170817 we examine constraints that observations put on the angular structure of
long gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. First, the relatively narrow observed distribution of $E_{X}/E_{\gamma}$
(the isotropic equivalent early X-ray afterglow to prompt $\gamma$-ray energy ratio) implies
that at any angle that $\gamma$-rays are emitted the Lorentz factor must be high. Specifically,
the Lorentz factor of $\gamma$-ray emitting material cannot drop rapidly with angle, and must be
$\Gamma(\theta)\gtrsim 50$ even if there are angles for which the gamma-ray received energy is
lower by three orders of magnitude compared to the jet core. Second, jets with an angular structure
of the $\gamma$-ray emission that over-produce events with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity below the
peak of the observed luminosity function are ruled-out. This eliminates models in which the $\gamma$-ray
energy angular distribution isn't sufficiently steep and the Lorentz factor distribution isn't
sufficiently shallow. Finally, models with a steep structure (e.g. Gaussian) which are detected
away from the jet core generate afterglow light-curves that were never observed. We conclude that
even if the jet kinetic energy distribution drops continuously with latitude, efficient $\gamma$-ray
emission seems to be restricted to material with $\Gamma\gtrsim 50$ and is most likely confined
to a narrow region around the core. While our study is confined to long GRBs, where the observed sample
is larger and more complete, there are indications that similar conclusions may be applicable also
to short GRBs. We discuss the possible implications to the $\gamma$-rays observed in GRB 170817A.
