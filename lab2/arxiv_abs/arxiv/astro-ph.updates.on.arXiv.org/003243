Finding life on exoplanets from telescopic observations is an ultimate goal of exoplanet science.
Life produces gases and other substances, such as pigments, which can have distinct spectral or
photometric signatures. Whether or not life is found with future data must be expressed with probabilities,
requiring a framework of biosignature assessment. We present a framework in which we advocate using
biogeochemical "Exo-Earth System" models to simulate potential biosignatures in spectra or photometry.
Given actual observations, simulations are used to find the Bayesian likelihoods of those data
occurring for scenarios with and without life. The latter includes "false positives" where abiotic
sources mimic biosignatures. Prior knowledge of factors influencing planetary inhabitation,
including previous observations, is combined with the likelihoods to give the Bayesian posterior
probability of life existing on a given exoplanet. Four components of observation and analysis
are necessary. 1) Characterization of stellar (e.g., age and spectrum) and exoplanetary system
properties, including "external" exoplanet parameters (e.g., mass and radius) to determine an
exoplanet's suitability for life. 2) Characterization of "internal" exoplanet parameters (e.g.,
climate) to evaluate habitability. 3) Assessment of potential biosignatures within the environmental
context (components 1-2) and any corroborating evidence. 4) Exclusion of false positives. The
resulting posterior Bayesian probabilities of life's existence map to five confidence levels,
ranging from "very likely" (90-100%) to "very unlikely" ($\le$10%) inhabited.
