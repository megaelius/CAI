We use Spitzer IRS spectroscopy to study the nature 65 IR-luminous galaxies at 0.02 < z < 0.6
with F(24micron) > 1.2mJy. The IRS spectra cover wavelengths spanning the PAH features and important
atomic diagnostic lines. Our sample corresponds to L(IR) = L(8-1000micron) = 10^10-10^12 Lsun.
We divide our galaxies into those with Spitzer IRAC colors indicative of warm dust heated by an AGN
(IRAGN) and those whose colors indicate star-formation processes (non-IRAGN). Compared to the
non-IRAGN, the IRAGN show smaller PAH emission EWs, which we attribute to an increase in mid-IR continuum
from the AGN. We find that in both the IRAGN and non-IRAGN samples, the PAH luminosities correlate
strongly with the [Ne II] emission, from which we conclude that the PAH luminosity directly traces
the instantaneous SFR in both the IRAGN and non-IRAGN galaxies. We compare the ratio of PAH luminosity
to the total IR luminosity and show that for most IRAGN star-formation accounts for 10-50% of the
L(IR). We also find no measurable difference between the PAH luminosity ratios of L(11.3)/L(7.7)
and L(6.2)/L(7.7) for the IRAGN and non-IRAGN, suggesting that AGN do not significantly excite
or destroy PAH molecules on galaxy-wide scales. A small subset of galaxies show excess of [O IV] emission
compared to their PAH emission, which indicates the presence of heavily-obscured AGN, including
3 galaxies that are not otherwise selected as IRAGN. The low PAH emission and low [Ne II] emission
of the IRAGN and [O IV]-excess objects imply they have low SFRs and their IR luminosity is dominated
by processes associated with the AGN.
