Irregular satellites of Jupiter with their highly eccentric, inclined and distant orbits suggest
that their capture took place just before the giant planet migration. We aim to improve our understanding
of the surface composition of irregular satellites of Jupiter to gain insight into a narrow time
window when our Solar System was forming. We observed three Jovian irregular satellites, Himalia,
Elara, and Carme, using a medium-resolution 0.8-5.5 micro m spectrograph on the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Using a linear spectral unmixing
model we have constrained the major mineral phases on the surface of these three bodies. Our results
confirm that the surface of Himalia, Elara, and Carme are dominated by opaque materials such as those
seen in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Our spectral modeling of NIR spectra of Himalia and
Elara confirm that their surface composition is the same and magnetite is the dominant mineral.
A comparison of the spectral shape of Himalia with the two large main C-type asteroids, Themis (D
176 km) and Europa (D 352 km), suggests surface composition similar to Europa. The NIR spectrum of
Carme exhibits blue slope up to 1.5 microm and is spectrally distinct from those of Himalia and Elara.
Our model suggests that it is compositionally similar to amorphous carbon. Himalia and Elara are
compositionally similar but differ significantly from Carme. These results support the hypotheses
that the Jupiter irregular satellites are captured bodies that were subject to further breakup
events and clustered as families based on their similar physical and surface compositions.
