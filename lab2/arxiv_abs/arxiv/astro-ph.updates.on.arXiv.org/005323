In this paper we describe the FIT\textit{spec} code, a data mining tool for the automatic fitting
of synthetic stellar spectra. The program uses a database of 27\,000 {\sc cmfgen} models of stellar
atmospheres arranged in a six-dimensional (6D) space, where each dimension corresponds to one
model parameter. From these models a library of 2\,835\,000 synthetic spectra were generated covering
the ultraviolet, optical, and infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Using FIT\textit{spec}
we adjust the effective temperature and the surface gravity. From the 6D array we also get the luminosity,
the metallicity, and three parameters for the stellar wind: the terminal velocity ($v_\infty$),
the $\beta$ exponent of the velocity law, and the clumping filling factor ($F_{\rm cl}$). Finally,
the projected rotational velocity ($v\cdot\sin i$) can be obtained from the library of stellar
spectra. Validation of the algorithm was performed by analyzing the spectra of a sample of eight
O-type stars taken from the {\sc iacob} spectroscopic survey of Northern Galactic OB stars. The
spectral lines used for the adjustment of the analyzed stars are reproduced with good accuracy.
In particular, the effective temperatures calculated with the FIT\textit{spec} are in good agreement
with those derived from spectral type and other calibrations for the same stars. The stellar luminosities
and projected rotational velocities are also in good agreement with previous quantitative spectroscopic
analyses in the literature. An important advantage of FIT\textit{spec} over traditional codes
is that the time required for spectral analyses is reduced from months to a few hours.
