The shallow faint-end slope of the galaxy mass function is usually reproduced in $\Lambda$CDM galaxy
formation models by assuming that the fraction of baryons that turns into stars drops steeply with
decreasing halo mass and essentially vanishes in haloes with maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm
max}<20$-$30$ km/s. Dark matter-dominated dwarfs should therefore have characteristic velocities
of about that value, unless they are small enough to probe only the rising part of the halo circular
velocity curve (i.e., half-mass radii, $r_{1/2}\ll 1$ kpc). Many dwarfs have properties in disagreement
with this prediction: they are large enough to probe their halo $V_{\rm max}$ but their characteristic
velocities are well below $20$ km/s. These `cold faint giants' (an extreme example is the recently
discovered Crater 2 Milky Way satellite) can only be reconciled with our $\Lambda$CDM models if
they are the remnants of once massive objects heavily affected by tidal stripping. We examine this
possibility using the APOSTLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group. Assuming
that low velocity dispersion satellites have been affected by stripping, we infer their progenitor
masses, radii, and velocity dispersions, and find them in remarkable agreement with those of isolated
dwarfs. Tidal stripping also explains the large scatter in the mass discrepancy-acceleration
relation in the dwarf galaxy regime: tides remove preferentially dark matter from satellite galaxies,
lowering their accelerations below the $a_{\rm min}\sim 10^{-11} m/s^2$ minimum expected for
isolated dwarfs. In many cases, the resulting velocity dispersions are inconsistent with the predictions
from Modified Newtonian Dynamics, a result that poses a possibly insurmountable challenge to that
scenario.
