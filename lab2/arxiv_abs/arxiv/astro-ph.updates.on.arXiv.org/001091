This paper presents a technique to search for supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The search is based on the peculiar properties of merging galaxies that
are found in a mock galaxy catalog from the Millennium Simulation. MBHBs are expected to be the main
gravitational wave (GW) sources for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs); however, it is still unclear if
the observed GW signal will be produced by a few single MBHBs, or if it will have the properties of a
stochastic background. The goal of this work is to produce a map of the sky in which each galaxy is assigned
a probability of having suffered a recent merger, and of hosting a MBHB that could be detected by PTAs.
This constitutes a step forward in the understanding of the expected PTA signal: the skymap can be
used to investigate the clustering properties of PTA sources and the spatial distribution of the
observable GW signal power; moreover, galaxies with the highest probabilities could be used as
inputs in targeted searches for individual GW sources. We also investigate the distribution of
neighboring galaxies around galaxies hosting MBHBs, finding that the most likely detectable PTA
sources are placed in dense galaxy environments. Different techniques are used in the search, including
Bayesian and Machine Learning algorithms, with consistent outputs. The spectral coverage of the
SDSS reaches less than a fifth of the sky, and the catalog becomes severely incomplete at large redshifts;
however, this technique can be applied in the future to larger catalogs to obtain complete, observationally-based
information of the expected GW signal detectable by PTAs.
