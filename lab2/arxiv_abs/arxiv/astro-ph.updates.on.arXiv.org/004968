Condensation clouds in substellar atmospheres have been widely inferred from spectra and photometric
variability. Up until now, their horizontally averaged vertical distribution and mean particle
size have been largely characterized using models, one of which is the eddy diffusion-sedimentation
model from Ackerman & Marley (2001) that relies on a sedimentation efficiency parameter, $f_{\rm
sed}$, to determine the vertical extent of clouds in the atmosphere. However, the physical processes
controlling the vertical structure of clouds in substellar atmospheres are not well understood.
In this work, we derive trends in $f_{\rm sed}$ across a large range of eddy diffusivities ($K_{zz}$),
gravities, material properties, and cloud formation pathways by fitting cloud distributions
calculated by a more detailed cloud microphysics model. We find that $f_{\rm sed}$ is dependent
on $K_{zz}$, but not gravity, when $K_{zz}$ is held constant. $f_{\rm sed}$ is most sensitive to
the nucleation rate of cloud particles, as determined by material properties like surface energy
and molecular weight. High surface energy materials form fewer, larger cloud particles, leading
to large $f_{\rm sed}$ ($>$1), and vice versa for materials with low surface energy. For cloud formation
via heterogeneous nucleation, $f_{\rm sed}$ is sensitive to the condensation nuclei flux and radius,
connecting cloud formation in substellar atmospheres to the objects' formation environments
and other atmospheric aerosols. These insights could lead to improved cloud models that help us
better understand substellar atmospheres. For example, we demonstrate that $f_{\rm sed}$ could
increase with increasing cloud base depth in an atmosphere, shedding light on the nature of the brown
dwarf L/T transition.
