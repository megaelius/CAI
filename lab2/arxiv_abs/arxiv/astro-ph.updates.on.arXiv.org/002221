HIRES, a high resolution spectrometer, is one of the first five instruments foreseen in the ESO roadmap
for the E-ELT. This spectrograph should ideally provide full spectral coverage from the UV limit
to 2.5 microns, with a resolving power from R$\sim$10,000 to R$\sim$100,000. At visual/blue wavelengths,
where the adaptive optics (AO) cannot provide an efficient light-concentration, HIRES will necessarily
be a bulky, seeing-limited instrument. The fundamental question, which we address in this paper,
is whether the same approach should be adopted in the near-infrared range, or HIRES should only be
equipped with compact infrared module(s) with a much smaller aperture, taking advantage of an AO-correction.
The main drawbacks of a seeing-limited instrument at all wavelengths are: \textit{i)} Lower sensitivities
at wavelengths dominated by thermal background (red part of the K-band). \textit{ii)} Much higher
volumes and costs for the IR spectrograph module(s). The main drawbacks of using smaller, AO-fed
IR module(s) are: \textit{i)} Performances rapidly degrading towards shorter wavelengths (especially
J e Y bands). \textit{ii)} Different spatial sampling of extended objects (the optical module see
a much larger area on the sky). In this paper we perform a trade-off analysis and quantify the various
effects that contribute to improve or deteriorate the signal to noise ratio. In particular, we evaluate
the position of the cross-over wavelength at which AO-fed instruments starts to outperform seeing-limited
instruments. This parameter is of paramount importance for the design of the part of HIRES covering
the K-band.
