Hydrocarbons are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, but their formation is still not well understood,
depending on the physical environment they are found in. M8 is host to one of the brightest HII regions
and PDRs in our galaxy. Using the APEX, and the IRAM 30 m telescopes, we performed a line survey toward
Herschel 36 (Her 36), which is the main ionizing stellar system in M8, and an imaging survey within
1.3 $\times$ 1.3 pc around Her 36 of various transitions of C$_{2}$H and c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$. We used
both LTE and non-LTE methods to determine the physical conditions of the emitting gas along with
the column densities and abundances of the observed species, which we compared with (updated) gas
phase photochemical PDR models. In order to examine the role of PAHs in the formation of small hydrocarbons
and to investigate their association with M8, we compared archival GLIMPSE 8 $\mu$m and the SPIRE
250 $\mu$m continuum images with the C$_{2}$H emission maps. We observed a total of three rotational
transitions of C$_{2}$H with their hyperfine structure components and four rotational transitions
of c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ with ortho and para symmetries toward M8. Fragmentation of PAHs seems less
likely to contribute to the formation of small hydrocarbons as the 8 $\mu$m emission does not follow
the distribution of C$_{2}$H emission, which is more associated with the molecular cloud. From
the quantitative analysis, we obtained abundances of $\sim$ 10$^{-8}$ and 10$^{-9}$ for C$_{2}$H
and c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ respectively, and volume densities of the hydrocarbon emitting gas in the
range $n(\rm H_2)$ $\sim$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{4}$--5 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$. The observed column
densities of C$_{2}$H and c-C$_3$H$_{2}$ are reproduced reasonably well by our PDR models. This
supports the idea that in high-UV flux PDRs, gas phase chemistry is sufficient to explain hydrocarbon
abundances.
