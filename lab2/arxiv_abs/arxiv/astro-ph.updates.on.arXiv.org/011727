We report the discovery of TOI 263.01 (TIC 120916706), a transiting substellar object (R = 0.87 RJup)
orbiting a faint M3.5~V dwarf (V=18.97) on a 0.56~d orbit. We set out to determine the nature of the
TESS planet candidate TOI 263.01 using ground-based multicolour transit photometry. The host
star is faint, which makes RV confirmation challenging, but the large transit depth makes the candidate
suitable for validation through multicolour photometry. Our analysis combines three transits
observed simultaneously in r', i', and z_s bands using the MuSCAT2 multicolour imager, three LCOGT-observed
transit light curves in g, r', and i' bands, a TESS light curve from Sector 3, and a low-resolution
spectrum for stellar characterisation observed with the ALFOSC spectrograph. We model the light
curves with PyTransit using a transit model that includes a physics-based light contamination
component that allows us to estimate the contamination from unresolved sources from the multicolour
photometry. This allows us to derive the true planet-star radius ratio marginalised over the contamination
allowed by the photometry, and, combined with the stellar radius, gives us a reliable estimate of
the object's absolute radius. The ground-based photometry excludes contamination from unresolved
sources with a significant colour difference to TOI 263. Further, contamination from sources of
same stellar type as the host is constrained to levels where the true radius ratio posterior has a
median of 0.217. The median radius ratio corresponds to an absolute planet radius of 0.87 RJup, which
confirms the substellar nature of the planet candidate. The object is either a giant planet or a brown
dwarf (BD) located deep inside the so-called "brown dwarf desert". Both possibilities offer a challenge
to current planet/BD formation models and makes 263.01 an object deserving of in-depth follow-up
studies.
