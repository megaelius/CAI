The stellar parameters of RR Lyrae stars vary considerably over a pulsation cycle, and their determination
is crucial for stellar modelling. We present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the pulsating
star RR Lyr, the prototype of its class, over a complete pulsation cycle, based on high-resolution
spectra collected at the 2.7-m telescope of McDonald Observatory. We used simultaneous photometry
to determine the accurate pulsation phase of each spectrum and determined the effective temperature,
the shape of the depth-dependent microturbulent velocity, and the abundance of several elements,
for each phase. The surface gravity was fixed to 2.4. Element abundances resulting from our analysis
are stable over the pulsation cycle. However, a variation in ionisation equilibrium is observed
around minimum radius. We attribute this mostly to a dynamical acceleration contributing to the
surface gravity. Variable turbulent convection on time scales longer than the pulsation cycle
has been proposed as a cause for the Blazhko effect. We test this hypothesis to some extent by using
the derived variable depth-dependent microturbulent velocity profiles to estimate their effect
on the stellar magnitude. These effects turn out to be wavelength-dependent and much smaller than
the observed light variations over the Blazhko cycle: if variations in the turbulent motions are
entirely responsible for the Blazhko effect, they must surpass the scales covered by the microturbulent
velocity. This work demonstrates the possibility of a self-consistent spectroscopic analysis
over an entire pulsation cycle using static atmosphere models, provided one takes into account
certain features of a rapidly pulsating atmosphere.
