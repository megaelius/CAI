We report interferometric imaging of [CII] and OH emission toward the center of the galaxy protocluster
associated with the z=5.3 submillimeter galaxy (SMG) AzTEC-3, using the Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter
Array (ALMA). We detect strong [CII], OH, and rest-frame 157.7 um continuum emission toward the
SMG. The [CII] emission is distributed over a scale of 3.9 kpc, implying a dynamical mass of 9.7 x 10^10
Msun, and a star formation rate (SFR) surface density of Sigma_SFR = 530 Msun/yr/kpc2. This suggests
that AzTEC-3 forms stars at Sigma_SFR approaching the Eddington limit for radiation pressure supported
disks. We find that the OH emission is slightly blueshifted relative to the [CII] line, which may
indicate a molecular outflow associated with the peak phase of the starburst. We also detect and
dynamically resolve [CII] emission over a scale of 7.5 kpc toward a triplet of Lyman-break galaxies
with moderate UV-based SFRs in the protocluster at ~95kpc projected distance from the SMG. These
galaxies are not detected in the continuum, suggesting far-infrared SFRs of <18-54 Msun/yr,
consistent with a UV-based estimate of 22 Msun/yr. The spectral energy distribution of these galaxies
is inconsistent with nearby spiral and starburst galaxies, but resembles those of dwarf galaxies.
This is consistent with expectations for young starbursts without significant older stellar populations.
This suggests that these galaxies are significantly metal-enriched, but not heavily dust-obscured,
"normal" star-forming galaxies at z>5, showing that ALMA can detect the interstellar medium
in "typical" galaxies in the very early universe.
