The composition of the lower mantle $-$ comprising 56% of Earth's volume $-$ remains poorly constrained.
Among the major elements, Mg/Si ratios ranging from $\sim$0.9$-$1.1, such as in rocky solar-system
building blocks (or chondrites), to $\sim$1.2$-$1.3, such as in upper-mantle rocks (or pyrolite),
have been proposed. Geophysical evidence for subducted lithosphere deep in the mantle has been
interpreted in terms of efficient mixing and thus homogeneous Mg/Si across most of the mantle. However,
previous models did not consider the effects of variable Mg/Si on the viscosity and mixing efficiency
of lower-mantle rocks. Here, we use geodynamic models to show that large-scale heterogeneity with
viscosity variations of $\sim$20$\times$, such as due to the dominance of intrinsically strong
(Mg,Fe)SiO$_3-$bridgmanite in low-Mg/Si domains, are sufficient to prevent efficient mantle
mixing, even on large scales. Models predict that intrinsically strong domains stabilize degree-two
mantle-convection patterns, and coherently persist at depths of $\sim$1,000$-$2,200 km up to
the present-day, separated by relatively narrow up-/downwelling conduits of pyrolitic material.
The stable manifestation of such "bridgmanite-enriched ancient mantle structures" (BEAMS) may
reconcile the geographical fixity of deep-rooted mantle-upwelling centers, and fundamental
geophysical changes near 1,000 km depth (e.g. in terms of seismic-tomography patterns, radial
viscosity increase, lateral deflections of rising plumes and sinking slabs). Moreover, these
ancient structures may provide a reservoir to host primordial geochemical signatures.
