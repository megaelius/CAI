For seven decades, the widely held view has been that the formation, the migration and the decay of
short-lived starspots explain the observed constantly changing photometric light curves of chromospherically
active stars. We argue that these observed deceptive light curves are interference of two real constant
period light curves of long-lived starspots. The relative slow motion of these long-lived starspots
with respect to each other causes the observed light curve changes. In the end of our Introduction,
we make six specific questions which undermine our argument, because it contradicts the current
views about stellar surface differential rotation and starspots in general. Our main aim is to answer
these six questions. The surface images and the light curves are used to estimate the surface differential
rotation of chromospherically active stars. These two approaches give contradicting results
even for the same individual star. We aim to solve this problem for good. Our last aim is to model the
puzzling light curves of FK Com. We formulate a period finding method that detects the two real light
curves behind the observed light curve. We solve the real light curves of FK Com. The long-lived structure
predicted by our argument is present on the surface of FK Com. The two periodicities of this structure
are also present in the long-term mean light curves of FK Com. We show that the one-dimensional period
finding methods, like the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, give spurious results because a simple sinusoid
is an incompatible model for the light curves of chromospherically active stars. We begin our Conclusions
by giving compact answers to all the above mentioned six specific questions. Our argument explains
numerous spurious phenomena: ...
