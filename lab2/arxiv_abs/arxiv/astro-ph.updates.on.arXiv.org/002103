We present our determination of the nuclear supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function for spiral
galaxies in the Local Universe, established from a volume-limited sample consisting of a statistically
complete collection of the brightest spiral galaxies in the Southern Hemisphere. Our SMBH mass
function agrees well at the high-mass end with previous values given in the literature. At the low-mass
end, inconsistencies exist in previous works that still need to be resolved, but our work is more
in line with expectations based on modeling of SMBH evolution. This low-mass end of the spectrum
is critical to our understanding of the mass function and evolution of SMBHs since the epoch of maximum
quasar activity. A luminosity distance $\leq$ 25.4 $Mpc$ and an absolute B-band magnitude $\leq$
-19.12 define the sample. These limits define a sample of 140 spiral galaxies, with 128 measurable
pitch angles to establish the pitch angle distribution for this sample. This pitch angle distribution
function may be useful in the study of the morphology of late-type galaxies. We then use an established
relationship between the pitch angle and the mass of the central SMBH in a host galaxy in order to estimate
the mass of the 128 respective SMBHs in this sample. This result effectively gives us the distribution
of mass for SMBHs residing in spiral galaxies over a lookback time $\leq$ 82.1 $h_{67.77}^{-1}$
$Myr$ and contained within a comoving volume of 3.37 $\times$ $10^4$ $h_{67.77}^{-3}$ $Mpc^3$.
We estimate the density of SMBHs residing in spiral galaxies in the Local Universe is $5.54_{-2.73}^{+6.55}$
$\times$ $10^4$ $h_{67.77}^3$ $M_{\odot}$ $Mpc^{-3}$. Thus, our derived cosmological SMBH mass
density for spiral galaxies is $\Omega_{BH} = 4.35_{-2.15}^{+5.14}$ $\times$ $10^{-7}$ $h_{67.77}$.
