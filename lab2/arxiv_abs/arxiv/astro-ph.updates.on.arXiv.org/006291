Supernovae (SNe) are among the most intensely studied objects of modern astrophysics, but due to
their complex physical nature, theoretical models are essential to understand better these exploding
stars, as well as the properties of the variation of the emitted radiation. One possibility for modeling
SNe light curves is the construction of a simplified semi-analytic model, which can be used for getting
order-of magnitude estimates of the SN properties. One of the strongest simplification in most
of these light curve models is the assumption of the constant Thomson-scattering opacity that can
be determined as the average opacity of the ejecta. Here we present a systematic analysis for estimating
the average opacity in different types of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) that can be used as the
constant opacity of the ejecta in simplified semi-analytic models. To use these average opacities
self-consistently during light curve (LC) fit we estimate their values from hydrodynamic simulations.
In this analysis we first generate MESA (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018) stellar models with
different physical parameters (initial mass, metallicity, rotation), which determine the mass-loss
history of the model star. Then we synthesize SN LCs from these models with the SNEC hydrodynamic
code (Morozova et al. 2015) and calculate the Rosseland mean opacity in every mass element. Finally,
we compute the average opacities by integrating these Rosseland mean opacities. As a result we find
that the average opacities from our calculations show adequate agreement with the opacities generally
used in previous studies.
