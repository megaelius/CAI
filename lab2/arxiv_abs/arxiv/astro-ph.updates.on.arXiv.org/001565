We have carried out a search for optically visible post-AGB candidates in the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC). We used mid-IR observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope to select optically visible
candidates with a mid-IR excess. We obtained low-resolution optical spectra for 801 candidates.
After removing contaminants and poor quality spectra, the final sample comprised of 63 post-AGB/RGB
candidates of A - F spectral type. Using the spectra, we estimated the stellar parameters: effective
temperature, surface gravity and [Fe/H]. We also estimated the reddening and deduced the luminosity
using the stellar parameters combined with photometry. Based on a luminosity criterion, 42 of these
63 sources were classified as post-RGB candidates and the remaining as post-AGB candidates. From
the spectral energy distributions we found that 6 of the 63 post-AGB/RGB candidates have a circumstellar
shell suggesting that they are single stars, while 27 of them have a surrounding disc, suggesting
that they are binaries. For the remaining candidates the nature of the circumstellar environment
was unclear. Variability is displayed by 38 post-AGB/RGB candidates with common variability types
being the Population II Cepheids (including RV-Tauri stars) and semi-regular variables. This
study has also revealed a new s-process enriched RV Tauri star (J005107.19-734133.3). From the
numbers of post-AGB/RGB stars in the SMC, we were able to estimate evolutionary rates that are in
good agreement with the stellar evolution models with mass loss in the post-AGB phase and re-accretion
in the post-RGB phase. This study also resulted in a new sample of 40 luminous young stellar objects
(YSOs) of A - F spectral type. Additionally, we also identified a group of 63 objects whose spectra
are dominated by emission lines and in some cases, a UV continuum. These objects are likely to be either
hot post-AGB/RGBs or luminous YSOs.
