Recent studies have made the community aware of scattered light when examining low-surface-brightness
galaxy features such as thick discs. In our past studies of the thick discs of edge-on galaxies in
the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) we modelled the point spread function
as a Gaussian. We re-examine our results using a revised point spread function model that accounts
for extended wings out to more than 2.5arcmin. We study the $3.6\mu{\rm m}$ images of 141 edge-on
galaxies from the S$^4$G. We decompose the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies perpendicular
to their mid-planes assuming that discs are made of two stellar discs in hydrostatic equilibrium.
We decompose the axial surface brightness profiles of galaxies to model the central mass concentration
- described by a S\'ersic function - and the disc - described by a broken exponential disc. Our improved
treatment confirms the ubiquity of thick discs. The main difference between our current fits and
those presented before is that now the scattered light from the thin disc dominates the surface brightness
at levels below $\mu\sim26\,{\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$. This does not affect drastically any of
our previously presented results: 1) Thick discs are nearly ubiquitous. They are not an artefact
caused by scattered light as has been suggested elsewhere. 2) Thick discs have masses comparable
to those of thin discs in low-mass galaxies - circular velocities $v_{\rm c}<120\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$
- whereas they are typically less massive than the thin discs in high-mass galaxies. 3) Thick discs
and central mass concentrations seem to have formed at the same epoch from a common material reservoir.
4) Roughly 60% of the up-bending breaks in face-on galaxies are caused by the superposition of a thin
and a thick disc where the scale-length of the latter is the largest. (Abridged)
