We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the star-forming
environment surrounding V1647 Ori, an outbursting FUor/EXor pre-MS star. Dust continuum and the
(J = 2 - 1) $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O molecular emission lines were observed to characterize
the V1647 Ori circumstellar disc and any large scale molecular features present. We detect continuum
emission from the circumstellar disc and determine a radius r = 40 au, inclination i = 17$^{\circ}$$^{+6}_{-9}$
and total disc mass of M$_{\mathrm{disk}}$ of ~0.1 M$_{\odot}$. We do not identify any disc structures
associated with nearby companions, massive planets or fragmentation. The molecular cloud environment
surrounding V1647 Ori is both structured and complex. We confirm the presence of an excavated cavity
north of V1647 Ori and have identified dense material at the base of the optical reflection nebula
(McNeil's Nebula) that is actively shaping its surrounding environment. Two distinct outflows
have been detected with dynamical ages of ~11,700 and 17,200 years. These outflows are misaligned
suggesting disc precession over ~5500 years as a result of anisotropic accretion events is responsible.
The collimated outflows exhibit velocities of ~2 km s$^{-1}$, similar in velocity to that of other
FUor objects presented in this series but significantly slower than previous observations and
model predictions. The V1647 Ori system is seemingly connected by an "arm" of material to a large
unresolved structure located ~20$"$ to the west. The complex environment surrounding V1647 Ori
suggests it is in the early stages of star formation which may relate to its classification as both
an FUor and EXor type object.
