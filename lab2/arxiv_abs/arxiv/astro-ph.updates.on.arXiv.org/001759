We investigate the star formation activity in the molecular complex associated with the Galactic
HII region Sh2-90, using radio-continuum maps obtained at 1280 MHz and 610 MHz, Herschel Hi-GAL
observations at 70 -- 500 microns, and deep near-infrared observation at JHK bands, along with Spitzer
observations. Sh2-90 presents a bubble morphology in the mid-IR (size ~ 0.9 pc x 1.6 pc). Radio observations
suggest it is an evolved HII region with an electron density ~ 144 cm^-3, emission measure ~ 6.7 x 10^4
cm^-6 pc and a ionized mass ~ 55 Msun. From Hi-GAL observations it is found that the HII region is part
of an elongated extended molecular cloud (size ~ 5.6 pc x 9.7 pc, H_2 column density >= 3 x 10^21
cm^-2 and dust temperature 18 -- 27 K) of total mass >= 1 x 10^4 Msun. We identify the ionizing cluster
of Sh2-90, the main exciting star being an O8--O9 V star. Five cold dust clumps (mass ~ 8 -- 95 Msun),
four mid-IR blobs around B stars, and a compact HII region are found at the edge of the bubble.The velocity
information derived from CO (J=3-2) data cubes suggests that most of them are associated with the
Sh2-90 region. 129 YSOs are identified (Class I, Class II, and near-IR excess sources). The majority
of the YSOs are low mass (<= 3 Msun) sources and they are distributed mostly in the regions of high
column density. Four candidate Class 0/I MYSOs have been found; they will possibly evolve to stars
of mass >= 15 Msun. We suggest multi-generation star formation is present in the complex. From
the evidences of interaction, the time scales involved and the evolutionary status of stellar/protostellar
sources, we argue that the star formation at the immediate border/edges of Sh2-90 might have been
triggered by the expanding HII region. However, several young sources in this complex are probably
formed by some other processes.
