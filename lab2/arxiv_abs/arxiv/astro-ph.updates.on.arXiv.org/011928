We studied asteroid clusters suggesting a possibility of at least two disruption events in their
recent history (< 5 Myr). We searched for new members of known asteroid pairs and clusters and we verified
their membership. We found four asteroid clusters, namely the clusters of (11842) Kap'bos, (14627)
Emilkowalski, (63440) 2001 MD30 and (157123) 2004 NW5 that show at least two secondary separation
events that occurred at significantly different times. We considered a possible formation mechanism
for these clusters: The parent of an asteroid cluster was spun up to its critical rotation frequency,
underwent a rotation fission and was slowed down by escape of the newly formed secondary/ies. Then
the YORP effect spun up the primary again and it reached its critical rotation frequency and underwent
another fission. We created a simple model to test whether this scenario is possible for the four
clusters. We obtained a good agreement between the model and the cluster properties for the clusters
of Kap'bos and (63440). For the cluster of Emilkowalski, the time needed for the primary to reach
its critical frequency after the first fission event was predicted to be too long by a factor of several.
We suspect, considering also its D type taxonomic classification and the existence of a dust band
associated with the cluster, that the asteroid Emilkowalski may actually be a cometary nucleus.
For the cluster of (157123), the final rotational frequency of the primary after the last fission
event predicted by our model is in a good agreement with the observed rotation frequency of (157123).
However, a separation of the older secondary is not possible in our model due to the deficiency of
free energy needed for an escape of the large secondary. This could be due to an error in the H value
of the secondary or the possibility that we did not find the real primary of this cluster.
