We report a luminous Type II supernova, ASASSN-15nx, with a peak luminosity of M_V=-20 mag, that
is between typical core-collapse supernovae and super-luminous supernovae. The post-peak optical
light curves show a long, linear decline with a steep slope of 2.5 mag/100 days (i.e., an exponential
decline in flux), through the end of observations at phase ~260 days. In contrast, the light curves
of hydrogen rich supernovae (SNe II-P/L) always show breaks in their light curves at phase ~100 days,
before settling onto Co56 radioactive decay tails with a decline rate of about 1 mag/100 days. The
spectra of ASASSN-15nx do not exhibit the narrow emission-line features characteristic of Type
IIn SNe, which can have a wide variety of light-curve shapes usually attributed to strong interactions
with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). ASASSN-15nx has a number of spectroscopic peculiarities,
including a relatively weak and triangularly-shaped H-alpha emission profile with no absorption
component. The physical origin of these peculiarities is unclear, but the long and linear post-peak
light curve without a break suggests a single dominant powering mechanism. Decay of a large amount
of Ni56 (M_Ni56 = 1.6 +/- 0.2 M_sun) can power the light curve of ASASSN-15nx, and the steep light-curve
slope requires substantial gamma-ray escape from the ejecta, which is possible given a low-mass
hydrogen envelope for the progenitor. Another possibility is strong CSM interactions powering
the light curve, but the CSM needs to be sculpted to produce the unique light-curve shape and to avoid
producing SN IIn-like narrow emission lines.
