The detection and subsequent characterisation of exoplanets are intimately linked to the characteristics
of their host star. Therefore, it is necessary to study the star in detail in order to understand the
formation history and characteristics of their companion(s). Our aims were to develop a community
tool that allows the automated calculation of stellar parameters for a large number of stars, using
high resolution echelle spectra and minimal photometric magnitudes, and introduce the first results
in this work. We measured the equivalent widths of several iron lines and used them to solve the radiative
transfer equation assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium to obtain the atmospheric parameters
($T_{\text{eff}}$, [Fe/H], logg and $\xi_t$). We used these values to derive the abundance of 11
chemical elements in the stellar photosphere (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu and Zn). Rotation
and macroturbulent velocity were obtained using temperature calibrators and synthetic line profiles
to match the observed spectra of five absorption lines. Finally, by interpolating in a grid of MIST
isochrones, we derived the mass, radius and age using a Bayesian approach. SPECIES obtains bulk
parameters that are in good agreement with measured values from different existing catalogues,
including when different methods are used to derive them. We find excellent agreement with previous
works that used similar methodologies. We find discrepancies in the chemical abundances for some
elements with respect to other works, which could be produced by differences in $T_{\text{eff}}$,
or in the line list or the atomic line data used to derive them. We also obtained analytic relations
to describe the correlations between different parameters, and we implemented new methods to better
handle these correlations, which provides a better description of the uncertainties associated
with the measurements.
