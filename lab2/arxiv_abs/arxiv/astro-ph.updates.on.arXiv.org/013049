Gravitational waves from extreme gravity events such as the coalescence of two black holes in a binary
system fill our observable universe, bearing with them the underlying theory of gravity driving
their process. One compelling alternative theory of gravity -- known as Einstein-dilaton Gauss-Bonnet
gravity motivated by string theory -- describes the presence of an additional dilaton scalar field
coupled directly to higher orders of the curvature, effectively describing a "fifth force" interaction
and the emission of scalar dipole radiation between two scalarized black holes. Most previous studies
focused on considering only the leading correction to the inspiral portion of the binary black hole
waveforms. In our recent paper, we carried out inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests in
this string-inspired gravity by including corrections to both the inspiral and ringdown portions,
as well as those to the mass and spin of remnant black holes, valid to quadratic order in spin. We here
extend the analysis by directly computing bounds on the theoretical coupling constant using the
full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform rather than treating the inspiral and merger-ringdown
portions separately. We also consider the corrections valid to quartic order in spin to justify
the validity of black hole's slow-rotation approximation. We find the quasinormal mode corrections
to the waveform to be particularly important for high-mass events such as GW170729, in which the
dilaton fields' small-coupling approximation fails without such effects included. We also show
that future space-based and multiband gravitational-wave observations have the potential to
go beyond existing bounds on the theory. The bounds presented here are comparable to those found
in via the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests.
