In this study we present the exploration of $\sim$500 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in
and around two large scale structures at $z\sim1$ drawn from the ORELSE survey. A sub-sample of these
galaxies ($\sim$150) were targeted for the initial phases of a near-infrared MOSFIRE spectroscopic
campaign investigating the differences in selections of galaxies which had recently ended a burst
of star formation or had rapidly quenched (i.e., post-starburst or K+A galaxies). Selection with
MOSFIRE resulted in a post-starburst sample more than double that selected by traditional $z\sim1$
(observed-frame optical) methods even after the removal of the relatively large fraction of dusty
starburst galaxies selected through traditional methods. While the traditional post-starburst
fraction increased with increased global density, the MOSFIRE-selected post-starburst fraction
was found to be constant in field, group, and cluster environments. However, this fraction relative
to the number of galaxies with ongoing star formation was observed to elevate in the cluster environment.
Post-starbursts selected with MOSFIRE were predominantly found to exhibit moderately strong
[OII] emission originating from activity other than star formation. Such galaxies, termed K+A
with ImposteR [OII]-derived Star formation (KAIROS) galaxies, were found to be considerably younger
than traditionally-selected post-starbursts and likely undergoing some form of feedback absent
or diminished in traditional post-starbursts. A comparison between the environments of the two
types of post-starbursts suggests a picture in which the evolution of a post-starburst galaxy is
considerably different in cluster environments than in the more rarefied environments of a group
or the field.
