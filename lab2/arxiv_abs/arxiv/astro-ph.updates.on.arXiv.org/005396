An increasing number of hundred-parsec scale, high line-mass filaments have been detected in the
Galaxy. Their evolutionary path, including fragmentation towards star formation, is virtually
unknown. We characterize the fragmentation within the Nessie filament, covering size-scales
between $\sim$ 0.1-100 pc. We also connect the small-scale fragments to the star-forming potential
of the cloud. We combine near-infrared data from the VVV survey with mid-infrared GLIMPSE data to
derive a high-resolution dust extinction map and apply a wavelet decomposition technique on it
to analyze the fragmentation characteristics of the cloud, which are compared with predictions
from fragmentation models. We compare the detected objects to those identified in $\sim$ 10 times
coarser resolution from ATLASGAL data. We present a high-resolution extinction map of Nessie.
We estimate the mean line-mass of Nessie to be $\sim$ 627 M$_\odot$/pc and the distance to be $\sim$
3.5 kpc. We find that Nessie shows fragmentation at multiple size scales. The nearest-neighbour
separations of the fragments at all scales are within a factor of 2 of the Jeans' length at that scale.
However, the relationship between the mean densities of the fragments and their separations is
significantly shallower than expected for Jeans' fragmentation. The relationship is similar
to the one predicted for a filament that exhibits a Larson-like scaling between size-scale and velocity
dispersion; such a scaling may result from turbulent support. Based on the number of YSOs in Nessie,
we estimate that the star formation rate is $\sim$ 371 M$_\odot$/Myr; similar values result if using
the number of dense cores, or the amount of dense gas, as the proxy of star formation. The star formation
efficiency is 0.017. These numbers indicate that Nessie's star-forming content is comparable
to the Solar neighborhood giant molecular clouds like Orion A.
