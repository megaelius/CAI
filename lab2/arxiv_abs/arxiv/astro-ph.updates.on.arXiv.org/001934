We present direct constraints on how the formation of low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations
in galactic fields depends on stellar age. In this pilot study, we utilize Chandra and Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) data to detect and characterize the X-ray point source populations of three nearby
early-type galaxies: NGC 3115, 3379, and 3384. The luminosity-weighted stellar ages of our sample
span 3-10 Gyr. X-ray binary population synthesis models predict that the field LMXBs associated
with younger stellar populations should be more numerous and luminous per unit stellar mass than
older populations due to the evolution of LMXB donor star masses. Crucially, the combination of
deep Chandra and HST observations allows us to test directly this prediction by identifying and
removing counterparts to X-ray point sources that are unrelated to the field LMXB populations,
including LMXBs that are formed dynamically in globular clusters, Galactic stars, and background
AGN/galaxies. We find that the "young" early-type galaxy NGC 3384 (~2-5 Gyr) has an excess of luminous
field LMXBs (L_X > (5-10) x 10^37 erg/s) per unit K-band luminosity (L_K; a proxy for stellar mass)
than the "old" early-type galaxies NGC 3115 and 3379 (~8-10 Gyr), which results in a factor of ~2-3
excess of LX/LK for NGC 3384. This result is consistent with the X-ray binary population synthesis
model predictions; however, our small galaxy sample size does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions
on the evolution field LMXBs in general. We discuss how future surveys of larger galaxy samples that
combine deep Chandra and HST data could provide a powerful new benchmark for calibrating X-ray binary
population synthesis models.
