Context. A large prominence was observed on September 24, 2013, for three hours (12:12 UT -15:12
UT) with the newly launched (June 2013) Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), THEMIS (Tenerife),
the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT), the Solar Dynamic Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(SDO/AIA), and the Multichannel Subtractive Double Pass spectrograph (MSDP) in the Meudon Solar
Tower. Aims. The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of the prominence fine structures in multiple
wavelengths to understand their formation. Methods. The spectrographs IRIS and MSDP provided
line profiles with a high cadence in Mg II and in Halpha lines. Results. The magnetic field is found
to be globally horizontal with a relatively weak field strength (8-15 Gauss). The Ca II movie reveals
turbulent-like motion that is not organized in specific parts of the prominence. On the other hand,
the Mg II line profiles show multiple peaks well separated in wavelength. Each peak corresponds
to a Gaussian profile, and not to a reversed profile as was expected by the present non-LTE radiative
transfer modeling. Conclusions. Turbulent fields on top of the macroscopic horizontal component
of the magnetic field supporting the prominence give rise to the complex dynamics of the plasma.
The plasma with the high velocities (70 km/s to 100 km/s if we take into account the transverse velocities)
may correspond to condensation of plasma along more or less horizontal threads of the arch-shape
structure visible in 304 A. The steady flows (5 km/s) would correspond to a more quiescent plasma
(cool and prominence-corona transition region) of the prominence packed into dips in horizontal
magnetic field lines. The very weak secondary peaks in the Mg II profiles may reflect the turbulent
nature of parts of the prominence.
