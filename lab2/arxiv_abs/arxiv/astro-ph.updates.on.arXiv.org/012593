We present a new stellar dynamical mass measurement ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) of the supermassive black
hole (SMBH) in NGC 1453, a fast-rotating massive elliptical galaxy in the MASSIVE survey. We measure
stellar kinematics in 135 spatial bins in the central 1.5 kpc by 2 kpc region of the galaxy using high
signal-to-noise ($S/N \sim 130$) spectra from the Gemini-North GMOS integral-field spectrograph
(IFS). Combining with wide-field IFS kinematics out to $\sim 3$ effective radii and stellar light
distributions from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 images, we perform Schwarzschild orbit-based
mass modeling in the axisymmetric limit to constrain the mass components in NGC 1453. The best-fit
black hole mass is $M_\mathrm{BH} =(2.9 \pm 0.4) 10^9 M_\odot$; the mass models without a central
black hole are excluded at the $8.7\sigma$ level. The NGC 1453 black hole lies within the intrinsic
scatter of the SMBH and galaxy scaling relations, unlike three other galaxies hosting $\gtrsim
10^{10} M_\odot$ SMBHs in the MASSIVE sample. The high-$S/N$ GMOS spectra enable us to determine
8 moments of the Gauss-Hermite expansion of the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs),
which are used as constraints in the orbit modeling. The stellar orbits in the mass models are further
constrained to produce negligible $h_9$ through $h_{12}$ to minimize spurious behavior in the
LOSVDs. We show that truncating the series at $h_4$, as was often done in prior work, leads to a much
weaker constraint on the inferred $M_\mathrm{BH}$ for NGC 1453. Furthermore, we discuss precautions
and modifications that are needed to achieve axisymmetry in triaxial orbit codes that use the Schwarzschild
method to sample the start space of stellar orbits in triaxial gravitational potentials.
