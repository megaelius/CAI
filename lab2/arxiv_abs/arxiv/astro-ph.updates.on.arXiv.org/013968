The low-redshift velocity field is a unique probe of the growth of cosmic structure and gravity.
We propose to use distances from gravitational wave (GW) detections, in conjunction with the redshifts
of their host galaxies from wide field spectroscopic surveys (e.g. DESI, 4MOST, TAIPAN), to measure
peculiar motions within the local Universe. Such measurement has the potential to constrain the
growth rate $f\sigma_8$ and test gravity through determination of the gravitational growth index
$\gamma$, complementing constraints from other peculiar velocity measurements. We find that
binary neutron star mergers with associated counterpart at $z\lesssim 0.2$ that will be detected
by the Einstein Telescope (ET) will be able to constrain $f\sigma_8$ to $\sim 3\%$ precision after
$10$ years of operations when combined with galaxy overdensities from DESI and TAIPAN. If a larger
network of third generation GW detectors is available (e.g. including the Cosmic Explorer), the
same constraints can be reached over a shorter timescale ($\sim 5$ years for a 3 detectors network).
The same events (plus information from their hosts' redshifts) can constrain $\gamma$ to $\sigma_\gamma\lesssim
0.04$. This constraint is precise enough to discern General Relativity from other popular gravity
models at $3\sigma$. This constraint is improved to $\sigma_\gamma\sim 0.02-0.03$ when combined
with galaxy overdensities. The potential of combining galaxies' peculiar velocities with gravitational
wave detections for cosmology highlights the need for extensive optical to near--infrared follow--up
of nearby gravitational wave events, or exquisite GW localization, in the next decade.
