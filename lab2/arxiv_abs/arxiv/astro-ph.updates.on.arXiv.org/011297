In this work we study non-singular{ bounce cosmology} in the context of the Lagrange multiplier
generalized $F(R)$ gravity theory of gravity. We specify our study by using a specific variant form
of the well known matter{ bounce cosmology}, with scale factor $a(t) = \left(a_0t^2 + 1 \right)^n$,
and we demonstrate that for $n < 1/2$, the primordial curvature perturbations are generated deeply
in the contraction era. Particularly, we show explicitly that the perturbation modes exit the horizon
at a large negative time during the contraction era, which in turn makes the ``low-curvature'' regime,
the era for which the calculations of observational indices related to the primordial power spectrum
can be considered reliable. Using the reconstruction techniques for the Lagrange multiplier $F(R)$
gravity, we construct the form of effective $F(R)$ gravity that can realize such a cosmological
evolution, and we determine the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations. Accordingly,
we calculate the spectral index of the primordial curvature perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar
ratio, and we confront these with the latest observational data. We also address the issue of stability
of the primordial metric perturbations, and to this end, we determine the form of $F(R)$ which realizes
the non-singular cosmology for the whole range of cosmic time $-\infty < t < \infty$, by solving the
Friedmann equations without the ``low-curvature'' approximation. This study is performed numerically
though, due to the high complexity of the resulting differential equations. We also investigate
the energy conditions in the present context. The phenomenology of the non-singular bounce is also
studied in the context of a standard $F(R)$ gravity.
