Tidal debris which are rich in HI gas, formed in interacting and merging systems, are suitable laboratories
to study star formation outside galaxies. Recently, several such systems were observed, which
contained many young star forming regions outside the galaxies. In previous works, we have studied
young star forming regions outside galaxies in different systems with optical and/or gaseous tidal
debris, all of them with available archive GALEX/UV images, in order to understand how often they
occur and in which type of environments. In this paper we searched for star forming regions around
the galaxy NGC2865, a shell galaxy which is circled by a ring of HI, with a total mass of 1.2 x 10$^9$
M$_\odot$. Using the Multi-Slit Imaging Spectroscopy Technique with the Gemini telescope, we
detected all H$\alpha$ emitting sources in the surroundings of the galaxy NGC2865, down to a flux
limit of 10$^{-18}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ \AA$^{-1}$. Together with Near and Far-Ultraviolet
flux information we characterize the star formation rates, masses, ages, and metallicities for
these HII regions. In total, we found 26 emission-line sources in a 60 $\times$ 60 Kpc field centered
over the southeastern tail of the HI gas present around the galaxy NGC2865. Out of the 26 H$\alpha$
emitters, 19 are in the satellite galaxy FGCE 0745 and seven are intergalactic HII regions scattered
over the south tail of the HI gas around NGC2865. We found that the intergalactic HII regions are young
($<$200 Myr) with stellar masses in the range 4 X 10$^3$M$_\odot$ to 17x10$^6$ M$_\odot$. These
are found in a region of low HI gas density, where the probability of forming stars is expected to be
low. For one of the intergalactic HII regions we estimated a solar oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H)
$\sim$ 8.7. We also were able to estimate the metallicity for the satellite galaxy FGCE0745 to be
12 + log(O/H) ~ 8.0.
