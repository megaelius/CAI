Standard analysis pipelines for measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in galaxy
surveys make use of a fiducial cosmological model to guide the data compression required to transform
from observed redshifts and angles to the measured angular and radial BAO peak positions. In order
to remove any dependence on the fiducial cosmology from the results, all models compared to the data
should mimic the compression and its dependence on the fiducial model. In practice, approximations
are made when testing models: (1) There is assumed to be no residual dependence on the fiducial cosmology
after reconstruction, (2) differences in the distance--redshift relationship are assumed to
match a linear scaling, and (3) differences in clustering between true and fiducial models are assumed
to be removed by the free parameters used to null the non-BAO signal. We test these approximations
using the current standard measurement procedure with a set of halo catalogs from the {\sc Aemulus}
suite of $N$-body simulations, which span a range of $w\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological models. We focus
on reconstruction of the primordial BAO and locating the BAO. For the range of $w\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmologies
covered by the {\sc Aemulus} suite, we find no evidence for systematic errors in the measured BAO
shift parameters $\alpha_{\parallel}$ and $\alpha_{\bot}$ to $< 0.1\%$. However, the measured
errors $\sigma_{\alpha_{\parallel}}$ and $\sigma_{\alpha_{\bot}}$ show a notable absolute
increase by up to $+0.001$ and $+0.002$ respectively in the case that the fiducial cosmology does
not match the truth. These effects on the inferred BAO scale will be important given the precision
of measurements expected from future surveys including DESI, Euclid, and WFIRST.
