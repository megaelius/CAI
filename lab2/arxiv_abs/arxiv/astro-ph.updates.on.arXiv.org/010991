Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies ($M_\star\lesssim10^{5-6}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) are relics of an early
phase of galaxy formation. They contain some of the oldest and most metal-poor stars in the Universe
which likely formed before the epoch of hydrogen reionisation. These galaxies are so faint that
they can only be detected as satellites of the Milky Way. They are so small that they are just barely
resolved in current cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. Here we combine very high resolution
cosmological $N$-body simulations with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to study the
demographics and spatial distribution of ultrafaint satellites in Milky Way-mass haloes. We show
that the abundance of these galaxies is correlated with the assembly history of the host halo: at
fixed mass, haloes assembled earlier contain, on average, more ultrafaint satellites today than
haloes assembled later. We identify simulated galactic haloes that experience an ancient Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage-like
and a recent LMC-like accretion event and find that the former occurs in 33% of the sample and the latter
in 9%. Only 3% experience both events and these are especially rich in ultrafaint satellites, most
acquired during the ancient accretion event. Our models predict that the radial distribution of
satellites is more centrally concentrated in early-forming haloes. Accounting for the depletion
of satellites by tidal interactions with the central disc, we find a very good match to the observed
radial distribution of satellites in the Milky Way over the entire radial range. This agreement
is mainly due to the ability of our model to track 'orphan' galaxies after their subhaloes fall below
the resolution limit of the simulation.
