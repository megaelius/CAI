Using archival {\it Chandra} observations with a total exposure of 510 ks, we present an updated
catalog of point sources for Globular Cluster 47 Tucanae. Our study covers an area of $\sim 176.7$
arcmin$^{2}$ (i.e., with $R\lesssim7.5\arcmin$) with 537 X-ray sources. We show that the surface
density distribution of X-ray sources in 47 Tuc is highly peaked in cluster center, rapidly decreases
at intermediate radii, and finally rises again at larger radii, with two distribution dips at $R\sim
100\arcsec$ and $R\sim 170\arcsec$ for the faint ($L_{X}\lesssim 5.0\times 10^{30} {\rm\ erg\,s^{-1}}$)
and bright ($L_{X}\gtrsim 5.0\times 10^{30} {\rm\ erg\,s^{-1}}$) groups of X-ray sources, separately.
These distribution features are similar to those of Blue Straggler Stars (BSS), where the distribution
dip is located at $R\sim 200\arcsec$ \citep{ferraro2004}. By fitting the radial distribution
of each group of sources with a "generalized King model", we estimated an average mass of $1.51\pm0.17\
M_{\odot}$, $1.44\pm0.15\ M_{\odot}$ and $1.16\pm0.06\ M_{\odot}$ for the BSS, bright and faint
X-ray sources, respectively. These results are consistent with the mass segregation effect of
heavy objects in GCs, where more massive objects drop to the cluster center faster and their distribution
dip propagates outward further. Besides, the peculiar distribution profiles of X-ray sources
and BSS are also consistent with the mass segregation model of binaries in GCs, which suggests that
in addition to the dynamical formation channel, primordial binaries are also a significant contributor
to the X-ray source population in GCs.
