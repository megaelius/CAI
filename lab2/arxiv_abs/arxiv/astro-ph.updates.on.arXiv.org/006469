The Athena X-Ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) will provide spatially resolved high-resolution
spectroscopy (2.5 eV FWHM up to 7 keV) over the 0.2 to 12 keV energy band. It will comprise an array of
3840 superconducting Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) operated at 90 mK, with an absolute energy
scale accuracy of 0.4 eV. Slight changes in the TES operating environment can cause significant
variations in its energy response function, which may result in degradation of the detector's energy
resolution, and eventually in systematic errors in the absolute energy scale if not properly corrected.
These changes will be monitored via an onboard Modulated X-ray Source (MXS) and the energy scale
will be corrected accordingly using a multi-parameter interpolation of gain curves obtained during
ground calibration. Assuming realistic MXS configurations and using the instrument end-to-end
simulator SIXTE, we investigate here both statistical and systematic effects on the X-IFU energy
scale, occurring either during ground measurements or in-flight. The corresponding impacts on
the energy resolution and means of accounting for these errors are also addressed. We notably demonstrate
that a multi-parameter gain correction, using both the pulse-height estimate and the baseline
of a pulse, can accurately recover systematic effects on the gain due to realistic changes in TES
operating conditions within 0.4 eV. Optimisations of this technique with respect to the MXS line
configuration and correction time, as well as to the energy scale parametrization are also show
promising results to improve the accuracy of the correction.
