Corundum ($\alpha$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$) and amorphous or metastable Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ are common
components of circumstellar dust observed around O-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and
found in primitive meteorites. We report a detailed isotopic and microstructural investigation
of a unique presolar corundum grain, QUE060, identified in an acid residue of the Queen Alexandra
Range 97008 (LL3.05) meteorite. Based on its O and Mg isotopic compositions, this 1.4 $\mu$m diameter
grain formed in a low- or intermediate-mass AGB star. It has four developed rhombohedral $\{$011$\}$
faces of corundum and a rough, rounded face with cavities. High Mg contents (Mg/Al $>$ 0.004) are
due to the decay of radioactive $^{26}$Al. No spinel (MgAl$_{2}$O$_{4}$) inclusions that might
have exsolved from the corundum are observed, but there are several high-Mg domains with modulated
structures. The subhedral shape of grain QUE060 is the first clear evidence that corundum condenses
and grows to micrometer sizes in the extended atmospheres around AGB stars. The flat faces indicate
that grain QUE060 experienced little modification by gas-grain and grain-grain collisions in
the interstellar medium (ISM) and solar nebula. The Mg distribution in its structure indicates
that grain QUE060 has not experienced any severe heating events since the exhaustion of $^{26}$Al.
However, it underwent at least one very transient heating event to form the high-Mg domains. A possible
mechanism for producing this transient event, as well as the one rough surface and cavity, is a single
grain-grain collision in the ISM. These results indicate that grain QUE060 is the most pristine
circumstellar corundum studied to date.
