We investigate galactic winds driven by supernova (SN) explosions in an isolated dwarf galaxy using
high-resolution (particle mass $m_{\rm gas} = 1{\rm M_\odot}$) hydrodynamical simulations that
include non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry, individual star formation, stellar feedback
and metal enrichment. We find that the system reaches a quasi-steady state on a Gyr-timescale though
with strong temporal fluctuations. Clustered SNe lead to the formation of superbubbles which break
out of the disk and vent out hot gas, launching the winds. At the virial radius, the time-averaged
loading factors of mass, momentum and energy are 3, 1 and 0.05, respectively, and the metal enrichment
factor is 1.5. Winds that escape the halo consist of two populations that differ in their launching
temperatures. Hot gas acquires enough kinetic energy to escape when launched while warm gas does
not. However, warm gas can be further accelerated by the ram pressure of the subsequently launched
hot gas and eventually escape. The strong interactions between different temperature phases highlight
the caveat of extrapolating properties of warm gas to large distances based on its local conditions
(e.g. the Bernoulli parameter). Our convergence study finds that wind properties converge at $m_{\rm
gas}=5 {\rm M_\odot}$ (with an injection mass of $500 {\rm M_\odot}$), and the winds weaken dramatically
once the cooling masses of individual SNe become unresolved. We demonstrate that injecting the
terminal momentum of SNe (neglecting the residual thermal energy), a popular sub-grid model in
the literature, fails to capture pressure-driven winds. The failure owes to its assumption that
most thermal energy is radiated away right after injection even for highly clustered SNe.
