WIMP-nucleon scattering is analyzed at order $1/M$ in Heavy WIMP Effective Theory. The $1/M$ power
corrections, where $M\gg m_W$ is the WIMP mass, distinguish between different underlying UV models
with the same universal limit and their impact on direct detection rates can be enhanced relative
to naive expectations due to generic amplitude-level cancellations at leading order. The necessary
one- and two-loop matching calculations onto the low-energy effective theory for WIMP interactions
with Standard Model quarks and gluons are performed for the case of an electroweak SU(2) triplet
WIMP, considering both the cases of elementary fermions and composite scalars. The low-velocity
WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section is evaluated and compared with current experimental limits
and projected future sensitivities. Our results provide the most robust prediction for electroweak
triplet Majorana fermion dark matter direct detection rates; for this case, a cancellation between
two sources of power corrections yields a small total $1/M$ correction, and a total cross section
close to the universal limit for $M \gtrsim {\rm few} \times 100\,{\rm GeV}$. For the SU(2) composite
scalar, the $1/M$ corrections introduce dependence on underlying strong dynamics. Using a leading
chiral logarithm evaluation, the total $1/M$ correction has a larger magnitude and uncertainty
than in the fermionic case, with a sign that further suppresses the total cross section. These examples
provide definite targets for future direct detection experiments and motivate large scale detectors
capable of probing to the neutrino floor in the TeV mass regime.
