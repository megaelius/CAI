Radio relics trace shock fronts generated in the intracluster medium (ICM) during cluster mergers.
The particle acceleration mechanism at the shock fronts is not yet completely understood. We observed
the Toothbrush relic with the Effelsberg and Sardinia Radio Telescope at 14.25\,GHz and 18.6\,GHz,
respectively. Unlike previously claimed, the integrated spectrum of the relic closely follows
a power law over almost three orders of magnitude in frequency, with a spectral index of $\alpha_{\rm
120\,MHz}^{\rm 18.6\,GHz}=-1.16\pm0.03$. Our finding is consistent with a power-law injection
spectrum, as predicted by diffusive shock acceleration theory. The result suggests that there
is only little magnetic field strength evolution downstream to the shock. From the lack of spectral
steepening, we find that either the Sunyaev-Zeldovich decrement produced by the pressure jump
at the shock along the line of sight is small or the relic is located far behind in the cluster. For the
first time, we detect linearly polarized emission from the "brush" at 18.6\,GHz. Compared to 8.3\,GHz,
the degree of polarization across the brush increases at 18.6\,GHz, suggesting a strong Faraday
depolarization towards lower frequencies. The observed depolarization is consistent with an
intervening magnetized screen that arise from the dense ICM containing turbulent magnetic fields.
The depolarization, corresponding to a standard deviation of the Rotation Measures as high as $\sigma_{\rm
RM}= 212\pm23\rm \,rad\,m^{-2}$, suggesting that the brush is located in or behind the ICM. Our
findings indicate that the Toothbrush can be consistently explained by the standard scenario for
relic formation
