We present the analysis underpinning the measurement of cosmological parameters from 207 spectroscopically
classified type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the first three years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova
Program (DES-SN), spanning a redshift range of 0.017<$z$<0.849. We combine the DES-SN sample with
an external sample of 122 low-redshift ($z$<0.1) SNe Ia, resulting in a "DES-SN3YR" sample of 329
SNe Ia. Our cosmological analyses are blinded: after combining our DES-SN3YR distances with constraints
from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB; Planck Collaboration 2016), our uncertainties in the
measurement of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, are .042 (stat) and .059 (stat+syst)
at 68% confidence. We provide a detailed systematic uncertainty budget, which has nearly equal
contributions from photometric calibration, astrophysical bias corrections, and instrumental
bias corrections. We also include several new sources of systematic uncertainty. While our sample
is <1/3 the size of the Pantheon sample, our constraints on $w$ are only larger by 1.4$\times$, showing
the impact of the DES SN Ia light curve quality. We find that the traditional stretch and color standardization
parameters of the DES SNe Ia are in agreement with earlier SN Ia samples such as Pan-STARRS1 and the
Supernova Legacy Survey. However, we find smaller intrinsic scatter about the Hubble diagram (0.077
mag). Interestingly, we find no evidence for a Hubble residual step ( 0.007 $\pm$ 0.018 mag) as a function
of host galaxy mass for the DES subset, in 2.4$\sigma$ tension with previous measurements. We also
present novel validation methods of our sample using simulated SNe Ia inserted in DECam images and
using large catalog-level simulations to test for biases in our analysis pipelines.
