Massive clumps tend to fragment into clusters of cores and condensations, some of which form high-mass
stars. In this work, we study the structure of massive clumps at different scales, analyze the fragmentation
process, and investigate the possibility that star formation is triggered by nearby HII regions.
We present a high angular resolution study of a sample of 8 massive proto-cluster clumps. Combining
infrared data, we use few-arcsecond resolution radio- and millimeter interferometric data to
study their fragmentation and evolution. Our sample is unique in the sense that all the clumps have
neighboring HII regions. Taking advantage of that, we test triggered star formation using a novel
method where we study the alignment of the centres of mass traced by dust emission at multiple scales.
The eight massive clumps have masses ranging from 228 to 2279 $M_\odot$. The brightest compact structures
within infrared bright clumps are typically associated with embedded compact radio continuum
sources. The smaller scale structures of $R_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 0.02 pc observed within each clump
are mostly gravitationally bound and massive enough to form at least a B3-B0 type star. Many condensations
have masses larger than 8 $M_\odot$ at small scale of $R_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 0.02 pc. Although the clumps
are mostly infrared quiet, the dynamical movements are active at clump scale ($\sim$ 1 pc). We studied
the spatial distribution of the gas conditions detected at different scales. For some sources we
find hints of external triggering, whereas for others we find no significant pattern that indicates
triggering is dynamically unimportant. This probably indicates that the different clumps go through
different evolutionary paths. In this respect, studies with larger samples are highly desired.
