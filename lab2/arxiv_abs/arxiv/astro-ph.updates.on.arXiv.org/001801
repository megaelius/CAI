We analyse the stellar populations in the host galaxies of 53 X-ray selected optically dull active
galactic nuclei (AGN) at 0.34<z<1.07 with ultra-deep (m=26.5) optical medium-band (R~50)
photometry from the Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources (SHARDS). The spectral resolution
of SHARDS allows us to consistently measure the strength of the 4000 AA break, Dn(4000), a reliable
age indicator for stellar populations. We confirm that most X-ray selected moderate-luminosity
AGN (L_X<10^44 erg/s) are hosted by massive galaxies (typically M*>10^10.5 M_sun) and that
the observed fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN increases with the stellar mass. A careful selection
of random control samples of inactive galaxies allows us to remove the stellar mass and redshift
dependencies of the AGN fraction to explore trends with several stellar age indicators. We find
no significant differences in the distribution of the rest-frame U-V colour for AGN hosts and inactive
galaxies, in agreement with previous results. However, we find significantly shallower 4000 AA
breaks in AGN hosts, indicative of younger stellar populations. With the help of a model-independent
determination of the extinction, we obtain extinction-corrected U-V colours and light-weighted
average stellar ages. We find that AGN hosts have younger stellar populations and higher extinction
compared to inactive galaxies with the same stellar mass and at the same redshift. We find a highly
significant excess of AGN hosts with Dn(4000)~1.4 and light weighted average stellar ages of 300-500
Myr, as well as a deficit of AGN in intrinsic red galaxies. We interpret failure in recognising these
trends in previous studies as a consequence of the balancing effect in observed colours of the age-extinction
degeneracy.
