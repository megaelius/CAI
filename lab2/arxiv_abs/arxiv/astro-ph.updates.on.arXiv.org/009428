We study the correlations between (direct) masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and X-ray
hot halo properties, by using a Bayesian analysis of archival datasets and theoretical models.
We analyze fundamental and composite X-ray variables (plasma temperature, luminosity, density,
pressure, and gas/total masses) from galactic to cluster scales. We show novel key scalings, with
the tightest relation being the $M_\bullet - T_{\rm x}$, followed by $M_\bullet - L_{\rm x}$ (scatter
0.2-0.3 dex). The tighter scatter and larger correlation coefficient of the X-ray halo scalings
compared with the optical counterparts (including the $M_\bullet-\sigma_\ast$), together with
the multivariate analysis, suggest that the plasma atmospheres play a more central role than the
stellar component in the growth of SMBHs (and ultramassive BHs), in particular accounting for the
group/cluster core halo. The derived gas mass scalings also correlate better with $M_\bullet$
than dark matter mass. We provide key insights on environmental features, relic galaxies, and coronae.
The comparison of the optical and X-ray fundamental planes shows that, while stars can be described
mainly via the virial theorem, X-ray halos are better described by univariate scalings with deviations
from self-similar collapse due to feedback processes. We test 3 major channels for BH growth: hot
gas accretion, chaotic cold accretion (CCA), and hierarchical BH mergers. Hot/Bondi-like models
are ruled out by the data, showing inconsistent anti-correlation with X-ray halos and too low feeding.
Cosmological simulations show that binary SMBH mergers are a sub-dominant channel over most of
the cosmic time and too rare to induce a central-limit-theorem effect. The scalings are consistent
with the predictions of CCA, the rain of matter condensing out of the turbulent X-ray halos, sustaining
a self-regulated feedback loop throughout cosmic time.
