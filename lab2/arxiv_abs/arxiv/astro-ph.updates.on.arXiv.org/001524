The X-ray spectra of many active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibit a `soft excess' below 1keV, whose
physical origin remains unclear. Diverse models have been suggested to account for it, including
ionised reflection of X-rays from the inner part of the accretion disc, ionised winds/absorbers,
and Comptonisation. The ionised reflection model suggests a natural link between the prominence
of the soft excess and the Compton reflection hump strength above 10keV, but it has not been clear
what hard X-ray signatures, if any, are expected from the other soft X-ray candidate models. Additionally,
it has not been possible up until recently to obtain high-quality simultaneous measurements of
both soft and hard X-ray emission necessary to distinguish these models, but upcoming joint XMM-NuSTAR
programmes provide precisely this opportunity. In this paper, we present an extensive analysis
of simulations of XMM+NuSTAR observations, using two candidate soft excess models as inputs, to
determine whether such campaigns can disambiguate between them by using hard and soft X-ray observations
in tandem. The simulated spectra are fit with the simplest "observer's model" of a black body and
neutral reflection to characterise the strength of the soft and hard excesses. A plot of the strength
of the hard excess against the soft excess strength provides a diagnostic plot which allows the soft
excess production mechanism to be determined in individual sources and samples using current state-of-the-art
and next generation hard X-ray enabled observatories. This approach can be straightforwardly
extended to other candidate models for the soft excess.
