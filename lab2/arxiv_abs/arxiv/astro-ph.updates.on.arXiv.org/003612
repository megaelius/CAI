Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a new population recently discovered in the \wise All-Sky
survey. Multiwavelength follow-up observations suggest that they are luminous, dust-obscured
quasars at high redshift. Here we present the JCMT SCUBA-2 850 $\mu m$ follow-up observations of
10 Hot DOGs. Four out of ten Hot DOGs have been detected at $>3\sigma$ level. Based on the IR SED decomposition
approach, we derive the IR luminosities of AGN torus and cold dust components. Hot DOGs in our sample
are extremely luminous with most of them having $L_{\rm IR}^{\rm tot}>10^{14} L_\odot$. The torus
emissions dominate the total IR energy output. However, the cold dust contribution is still non-negligible,
with the fraction of the cold dust contribution to the total IR luminosity $(\sim 8-24\%)$ being
dependent on the choice of torus model. The derived cold dust temperatures in Hot DOGs are comparable
to those in UV bright quasars with similar IR luminosity, but much higher than those in SMGs. Higher
dust temperatures in Hot DOGs may be due to the more intense radiation field caused by intense starburst
and obscured AGN activities. Fourteen and five submillimeter serendipitous sources in the 10 SCUBA-2
fields around Hot DOGs have been detected at $>3\sigma$ and $>3.5\sigma$ levels, respectively.
By estimating their cumulative number counts, we confirm the previous argument that Hot DOGs lie
in dense environments. Our results support the scenario in which Hot DOGs are luminous, dust-obscured
quasars lying in dense environments, and being in the transition phase between extreme starburst
and UV-bright quasars.
