Three Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are located in and near the Quintuplet Cluster at the Galactic
Center: the Pistol star, G0.120-0.048, and qF362. We present imaging at 19, 25, 31, and 37 {\mu}m
of the region containing these three LBVs, obtained with SOFIA using FORCAST. We argue that the Pistol
and G0.120-0.048 are identical ``twins" that exhibit contrasting nebulae due to the external influence
of their different environments. Our images reveal the asymmetric, compressed shell of hot dust
surrounding the Pistol Star and provide the first detection of the thermal emission from the symmetric,
hot dust envelope surrounding G0.120-0.048. Dust and gas composing the Pistol nebula are primarily
heated and ionized by the nearby Quintuplet Cluster stars. The northern region of the Pistol nebula
is decelerated due to the interaction with the high-velocity (2000 km/s) winds from adjacent Wolf-Rayet
Carbon (WC) stars. With the DustEM code we determine that the Pistol nebula is composed of a distribution
of very small, transiently-heated grains (10-~35 {\AA}) and that it exhibits a gradient of decreasing
grain size from the south to the north due to differential sputtering by the winds from the WC stars.
Dust in the G0.120-0.048 nebula is primarily heated by the central star; however, the nebular gas
is ionized externally by the Arches Cluster. Unlike the Pistol nebula, the G0.120-0.048 nebula
is freely expanding into the surrounding medium. Given independent dust and gas mass estimates
we find that the Pistol and G0.120-0.048 nebulae exhibit similar gas-to-dust mass ratios of ~310
and ~290, respectively. Both nebulae share identical size scales (~ 0.7 pc) which suggests that
they have similar dynamical timescales of ~10^5 yrs, assuming a shell expansion velocity of v_exp
60 km/s.
