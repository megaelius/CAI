A0538-66 is a Be/X-ray binary (Be/XRB) hosting a 69 ms pulsar. It emitted bright X-ray outbursts
with peak luminosity up to $\sim 10^{39}$ erg/s during the first years after its discovery in 1977.
Since then, it was always seen in quiescence or during outbursts with $L_x \lesssim 4 \times 10^{37}$
erg/s. In 2018 we carried out XMM-Newton observations of A0538-66 during three consecutive orbits
when the pulsar was close to periastron. In the first two observations we discovered a remarkable
variability, with flares of typical durations between $\sim$2-50 s and peak luminosities up to
$\sim 4\times 10^{38}$ erg/s (0.2-10 keV). Between the flares the luminosity was $\sim 2\times
10^{35}$ erg/s. The flares were absent in the third observation, during which A0538-66 had a steady
luminosity of $2\times 10^{34}$ erg/s. In all observations, the X-ray spectra consist of a softer
component, well described by an absorbed power law with photon index $\Gamma_1\approx 2-4$ and
$N_H\approx 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, plus a harder power-law component ($\Gamma_2\approx 0-0.5$)
dominating above $\sim$2 keV. The softer component shows larger flux variations than the harder
one, and a moderate hardening correlated with the luminosity. The fast flaring activity seen in
these observations was never observed before in A0538-66, nor, to our best knowledge, in other Be/XRBs.
We explore the possibility that during our observations the source was accreting in a regime of nearly
spherically symmetric inflow. In this case, an atmosphere can form around the neutron star magnetosphere
and the observed variability can be explained by transitions between the accretion and supersonic
propeller regimes.
