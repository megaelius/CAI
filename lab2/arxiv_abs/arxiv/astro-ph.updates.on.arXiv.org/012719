Over the last several years, spectroscopic observations of transiting exoplanets have begun to
uncover information about their atmospheres, including atmospheric composition and indications
of the presence of clouds and hazes. Spectral retrieval is the leading technique for interpretation
of transmission spectra and is employed by several teams using a variety of forward models and parameter
estimation algorithms. However, different model suites have mostly been used in isolation and
so it is unknown whether the results from each are comparable. As we approach the launch of the James
Webb Space Telescope we anticipate advances in wavelength coverage, precision, and resolution
of transit spectroscopic data, so it is important that the tools that will be used to interpret these
information rich spectra are validated. To this end, we present an inter-model comparison of three
retrieval suites: TauREx, NEMESIS and CHIMERA. We demonstrate that the forward model spectra are
in good agreement (residual deviations on the order of 20 - 40 ppm), and discuss the results of cross
retrievals between the three tools. Generally, the constraints from the cross retrievals are consistent
with each other and with input values to within 1 sigma However, for high precision scenarios with
error envelopes of order 30 ppm, subtle differences in the simulated spectra result in discrepancies
between the different retrieval suites, and inaccuracies in retrieved values of several sigma.
This can be considered analogous to substantial systematic/astrophysical noise in a real observation,
or errors/omissions in a forward model such as molecular linelist incompleteness or missing absorbers.
