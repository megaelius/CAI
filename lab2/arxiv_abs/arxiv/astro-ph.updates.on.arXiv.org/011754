Both observations of arc-like structures and luminosity bursts of stars > 1 Myr in age indicate that
at least some stars undergo late infall events. We investigate scenarios of replenishing the mass
reservoir around a star via capturing and infalling events of cloudlets. We carry out altogether
24 three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of cloudlet encounters with a Herbig star of
mass 2.5 solar mass using the moving mesh code AREPO. To account for the two possibilities of a star
or a cloudlet traveling through the interstellar medium (ISM), we put either the star or the cloudlet
at rest with respect to the background gas. For absent cooling in the adiabatic runs, almost none
of the cloudlet gas is captured due to high thermal pressure. However, second-generation disks
easily form when accounting for cooling of the gas. The disk radii range from several 100 au to about
1000 au and associated arc-like structures up to 10 000 au in length form around the star for runs with
and without stellar irradiation. Consistent with angular momentum conservation, the arcs and
disks are larger for larger impact parameters. Accounting for turbulence in the cloudlet only mildly
changes the model outcome. In the case of the star being at rest with the background gas, the disk formation
and mass replenishment process is more pronounced and the associated arc-shaped streamers are
longer-lived. The results of our models confirm that late encounter events lead to the formation
of transitional disks associated with arc-shaped structures such as observed for AB Aurigae or
HD 100546. In addition, we find that second-generation disks and their associated filamentary
arms are longer lived (>100 000 yrs) in infall events, when the star is at rest with the background
gas.
