S stars are transition objects between M-type giants and carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch
(AGB). They are characterized by overabundances of s-process elements. Roughly half of them are
enhanced in technetium (Tc), an s-process element with no stable isotope, while the other half lack
technetium. This dichotomy arises from the fact that Tc-rich S stars are intrinsically producing
s-process elements and have undergone third dredge-up (TDU) events, while Tc-poor S stars owe their
s-process overabundances to a past pollution by a former AGB companion. Our aim is to analyse the
abundances of S stars and gain insights into their evolutionary status and on the nucleosynthesis
of heavy s-process elements taking place in their interior. In particular, the location of extrinsic
and intrinsic S stars in the HR diagram will be compared with the theoretical onset of the TDU on the
thermally-pulsing AGB. A sample of 19 S-type stars was analysed by combining HERMES high-resolution
spectra, accurate Gaia Data Release 2 (GDR2) parallaxes, stellar-evolution models, and newly-designed
MARCS model atmospheres for S-type stars. Combining the derived parameters with GDR2 parallaxes
allows a joint analysis of the location of the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and of their
surface abundances. For all 19 stars, Zr and Nb abundances are derived, complemented by abundances
of other s-process elements for the three Tc-rich S stars. These abundances agree within the uncertainties
with nucleosynthesis predictions for stars of corresponding mass, metallicity and evolutionary
stage. Most extrinsic S stars lie close to the tip of the red giant branch (RGB), and a few are located
along the early AGB. The location of intrinsic S stars in the HR diagram is compatible with them being
thermally-pulsing AGB stars.
