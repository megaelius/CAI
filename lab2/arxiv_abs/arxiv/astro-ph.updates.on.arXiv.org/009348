Accurate estimations of atmospheric properties of exoplanets from transmission spectra require
understanding of degeneracies between model parameters and observations that can resolve them.
We conduct a systematic investigation of such degeneracies using a combination of detailed atmospheric
retrievals and a range of model assumptions, focusing on H$_2$-rich atmospheres. As a case study,
we consider the well-studied hot Jupiter HD 209458 b. We perform extensive retrievals with models
ranging from simple isothermal and isobaric atmospheres to those with full pressure-temperature
profiles, inhomogeneous cloud/haze coverage, multiple molecular species, and data in the optical-infrared
wavelengths. Our study reveals four key insights. First, we find that a combination of models with
minimal assumptions and broadband transmission spectra with current facilities allow precise
estimates of chemical abundances. In particular, high-precision optical and infrared spectra
along with models including variable cloud coverage and prominent opacity sources, Na and K being
important in optical, provide joint constraints on cloud/haze properties and chemical abundances.
Second, we show that the degeneracy between planetary radius and its reference pressure is well
characterised and has little effect on abundance estimates, contrary to previous claims using
semi-analytic models. Third, collision induced absorption due to H$_2$-H$_2$ and H$_2$-He interactions
plays a critical role in correctly estimating atmospheric abundances. Finally, our results highlight
the inadequacy of simplified semi-analytic models with isobaric assumptions for reliable retrievals
of transmission spectra. Transmission spectra obtained with current facilities such as HST and
VLT can provide strong constraints on atmospheric abundances of exoplanets.
