The methylidyne radical CH is commonly used as a proxy for H$_2$ in the cold, neutral phase of the interstellar
medium. The optical spectroscopy of CH is limited by interstellar extinction, whereas far-infrared
observations provide an integral view through the Galaxy. While the HF ground state absorption,
another H$_2$ proxy in diffuse gas, frequently suffers from saturation, CH remains transparent
both in spiral-arm crossings and high-mass star forming regions, turning this light hydride into
a universal surrogate for H$_2$. However, in slow shocks and in regions dissipating turbulence
its abundance is expected to be enhanced by an endothermic production path, and the idea of a "canonical"
CH abundance needs to be addressed. The $N=2\leftarrow 1$ ground state transition of CH at $\lambda
149\,\mu$m has become accessible to high-resolution spectroscopy thanks to GREAT aboard SOFIA.
Its unsaturated absorption and the absence of emission makes it an ideal candidate for the determination
of column densities with a minimum of assumptions. Here we present an analysis of four sightlines
towards distant, far-infrared bright Galactic star forming regions. If combined with the sub-millimeter
line of CH at $\lambda 560\,\mu$m, environments forming massive stars can be analyzed. For this
we present a case study on the "proto-Trapezium" cluster W3 IRS5, and demonstrate that the sub-millimeter/far-infrared
lines of CH reliably trace not only diffuse but also dense, molecular gas. While we confirm the global
correlation between the column densities of HF and those of CH, clear signposts of an over-abundance
of CH are observed towards lower densities. A quiescent ion-neutral chemistry alone cannot account
for this over-abundance. Vortices forming in turbulent, diffuse gas may be the setting for an enhanced
production path.
