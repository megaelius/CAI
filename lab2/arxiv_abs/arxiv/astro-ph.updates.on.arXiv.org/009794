Protostellar flares are rapid magnetic energy release events associated with formation of hot
plasma in protostars. In the previous models of protostellar flares, the interaction between a
protostellar magnetosphere with the surrounding disk plays crucial roles in building-up and releasing
the magnetic energy. However, it remains unclear if protostars indeed have magnetospheres because
vigorous disk accretion and strong disk magnetic fields in the protostellar phase may destroy the
magnetosphere. Considering this possibility, we investigate the energy accumulation and release
processes in the absence of a magnetosphere using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation.
Our simulation reveals that protostellar flares are repeatedly produced even in such a case. Unlike
in the magnetospheric models, the protostar accumulates magnetic energy by acquiring large-scale
magnetic fields from the disk by accretion. Protostellar flares occur when a portion of the large-scale
magnetic fields are removed from the protostar as a result of magnetic reconnection. Protostellar
flares in the simulation are consistent with observations; the released magnetic energy (up to
$\sim 3\times 10^{38}$ erg) is large enough to drive observed flares, and the flares produce hot
ejecta. The expelled magnetic fields enhance accretion, and the energy build-up and release processes
are repeated as a result. The magnetic flux removal via reconnection leads to redistribution of
magnetic fields in the inner disk. We therefore consider that protostellar flares will play an important
role in the evolution of the disk magnetic fields in the vicinity of protostars.
