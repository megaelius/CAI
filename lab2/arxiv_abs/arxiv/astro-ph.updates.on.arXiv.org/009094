Aims: Using a sample of 175 low-inclination galaxies from the S$^{4}$G, we investigate the origins
of up-bending (Type III) breaks in the 3.6 $\mu$m surface brightness profiles of disk galaxies.
Methods: We re-analyze a sample of previously identified Type III disk break-hosting galaxies
using a new, unbiased break-finding algorithm, which uncovered many new, sometimes subtle disk
breaks across the whole sample. We classify each break by its likely origin through close examination
of the galaxy images across wavelengths, and compare samples of galaxies separated by their outermost
identified break types in terms of their stellar populations and local environments. Results:
We find that more than half of the confirmed Type III breaks in our sample can be attributed to morphological
asymmetry in the host galaxies. As these breaks are mostly an artifact of the azimuthal averaging
process, their status as physical "breaks" is questionable. Such galaxies occupy some of the highest
density environments in our sample, implying that much of this asymmetry is the result of tidal disturbance.
Additionally, we find that Type III breaks related to extended spiral arms or star formation often
host down-bending (Type II) breaks at larger radius which were previously unidentified. Such galaxies
reside in the lowest density environments in our sample, in line with previous studies that found
a lack of Type II breaks in clusters. Galaxies occupying the highest density environments most often
show Type III breaks associated with outer spheroidal components. Conclusions: We find that Type
III breaks in the outer disks of galaxies arise most often through environmental influence: either
tidal disturbance (resulting in disk asymmetry) or heating through, e.g., galaxy harrassment
(leading to spheroidal components). Galaxies hosting the latter break types also show... (abstract
