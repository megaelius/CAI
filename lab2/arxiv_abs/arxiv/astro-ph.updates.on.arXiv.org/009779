The obscuring structure surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be explained as a dust and
gas flow cycle that fundamentally connects the AGN with their host galaxies. Although this structure
is usually associated with dusty winds driven by radiation pressure, almost all models for the accretion
onto a supermassive blackhole and outflows invoke magnetic fields, which are poorly understood.
We have detected the polarization of the torus of NGC 1068 using ALMA Cycle 4 high-angular resolution
($0.07$", $4.2$ pc) polarimetric dust continuum observations at Band 7 (348.5 GHz, $860$ $\mu$m).
We measure an asymmetric variation of the degree of polarization across the torus equatorial axis
with a peak polarization of $2.2\pm0.3$% and position angle of $9\pm2^{\circ}$ (E-vector) at $\sim8$
pc east from the core. We compute synthetic polarimetric observations of magnetically aligned
dust grains assuming a toroidal magnetic field and homogeneous grain alignment. We conclude that
the measured 860 $\mu$m continuum polarization arises from magnetically aligned dust grains in
an optically thin region of the torus within the central 16 pc region. We explain the asymmetric degree
of polarization across the equatorial axis of the torus due to 1) an inhomogeneous optical depth,
and 2) a variation of the velocity dispersion, i.e. variation of the magnetic field turbulence at
sub-pc scales, from the eastern to the western part of the torus. These observations constrain the
torus properties beyond spectral energy distribution results. Our data and modeling lend strong
support for the presence of magnetic fields up to a few pc that can contribute to the support of the
torus.
