The next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is a transformational radio observatory being designed
by the U.S. National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). It will provide order of magnitude improvements
in sensitivity, resolution, and uv coverage over the current Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at ~1.2-50
GHz and extend the frequency range up to 70-115 GHz. This document is a white paper written by members
of the Canadian community for the 2020 Long Range Plan panel, which will be making recommendations
on Canada's future directions in astronomy. Since Canadians have been historically major users
of the VLA and have been valued partners with NRAO for ALMA, Canada's participation in ngVLA is welcome.
Canadians have been actually involved in ngVLA discussions for the past five years, and have played
leadership roles in the ngVLA Science and Technical Advisory Councils. Canadian technologies
are also very attractive for the ngVLA, in particular our designs for radio antennas, receivers,
correlates, and data archives, and our industrial capacities to realize them. Indeed, the Canadian
designs for the ngVLA antennas and correlator/beamformer are presently the baseline models for
the project. Given the size of Canada's radio community and earlier use of the VLA (and ALMA), we recommend
Canadian participation in the ngVLA at the 7% level. Such participation would be significant enough
to allow Canadian leadership in gVLA's construction and usage. Canada's participation in ngVLA
should not preclude its participation in SKA; access to both facilities is necessary to meet Canada's
radio astronomy needs. Indeed, ngVLA will fill the gap between those radio frequencies observable
with the SKA and ALMA at high sensitivities and resolutions. Canada's partnership in ngVLA will
give it access to cutting-edge facilities together covering approximately three orders of magnitude
in frequency.
