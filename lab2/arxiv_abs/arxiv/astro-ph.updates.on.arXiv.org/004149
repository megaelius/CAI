In this paper we describe the routine photometric calibration of data taken with the VIRCAM instrument
on the ESO VISTA telescope. The broadband ZYJHKs data are directly calibrated from 2MASS point sources
visible in every VISTA image. We present the empirical transformations between the 2MASS and VISTA,
and WFCAM and VISTA, photometric systems for regions of low reddening. We investigate the long-term
performance of VISTA+VIRCAM. An investigation of the dependence of the photometric calibration
on interstellar reddening leads to these conclusions: (1) For all broadband filters, a linear colour-dependent
correction compensates the gross effects of reddening where $E(B-V)<5.0$. (2) For $Z$ and $Y$,
there is a significantly larger scatter above E(B-V)=5.0, and insufficient measurements to adequately
constrain the relation beyond this value. (3) The $JHK\!s$ filters can be corrected to a few percent
up to E(B-V)=10.0. We analyse spatial systematics over month-long timescales, both inter- and
intra-detector and show that these are present only at very low levels in VISTA. We monitor and remove
residual detector-to-detector offsets. We compare the calibration of the main pipeline products:
pawprints and tiles. We show how variable seeing and transparency affect the final calibration
accuracy of VISTA tiles, and discuss a technique, {\it grouting}, for mitigating these effects.
Comparison between repeated reference fields is used to demonstrate that the VISTA photometry
is precise to better than $\simeq2\%$ for the $Y$$J$$H$$Ks$ bands and $3\%$ for the $Z$ bands. Finally
we present empirically determined offsets to transform VISTA magnitudes into a true Vega system.
