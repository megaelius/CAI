We performed 3-D simulations of proton-rich material entrainment into \czw-rich He-shell flash
convection and the subsequent H-ingestion flash that took place in the post-AGB star Sakurai's
object. Observations of the transient nature and anomalous abundance features are available to
validate our method and assumptions, with the aim to apply them to very low metallicity stars in the
future. We include nuclear energy feedback from H burning and cover the full $4\pi$ geometry of the
shell. Runs on $768^3$ and $1536^3$ grids agree well with each other and have been followed for $1500\mathrm{min}$
and $1200\mathrm{min}$. After a $850\mathrm{min}$ long quiescent entrainment phase the simulations
enter into a global non-spherical oscillation that is launched and sustained by individual ignition
events of H-rich fluid pockets. Fast circumferential flows collide at the antipode and cause the
formation and localized ignition of the next H-overabundant pocket. The cycle repeats for more
than a dozen times while its amplitude decreases. During the global oscillation the entrainment
rate increases temporarily by a factor $\approx 100$. Entrained entropy quenches convective motions
in the upper layer until the burning of entrained H establishes a separate convection zone. The lower-resolution
run hints at the possibility that another global oscillation, perhaps even more violent will follow.
The location of the H-burning convection zone agrees with a 1-D model in which the mixing efficiency
is calibrated to reproduce the light curve. The simulations have been performed at the NSF Blue Waters
supercomputer at NCSA.
