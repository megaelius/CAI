As part of on an extensive data mining effort, we have compiled a database of 162 Galactic rotation
speed measurements at $R_0$ (the solar Galactocentric distance), $\Theta_0$. Published between
1927 and 2017 June, this represents the most comprehensive set of $\Theta_0$ values since the 1985
meta analysis that led to the last revision of the International Astronomical Union's recommended
Galactic rotation constants. Although we do not find any compelling evidence of the presence of
`publication bias' in recent decades, we find clear differences among the $\Theta_0$ values and
the $\Theta_0/R_0$ ratios resulting from the use of different tracer populations. Specifically,
young tracers (including OB and supergiant stars, masers, Cepheid variables, H{\sc ii} regions,
and young open clusters), as well as kinematic measurements of Sgr A* near the Galactic Center, imply
a significantly larger Galactic rotation speed at the solar circle and a higher $\Theta_0/R_0$
ratio (i.e., $\Theta_0 = 247 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\Theta_0/R_0 = 29.81 \pm 0.32$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$;
statistical uncertainties only) than any of the tracers dominating the Galaxy's mass budget (i.e.,
field stars and the H{\sc i}/CO distributions). Using the latter as most representative of the bulk
of the Galaxy's matter distribution, we arrive at an updated set of Galactic rotation constants,
$\Theta_0 = 225 \pm 3 \mbox{ (statistical)} \pm 10 \mbox{ (systematic) km s}^{-1}$, $R_0 = 8.3 \pm
0.2 \mbox{ (statistical)} \pm 0.4 \mbox{ (systematic) kpc}$, and $\Theta_0 / R_0 = 27.12 \pm 0.39
\mbox{ (statistical)} \pm 1.78 \mbox{ (systematic) km s}^{-1} \mbox{ kpc}^{-1}$.
