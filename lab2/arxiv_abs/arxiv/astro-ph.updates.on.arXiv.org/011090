Stellar mass and metallicity are factors that affect the neutron-capture process. Due to this,
the enrichment of the ISM and the abundance of neutron-capture elements vary with time, making them
suitable probes for the Galactic chemical evolution. In this work we make a differential comparison
of neutron-capture element abundances determined in the local disk(s) and the bulge, focusing
on minimising possible systematic effects in the analysis, with the aim of finding possible differences/similarities
between the populations. Abundances are determined for Zr, La, Ce and Eu in 45 bulge giants and 291
local disk giants, from high-resolution optical spectra. The abundances are determined by fitting
synthetic spectra using the SME-code. The disk sample is separated into thin/thick disk components
using a combination of abundances and kinematics. We find flat Zr, La, Ce trends in the bulge, with
a $\sim 0.1$ dex higher La abundance compared with the disk, possibly indicating a higher s-process
contribution for La in the bulge. [Eu/Fe] decreases with increasing [Fe/H], with a plateau at around
[Fe/H] $\sim -0.4$, pointing at similar enrichment as $\alpha$-elements in all populations. We
find that the r-process dominated the neutron-capture production at early times both in the disks
and bulge. [La/Eu] for the bulge are systematically higher than the thick disk, pointing to either
a) a different amount of SN II or b) a different contribution of the s-process in the two populations.
Considering [(La+Ce)/Zr], the bulge and the thick disk follow each other closely, suggesting a
similar ratio of high/low mass asymptotic giant branch-stars.
