The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) small explorer spacecraft provides simultaneous
spectra and images of the photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and corona with 0.33-0.4
arcsec spatial resolution, 2 s temporal resolution and 1 km/s velocity resolution over a field-of-view
of up to 175 arcsec x 175 arcsec. IRIS was launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit on 27 June 2013 using
a Pegasus-XL rocket and consists of a 19-cm UV telescope that feeds a slit-based dual-bandpass imaging
spectrograph. IRIS obtains spectra in passbands from 1332-1358, 1389-1407 and 2783-2834 Angstrom
including bright spectral lines formed in the chromosphere (Mg II h 2803 Angstrom and Mg II k 2796
Angstrom) and transition region (C II 1334/1335 Angstrom and Si IV 1394/1403 Angstrom). Slit-jaw
images in four different passbands (C II 1330, Si IV 1400, Mg II k 2796 and Mg II wing 2830 Angstrom)
can be taken simultaneously with spectral rasters that sample regions up to 130 arcsec x 175 arcsec
at a variety of spatial samplings (from 0.33 arcsec and up). IRIS is sensitive to emission from plasma
at temperatures between 5000 K and 10 MK and will advance our understanding of the flow of mass and
energy through an interface region, formed by the chromosphere and transition region, between
the photosphere and corona. This highly structured and dynamic region not only acts as the conduit
of all mass and energy feeding into the corona and solar wind, it also requires an order of magnitude
more energy to heat than the corona and solar wind combined. The IRIS investigation includes a strong
numerical modeling component based on advanced radiative-MHD codes to facilitate interpretation
of observations of this complex region. Approximately eight Gbytes of data (after compression)
are acquired by IRIS each day and made available for unrestricted use within a few days of the observation.
