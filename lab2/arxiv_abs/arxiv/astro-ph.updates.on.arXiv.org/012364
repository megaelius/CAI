Superhydrogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may be present in H-rich and ultraviolet-poor
benign regions. The addition of excess H atoms to PAHs converts the aromatic bonds into aliphatic
bonds, the strongest of which falls near 3.4 $\mu$m. Therefore, superhydrogenated PAHs are often
hypothesized as a carrier of the 3.4 $\mu$m emission feature which typically accompanies the stronger
3.3 $\mu$m aromatic C--H stretching feature. To assess this hypothesis, we use density function
theory to compute the IR vibrational spectra of superhydrogenated PAHs and their ions of various
sizes (ranging from benzene, naphthalene to perylene and coronene) and of various degrees of hydrogenation
(ranging from minimal hydrogenation to heavy hydrogenation). For each molecule, we derive the
intrinsic oscillator strengths of the 3.3 $\mu$m aromatic C--H stretch ($A_{3.3}$) and the 3.4
$\mu$m aliphatic C--H stretch ($A_{3.4}$). By comparing the computationally-derived mean ratio
of $\langle A_{3.4}/A_{3.3}\rangle\sim1.98$ with the mean ratio of the observed intensities
$\langle I_{3.4}/I_{3.3}\rangle\sim0.12$, we find that the degree of superhydrogenation ---
the fraction of C atoms attached with excess H atoms --- is only $\sim2.2\%$ for neutral PAHs which
predominantly emit the 3.3 and 3.4 $\mu$m features. We also determine for each molecule the intrinsic
band strengths of the 6.2 $\mu$m aromatic C--C stretch ($A_{6.2}$) and the 6.85 $\mu$m aliphatic
C--H deformation ($A_{6.85}$). We derive the degree of superhydrogenation from the mean ratio
of the observed intensities $\langle I_{6.85}/I_{6.2}\rangle\sim0.10$ and $\langle A_{6.85}/A_{6.2}\rangle\sim1.53$
for neutrals and $\langle A_{6.85}/A_{6.2}\rangle\sim1.23$ for cations to be $\lesssim 3.1\%$
for neutrals and $\lesssim 8.6\%$ for cations. We conclude that astrophysical PAHs are primarily
aromatic and are only marginally superhydrogenated.
