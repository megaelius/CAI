Radial magnetic fields that resist orbital shear can explain the outwards angular momentum transport
required for accretion in non-self-gravitating disks. This generates azimuthal magnetic fields
and thus Maxwell stresses that transfer angular momentum radially. Variations on this idea include
both the magnetorotational instability and disk winds. We demonstrate here that these transport
mechanisms generate dynamically significant radial Poynting flux, so they are inherently not
local. Simulations treating this problem typically use either the shear-periodic, shearing sheet
approximation, or disk annuli with artificial radial boundary conditions. Spurious energy flows
through these boundaries generally control the magnitude and even the sign of angular momentum
transport. We then demonstrate that, when dominated by radial stresses, shearing sheets must decrete,
as must self-similar regions of disks with power-law variations in physical quantities. Only the
innermost edge of the disk, where magnetic energy increases with radius, can actually accrete.
The transition radius between accretion and decretion varies vertically, resulting in a decreting
midplane layer and accreting surface layers, similar to a viscous meridional circulation, except
that here the power provided to the midplane outflow is transported radially, rather than vertically.
Energy from the thin region deep in the potential well can drive decretion throughout the remainder
of the disk. The short orbital time at the outer edge of this accretion region determines the viscous
timescale, suggesting that disks are inherently unsteady. Among other implications, the decretion
that we find may transport high-temperature minerals outwards in disks, explaining their presence
in comet dust.
