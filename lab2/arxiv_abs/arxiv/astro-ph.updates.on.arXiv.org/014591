We have conducted a comprehensive survey of emission-line galaxies at $z\lesssim1.6$ based on
narrowband (NB) imaging data taken with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru telescope. In this
paper, we update the catalogs of H$\alpha$, [OIII], and [OII] emission-line galaxies using the
data from the second Public Data Release (PDR2) of Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) of HSC and Cosmic
HydrOgen Reionization Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS) survey along with the spectroscopic redshifts
for 2,019 emission-line galaxies selected with the PDR1 data. The wider effective coverage of NB816
and NB921, 16.3 deg$^2$ and 16.9 deg$^2$ respectively, are available in the Deep and UltraDeep layers
of HSC-SSP from the PDR2. The CHORUS survey provides us with data with additional three NBs (NB527,
NB718, and NB973) in the COSMOS field in the UltraDeep layer (1.37 deg$^2$). The five NB datasets
allow us to investigate the star-forming galaxies presenting emission-lines at 14 specific redshifts
ranging from $z\sim1.6$ down to $z\sim0.05$. We revisit the distribution of large-scale structures
and luminosity functions (LFs) for the emission-line galaxies with the large samples of 75,377
emission-line galaxies selected. The redshift revolution of LFs shows that the star formation
rate densities (SFRDs) decreases monotonically from $z\sim1.6$, which is consistent with the
cosmic SFRD ever known. Our samples of emission-line galaxies covering a sufficiently large survey
volume are useful to investigate the evolution of star-forming galaxies since the cosmic noon in
a wide range of environments including galaxy clusters, filaments, and voids.
