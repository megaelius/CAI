Densely packed coronal loops are rooted in plages in the vicinity of active regions on the Sun. The
photospheric magnetic features underlying these plage areas are patches of mostly unidirectional
magnetic field extending several acrsec on the solar surface. To explore the transient nature of
magnetic field, its mixed-polarity characteristics and the associated energetics in plages using
high spatial resolution observations and numerical simulations. We use photospheric Fe I 6173\,\AA\
spectropolarimetric observations of a decaying active region obtained from the SST. These data
are inverted to retrieve the magnetic field underlying the plage as identified in the EUV emission
maps obtained from the AIA onboard the SDO. To obtain more insights into the evolution of plages on
the Sun, we perform 3D radiation MHD simulations of magnetoconvection using the MURaM code. The
observations show transient magnetic flux emergence and cancellation events within the plage,
on timescales of a few 100 s, and on spatial scales comparable to granules. These transient events
occur at the footpoints of active region plage loops. In one case the coronal response at the footpoints
of those loops is clearly associated with the underlying transient. The simulations also reveal
similar magnetic flux emergence and cancellation events that extend to even smaller spatial and
temporal scales. Individual simulated transient events transfer an energy flux in excess of 1 MW
m$^{-2}$ through the photosphere. We suggest that the magnetic transients could play an important
role in the energetics of active region plage. Both in observations and simulations the opposite
polarity magnetic field brought up by transient flux emergence cancels with the surrounding plage
field. Magnetic reconnection associated with such transient events likely conduits magnetic
energy to power the overlying chromosphere and coronal loops.
