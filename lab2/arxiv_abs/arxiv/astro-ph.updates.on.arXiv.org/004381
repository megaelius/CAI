The currents carried by the jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be probed using maps of the Faraday
rotation measure (RM), since a jet current will be accompanied by a toroidal magnetic (B) field,
which will give rise to a systematic change in the RM across the jet. The aim of this study is to identify
new AGNs displaying statistically significant transverse RM gradients across their parsec-scale
jets, and to look for overall patterns in the implied directions for the toroidal B-field components
and jet currents. We have carried out new analyses of Faraday RM maps derived from previously published
8.1, 8.4, 12.1 and 15.3 GHz data obtained in 2006 on the NRAO VLBA. In a number of important ways, our
procedures were identical to those of the original authors, but several other key aspects of the
new imaging and analysis differ from the original methods. Our new analysis has substantially increased
the number of AGNs known to display transverse RM gradients. The collected data on parsec and kiloparsec
scales indicate that the current typically flows inward along the jet axis and outward in a more extended
region surrounding the jet, typical to the current structure of a coaxial cable, accompanied by
a self-consistent system of nested helical B fields, whose toroidal components give rise to the
observed transverse RM gradients. These new results make it possible for the first time to conclusively
demonstrate the existence of a preferred direction for the toroidal B-field components - and therefore
of the currents - of AGN jets. Discerning the origin of this current-field system is of cardinal importance
for understanding the physical mechanisms leading to the formation of the intrinsic jet B field,
which likely plays an important role in the propagation and collimation of the jets; one possibility
is the action of a "cosmic battery".
