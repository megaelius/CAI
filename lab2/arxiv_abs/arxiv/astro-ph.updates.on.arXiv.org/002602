Ionized carbon is the main gas-phase reservoir of carbon in the neutral diffuse interstellar medium
and its 158 micron fine structure transition [CII] is the most important cooling line of the diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM). We combine [CII] absorption and emission spectroscopy to gain an improved
understanding of physical conditions in the different phases of the ISM. We present high resolution
[CII] spectra obtained with the Herschel/HIFI instrument towards bright dust continuum sources
regions in the Galactic plane, probing simultaneously the diffuse gas along the line of sight and
the background high-mass star forming regions. These data are complemented by observations of
the 492 and 809 GHz fine structure lines of atomic carbon and by medium spectral resolution spectral
maps of the fine structure lines of atomic oxygen at 63 and 145 microns with Herschel/PACS. We show
that the presence of foreground absorption may completely cancel the emission from the background
source in medium spectral resolution data and that high spectral resolution spectra are needed
to interpret the [CII] and [OI] emission and the [CII]/FIR ratio. This phenomenon may explain part
of the [CII]/FIR deficit seen in external luminous infrared galaxies. The C+ and C excitation in
the diffuse gas is consistent with a median pressure of 5900 Kcm-3 for a mean TK ~100 K. The knowledge
of the gas density allows us to determine the filling factor of the absorbing gas along the selected
lines of sight: the median value is 2.4 %, in good agreement with the CNM properties. The mean excitation
temperature is used to derive the average cooling due to C+ in the Galactic plane : 9.5 x 10^{-26} erg/s/H.
Along the observed lines of sight, the gas phase carbon abundance does not exhibit a strong gradient
as a function of Galacto-centric radius and has a weighted average of C/H = 1.5 +/- 0.4 x 10^{-4}.
