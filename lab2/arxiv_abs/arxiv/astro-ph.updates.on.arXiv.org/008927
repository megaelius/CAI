For nearly 40 years, dark matter has been widely assumed to be cold and collisionless. Cold dark matter
models make fundamental predictions for the behavior of dark matter on small (<10 kpc) scales. These
predictions include cuspy density profiles at the centers of dark matter halos and a halo mass function
that increases as dN/dM ~ M^-1.9 down to very small masses. We suggest two observational programs
relying on extremely large telescopes to critically test these predictions, and thus shed new light
on the nature of dark matter. (1) Combining adaptive optics-enabled imaging with deep spectroscopy
to measure the three-dimensional motions of stars within a sample of Local Group dwarf galaxies
that are the cleanest dark matter laboratories known in the nearby universe. From these observations
the inner slope of the dark matter density profile can be determined with an accuracy of 0.20 dex,
enabling a central cusp to be distinguished from a core at 5 sigma significance. (2) Diffraction-limited
AO imaging and integral field spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies and quasars to quantify
the abundance of dark substructures in the halos of the lens galaxies and along the line of sight.
Observations of 50 lensed arcs and 50 multiply-imaged quasars will be sufficient to measure the
halo mass function over the range 10^7 < M < 10^10 Msun at cosmological scales, independent of the
baryonic and stellar composition of those structures. These two observational probes provide
complementary information about the small scale structure, with a joint self-consistent analysis
mitigating limitations of either probe. This program will produce the strongest existing constraints
on the properties of dark matter on small scales, allowing conclusive tests of alternative warm,
fuzzy, and self-interacting dark matter models.
