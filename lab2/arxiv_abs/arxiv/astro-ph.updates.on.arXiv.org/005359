The Planck catalogues of SZ sources, PSZ1 and PSZ2, are the largest catalogues of galaxy clusters
selected through their SZ signature in the full sky. In 2013, we started a long-term observational
program at Canary Island observatories with the aim of validating about 500 unconfirmed SZ sources.
In this work we present results of the initial pre-screening of possible cluster counterparts using
photometric and spectroscopic data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR12. Our main aim is to identify
previously unconfirmed PSZ2 cluster candidates and to contribute in determination of the actual
purity and completeness of Planck SZ source sample. Using the latest version of the PSZ2 catalogue,
we select all sources overlapping with the SDSS DR12 footprint and without redshift information.
We validate these cluster fields following optical criteria (mainly distance with respect to the
Planck pointing, magnitude of the brightest cluster galaxy and cluster richness) and combining
them with the profiles of the Planck Compton y-maps. Together, this procedure allows for a more robust
identification of optical counterparts compared to simply cross-matching with existing SDSS
cluster catalogues that have been constructed from earlier SDSS Data Releases. The sample contains
new redshifts for 37 Planck galaxy clusters that were not included in the original release of PSZ2
Planck catalogue. We detect three cases as possible multiple counterparts. We show that a combination
of all available information (optical images and profile of SZ signal) can provide correct associations
between the observed Planck SZ source and the optically identified cluster. We also show that Planck
SZ detection is very sensitive even to high-z (z>0.5) clusters. In addition, we also present updated
spectroscopic information for 34 Planck PSZ1 sources (33 previously photometrically confirmed
and 1 new identification).
