The details of bulge formation via collapse, mergers, secular processes or their interplay remain
unresolved. To start answering this question and quantify the importance of distinct mechanisms,
we mapped a sample of three galactic bulges using data from the integral field spectrograph WiFeS
on the ANU 2.3m telescope in Siding Spring Observatory. Its high resolution gratings (R=7000) allow
us to present a detailed kinematic and stellar population analysis of their inner structures with
classical and novel techniques. The comparison of those techniques calls for the necessity of inversion
algorithms in order to understand complex substructures and separate populations. We use line-strength
indices to derive SSP-equivalent ages and metallicities. Additionally, we use full spectral fitting
methods, here the code STECKMAP, to extract their star formation histories. The high quality of
our data allows us to study the 2D distribution of different stellar populations (i.e. young, intermediate,
and old). We can identify their dominant populations based on these age-discriminated 2D light
and mass contribution. In all galactic bulges studied, at least 50% of the stellar mass already existed
10 Gyrs ago, more than currently predicted by simulations. A younger component (age between 1 to
8 Gyrs) is also prominent and its present day distribution seems to be affected much more strongly
by morphological structures, especially bars, than the older one. This in-depth analysis of the
three bulges supports the notion of increasing complexity in their evolution, likely to be found
in numerous bulge structures if studied at this level of detail, which cannot be achieved by mergers
alone and require a non-negligible contribution of secular evolution.
