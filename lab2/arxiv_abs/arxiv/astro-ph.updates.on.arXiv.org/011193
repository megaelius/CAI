The proposed next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will enable the imaging of astronomical
sources in unprecedented detail by providing an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity
and angular resolution compared with radio interferometers currently operating at 1.2--116~GHz.
However, the current ngVLA array design results in a highly non-Gaussian dirty beam that may make
it difficult to achieve high-fidelity images with both maximum sensitivity and maximum angular
resolution using traditional CLEAN deconvolution methods. This challenge may be overcome with
regularized maximum-likelihood (RML) methods, a new class of imaging techniques developed for
the Event Horizon Telescope. RML methods take a forward-modeling approach, directly solving for
the images without using either the dirty beam or the dirty map. Consequently, this method has the
potential to improve the fidelity and effective angular resolution of images produced by the ngVLA.
As an illustrative case, we present ngVLA imaging simulations of stellar radio photospheres performed
with both multi-scale (MS-) CLEAN and RML methods implemented in the CASA and SMILI packages, respectively.
We find that both MS-CLEAN and RML methods can provide high-fidelity images recovering most of the
representative structures for different types of stellar photosphere models. However, RML methods
show better performance than MS-CLEAN for various stellar models in terms of goodness-of-fit to
the data, residual errors of the images, and in recovering representative features in the ground
truth images. Our simulations support the feasibility of transformative stellar imaging science
with the ngVLA, and simultaneously demonstrate that RML methods are an attractive choice for ngVLA
imaging.
