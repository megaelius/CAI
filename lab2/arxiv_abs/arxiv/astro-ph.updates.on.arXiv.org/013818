We report the bivariate HI- and H$_2$-stellar mass distributions of local galaxies in addition
of an inventory of galaxy mass functions, MFs, for HI, H$_2$, cold gas, and baryonic mass, separately
into early- and late-type galaxies. The MFs are determined using the HI and H$_2$ conditional distributionsand
the galaxy stellar mass function, GSMF. For the conditional distributions we use the compilation
presented in Calette et al. 2018. For determining the GSMF from $M_{\ast}\sim3\times10^{7}$ to
$3\times10^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$, we combine two spectroscopic samples from the SDSS at the redshift
range $0.0033<z<0.2$. We find that the low-mass end slope of the GSMF, after correcting from surface
brightness incompleteness, is $\alpha\approx-1.4$, consistent with previous determinations.
The obtained HI MFs agree with radio blind surveys. Similarly, the H$_2$ MFs are consistent with
CO follow-up optically-selected samples. We estimate the impact of systematics due to mass-to-light
ratios and find that our MFs are robust against systematic errors. We deconvolve our MFs from random
errors to obtain the intrinsic MFs. Using the MFs, we calculate cosmic density parameters of all
the baryonic components. Baryons locked inside galaxies represent 5.4% of the universal baryon
content, while $\sim96$% of the HI and H$_2$ mass inside galaxies reside in late-type morphologies.
Our results imply cosmic depletion times of H$_2$ and total neutral H in late-type galaxies of $\sim
1.3$ and 7.2 Gyr, respectively, which shows that late type galaxies are on average inefficient in
converting H$_2$ into stars and in transforming HI gas into H$_2$. Our results provide a fully self-consistent
empirical description of galaxy demographics in terms of the bivariate gas--stellar mass distribution
and their projections, the MFs. This description is ideal to compare and/or to constrain galaxy
formation models.
