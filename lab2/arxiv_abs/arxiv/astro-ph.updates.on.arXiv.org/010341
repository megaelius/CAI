Cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) originating from the star-forming discs of spiral galaxies frequently
form extended radio haloes that are best observable in edge-on galaxies. For the present study we
selected two nearby edge-on galaxies from the CHANG-ES survey, NGC 891 and 4565, which differ largely
in halo size and SFR. To figure out how such differences are related to the CRE transport in disc and
halo, we use wide-band 1.5 and 6 GHz VLA observations obtained in the B, C, and D configurations, and
combine the 6 GHz images with Effelsberg observations to correct for missing short spacings. We
study the spatially resolved non-thermal spectral index distribution in terms of CRE spectral
ageing, compute total magnetic field strengths assuming energy equipartition between CRs and
magnetic fields, and also determine synchrotron scale heights. Based on the vertical profiles
of synchrotron intensity and spectral index, we create purely advective and purely diffusive CRE
transport models by numerically solving the 1D diffusion-loss equation. In particular, we investigate
for the first time the radial dependence of synchrotron and magnetic field scale heights, advection
speeds and diffusion coefficients in these two galaxies. We find the spectral index distribution
of NGC 891 to be mostly consistent with continuous CRE injection, while in NGC 4565 the local synchrotron
spectra are more in line with discrete-epoch CRE injection (JP or KP models). This implies that CRE
injection timescales are lower than the synchrotron cooling timescales. The scale height of NGC
891 increases with radius, indicating that synchrotron losses are significant. NGC 891 is probably
dominated by advective CRE transport at a velocity of $\gtrsim150\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. In
contrast, NGC 4565 is diffusion-dominated up to $z=1$ kpc or higher, with a diffusion coefficient
of $\geq2\times10^{28}\,\mathrm{cm^2\,s^{-1}}$.
