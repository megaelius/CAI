Context: Reliable, directly measured optical properties of astrophysical ice analogs in the infrared
(IR) and terahertz (THz) range are missing. These parameters are of great importance to model the
dust continuum radiative transfer in dense and cold regions, here thick ice mantles are present,
and are necessary for the interpretation of future observations planned in the far-IR region. Aims:
Coherent THz radiation allows direct measurement of the complex dielectric function (refractive
index) of astrophysically relevant ice species in the THz range. Methods: The time-domain waveforms
and the frequency-domain spectra of reference samples of CO ice, deposited at a temperature of 28.5
K and annealed to 33 K at different thicknesses, have been recorded. A new algorithm is developed
to reconstruct the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index from the time-domain THz data.
Results: The complex refractive index in the wavelength range of 1 mm - 150 ${\mu}$m (0.3 - 2.0 THz)
has been determined for the studied ice samples, and compared with available data found in the literature.
Conclusions: The developed algorithm of reconstructing the real and imaginary parts of the refractive
index from the time-domain THz data enables, for the first time, the determination of optical properties
of astrophysical ice analogs without using the Kramers-Kronig relations. The obtained data provide
a benchmark to interpret the observational data from current ground based facilities as well as
future space telescope missions, and have been used to estimate the opacities of the dust grains
in presence of CO ice mantles.
