The James Webb Space Telescope will provide deep imaging and spectroscopy for sources at redshifts
above 6, covering the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, 6 < z < 10). The Mid-IR instrument (MIRI) integral
field spectrograph (MRS) will be the only instrument onboard JWST able to observe the brighest optical
emission lines H$\alpha$ and [OIII]0.5007$\mu$m at redshifts above 7 and 9, respectively. This
paper presents a study of the H$\alpha$ fluxes predicted by FIRSTLIGHT cosmological simulations
for galaxies at redshifts of 6.5 to 10.5, and its detectability with MIRI. Deep (40 ks) spectroscopic
integrations with MRS will be able to detect (S/N > 5) EoR sources at redshifts above 7 with intrinsic
star formation rates of more than 2 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and stellar masses above 4-9 $\times$
10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$. In addition, the paper presents realistic MRS simulated observations of the
expected (rest-frame) optical and near-infrared spectra for some spectroscopically confirmed
EoR sources detected by ALMA as [OIII]88$\mu$m emitters. The MRS simulated spectra cover a wide
range of low metallicities from about 0.2 to 0.02Z$_{\odot}$, and different [OIII]88$\mu$m/[OIII]0.5007$\mu$m
line ratios. The simulated 10ks MRS spectra show S/N in the range of 5 to 90 for H$\beta$, [OIII]0.4959,0.5007$\mu$m,
H$\alpha$ and HeI1.083$\mu$m emission lines of MACS1149-JD1 at z = 9.11, independent of metallicity.
In addition, deep 40 ks simulated spectra of the luminous, merger candidate B14-65666 at z=7.15
shows the MRS capabilities of detecting, or putting strong upper limits, on the [NII]0.6584$\mu$m,
[SII]0.6717,0.6731$\mu$m, and [SIII]0.9069,0.9532$\mu$m emission lines. In summary, MRS will
enable the detailed study of key physical properties like internal extinction, instantaneous
star formation, hardness of the ionizing continuum, and metallicity, in bright (intrinsic or lensed)
EoR sources.
