We use the gas-grain chemistry code UCLCHEM to explore the impact of cosmic-ray feedback on the chemistry
of circumstellar disks. We model the attenuation and energy losses of the cosmic-rays as they propagate
outwards from the star and also consider ionization due to stellar radiation and radionuclides.
For accretion rates typical of young stars, $\dot M_* \sim 10^{-9}-10^{-6}$ M_\odot yr$^{-1}$,
we show that cosmic rays accelerated by the stellar accretion shock produce a cosmic-ray ionization
rate at the disk surface $\zeta \gtrsim 10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$, at least an order of magnitude higher
than the ionization rate associated with the Galactic cosmic-ray background. The incident cosmic-ray
flux enhances the disk ionization at intermediate to high surface densities ($\Sigma > 10$ g cm$^{-2}$)
particularly within 10 au of the star. We find the dominant ions are C$^+$, S$^+$ and Mg$^+$ in the
disk surface layers, while the H$_3^+$ ion dominates at surface densities above 1.0 g cm$^{-2}$.
We predict the radii and column densities at which the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is
active in T Tauri disks and show that ionization by cosmic-ray feedback extends the MRI-active region
towards the disk mid-plane. However, the MRI is only active at the mid-plane of a minimum mass solar
nebula disk if cosmic-rays propagate diffusively ($\zeta \propto r^{-1}$) away from the star.
The relationship between accretion, which accelerates cosmic rays, the dense accretion columns,
which attenuate cosmic rays, and the MRI, which facilitates accretion, create a cosmic-ray feedback
loop that mediates accretion and may produce luminosity variability.
