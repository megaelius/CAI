Strongly gravitational lensing systems (SGL) encodes cosmology information in source/lens distance
ratios $\mathcal{D}_{\rm obs}=\mathcal{D}_{\rm ls}/\mathcal{D}_{\rm s}$, which can be used
to precisely constrain cosmological parameters. In this paper, based on future measurements of
390 strong lensing systems from the forthcoming LSST survey, we have successfully reconstructed
the distance ratio $\mathcal{D}_{\rm obs}$ (with the source redshift $z_s\sim 4.0$), directly
from the data without assuming any parametric form. A recently developed method based on model-independent
reconstruction approach, Gaussian Processes (GP) is used in our study of these strong lensing systems.
Our results show that independent measurement of the matter density parameter ($\Omega_m$) could
be expected from such strong lensing statistics. More specifically, one can expect $\Omega_m$
to be estimated at the precision of $\Delta\Omega_m\sim0.015$ in the concordance $\Lambda$CDM
model, which provides comparable constraint on $\Omega_m$ with Planck 2015 results. In the framework
of the modified gravity theory (DGP), 390 detectable galactic lenses from future LSST survey would
lead to stringent fits of $\Delta\Omega_m\sim0.030$. \textbf{Finally, we have discussed three
possible sources of systematic errors (sample incompleteness, the determination of length of
lens redshift bin, and the choice of lens redshift shells), and quantified their effects on the final
cosmological constraints. Our results strongly indicate that future strong lensing surveys,
with the accumulation of a larger and more accurate sample of detectable galactic lenses, will considerably
benefit from the methodology described in this analysis. }
