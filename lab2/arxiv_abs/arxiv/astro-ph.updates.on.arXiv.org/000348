At z<1 a large fraction of the baryons is thought to reside in diffuse gas that has been heated to
temperatures log T=5-6 by gravitational accretion shocks and galactic winds. Absorption by the
770.41A, 780.32A doublet of NeVIII in the spectra of QSOs provides us with a unique tool to study this
elusive gas phase. We construct an analytic model for the NeVIII absorption as a function of the gas
density, temperature, and the abundance of metals, allowing for the latter to be in-homogeneously
distributed within the gaseous structures responsible for the absorption, and assuming that these
structures are self-gravitating, that the gas is exposed to the UV/X-ray background, and that it
is in ionisation equilibrium. Our model agrees with the predictions of a cosmological, hydrodynamic
simulation from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project provided that the degree of metal
mixing, parametrized by the average line-of-sight metal-filling fraction within the gas clouds
harbouring NeVIII, is low: c_L~0.1. Most of the NeVIII at low z is produced by collisional ionisation
in gas with -6<log nH<-4, 5<log T<6, and NeVIII column densities log N<14. Absorbers
as strong as those recently detected by COS, log N>14, are only produced in collisionally ionised
gas with T=5x10^5 K and log n_H>-4. Metal-rich ([Ne/H]=0), strong (log N~14) absorbers have
typical sizes ~10 kpc and likely originate in the immediate vicinity of galaxies. Despite their
relatively high total hydrogen column densities (log N_H~20), these strong NeVIII cloudlets account
for less than 1% of the cosmic baryon budget. The baryon content of the gas harbouring the NeVIII absorbers
is, however, a factor 1/c_L higher. We conclude that strong NeVIII absorbers are robust probes of
shock-heated diffuse gas. Spectra with S/N~100 would allow the detection of the weaker systems
that trace a substantial fraction of the baryons at low redshift.
