Due to its Earth-like minimum mass of 1.27 M$_{\text{E}}$ and its close proximity to our Solar system,
Proxima Centauri b is one of the most interesting exoplanets for habitability studies. Its host
star, Proxima Centauri, is however a strongly flaring star, which is expected to provide a very hostile
environment for potentially habitable planets. We perform a habitability study of Proxima Centauri
b assuming an Earth-like atmosphere under high stellar particle bombardment, with a focus on spectral
transmission features. We employ our extensive model suite calculating energy spectra of stellar
particles, their journey through the planetary magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere, ultimately
providing planetary climate and spectral characteristics, as outlined in Herbst et al. (2019).
Our results suggest that together with the incident stellar energy flux, high particle influxes
can lead to efficient heating of the planet well into temperate climates, by limiting CH$_4$ amounts,
which would otherwise run into anti-greenhouse for such planets around M-stars. We identify some
key spectral features relevant for future spectral observations: First, NO$_2$ becomes the major
absorber in the visible, which greatly impacts the Rayleigh slope. Second, H$_2$O features can
be masked by CH$_4$ (near infra-red) and CO$_2$ (mid to far infra-red), making them non-detectable
in transmission. Third, O$_3$ is destroyed and instead HNO$_3$ features become clearly visible
in the mid to far infra-red. Lastly, assuming a few percent of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere, CO$_2$ absorption
at 5.3 $\mu$m becomes significant (for flare and non-flare cases), strongly overlapping with a
flare related NO feature in Earth's atmosphere.
