We report X-ray spectroscopic results for four giant solar flares occurred on 2005 September 7 (X17.0),
2005 September 8 (X5.4), 2005 September 9 (X6.2), and 2006 December 5 (X9.0), obtained from Earth
albedo data with the X-ray imaging spectrometer (XIS) onboard Suzaku. The good energy resolution
of the XIS (FWHM$\sim$100 eV) enables us to separate a number of line-like features and detect the
underlying continuum emission. These features include Si He$\alpha$, Si Ly$\alpha$, S He$\alpha$,
S Ly$\alpha$, Ar He$\alpha$, and Ca He$\alpha$ originating from solar flares as well as fluorescent
Ar K$\alpha$ and Ar K$\beta$ from the Earth atmosphere. Absolute elemental abundances (X/H) averaged
over the four flares are obtained to be $\sim$2.0 (Ca), $\sim$0.7 (Si), $\sim$0.3 (S), and $\sim$0.9
(Ar) at around flare peaks. This abundance pattern is similar to those of active stars' coronae showing
inverse first ionization potential (i-FIP) effects, i.e., elemental abundances decrease with
decreasing FIP with a turnover at the low end of FIP. The abundances are almost constant during the
flares, with an exception of Si which increases by a factor of $\sim$2 in the decay phase. The evolution
of the Si abundance is consistent with a picture that the i-FIP plasma originates from the chromosphere
evaporation and then mixes with the surrounding low-FIP biased materials. Flare-to-flare abundance
varied by a factor of 2, agreeing with past observations of solar flares. Finally, we emphasize that
Earth albedo data acquired by X-ray astronomy satellites like Suzaku and XRISM can significantly
contribute to studies of solar physics.
