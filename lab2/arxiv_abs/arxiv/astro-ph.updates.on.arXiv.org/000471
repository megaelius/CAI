(Abridged) We analyze chemical and kinematical properties of about 850 FGK solar neighborhood
long-lived dwarfs observed with the HARPS high-resolution spectrograph. The stars in the sample
have logg > 4 dex, 5000 < Teff < 6500 K, and -1.39 < [Fe/H] < 0.55 dex. We apply a purely
chemical analysis approach based on the [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plot to separate Galactic stellar
populations into the thin disk, thick disk and high-alpha metal-rich (hamr). Our analysis shows
a negative gradient of the rotational velocity of the thin disk stars with [Fe/H] (-17 km s^-1 dex^-1),
and a steep positive gradient for both the thick disk and hamr stars with the same magnitude of about
+42 km s^-1 dex^-1. For the thin disk stars we observed no correlation between orbital eccentricities
and metallicity, but observed a steep negative gradient for the thick disk and hamr stars with practically
the same magnitude (about -0.18 dex^-1). Our results suggest that radial migration played an important
role in the formation and evolution of the thin disk. For the thick disk stars it is not possible to
reach a firm conclusion about their origin. Based on the eccentricity distribution of the thick
disk stars only their accretion origin can be ruled out, and the heating and migration scenario could
explain the positive steep gradient of V_phi with [Fe/H]. Analyzing the hamr stellar population
we found that they share properties of both the thin and thick disk population. A comparison of the
properties of the hamr stars with that of the subsample of stars from the N-body/SPH simulation using
radial migration suggest that they may have originated from the inner Galaxy. Further detailed
investigations would help to clarify their exact nature and origin.
