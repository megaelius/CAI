In the recent years, the internal-linear-combination (ILC) method was investigated extensively
in the context of reconstruction of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy
signal using observations obtained by WMAP and Planck satellite missions. In this article, we,
for the first time, apply the ILC method to reconstruct the large scale CMB E mode polarization signal,
which serves as the unique probe of ionization history of the Universe, using simulated observations
of 15 frequency CMB polarization maps of future generation COrE satellite mission. We find that
usual ILC cleaned E mode map is highly erroneous due to presence of a chance-correlation between
CMB and astrophysical foreground components in the empirical covariance matrix which is used to
estimate the weight factors. The cleaned angular power spectrum for E mode is strongly biased and
erroneous due to these chance correlation factors. In order to address the issues of bias and errors
we extend and improve the usual ILC method for CMB E mode reconstruction by incorporating prior information
of theoretical E mode angular power spectrum while estimating the weights for linear combination
of input maps. Using the E mode covariance matrix effectively suppresses the CMB-foreground chance
correlation power leading to an accurate reconstruction of cleaned CMB E mode map and its angular
power spectrum. We provide a comparative study of the performance of the usual ILC and the new method
over large angular scales of the sky and show that the later produces significantly statistically
improved results than the former. The new E mode CMB angular power spectrum contains neither any
significant negative bias at the low multipoles nor any positive foreground bias at relatively
higher mutlipoles. The error estimates of the cleaned spectrum agree very well with the cosmic variance
induced error.
