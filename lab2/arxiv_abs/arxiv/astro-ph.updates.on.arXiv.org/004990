In our previous work, we found that only two scenarios are capable of reproducing the observed integrated
mass-metallicity relations for the gas and stellar components of local star-forming galaxies
simultaneously. One scenario invokes a time-dependent metal outflow loading factor with stronger
outflows at early times. The other scenario uses a time-dependent IMF slope with a steeper IMF at
early times. In this work, we extend our study to investigate the radial profile of gas and stellar
metallicity in local star-forming galaxies using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from
the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. We find that most galaxies show negative gradients in both gas and stellar
metallicity with steeper gradients in stellar metallicity. The stellar metallicity gradient
tend to be mass dependent with steeper gradients in more massive galaxies while no clear mass dependence
is found for the gas metallicity gradient. Then we compare the observations with the predictions
from a chemical evolution model of the radial profiles of gas and stellar metallicities. We confirm
that the two scenarios proposed in our previous work are also required to explain the metallicity
gradients. Based on these two scenarios we successfully reproduce the radial profiles of gas metallicity,
stellar metallicity, stellar mass surface density, and star formation rate (SFR) surface density
simultaneously. The origin of the negative gradient in stellar metallicity turns out to be driven
by either radially dependent metal outflow or IMF slope. In contrast, the radial dependence of the
gas metallicity is less constrained because of the degeneracy in model parameters.
