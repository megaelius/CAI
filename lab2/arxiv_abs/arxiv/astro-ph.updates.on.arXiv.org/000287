Rotational transition lines of CO play a major role in molecular radio astronomy and in particular
in the study of star formation and the Galactic structure. Although a wealth of data exists in the
Galactic plane and some well-known molecular clouds, there is no available CO high sensitivity
all-sky survey to date. Such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \Planck\ HFI data because
the three lowest CO rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 GHz significantly contribute
to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 GHz HFI channels respectively. Two different component separation
methods are used to extract the CO maps from Planck HFI data. The maps obtained are then compared to
one another and to existing external CO surveys. From these quality checks the best CO maps in terms
of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contamination are selected. Three sets of velocity-integrated
CO emission maps are produced: Type 1 maps of the CO (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions
with low foreground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; Type 2 maps for the (1-0)
and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and one Type 3 map, a line composite map
with the best signal-to-noise ratio in order to locate the faintest molecular regions. The maps
are described in detail. They are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of the
Galactic Plane and also of fainter regions out of the Galactic plane. The Planck HFI velocity-integrated
CO maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky
CO view of the Galaxy. These maps are also of great interest to monitor potential CO contamination
on CMB \Planck\ studies.
