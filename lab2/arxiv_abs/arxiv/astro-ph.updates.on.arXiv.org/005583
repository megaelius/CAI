We present and analyse mock stellar catalogues that match the selection criteria and observables
(including uncertainties) of the \emph{Gaia} satellite data release 2 (DR2). The source are six
cosmological high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamic $\Lambda$CDM zoom simulations of the formation
of Milky Way analogues from the \textlcsc{AURIGA} project. Mock data are provided for stars with
$V < 16$ mag, and $V < 20$ mag at $|b|>20$ degrees. The mock catalogues are made using two different
methods: the public \textlcsc{SNAPDRAGONS} code, and a method based on that of Lowing et al. that
preserves the phase-space distribution of the model stars. The catalogues contain 5-parameter
astrometry, radial velocities, multi-band photometry, stellar parameters, dust extinction
values, and uncertainties in all these quantities. In addition, we provide theoretical quantities
from the simulations, including the gravitational potential and information on the origin of each
star. By way of demonstration we apply the mock catalogues to the young stellar disc and the stellar
halo. We show that: i)~the young ($< 300$ Myr) outer stellar disc exhibits a flared distribution
that is reflected in the height and vertical velocity distribution of $\rm A$- and $\rm B$-dwarf
stars up to radii comparable to $\sim 15$ kpc, and ii)~the spin of the stellar halo out to 100~kpc can
be accurately measured with \emph{Gaia} DR2 RR Lyrae stars. We discuss the limitations of both methods
and conclude that these mock stellar catalogues, which we make publicly available, are well suited
for comparisons with observations and should help to: i)~develop and test analysis methods for
the \emph{Gaia} DR2 data, ii)~gauge the limitations and biases of the data and iii)~ interpret the
data in the light of theoretical predictions from realistic {\em ab initio} simulations of galaxy
formation in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model.
