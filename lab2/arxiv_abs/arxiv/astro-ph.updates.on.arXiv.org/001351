Recently it has been suggested that the fragmentation boundary in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic
(SPH) and FARGO simulations of self-gravitating accretion discs with beta-cooling do not converge
as resolution is increased. Furthermore, this recent work suggests that by carefully optimising
the artificial viscosity parameters in these codes it can be shown that fragmentation may occur
for much longer cooling times than earlier work suggests. If correct, this result is intriguing
as it suggests that gas giant planets could form, via direct gravitational collapse, reasonably
close to their parent stars. This result is, however, slightly surprising and there have been a number
of recent studies suggesting that the result is likely an indication of a numerical problem with
the simulations. One suggestion, in particular, is that the SPH results are influenced by the manner
in which the cooling is implemented. We extend this work here and show that if the cooling is implemented
in a manner that removes a known numerical artefact in the shock regions, the fragmentation boundary
converges to a value consistent with earlier work and that fragmentation is unlikely for the long
cooling times suggested by this recent work. We also investigate the optimisation of the artificial
viscosity parameters and show that the values that appear optimal are likely introducing numerical
problems in both the SPH and FARGO simulations. We therefore conclude that earlier predictions
for the cooling times required for fragmentation are likely correct and that, as suggested by this
earlier work, fragmentation cannot occur in the inner parts (r < 50 au) of typical protostellar
discs.
