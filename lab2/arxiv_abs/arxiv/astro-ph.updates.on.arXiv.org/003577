We present a fully analytical, time-dependent leptonic one-zone model that describes a simplified
radiation process of multiple interacting ultrarelativistic electron populations, accounting
for the flaring of GeV blazars. In this model, several mono-energetic, ultrarelativistic electron
populations are successively and instantaneously injected into the emission region, i.e., a magnetized
plasmoid propagating along the blazar jet, and subjected to linear, time-independent synchrotron
radiative losses, which are caused by a constant magnetic field, and nonlinear, time-dependent
synchrotron self-Compton radiative losses in the Thomson limit. Considering a general multiple-injection
scenario is, from a physical point of view, more realistic than the usual single-injection scenario
invoked in common blazar models, as blazar jets may extend over tens of kiloparsecs and, thus, most
likely pick up several particle populations from intermediate clouds. We analytically compute
the electron number density by solving a kinetic equation using Laplace transformations and the
method of matched asymptotic expansions. Moreover, we explicitly calculate the optically thin
synchrotron intensity, the synchrotron self-Compton intensity in the Thomson limit, as well as
the associated total fluences. In order to mimic injections of finite duration times and radiative
transport, we model flares by sequences of these instantaneous injections, suitably distributed
over the entire emission region. Finally, we present a parameter study for the total synchrotron
and synchrotron self-Compton fluence spectral energy distributions for a generic three-injection
scenario, varying the magnetic field strength, the Doppler factor, and the initial electron energy
of the first injection in realistic parameter domains, demonstrating that our model can reproduce
the typical broad-band behavior seen in observational data.
