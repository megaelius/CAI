Impact craters are among the most prominent topographic features on planetary bodies. Crater scaling
laws allow us to extract information about the impact histories on the host bodies. The pi-group
scaling laws have been constructed based on the point-source approximation, dimensional analysis,
and the results from impact experiments. Recent impact experiments, however, demonstrated that
the scaling parameters themselves exhibits complex behavior against the change in the impact conditions
and target properties. Here, we propose an alternative, fully analytical method to predict impact
outcomes based on impact cratering mechanics. This approach is based on the Maxwell Z-model and
the residual velocity. We present analytical expressions of (1) the proportionality relation
between the ejection velocity and the ejection position, (2) the radius of a growing crater as a function
of time, and (3) the transient crater radii. Since we focused on obtaining analytical solutions,
a number of simplifications are employed. Due to the simplifications in the strength model, the
accuracy of the prediction in the strength-dominated regime is relatively low. Our model reproduces
the power-law behavior of the ejecta velocity distribution and the approximate time variation
of a growing crater. The predicted radii under typical impact conditions mostly converge to a region
between the two typical scaling lines by the pi-group scaling laws, strongly supporting the notion
that the new method is one of the simplest ways to predict impact outcomes, as it provides analytical
solutions. Our model could serve as a quick-look tool to estimate the impact outcome under a given
set of conditions, and it might provide new insights into the nature of impact excavation processes.
