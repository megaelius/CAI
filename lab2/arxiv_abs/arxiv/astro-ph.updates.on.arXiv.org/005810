Yes, for a wide range of cosmological models ($\Lambda$CDM, non-interacting $w_z$CDM or models
with possible interactions between dark energy and dark matter, in either phantom or non-phantom
regimes). In the recent past there have been many attempts to solve the tension between direct measurements
of $H_0$ and $\sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{0 {\rm m}}}$ from the respective low redshift observables
and indirect measurements of these quantities from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this
work we reconstruct a model independent approach that boils down to different classes of cosmological
models under suitable parameters choices. We test this parameterization against the latest Planck
CMB data combined with recent BAO, SNeIa datasets and the R16 direct $H_0$ measurements, and compare
among different cosmological models. Our analysis reveals that a strong positive correlation
between $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ is more or less generic, irrespective of the choice of cosmological
models. We also find that present data slightly prefers a phantom equation of state for dark energy
and a slight negative value for effective equation of state for dark matter (which is a direct signature
of interacting models) with a relatively high value for $H_0$ consistent with R16 and simultaneously,
a consistent value for $\Omega_{0 {\rm m}}$. Thus, even though the tensions cannot be fully resolved,
interacting models with phantom equation of state get a slight edge over the others for currently
available data. We also see that allowing interaction between dark energy and dark matter may resolve
the tension between the high redshift CMB data and individual low redshift datasets, but the low
redshift datasets have inconsistencies between them (e.g. between BAO and $H_0$, SNeIa and BAO,
and cluster counts and $H_0$) that are practically independent of the cosmological model.
