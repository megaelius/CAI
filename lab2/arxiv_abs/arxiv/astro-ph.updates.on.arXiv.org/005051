We present the source separation framework SCARLET for multi-band images, which is based on a generalization
of the Non-negative Matrix Factorization to alternative and several simultaneous constraints.
Our approach describes the observed scene as a mixture of components with compact spatial support
and uniform spectra over their support. We present the algorithm to perform the matrix factorization
and introduce constraints that are useful for optical images of stars and distinct stellar populations
in galaxies, in particular symmetry and monotonicity with respect to the source peak position.
We also derive the treatment of correlated noise and convolutions with band-dependent point spread
functions, rendering our approach applicable to coadded images observed under variable seeing
conditions. SCARLET thus yields a PSF-matched photometry measurement with an optimally chosen
weight function given by the mean morphology in all available bands. We demonstrate the performance
of SCARLET for deblending crowded extragalactic scenes and on an AGN jet -- host galaxy separation
problem in deep 5-band imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Stategic Survey Program. Using simulations
with prominent crowding we show that SCARLET yields superior results to the HSC-SDSS deblender
for the recovery of total fluxes, colors, and morphologies. Due to its non-parametric nature, a
conceptual limitation of SCARLET is its sensitivity to undetected sources or multiple stellar
population within detected sources, but an iterative strategy that adds components at the location
of significant residuals appears promising. The code is implemented in Python with C++ extensions
and is available at https://github.com/fred3m/scarlet
