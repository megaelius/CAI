We use a suite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations from the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies
and their Environments (EAGLE) project to investigate the formation of hot hydrostatic haloes
and their dependence on feedback mechanisms. We find that the appearance of a strong bimodality
in the probability density function (PDF) of the ratio of the radiative cooling and dynamical times
for halo gas provides a clear signature of the formation of a hot corona. Haloes of total mass $10^{11.5}-10^{12}{\rm{M}}_{\odot}$
develop a hot corona independent of redshift, at least in the interval $z=0-4$ where the simulation
has sufficiently good statistics. We analyse the build up of the hot gas mass in the halo, $M_{\rm{hot}}$,
as a function of halo mass and redshift and find that while more energetic galactic winds powered
by SNe increases $M_{\rm{hot}}$, AGN feedback reduces it by ejecting gas from the halo. We also study
the thermal properties of gas accreting onto haloes and measure the fraction of shock-heated gas
as a function of redshift and halo mass. We develop analytic and semianalytic approaches to estimate
a `critical halo mass', $M_{\rm{crit}}$, for hot halo formation. We find that the mass for which
the heating rate produced by accretion shocks equals the radiative cooling rate, reproduces the
mass above which haloes develop a significant hot atmosphere. This yields a mass estimate of $M_{\rm{crit}}
\approx 10^{11.7}{\rm{M}}_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, which agrees with the simulation results. The value
of $M_{\rm{crit}}$ depends more strongly on the cooling rate than on any of the feedback parameters.
