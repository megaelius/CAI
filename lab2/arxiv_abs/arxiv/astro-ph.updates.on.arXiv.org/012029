We extend the range of validity of the ARTIS 3D radiative transfer code up to hundreds of days after
explosion, when Type Ia supernovae are in their nebular phase. To achieve this, we add a non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) population and ionisation solver, a new multi-frequency
radiation field model, and a new atomic dataset with forbidden transitions. We treat collisions
with non-thermal leptons resulting from nuclear decays to account for their contribution to excitation,
ionisation, and heating. We validate our method with a variety of tests including comparing our
synthetic nebular spectra for the well-known one-dimensional W7 model with the results of other
studies. As an illustrative application of the code, we present synthetic nebular spectra for the
detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf in which the possible effects of gravitational settling
of Ne22 prior to explosion have been explored. Specifically, we compare synthetic nebular spectra
for a 1.06 M$_\odot$ white dwarf model obtained when 5.5 Gyr of very-efficient settling is assumed
to a similar model without settling. We find that this degree of Ne22 settling has only a modest effect
on the resulting nebular spectra due to increased Ni58 abundance. Due to the high ionisation in sub-Chandrasekhar
models, the nebular [Ni II] emission remains negligible, while the [Ni III] line strengths are increased
and the overall ionisation balance is slightly lowered in the model with Ne22 settling. In common
with previous studies of sub-Chandrasekhar models at nebular epochs, these models overproduce
[Fe III] emission relative to [Fe II] in comparison to observations of normal Type Ia supernovae.
