In this paper, the temporal evolution of 3-dimensional relativistic current sheets in Poynting-dominated
plasma is studied for the first time. Over the past few decades, a lot of efforts have been conducted
on studying the evolution of current sheets in 2-dimensional space, and concluded that sufficiently
long current sheets always evolves into the so-called "plasmoid-chain", which provides fast reconnection
rate independent of its resistivity. However, it is suspected that plasmoid-chain can exist only
in the case of 2-dimensional approximation, and would show transition to turbulence in 3-dimensional
space. We performed 3-dimensional numerical simulation of relativistic current sheet using resistive
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic approximation. The results showed that the 3-dimensional
current sheet evolve not into plasmoid-chain but turbulence. The resulting reconnection rate
is $0.004$ which is much smaller than that of plasmoid-chain. The energy conversion from magnetic
field to kinetic energy of turbulence is just 0.01\% which is much smaller than typical non-relativistic
cases. Using the energy principle, we also showed that the plasmoid is always unstable for a displacement
in opposite direction to its acceleration, probably interchange-type instability, and this always
results in seeds of turbulence behind the plasmoids. Finally, the temperature distribution along
the sheet is discussed, and it is found that the sheet is less active than plasmoid-chain. Our finding
can be applied for many high energy astrophysical phenomena, and can provide a basic model of the
general current sheet in Poynting-dominated plasma.
