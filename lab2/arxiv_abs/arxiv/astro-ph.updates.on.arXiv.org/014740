Turbulence is a predominant process for energizing electrons and ions in collisionless astrophysical
plasmas, and thus is responsible for shaping their radiative signatures (luminosity, spectra,
and variability). To better understand the kinetic properties of a collisionless radiative plasma
subject to externally driven turbulence, we investigate particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic
plasma turbulence with external inverse Compton cooling acting on the electrons. We find that ions
continuously heat up while electrons gradually cool down (due to the net effect of radiation), and
hence the ion-to-electron temperature ratio $T_i/T_e$ grows in time. We show that $T_i/T_e$ is
limited only by the size and duration of the simulations (reaching $T_i/T_e \sim 10^3$), indicating
that there are no efficient collisionless mechanisms of electron-ion thermal coupling. This result
has implications for models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows, such as observed in the
Galactic Center and in M87, for which so-called two-temperature plasmas with $T_i/T_e \gg 1$ have
been invoked to explain their low luminosity. Additionally, we find that electrons acquire a quasi-thermal
distribution (dictated by the competition of turbulent particle energization and radiative cooling),
while ions undergo efficient nonthermal acceleration (acquiring a harder distribution than in
equivalent non-radiative simulations). There is a modest nonthermal population of high-energy
electrons that are beamed intermittently in space, time, and direction; these beamed electrons
may explain rapid flares in certain high-energy astrophysical systems (e.g., in the Galactic Center).
These numerical results demonstrate that extreme two-temperature plasmas can be produced and
maintained by relativistic radiative turbulence.
