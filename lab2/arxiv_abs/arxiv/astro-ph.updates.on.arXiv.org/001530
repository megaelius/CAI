We present the first report on an innovative new project named "RAD@home", a citizen-science research
collaboratory built on free web-services like Facebook, Google, Skype, NASA Skyview, NED, TGSS
etc.. This is the first of its kind in India, a zero-funded, zero-infrastructure, human-resource
network to educate and directly involve in research, hundreds of science-educated under-graduate
population of India, irrespective of their official employment and home-location with in the country.
Professional international collaborators are involved in follow up observation and publication
of the objects discovered by the collaboratory. We present here ten newly found candidate episodic
radio galaxies, already proposed to GMRT, and ten more interesting cases which includes, bent-lobe
radio galaxies located in new Mpc-scale filaments, likely tracing cosmological cluster accretion
from the cosmic web. Two new Speca-like rare spiral-host large radio galaxies have also been been
reported here. Early analyses from our follow up observations with the Subaru and XMM-Newton telescopes
have revealed that Speca is likely a new entry to the cluster and is a fast rotating, extremely massive,
star forming disk galaxy. Speca-like massive galaxies with giant radio lobes, are possibly remnants
of luminous quasars in the early Universe or of first supermassive black holes with in first masssve
galaxies. As discoveries of Speca-like galaxies did not require new data from big telescopes, but
free archival radio-optical data, these early results demonstrate the discovery potential of
RAD@home and how it can help resource-rich professionals, as well as demonstrate a model of academic-growth
for resource-poor people in the underdeveloped regions via Internet.
