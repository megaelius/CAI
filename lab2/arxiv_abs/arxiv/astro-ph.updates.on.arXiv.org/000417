We have analyzed the radial scales, central surface brightnesses, and colors of 404 disks of various
types of galaxies. The central surface brightness mu0 and linear disk scale length h vary smoothly
along the Hubble sequence of galaxies within a rather narrow interval. The disks of relatively early
type galaxies display higher central surface brightnesses in K, higher central surface densities,
smaller sizes (relative to the diameter of the galaxy), redder integrated and central colors. The
color gradient normalized to the radius of the galaxy and the blue central surface brightness mu0_{0,i}(B)
of the disk, are both independent of the galaxy type. The radial disk scales in different photometric
bands differ less in early-type than in late-type galaxies. The ratio of linear disk scales measured
in different photometric bands increases with the isophote ellipticity e of the disk (the inclination
of the galaxy); however, the range of the ratio values for each e value exceeds the range of variations
of scale lengths ratio over e. The disks in S0 galaxies have more homogeneous parameters than those
in spiral galaxies. However, no sharp boundary in the properties of disks in lenticular, spiral,
and irregular galaxies has been found; all parameters vary smoothly along the Hubble sequence.
A correlation between the central disk surface brightness and the total luminosity of the galaxy
is observed. We also consider the influence of dust on the photometric parameters of the disks. We
show that the dust concentrated in dust lines towards the spiral arms and bars does not influence
to the scale lengths ratio.
