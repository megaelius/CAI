The study of comets affords a unique window into the birth, infancy, and subsequent history of the
solar system. There is strong evidence that comets incorporated pristine interstellar material
as well as processed nebular matter, providing insights into the composition and prevailing conditions
over wide swaths of the solar nebula at the time of planet formation. Dynamically new Oort cloud comets
harbor primitive ices that have been stored thousands of astronomical units from the Sun and have
suffered minimal thermal or radiative processing since their emplacement ~4.5 Gyr ago. Periodic,
more dynamically evolved comets such as the Halley-type and Jupiter-family comets reveal the effects
of lives spent over a range of heliocentric distances, including perihelion passages into the very
inner solar system. Systematically characterizing the information imprinted in the native ice
compositions of these objects is critical to understanding the formation and evolution of the solar
system, the presence of organic matter and water on the terrestrial planets, the chemistry present
in protoplanetary disks around other stars, and the nature of interstellar interlopers such as
2I/Borisov. Although comet rendezvous and sample return missions can provide remarkable insights
into the properties of a few short-period comets, the on-sky capacity necessary to perform population-level
comet studies while simultaneously remaining sensitive to the paradigm-challenging science
that individual comets can reveal can only be provided by remote sensing observations. Here we report
the state-of-the-art in ground- and space-based remote sensing of cometary volatiles, review
the remarkable progress of the previous decade, articulate the pressing questions that ground-
and space-based work will address over the next ten years, and advocate for the technology and resources
necessary to realize these aspirations.
