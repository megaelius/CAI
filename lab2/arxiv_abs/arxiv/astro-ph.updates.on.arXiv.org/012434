Type-2 Low-ionization Narrow Emission-line Regions (LINERs) have been optically classified
with the Palomar data as not presenting a broad component in the Balmer emission lines associated
to the Broad Line Region (BLR) of the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We unveil the presence of different
kinematic components of emission lines in the nuclear region of a sample of local (z$\leq$0.022)
type-2 LINERs. We focus on the analysis of their true nature by means of the detection (or not) of a
broad component originated in the BLR. Additionally, we search for the possible presence of non-rotational
motions such as outflows. We have applied a decomposition of the nuclear emission lines using a spectroscopic
analysis of the optical spectra of 9 type-2 LINERs of intermediate-resolution data retrieved from
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive. The study is completed with archival spectra from the
Double Spectrograph from the Palomar Observatory. The emission line fitting reveals the presence
of a broad component associated to the BLR in 6 out of the 9 galaxies for the space-based data, and for
2 out of the 8 from the ground-based spectra. The velocity dispersion of two galaxies (NGC 4486 and
NGC 4594) measured in HST/STIS data suggest the presence of outflows. The results indicate that
the spatial resolution plays a major role in the detection of the BLR, as it appears diluted in the
ground-based data (even after removing stellar contribution). This is also true for the emission
line diagnostics, as the contaminant light contributes to lower emission line ratios towards the
star-forming area of standard BPTs. We propose to reclassify NGC4594 as a type-1 LINER, since a BLR
component is seen in both space- and ground-based spectra. We find ambiguous results for the BLR
component of NGC 4486. The modest outflow detection in our sample may indicate that they are not as
frequent as for type-1 LINERs.
