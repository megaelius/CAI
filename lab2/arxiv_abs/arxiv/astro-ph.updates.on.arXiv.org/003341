The Hitomi X-ray observatory made the first direct measurements of galaxy cluster gas motions with
its observations of Perseus, which implied that the core of Perseus is fairly "quiescent", with
velocities less than $\sim$200 km s$^{-1}$, despite the fact that the core of Perseus possesses
an active galactic nucleus and sloshing cold fronts. Building on previous work, we use synthetic
Hitomi/SXS observations of the hot plasma of a simulated cluster with different viscosities and
sloshing gas motions to analyze its velocity structure in a similar fashion. We find that sloshing
motions can produce line shifts and widths similar to those measured by Hitomi in Perseus, and that
these measurements are very similar regardless of the value of the ICM viscosity, because viscous
effects only reveal themselves clearly on length scales smaller than the equivalent length scale
of the SXS $\sim$1' PSF. The PSF biases the line shift of regions near the core as much as $\sim 40-50$
km s$^{-1}$, indicating that it is crucial to model this effect carefully, as noted by previous investigations.
We also infer that if sloshing motions dominate the observed line-of-sight velocity gradient,
Perseus must be observed from a line of sight which is at least somewhat inclined from the plane of
these motions, but not so inclined that the spiral pattern is no longer visible. Finally, we find
that assuming isotropy of motions can underestimate the total velocity and kinetic energy of the
core in our simulation by as much as $\sim$60%, depending on the line of sight. Despite this, the total
kinetic energy in our simulated cluster core is still less than 10% of the thermal energy in the core,
in agreement with the Hitomi observations.
