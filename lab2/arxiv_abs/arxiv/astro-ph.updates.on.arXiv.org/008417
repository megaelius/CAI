Precise Doppler radial-velocity (RV) instruments will continue to play an essential role in advancing
our holistic understanding of exoplanetary systems. The combination of orbital parameters from
transit surveys and follow-up RV measurements is vital to unlock mass and density estimates of detected
planets, giving us insight into their environment and structure. However, the exoplanet field
is reaching a critical juncture: the measurement sensitivity of existing radial-velocity instruments
is becoming the limiting factor in further increasing our knowledge. Without improvement in delivered
RV measurement precision, we will not be able to provide dynamical mass and density estimates for
some of the most exciting (and consequently most challenging) discoveries expected from new transit
missions including the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) (Plavchan et al. 2015, Ricker
et al. 2014). RV precisions at the 10cm/s level are required to fully confirm earth-like analogues,
provide masses and measure density to the 1-5% level from these missions. Additionally, this RV
capability will also be important to allow for efficient target selection for facilities such as
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). A promising way forward to achieve this goal is to use single-mode
fibers to inject light to a spectrograph. This mitigates many of the error terms facing current generation
seeing-limited RV instruments while simultaneously offering the capability of high resolution
spectroscopy within a small optical footprint (Schwab et al. 2012, Crepp 2014, Jovanovic et al.
2016a). We discuss the benefits of this technique, its challenges, and the current status of development.
