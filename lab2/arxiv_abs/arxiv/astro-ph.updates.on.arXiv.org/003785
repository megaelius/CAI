We present high-resolution (sub-parsec) observations of a giant molecular cloud in the nearest
star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. ALMA Band 6 observations trace the bulk of the
molecular gas in $^{12}$CO(2-1) and high column density regions in $^{13}$CO(2-1). Our target
is a quiescent cloud (PGCC G282.98-32.40, which we refer to as the "Planck cold cloud" or PCC) in the
southern outskirts of the galaxy where star-formation activity is very low and largely confined
to one location. We decompose the cloud into structures using a dendrogram and apply an identical
analysis to matched-resolution cubes of the 30 Doradus molecular cloud (located near intense star
formation) for comparison. Structures in the PCC exhibit roughly 10 times lower surface density
and 5 times lower velocity dispersion than comparably sized structures in 30 Dor, underscoring
the non-universality of molecular cloud properties. In both clouds, structures with relatively
higher surface density lie closer to simple virial equilibrium, whereas lower surface density
structures tend to exhibit super-virial line widths. In the PCC, relatively high line widths are
found in the vicinity of an infrared source whose properties are consistent with a luminous young
stellar object. More generally, we find that the smallest resolved structures ("leaves") of the
dendrogram span close to the full range of line widths observed across all scales. As a result, while
the bulk of the kinetic energy is found on the largest scales, the small-scale energetics tend to
be dominated by only a few structures, leading to substantial scatter in observed size-linewidth
relationships.
