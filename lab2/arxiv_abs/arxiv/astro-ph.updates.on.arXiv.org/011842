We present Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy of three recently discovered ultra-faint Milky Way satellites,
Grus II, Tucana IV, and Tucana V. We measure systemic velocities of V_hel = -110.0 +/- 0.5 km/s, V_hel
= 15.9 +/- 1.8 km/s, and V_hel = -36.2 +/-2.5 km/s for the three objects, respectively. Their large
relative velocity differences demonstrate that the satellites are unrelated despite their close
physical proximity to one another. We determine a velocity dispersion for Tuc IV of sigma = 4.3^+1.7_-1.0
km/s, but are unable to resolve the velocity dispersions of the other two systems. For Gru II we place
an upper limit at 90% confidence on the dispersion of sigma < 1.9 km/s, and for Tuc V we are not able to
obtain any useful limits. All three satellites have low mean metallicities below [Fe/H] = -2.1,
but none has a detectable metallicity spread. Using the spectroscopic member stars, we determine
proper motions for each satellite from the second Gaia data release. We compute their orbits around
the Milky Way, finding that all three objects are currently approaching pericenter. Gru II is on
a tightly bound orbit with a pericentric distance of 25 kpc and apocenter of 66 kpc. Tuc V has a significantly
more extended orbit, with an apocenter likely beyond 100 kpc, and could be approaching the Milky
Way for the first time. The current orbital parameters of Tuc IV are similar to those of Gru II, with
a pericenter of 25 kpc. However, a backward integration of the orbit of Tuc IV demonstrates that it
collided with the Large Magellanic Cloud with an impact parameter of 4 kpc ~120 Myr ago, deflecting
its trajectory and possibly altering its internal kinematics. Based on their sizes, masses, and
metallicities, we classify Gru II and Tuc IV as likely dwarf galaxies, but we are not able to draw strong
conclusions about the nature of Tuc V. [slightly abridged]
