The existence of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies highlights the need to push our theoretical understanding
of galaxies to extremely low mass. Using two identical high-resolution, fully cosmological simulations
of dwarf galaxies, we examine the formation of dwarf galaxies and their UFD satellites. The simulations
have identical initial conditions, and vary only in how they form stars: one uses a temperature-density
threshold for star formation in combination with metal line cooling, while the other replaces the
temperature-density threshold with an H$_{2}$-based sub-grid star formation model. We find that
the total number of dwarf galaxies that forms is different by a factor of 2 between the two runs, leading
to a factor of 5 difference in the number of luminous UFD companions around more massive, isolated
dwarfs. The metal-cooling (MC) run yields 10 resolved luminous satellites, a 47% chance of finding
a satellite around a M$_{halo}$ $\sim 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ host. The H$_2$ run, on the other hand,
produces only two luminous satellites, and predicts only a 16% chance of finding a luminous satellite.
Metallicity is the primary physical parameter that creates this difference. As metallicity decreases,
the formation of H$_2$ is slowed and relegated to higher-density material. Thus, our H$_2$ run is
unable to form many stars before reionization. These results emphasize that predictions for UFD
properties made using hydrodynamic simulations, in particular regarding the frequency of satellites
around dwarf galaxies, the slope of the stellar mass function at low masses, as well as the properties
of ultra-faint galaxies, are extremely sensitive to the subgrid physics of star formation. However,
upcoming discoveries of ultra-faint dwarfs both in the Milky Way halo and in the Local Group will
provide invaluable constraining power on the physics of the first star formation.
