Recent ground- and space-based observations reveal the presence of small-scale motions between
convection cells in the solar photosphere. In these regions small-scale magnetic flux tubes are
generated due to the interaction of granulation motion and background magnetic field. This paper
studies the effects of these motions, on magnetohydrodynamic wave excitation from broadband photospheric
drivers. Numerical experiments of linear magnetohydrodynamic wave propagation in a magnetic
flux tube embedded in a realistic gravitationally stratified solar atmosphere between the photosphere
and the low choromosphere (above $\beta=1$) are performed. Horizontal and vertical velocity field
drivers mimic granular buffeting and solar global oscillations. A uniform torsional driver as
well as Archimedean and logarithmic spiral drivers mimic observed torsional motions in the solar
photosphere. The results are analysed using a novel method for extracting the parallel, perpendicular
and azimuthal components of the perturbations, which caters for both the linear and non-linear
case. Employing this method yields the identification of the wave modes excited in the numerical
simulations and enables a comparison of excited modes via velocity perturbations and wave energy
flux. The wave energy flux distribution is calculated, to enable the quantification of the relative
strengths of excited modes. The torsional drivers excite primarily Alfv\'en modes (~60% of the
total flux) with small contributions from the slow kink mode, and, for the logarithmic spiral driver,
small amounts of slow sausage mode. The horizontal and vertical drivers excite primarily slow kink
or fast sausage modes respectively, with small variations dependent upon flux surface radius.
