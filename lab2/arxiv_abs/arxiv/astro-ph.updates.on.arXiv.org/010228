In this work we investigate cosmologies with a time-varying gravitational constant, $G(t)$, as
an alternative to having a cosmological constant. Since, it is known in the literature that, in general
relativity, having a variable gravitational constant breaks the conservation of energy unless
further dynamical components are added, we consider a Newtonian approach, in which the energy conservation
is ensured. We investigate whether these cosmologies are able to reproduce the cosmological acceleration
without a cosmological constant, nor any other sort of dark energy fluid. After constructing the
Friedmann-Lema\^itre equation for a late-stage, matter dominated universe by starting with Newton's
second law, where $G$ is taken as a function of time, we create specific models to test against cosmological
observations. In this Friedmann-Lema\^itre equation we obtain a second gravitational constant,
$G^*$, related to the original $G$ in the acceleration equation. For the tests we focus on the acceleration
period and use low-redshift probes: type Ia supernovae (SNIa), baryon acoustic oscillations,
and cosmic chronometers, taking also into account a possible change in the supernova intrinsic
luminosity with redshift. As a result, we obtain several models without a cosmological constant
with similar or even slightly better $\chi^2$ values than the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
When SNIa luminosity dependence on redshift is added, a model with a $G$ exponentially decreasing
to zero today can explain the observations. In the cases where SNIa are assumed to be standard candles,
the observations favour a negative $G$ at large scales to produce cosmic acceleration. We conclude
that these models offer a viable interpretation of the late-time universe observations.
