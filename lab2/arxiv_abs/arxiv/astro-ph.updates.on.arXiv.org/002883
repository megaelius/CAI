After a decade and a half of research motivated by the accelerating universe, theory and experiment
have a reached a certain level of maturity. The development of theoretical models beyond \Lambda,
or smooth dark energy, often called modified gravity, has led to broader insights into a path forward,
and a host of observational and experimental tests have been developed. In this review we present
the current state of the field and describe a framework for anticipating developments in the next
decade. We identify the guiding principles for rigorous and consistent modifications of the standard
model, and discuss the prospects for empirical tests. We begin by reviewing attempts to consistently
modify Einstein gravity in the infrared, focusing on the notion that additional degrees of freedom
introduced by the modification must screen themselves from local tests of gravity. We categorize
screening mechanisms into three broad classes: mechanisms which become active in regions of high
Newtonian potential, those in which first derivatives become important, and those for which second
derivatives are important. Examples of the first class, such as f(R) gravity, employ the familiar
chameleon or symmetron mechanisms, whereas examples of the last class are galileon and massive
gravity theories, employing the Vainshtein mechanism. In each case, we describe the theories as
effective theories. We describe experimental tests, summarizing laboratory and solar system
tests and describing in some detail astrophysical and cosmological tests. We discuss future tests
which will be sensitive to different signatures of new physics in the gravitational sector. Parts
that are more relevant to theorists vs. observers/experimentalists are clearly indicated, in
the hope that this will serve as a useful reference for both audiences, as well as helping those interested
in bridging the gap between them.
