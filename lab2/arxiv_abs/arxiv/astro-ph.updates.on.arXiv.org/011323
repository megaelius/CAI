There has been a long-standing factor-of-two tension between the observed star formation rate
density and the observed stellar mass buildup after $z\sim2$. Recently we have proposed that sophisticated
panchromatic SED models can resolve this tension, as these methods infer systematically higher
masses and lower star formation rates than standard approaches. In a series of papers we now extend
this analysis and present a complete, self-consistent census of galaxy formation over $0.2 < z <
3$ inferred with the \texttt{Prospector} galaxy SED-fitting code. In this work, Paper I, we present
the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function using new mass measurements of $\sim$10$^5$ galaxies
in the 3D-HST and COSMOS-2015 surveys. We employ a new methodology to infer the mass function from
the observed stellar masses: instead of fitting independent mass functions in a series of fixed
redshift intervals, we construct a continuity model that directly fits for the redshift evolution
of the mass function. This approach ensures a smooth picture of galaxy assembly and makes use of the
full, non-Gaussian uncertainty contours in our stellar mass inferences. The resulting mass function
has higher number densities at a fixed stellar mass than almost any other measurement in the literature,
largely owing to the older stellar ages inferred by \texttt{Prospector}. The stellar mass density
is $\sim$50% higher than previous measurements, with the offset peaking at $z\sim1$. The next two
papers in this series will present the new measurements of star-forming main sequence and the cosmic
star formation rate density, respectively.
