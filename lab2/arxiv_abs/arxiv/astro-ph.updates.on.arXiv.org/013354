Exploration of the outer solar system is central to NASA's objectives. It addresses NASA's top-level
strategic goal as expressed in its 2018 Strategic Plan: to understand the Sun, Earth, solar system,
and universe, including searching for habitable conditions and life elsewhere, understanding
the origin and evolution of the solar system, and answering fundamental scientific questions about
the processes that continue to shape our solar system. The 2018 NASA authorization act from Congress
includes "the search for life's origins, evolution, distribution, and future in the universe."
The outer solar system provides critical evidence for how our solar system formed and evolved, and
is home to extensive liquid water oceans, potentially hosting life. This White Paper summarizes
the Outer Planets Assessment Group's (OPAG's) priorities as they relate to the Decadal Survey.
Our top-priority large, directed missions are, in order, completing development and launching
the Europa Clipper mission, a new start for a directed Ice Giant System mission with atmospheric
probe(s), and a directed Ocean Worlds mission. Continuation of Discovery and New Frontiers programs
is essential to OPAG. In addition, we note the necessity of maintaining a healthy Research and Analysis
(R&A) program, which includes a strong laboratory measurements component, and a robust Earth-based
observing program. International partnerships are key components of these activities. OPAG's
top two technology priorities are rapid development of a next-generation radioisotope power source
for an Ice Giant System mission and development of key life detection technologies in support of
an Ocean Worlds mission.
