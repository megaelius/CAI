Knowledge about how the nonlinear behaviour of the intrinsic signal from lensed background sources
changes on its path to the observer provides much information, particularly about the matter distribution
in lensing galaxies and the physical properties of the current universe, in general. Here, we analyse
the multifractal (nonlinear) behaviour of the optical observations of A and B images of Q0957+561
in the $r$ and $g$ bands. AIMS: To verify the presence, or absence, of extrinsic variations in the
observed signals of the quasar images and investigate whether extrinsic variations affect the
multifractal behaviour of their intrinsic signals. METHOD: We apply a wavelet transform modulus
maxima-based multifractality analysis approach. RESULTS: We detect strong multifractal (nonlinear)
signatures in the light curves of the quasar images. The degree of multifractality for both images
in the $r$ band changes over time in a non-monotonic way, possibly indicating the presence of extrinsic
variabilities in the light curves of the images, i.e., the signals of the quasar images are a combination
of both intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Additionally, in the r band, in periods of quiescent microlensing
activity, we find that the degree of multifractality (nonlinearity) of image A is stronger than
that of B, while B has a larger multifractal strength in recent epochs (from day 5564 to day 7527) when
it appears to be affected by microlensing. Finally, comparing the optical bands in a period of quiescent
microlensing activity, we find that the degree of multifractality is stronger in the $r$ band for
both quasar images. In the absence of microlensing, the observed excesses of nonlinearity are most
likely generated when the broad-line region (BLR) reprocesses the radiation from the compact sources.
