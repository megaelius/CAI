This work aims to disentangle the morphological, kinematic, and chemical components of the nebula
M1-67 to shed light on its process of formation around the central Wolf-Rayet (WR) star WR124. We
have carried out integral field spectroscopy observations over two regions of M1-67, covering
most of the nebula in the optical range. Maps of electron density, line ratios, and radial velocity
were created to perform a detailed analysis of the two-dimensional structure. We studied the physical
and chemical properties by means of integrated spectra selected over the whole nebula. Photoionization
models were performed to confirm the empirical chemical results theoretically. In addition, we
analysed infrared spectroscopic data and the MIPS 24micron image of M1-67 from Spitzer. We find
that the ionized gas of M1-67 is condensed in knots aligned in a preferred axis along the NE-SW direction,
like a bipolar structure. Both electron density and radial velocity decrease in this direction
when moving away from the central star. From the derived electron temperature, Te~8200 K, we have
estimated chemical abundances, obtaining that nitrogen appears strongly enriched and oxygen
depleted. From the last two results, we infer that this bipolarity is the consequence of an ejection
of an evolved stage of WR124 with material processed in the CNO cycle. The infrared study has revealed
that the bipolar axis is composed of ionized gas with a low ionization degree that is well mixed with
warm dust and of a spherical bubble surrounding the ejection at 24micron. Taking the evolution of
a 60 Mo star and the temporal scale of the bipolar ejection into account, we propose that the observed
gas was ejected during an eruption in the luminous blue variable. The star has entered the WR phase
recently without apparent signs of interaction between WR-winds and interstellar material.
