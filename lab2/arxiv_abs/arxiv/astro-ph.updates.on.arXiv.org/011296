Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner (hereafter, comet 21P/G-Z) is a Jupiter-family comet and a parent
comet of the October Draconids meteor shower. If meteoroids originating from a Jupiter-family
comet contain complex organic molecules, such as amino acids, they are essential pieces of the puzzle
regarding the origin of life on Earth. We observed comet 21P/G-Z in the mid-infrared wavelength
region using the Cooled Mid-infrared Camera and Spectrometer (COMICS) on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope
on UT 2005 July 5. Here, we report the unidentified infrared (UIR) emission features of comet 21P/G-Z,
which are likely due to complex organic molecules (both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons),
and the thermal emission from amorphous/crystalline silicates and amorphous carbon grains in
its mid-infrared low-resolution spectrum. The UIR features at ~8.2 micron, ~8.5 micron, and ~11.2
micron found in the spectrum of comet 21P/G-Z could be attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(or hydrogenated amorphous carbons) contaminated by N- or O-atoms, although part of the feature
at ~11.2 micron comes from crystalline olivine. The other feature at ~9.2 micron might originate
from aliphatic hydrocarbons. Comet 21P/G-Z is enriched in complex organic molecules. Considering
that the derived mass fraction of crystalline silicates in comet 21P/G-Z is typical of comets, we
propose that the comet originated from a circumplanetary disk of giant planets (similar to Jupiter
and Saturn) where was warmer than the typical comet-forming region (5-30 au from the Sun) and was
suitable for the formation of complex organic molecules. Comets from circumplanetary disks might
be enriched in complex organic molecules, such as comet 21P/G-Z, and may have provided pre-biotic
molecules to ancient Earth by direct impact or meteor showers.
