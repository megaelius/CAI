UHECRs have attracted a lot of attention due to their challengingly high energies and their potential
value to constrain physical processes and astrophysical parameters in the most energetic sources
of the universe. Current detectors have failed to detect significant anisotropies which had been
expected to allow source identification. Some indications about the UHECR composition, which
may become heavier at the highest energies, has even put into question the possibility that such
a goal could be achieved soon. We investigate the potential value of a new-generation detector,
with 10 times larger exposure, to overcome the current situation and make significant progress
in the detection of anisotropies and thus in the study of UHECRs. We take as an example the expected
performances of the JEM-EUSO, assuming a uniform full-sky coverage with a total exposure of 300,000
km2 sr yr. We simulate realistic UHECR sky maps for a wide range of possible astrophysical scenarios
allowed by the current constraints, taking into account the energy losses and photo-dissociation
of the UHECRs, as well as their deflections by magnetic fields. These sky maps, built for the expected
statistics of JEM-EUSO as well as for the current Auger statistics, as a reference, are analyzed
from the point of view of their intrinsic anisotropies, using the two-point correlation function.
A statistical study of the resulting anisotropies is performed for each astrophysical scenario,
varying the UHECR source composition and spectrum as well as the source density. We find that significant
anisotropies are expected to be detected by a next-generation UHECR detector, for essentially
all the astrophysical scenarios studied, and give precise, quantitative meaning to this statement.
Our results show that a gain of one order of magnitude in exposure would make a significant difference
compared to the existing detectors.
