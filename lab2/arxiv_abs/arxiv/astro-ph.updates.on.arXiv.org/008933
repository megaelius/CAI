Much controversy surrounds the inferred progenitor masses of Type II-Plateau (II-P) supernovae
(SNe). The debate is nourished by the discrepant results from radiation-hydrodynamics simulations,
from pre-explosion imaging, and from studies of host stellar populations. Here, we present a controlled
experiment using four solar metallicity models with zero-age main-sequence masses of 12, 15, 20,
and 25Msun. Because of the effects of core burning and surface mass loss, these models reach core
collapse as red-supergiant (RSG) stars with a similar H-rich envelope mass of 8 to 9Msun but with
final masses in the range 11 to 16Msun. We explode the progenitors using a thermal bomb, adjusting
the energy deposition to yield an asymptotic ejecta kinetic energy of 1.25 x 10^51 erg and an initial
56Ni mass of 0.04Msun. The resulting SNe produce similar photometric and spectroscopic properties
from 10 to 200d. The spectral characteristics are degenerate. The scatter in early-time color results
from the range in progenitor radii, while the differences in late-time spectra reflect the larger
oxygen yields in more massive progenitors. Because the progenitors have a comparable H-rich envelope
mass, the photospheric phase duration is comparable for all models; the difference in He-core mass
is invisible. As different main-sequence masses can produce progenitors with a similar H-rich
envelope mass, light curve modeling cannot provide a robust and unique solution for the ejecta mass
of Type II-P SNe. The numerous uncertainties in massive star evolution and wind mass loss also prevent
a robust association with a main-sequence star mass. Light curve modeling can at best propose compatibility.
