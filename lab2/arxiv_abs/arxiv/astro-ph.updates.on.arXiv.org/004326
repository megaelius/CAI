Water megamasers from circumnuclear disks in galaxy centers provide the most accurate measurements
of supermassive black hole masses and uniquely probe the sub-parsec accretion processes. At the
same time, these systems offer independent crucial constraints of the Hubble Constant in the nearby
universe, and thus, the arguably best single constraint on the nature of dark energy. The chances
of finding these golden standards are however abysmally low, at an overall ~<3% for any level of water
maser emission detected at 22 GHz, and ~<1% for those exhibiting the disk-like configuration. We
provide here a thorough summary of the current state of the detection of water megamaser disks, along
with a novel investigation of the chances of increasing their detection rates based on a multivariate
parameter analysis of optical and mid-infrared photometric properties of the largest database
of galaxies surveyed for the 22 GHz emission. We find that galaxies with water megamaser emission
tend to associate with strong emission in all WISE mid-infrared wavelengths, with the strongest
enhancement in the W4 band, at 22 micron, as well as with previously proposed and newly found indicators
of AGN strength in the mid-infrared, such as red W1-W2 and W1-W4 colors, and the integrated mid-infrared
luminosity of the host galaxy. While these trends offer a potential boost of the megamaser detection
rates to 6 - 15%, or a factor of 2-8 relative to the current rates, depending on the chosen sample selection
criteria, the completeness rate remains generally low (40 -- 60% of megamasers would not be targeted).
By combining criteria of mid-IR brightness, optical colors, and the optical brightness, the detection
rate of disk masers can be effectively boosted to ~> 6%, with ~> 60% completeness rates.
