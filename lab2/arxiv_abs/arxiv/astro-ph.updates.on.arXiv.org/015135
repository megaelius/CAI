We compare the primordial scalar power spectra in the loop cosmological models using the effective
dynamics of the hybrid approach to cosmological perturbations in which the background is loop quantized
but the perturbations are Fock quantized. The three loop cosmological models under consideration
are the standard LQC, the modified LQC-I (mLQC-I) and the modified LQC-II (mLQC-II) in the spatially
flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe with a Starobinsky potential.
These models arise from different regularizations of the classical Hamiltonian constraint in
the symmetry reduced spacetimes and aim to capture certain features of quantization in loop quantum
gravity. When applying the techniques in the hybrid approach to mLQC-I/II, we find the effective
Mukhanov-Sasaki equations take the same form as in LQC. The difference among the three models is
encoded in the unique expressions of the effective masses in each model. We find that the relative
difference in the amplitude of power spectrum between LQC and mLQC-II is approximately $50\%$ in
the infrared and the oscillatory regimes, whereas this difference can be as large as $100\%$ between
mLQC-I and LQC/mLQC-II. Interestingly, in the infrared and the oscillatory regimes of mLQC-I,
we obtain a suppressed power spectrum from the hybrid approach which is far below the Planck scale.
This result is in a striking contrast to the one obtained from dressed metric approach to perturbations
where the corresponding amplitude in this regime is extremely large. Our analysis shows that while
the phenomenological predictions are in agreement between two approaches for LQC and mLQC-II,
for mLQC-I the differences between dressed and hybrid approaches can be quite significant. Our
result provides the first robust evidence of difference in predictions between dressed and hybrid
approaches due to respective underlying constructions.
