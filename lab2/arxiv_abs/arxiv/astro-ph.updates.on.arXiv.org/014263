Eccentric gaseous discs are unstable to a parametric instability involving the resonant interaction
between inertial-gravity waves and the eccentric mode in the disc. We present 3D global hydrodynamical
simulations of inviscid circumbinary discs that form an inner cavity and become eccentric through
interaction with the central binary. The parametric instability grows and generates turbulence
that transports angular momentum with stress parameter $\alpha \sim 5 \times 10^{-3}$ at distances
$\lesssim 7 \;a_{bin} $, where $a_{bin}$ is the binary semi-major axis. Vertical turbulent diffusion
occurs at a rate corresponding to $\alpha_{diff}\sim 1-2\times 10^{-3}$. We examine the impact
of turbulent diffusion on the vertical settling of pebbles, and on the rate of pebble accretion by
embedded planets. In steady state, dust particles with Stokes numbers ${\it St} \lesssim 0.1$ form
a layer of finite thickness $H_d \gtrsim 0.1 H$, where $H$ is the gas scale height. Pebble accretion
efficiency is then reduced by a factor $r_{acc}/H_d$, where $r_{acc}$ is the accretion radius,
compared to the rate in a laminar disc. For accreting core masses with $m_p \lesssim 0.1\; M_\oplus$,
pebble accretion for particles with ${\it St} \gtrsim 0.5$ is also reduced because of velocity kicks
induced by the turbulence. These effects combine to make the time needed by a Ceres-mass object to
grow to the pebble isolation mass, when significant gas accretion can occur, longer than typical
disc lifetimes. Hence, the origins of circumbinary planets orbiting close to their central binary
systems, as discovered by the Kepler mission, are difficult to explain using an in situ model that
invokes a combination of the streaming instability and pebble accretion.
