The well-known quasar SDSS J095253.83+011421.9 (J0952+0114) at z=3.02 has one of the most peculiar
spectra discovered so far, showing the presence of narrow Ly$\alpha$ and broad metal emission lines.
Although recent studies have suggested that a Proximate Damped Ly$\alpha$ system (PDLA) causes
this peculiar spectrum, the origin of the gas associated with the PDLA is unknown. Here we report
the results of MUSE observations that reveal a new giant ($\approx$ 100 physical kpc) Lyman $\alpha$
nebula. The detailed analysis of the Ly$\alpha$ velocity, velocity dispersion, and surface brightness
profiles suggests that the J0952+0114 Ly$\alpha$ nebula shares similar properties of other QSO
nebulae previously detected with MUSE, implying that the PDLA in J0952+0144 is covering only a small
fraction of the QSO emission solid angle. We also detected bright and spectrally narrow CIV$\lambda$1550
and HeII$\lambda$1640 extended emission around J0952+0114 with velocity centroids similar to
the peak of the extended and central narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission. The presence of a peculiarly bright,
unresolved, and relatively broad HeII$\lambda$1640 emission in the central region at exactly
the same PDLA redshift hints at the possibility that the PDLA originates in a clumpy outflow with
a bulk velocity of about 500 km/s. The smaller velocity dispersion of the large scale Ly$\alpha$
emission suggests that the high-speed outflow is confined to the central region. Lastly, the derived
spatially resolved HeII/Ly$\alpha$ and CIV/Ly$\alpha$ maps show a positive gradient with the
distance to the QSO hinting at a non-homogeneous ionization parameter distribution.
