When magnetic flux emerges from beneath the photosphere it displaces the preexisting field in the
corona, and a current sheet generally forms at the boundary between the old and new magnetic domains.
Reconnection in the current sheet relaxes this highly stressed configuration to a lower energy
state. This scenario is most familiar, and most often studied, in flares, where the flux transfer
is rapid. We present here a study of steady, quiescent flux transfer occurring at a rate three orders
of magnitude below that in a large flare. In particular we quantify the reconnection rate, and related
energy release, occurring as new polarity emerges to form Active Region 11112 (2010-10-16T00:S18W14)
within a region of preexisting flux. A bright, low lying kernel of coronal loops above the emerging
polarity, observed with AIA onboard SDO and XRT onboard Hinode, originally shows magnetic connectivity
only between regions of newly emerged flux when overlaid on magnetograms from HMI. Over the course
of several days, this bright kernel advances into the preexisting flux. The advancement of an easily
visible boundary into the old flux regions allows measurement of the rate of reconnection between
old and new magnetic domains. We compare the reconnection rate to the inferred heating of the coronal
plasma. To our knowledge, this is the first measurement of steady, quiescent heating related to
reconnection. We determine that the newly emerged flux reconnects at a fairly steady rate of 0.38e16
Mx/s over two days, while the radiated power varies between 2~8e25 erg/s over the same time. We find
that as much as 40% of the total emerged flux at any given time may have reconnected. The total amount
of transferred flux (1e21 Mx) and radiated energy (7.2e30 ergs) are comparable to that of a large
M- or small X-class flare, but are stretched out over 45 hours.
