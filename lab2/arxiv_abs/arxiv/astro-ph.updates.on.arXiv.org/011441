The Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey has performed a multi-epoch near-infrared imaging
of the inner Galactic plane. High-fidelity photometric catalogs are needed to utilize the data.
We aim at producing a deep, point-spread-function (PSF) photometric catalog for the VVV survey
J, H, and Ks band data. Specifically, we aim at taking advantage of all the epochs of the survey to reach
high limiting magnitudes. We develop an automatic PSF-fitting pipeline based on the DaoPHOT algorithm
and perform photometry on the stacked VVV images in J, H, and Ks bands. We present a PSF photometric
catalog in the Vega system that contains about 926 million sources in the J, H, and Ks filters. About
10% of the sources are flagged as possible spurious detections. The 5 sigma limiting magnitudes
of the sources with high reliability are about 20.8, 19.5, and 18.7 mag in the J, H, and Ks band, respectively,
depending on the local crowding condition. Our photometric catalog reaches on average about one
magnitude deeper than the previously released PSF DoPHOT photometric catalog. It also includes
less spurious detections. There are significant differences in the brightnesses of faint sources
between our catalog and the previously released one. The likely origin of these differences is in
the different photometric algorithms that are utilized; it is not straightforward to assess which
catalog is more accurate in which situations. Our new catalog is beneficial especially for science
goals that require high limiting magnitudes; our catalog reaches such in fields that have a relatively
uniform source number density. Overall, the limiting magnitudes and completeness are different
in the fields with different crowding conditions.
