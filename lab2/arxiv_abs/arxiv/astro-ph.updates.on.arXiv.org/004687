Transmission spectra are differential measurements that utilize stellar illumination to probe
transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Any spectral difference between the illuminating light source
and the disk-integrated stellar spectrum due to starspots and faculae will be imprinted in the observed
transmission spectrum. However, few constraints exist for the extent of photospheric heterogeneities
in M dwarfs. Here, we model spot and faculae covering fractions consistent with observed photometric
variabilities for M dwarfs and the associated 0.3-5.5 $\mu$m stellar contamination spectra. We
find that large ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with observations
and corrections assuming a linear relation between variability amplitude and covering fractions
generally underestimate the stellar contamination. Using realistic estimates for spot and faculae
covering fractions, we find stellar contamination can be more than $10 \times$ larger than transit
depth changes expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. We also find that stellar
spectral contamination can lead to systematic errors in radius and therefore the derived density
of small planets. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, we show that TRAPPIST-1's rotational variability
is consistent with spot covering fractions $f_{spot} = 8^{+18}_{-7}\%$ and faculae covering fractions
$f_{fac} = 54^{+16}_{-46}\%$. The associated stellar contamination signals alter transit depths
of the TRAPPIST-1 planets at wavelengths of interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly
1-15 $\times$ the strength of planetary features, significantly complicating $JWST$ follow-up
observations of this system. Similarly, we find stellar contamination can lead to underestimates
of bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets of $\Delta(\rho) = -3^{+3}_{-8} \%$, thus leading to
overestimates of their volatile contents.
