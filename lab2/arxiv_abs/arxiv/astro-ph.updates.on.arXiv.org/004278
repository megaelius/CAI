Detection of the redshifted 21cm-line signal from neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium
(IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is complicated by intense foregrounds such as galactic
synchrotron and extragalactic radio galaxies. The 21cm-Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter(LAE) cross-correlation
is one of the tools available to reduce the foregrounds because the foreground emission from such
radio sources is statistically independent of LAE distribution. LAE surveys during the EoR at redshifts
$z=6.6$ and $7.3$ are ongoing by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). Additionally, Prime Focus
Spectrograph (PFS) provides precise redshift information of the LAEs discovered by the HSC survey.
In this paper, we investigate the detectability of the 21cm-signal with the 21cm-LAE cross-correlation
by using our improved reionization simulations that are consistent with the neutral hydrogen fraction
at $z\sim6$ indicated by QSO spectra and the observed Thompson scattering optical depth. We also
focus on the error budget and evaluate it quantitatively in order to consider a strategy to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we explore an expansion of the LAE survey to suggest optimal
survey parameters and show a potential to measure a characteristic size of ionized bubbles via the
turnover scale of the cross-power spectrum. As a result, we find that the Murchison Widefield Array
(MWA) has ability to detect the cross-spectrum signal on large scales by combining LAE Deep field
survey of HSC. We also show that the sensitivity is improved dramatically at small scales by adding
redshift information from the PFS measurements. Finally, we find that a wider LAE survey is better
than a deeper survey with a fixed observation time in order to detect the cross-spectrum and that
the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) has a potential to measure the turnover scale with an accuracy of
$6\times10^{-3}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$.
