The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational wave (GW) detectors will begin operation in
the coming years, with compact binary coalescence events a likely source for the first detections.
The gravitational waveforms emitted directly encode information about the sources, including
the masses and spins of the compact objects. Recovering the physical parameters of the sources from
the GW observations is a key analysis task. This work describes the LALInference software library
for Bayesian parameter estimation of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, which builds on
several previous methods to provide a well-tested toolkit which has already been used for several
studies. We are able to show using three independent sampling algorithms that our implementation
consistently converges on the same results, giving confidence in the parameter estimates thus
obtained. We demonstrate this with a detailed comparison on three compact binary systems: a binary
neutron star, a neutron star-black hole binary and a binary black hole, where we show a cross-comparison
of results. These systems were analysed with non-spinning, aligned spin and generic spin configurations
respectively, showing that consistent results can be obtained even with the full 15-dimensional
parameter space of the generic spin configurations. We also demonstrate statistically that the
Bayesian credible intervals we recover correspond to frequentist confidence intervals under
correct prior assumptions by analysing a set of 100 signals drawn from the prior. We discuss the computational
cost of these algorithms, and describe the general and problem-specific sampling techniques we
have used to improve the efficiency of sampling the CBC parameter space.
