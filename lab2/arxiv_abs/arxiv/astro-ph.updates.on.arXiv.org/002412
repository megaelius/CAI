The optical properties of ice in the far infrared are important for models of protoplanetary and
debris disks. In this report we derive a new set of data for the absorption (represented by the imaginary
part of the refractive index $\kappa$) of crystalline water ice in this spectral range, including
a detailed inspection of the temperature dependence, which had not been done in such detail before.
We measured the transmission of three ice layers with different thickness at wavelengths $\lambda=45...1000$
microns at temperatures $\vartheta = 10...250$ K. We found a change in the spectral dependence of
$\kappa$ at a wavelength of $175 \pm 6$ microns. At shorter wavelengths, $\kappa$ exhibits a constant
flat slope and no significant temperature dependence. Long-ward of that wavelength, the slope
gets steeper and has a clear, approximately linear temperature dependence. This change in the behaviour
is probably caused by a characteristic absorption band of water ice. The measured data were fitted
by a power-law model that analytically describes the absorption behaviour at an arbitrary temperature.
This model can readily be applied to any object of interest, for instance a protoplanetary or a debris
disk. To illustrate how the model works, we simulated the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the resolved, large debris disk around the nearby solar-type star HD 207129. Replacing our ice model
by another, commonly used data set for water ice results in a different SED slope at longer wavelengths.
This leads to changes in the characteristic model parameters of the disk, such as the inferred particle
size distribution, and affects the interpretation of the underlying collisional physics of the
disk.
