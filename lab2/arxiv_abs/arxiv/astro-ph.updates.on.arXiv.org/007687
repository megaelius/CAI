A widely used method for parameterizing the outcomes of common envelopes (CEs) involves defining
an ejection efficiency, $\bar\alpha_{\rm eff}$, that represents the fraction of orbital energy
used to unbind the envelope as the orbit decays. Given $\bar\alpha_{\rm eff}$, a prediction for
the post-CE orbital separation is then possible with knowledge of the energy required to unbind
the primary's envelope from its core. Unfortunately, placing observational constraints on $\bar\alpha_{\rm
eff}$ is challenging as it requires knowledge of the primary's structure at the onset of the common
envelope phase. Numerical simulations have also had difficulties reproducing post-CE orbital
configurations as they leave extended, but still bound, envelopes. Using detailed stellar interior
profiles, we calculate $\bar\alpha_{\rm eff}$ values for a matrix of primary-companion mass pairs
when the primary is likely to incur a CE, i.e., at maximal extent in its evolution. We find that the
ejection efficiency is most sensitive to the properties of the surface-contact convective region
(SCCR). In this region, the convective turnover times are short compared to orbital decay timescales,
thereby allowing the star to effectively radiate orbital energy and thus lower $\bar\alpha_{\rm
eff}$. The inclusion of convection in numerical simulations of CEs may resolve the ejection problem
without the need for additional energy sources as the orbit must shrink substantially further before
the requisite energy can be tapped to drive ejection. Additionally, convection leads to predicted
post-CE orbital periods of less than a day, an observational result that has been difficult to reproduce
in population studies where $\bar\alpha_{\rm eff}$ is taken to be constant. Finally, we provide
a simple method to calculate $\bar\alpha_{\rm eff}$ if the properties of the SCCR are known.
