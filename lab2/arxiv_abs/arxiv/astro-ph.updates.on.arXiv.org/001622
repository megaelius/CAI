We present the first ground-based CCD ($\lambda < 1\mu$m) image of an extrasolar planet. Using
MagAO's VisAO camera we detected the extrasolar giant planet (EGP) $\beta$ Pictoris b in $Y$-short
($Y_S$, 0.985 $\mu$m), at a separation of $0.470 \pm 0.010''$ and a contrast of $(1.63 \pm 0.49) \times
10^{-5}$. This detection has a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.1, with an empirically estimated upper-limit
on false alarm probability of 1.0%. We also present new photometry from the NICI instrument on the
Gemini-South telescope, in $CH_{4S,1\%}$ ($1.58$ $\mu m$), $K_S$ ($2.18\mu m$), and $K_{cont}$
(2.27 $\mu m$). A thorough analysis of our photometry combined with previous measurements yields
an estimated near-IR spectral type of L$2.5\pm1.5$, consistent with previous estimates. We estimate
log$(L_{bol}/L_{Sun})$ = $-3.86 \pm 0.04$, which is consistent with prior estimates for $\beta$
Pic b and with field early-L brown dwarfs. This yields a hot-start mass estimate of $11.9 \pm 0.7$
$M_{Jup}$ for an age of $21\pm4$ Myr, with an upper limit below the deuterium burning mass. Our $L_{bol}$
based hot-start estimate for temperature is $T_{eff}=1643\pm32$ K (not including model dependent
uncertainty). Due to the large corresponding model-derived radius of $R=1.43\pm0.02$ $R_{Jup}$,
this $T_{eff}$ is $\sim$$250$ K cooler than would be expected for a field L2.5 brown dwarf. Other
young, low-gravity (large radius), ultracool dwarfs and directly-imaged EGPs also have lower
effective temperatures than are implied by their spectral types. However, such objects tend to
be anomalously red in the near-IR compared to field brown dwarfs. In contrast, $\beta$ Pic b has near-IR
colors more typical of an early-L dwarf despite its lower inferred temperature.
