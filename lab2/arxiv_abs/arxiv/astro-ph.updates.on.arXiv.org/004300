We report the results of intensive X-ray, UV and optical monitoring of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593
with Swift. There is no intrinsic flux-related spectral change in the the variable components in
any band with small apparent variations due only to contamination by a second constant component,
possibly a (hard) reflection component in the X-rays and the (red) host galaxy in the UV/optical
bands. Relative to the shortest wavelength band, UVW2, the lags of the other UV and optical bands
are mostly in agreement with the predictions of reprocessing of high energy emission from an accretion
disc. The U-band lag is, however, far larger than expected, almost certainly because of reprocessed
Balmer continuum emission from the more distant broad line region gas. The UVW2 band is well correlated
with the X-rays but lags by ~6x more than expected if the UVW2 results from reprocessing of X-rays
on the accretion disc. However, if the lightcurves are filtered to remove variations on timescales
>5d, the lag approaches the expectation from disc reprocessing. MEMEcho analysis shows that direct
X-rays can be the driver of most of the variations in the UV/optical bands as long as the response functions
for those bands all have long tails (up to 10d) in addition to a strong peak (from disc reprocessing)
at short lag (<1d). We interpret the tails as due to reprocessing from the surrounding gas. Comparison
of X-ray to UVW2 and UVW2 to V-band lags for 4 AGN, including NGC 4593, shows that all have UVW2 to V-band
lags which exceed the expectations from disc resprocessing by factor < 2. However the X-ray to UVW2
lags are, mostly, in greater excess from the expectations from disc reprocessing and differ between
AGN. The largest excess is in NGC 4151. Absorption and scattering may be affecting X-ray to UV lags.
