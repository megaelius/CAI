Several low-mass eclipsing binary stars show larger than expected radii for their measured mass,
metallicity and age. One proposed mechanism for this radius inflation involves inhibited internal
convection and starspots caused by strong magnetic fields. One particular eclipsing binary, T-Cyg1-12664,
has proven confounding to this scenario. \citet{Cakirli2013a} measured a radius for the secondary
component that is twice as large as model predictions for stars with the same mass and age, but a primary
mass that is consistent with predictions. \citet[][]{Iglesias2017} independently measured
the radii and masses of the component stars and found that the radius of the secondary is not in fact
inflated with respect to models, but that the primary is, consistent with the inhibited convection
scenario. However, in their mass determinations, \citet[][]{Iglesias2017} lacked independent
radial velocity measurements for the secondary component due to the star's faintness at optical
wavelengths. The secondary component is especially interesting as its purported mass is near the
transition from partially-convective to a fully-convective interior. In this article we independently
determined the masses and radii of the component stars of T-Cyg1-12664 using archival {\it Kepler}
data and radial velocity measurements of both component stars obtained with IGRINS on the Discovery
Channel Telescope and NIRSPEC and HIRES on the Keck Telescopes. We show that neither of the component
stars is inflated with respect to models. Our results are broadly consistent with modern stellar
evolutionary models for main-sequence M dwarf stars and do not require inhibited convection by
magnetic fields to account for the stellar radii.
