We investigate the effect on potentially-habitable Earth-like planets of the magnetic fields
of M dwarf (dM) stars. Such fields can reduce the size of planetary magnetospheres to such an extent
that a significant fraction of the planet's atmosphere may be exposed to erosion by the stellar wind.
We use the sample of 15 active dM stars, for which surface magnetic field maps have been reconstructed,
to determine the magnetic pressure at the planet's orbit and hence the minimum size of its magnetosphere,
which would only be increased by considering the stellar wind. Our method provides a fast means to
assess which planets are most affected by the stellar magnetic field. We show that hypothetical
Earth-like planets with similar terrestrial magnetisation (1G) orbiting at the inner (outer)
edge of the habitable zone of these stars would present magnetospheres that extend at most up to 6
(11.7) planetary radii. With the exception of a couple of cases, to be able to sustain an Earth-sized
magnetosphere, the terrestrial planet would either (1) need to orbit significantly farther out
than the traditional limits of the habitable zone; or else, (2) if it were orbiting within the habitable
zone, it would require a minimum magnetic field ranging from a few G to up to a few thousand G. By assuming
a magnetospheric size that is more appropriate for the young-Earth (3.4Gyr ago), the required planetary
magnetic fields are one order of magnitude smaller. However, in this case, the polar cap area of the
planet that is unprotected from transport of particles to/from interplanetary space is twice larger.
As the star ages and its rotation rate and magnetic field reduce, the interplanetary magnetic pressure
decreases and the magnetosphere of planets should become larger. Using an empirically-derived
rotation-activity/magnetism relation,... (continues)
