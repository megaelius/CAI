Space-borne low-to medium-resolution (R~10^2-10^3) transmission spectroscopy of atmospheres
detect the broadest spectral features (alkali doublets, molecular bands, scattering), while
high-resolution (R~10^5), ground-based observations probe the sharpest features (cores of the
alkali lines, molecular lines).The two techniques differ by:(1) The LSF of ground-based observations
is 10^3 times narrower than for space-borne observations;(2)Space-borne transmission spectra
probe up to the base of thermosphere, while ground-based observations can reach pressures down
to 10^{-11};(3)Space-borne observations directly yield the transit depth of the planet, while
ground-based observations measure differences in the radius of the planet at different wavelengths.It
is challenging to combine both techniques.We develop a method to compare theoretical models with
observations at different resolutions.We introduce PyETA, a line-by-line 1D radiative transfer
code to compute transmission spectra at R~10^6 (0.01 A) over a broad wavelength range.An hybrid
forward modeling/retrieval optimization scheme is devised to deal with the large computational
resources required by modeling a broad wavelength range (~$0.3-2\mu m$) at high resolution.We
apply our technique to HD189733b.Here, HST observations reveal a flattened spectrum due to scattering
by aerosols, while high-resolution ground-based HARPS observations reveal the sharp cores of
sodium lines.We reconcile these results by building models that reproduce simultaneously both
data sets, from the troposphere to the thermosphere. We confirm:(1)the presence of scattering
by tropospheric aerosols;(2)that the sodium core feature is of thermospheric origin.Accounting
for aerosols, the sodium cores indicate T up to 10000K in the thermosphere.The precise value of the
thermospheric temperature is degenerate with the abundance of sodium and altitude of the aerosol
deck.
