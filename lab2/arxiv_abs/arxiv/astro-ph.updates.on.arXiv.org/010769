The results from the ALMA proposal peer review process in Cycles 0-6 are analyzed to identify any
systematics in the scientific rankings that may signify bias. Proposal rankings are analyzed with
respect to the experience level of a Principal Investigator (PI) in submitting ALMA proposals,
regional affiliation (Chile, East Asia, Europe, North America, or Other), and gender. The analysis
was conducted for both the Stage 1 rankings, which are based on the preliminary scores from the reviewers,
and the Stage 2 rankings, which are based on the final scores from the reviewers after participating
in a face-to-face panel discussion. Analysis of the Stage 1 results shows that PIs who submit an ALMA
proposal in multiple cycles have systematically better proposal ranks than PIs who have submitted
proposals for the first time. In terms of regional affiliation, PIs from Europe and North America
have better Stage 1 rankings than PIs from Chile and East Asia. Consistent with Lonsdale et al. (2016),
proposals led by men have better Stage 1 rankings than women when averaged over all cycles. This trend
was most noticeably present in Cycle 3, but no discernible differences in the Stage 1 rankings are
present in recent cycles. Nonetheless, in each cycle to date, women have had a lower proposal acceptance
rate than men even after differences in demographics are considered. Comparison of the Stage 1 and
Stage 2 rankings reveal no significant changes in the distribution of proposal ranks by experience
level, regional affiliation, or gender as a result of the panel discussions, although the proposal
ranks for East Asian PIs show a marginally significant improvement from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when averaged
over all cycles. Thus any systematics in the proposal rankings are introduced primarily in the Stage
1 process and not from the face-to-face discussions.
