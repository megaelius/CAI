The rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs), $R_\text{TDE}$, is predicted to depend on stellar conditions
near the super-massive black hole (SMBH), which are on difficult-to-measure sub-parsec scales.
We test whether $R_\text{TDE}$ depends on kpc-scale global galaxy properties, which are observable.
We concentrate on stellar surface mass density, $\Sigma_{M_\star}$, and velocity dispersion,
$\sigma_v$, which correlate with the stellar density and velocity dispersion of the stars around
the SMBH. We consider 35 TDE candidates, with and without known X-ray emission. The hosts range from
star-forming to quiescent to quiescent with strong Balmer absorption lines. The last (often with
post-starburst spectra) are overrepresented in our sample by a factor of $35^{+21}_{-17}$ or $18^{+8}_{-7}$,
depending on the strength of the H$\delta$ absorption line. For a subsample of hosts with homogeneous
measurements, $\Sigma_{M_\star}=10^9$-$10^{10}~{\rm M_\odot / kpc^2}$, higher on average
than for a volume-weighted control sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies with similar redshifts
and stellar masses. This is because: (1) most of the TDE hosts here are quiescent galaxies, which
tend to have higher $\Sigma_{M_\star}$ than the star-forming galaxies that dominate the control,
and (2) the star-forming hosts have higher average $\Sigma_{M_\star}$ than the star-forming control.
There is also a weak suggestion that TDE hosts have lower $\sigma_v$ than for the quiescent control.
Assuming that $R_{\rm TDE}\propto \Sigma_{M_\star}^\alpha \times \sigma_v^\beta$, and applying
a statistical model to the TDE hosts and control sample, we estimate $\hat{\alpha}=0.9 \pm 0.2$
and $\hat{\beta}=-1.0 \pm 0.6$. This is broadly consistent with $R_\text{TDE}$ being tied to the
dynamical relaxation of stars surrounding the SMBH.
