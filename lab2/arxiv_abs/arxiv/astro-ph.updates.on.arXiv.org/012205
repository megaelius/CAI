Large low surface brightness galaxies have recently been found to be abundant in nearby galaxy clusters.
In this paper, we investigate these ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the six Hubble Frontier Fields
galaxy clusters: Abell 2744, MACSJ0416.1$-$2403, MACSJ0717.5$+$3745, MACSJ1149.5$+$2223,
Abell S1063 and Abell 370. These are the most massive ($1$-$3 \times 10^{15}~M_\odot$) and distant
($0.308 < z < 0.545$) systems in which this class of galaxy has yet been discovered. We estimate that
the clusters host of the order of ${\sim}$200-1400 UDGs inside the virial radius ($R_{200}$), consistent
with the UDG abundance halo-mass relation found in the local universe, and suggests that UDGs may
be formed in clusters. Within each cluster, however, we find that UDGs are not evenly distributed.
Instead their projected spatial distributions are lopsided, and they are deficient in the regions
of highest mass density as traced by gravitational lensing. While the deficiency of UDGs in central
regions is not surprising, the lopsidedness is puzzling. The UDGs, and their lopsided spatial distributions,
may be associated with known substructures late in their infall into the clusters, meaning that
we find evidence both for formation of UDGs in clusters and for UDGs falling into clusters. We also
investigate the ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) residing in the clusters, and find the spatial distributions
of UDGs and UCDs appear anti-correlated. Around 15% of UDGs exhibit either compact nuclei or nearby
point sources. Taken together, these observations provide additional evidence for a picture in
which at least some UDGs are destroyed in dense cluster environments and leave behind a residue of
UCDs.
