Direct imaging has paved the way for atmospheric characterization of young and self-luminous gas
giants. Scattering in a horizontally-inhomogeneous atmosphere causes the disk-integrated polarization
of the thermal radiation to be linearly polarized, possibly detectable with the newest generation
of high-contrast imaging instruments. We aim to investigate the effect of latitudinal and longitudinal
cloud variations, circumplanetary disks, atmospheric oblateness, and cloud particle properties
on the integrated degree and direction of polarization in the near-infrared. We have developed
a three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code (ARTES) for scattered light simulations
in (exo)planetary atmospheres. The code is applicable to calculations of reflected light and thermal
radiation in a spherical grid with a parameterized distribution of gas, clouds, hazes, and circumplanetary
material. The disk-integrated degree of polarization of a horizontally-inhomogeneous atmosphere
is maximal when the planet is flattened, the optical thickness of the equatorial clouds is large
compared to the polar clouds, and the clouds are located at high altitude. For a flattened planet,
the integrated polarization can both increase or decrease with respect to a spherical planet which
depends on the horizontal distribution and optical thickness of the clouds. The direction of polarization
can be either parallel or perpendicular to the projected direction of the rotation axis when clouds
are zonally distributed. Rayleigh scattering by submicron-sized cloud particles will maximize
the polarimetric signal whereas the integrated degree of polarization is significantly reduced
with micron-sized cloud particles as a result of forward scattering. The presence of a cold or hot
circumplanetary disk may also produce a detectable degree of polarization ($\lesssim$1%) even
with a uniform cloud layer in the atmosphere.
