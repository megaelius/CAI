The physical properties of brown dwarf companions found to orbit nearby, solar-type stars can be
benchmarked against independent measures of their mass, age, chemical composition, and other
parameters, offering insights into the evolution of substellar objects. The TRENDS high-contrast
imaging survey has recently discovered a (mass/age/metallicity) benchmark brown dwarf orbiting
the nearby (d=18.69+/-0.19 pc), G8V/K0V star HD 4747. We have acquired follow-up spectroscopic
measurements of HD 4747 B using the Gemini Planet Imager to study its spectral type, effective temperature,
surface gravity, and cloud properties. Observations obtained in the H-band and K1-band recover
the companion and reveal that it is near the L/T transition (T1+/-2). Fitting atmospheric models
to the companion spectrum, we find strong evidence for the presence of clouds. However, spectral
models cannot satisfactorily fit the complete data set: while the shape of the spectrum can be well-matched
in individual filters, a joint fit across the full passband results in discrepancies that are a consequence
of the inherent color of the brown dwarf. We also find a $2\sigma$ tension in the companion mass, age,
and surface gravity when comparing to evolutionary models. These results highlight the importance
of using benchmark objects to study "secondary effects" such as metallicity, non-equilibrium
chemistry, cloud parameters, electron conduction, non-adiabatic cooling, and other subtleties
affecting emergent spectra. As a new L/T transition benchmark, HD 4747 B warrants further investigation
into the modeling of cloud physics using higher resolution spectroscopy across a broader range
of wavelengths, polarimetric observations, and continued Doppler radial velocity and astrometric
monitoring.
