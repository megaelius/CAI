We introduce simulations aimed at assessing how well weak gravitational lensing of 21cm radiation
from the Epoch of Reionization ($z \sim 8$) can be measured by an SKA-like radio telescope. A simulation
pipeline has been implemented to study the performance of lensing reconstruction techniques.
We show how well the lensing signal can be reconstructed using the three-dimensional quadratic
lensing estimator in Fourier space assuming different survey strategies. The numerical code introduced
in this work is capable of dealing with issues that can not be treated analytically such as the discreteness
of visibility measurements and the inclusion of a realistic model for the antennae distribution.
This paves the way for future numerical studies implementing more realistic reionization models,
foreground subtraction schemes, and testing the performance of lensing estimators that take into
account the non-Gaussian distribution of HI after reionization. If multiple frequency channels
covering $z \sim 7-11.6$ are combined, Phase 1 of SKA-Low should be able to obtain good quality images
of the lensing potential with a total resolution of $\sim 1.6$ arcmin. The SKA-Low Phase 2 should
be capable of providing images with high-fidelity even using data from $z\sim 7.7 - 8.3$. We perform
tests aimed at evaluating the numerical implementation of the mapping reconstruction. We also
discuss the possibility of measuring an accurate lensing power spectrum. Combining data from $z
\sim 7-11.6$ using the SKA2-Low telescope model, we find constraints comparable to sample variance
in the range $L<1000$, even for survey areas as small as $25\mbox{ deg}^2$.
