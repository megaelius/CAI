Large OVI columns are observed around star-forming, low-redshift ~L* galaxies, with a dependence
on impact parameter indicating that most O^5+ particles reside beyond half the halo virial radius
(>~100 kpc). In order to constrain the nature of the gas traced by OVI, we analyze additional observables
of the outer halo, namely HI to OVI column ratios of 1-10, an absence of low-ion absorption, a mean
differential extinction of E(B-V)~10^-3, and a linear relation between OVI column and velocity
width. We contrast these observations with two physical scenarios: (1) OVI traces high-pressure
(~30 cm^-3 K) collisionally-ionized gas cooling from a virially-shocked phase, and (2) OVI traces
low-pressure (<~1 cm^-3 K) gas beyond the accretion shock, where the gas is in ionization and thermal
equilibrium with the UV background. We demonstrate that the high-pressure scenario requires multiple
gas phases to explain the observations, and a large deposition of energy at >~100 kpc to offset the
energy radiated by the cooling gas. In contrast, the low-pressure scenario can explain all considered
observations with a single gas phase in thermal equilibrium, provided that the baryon overdensity
is comparable to the dark-matter overdensity, and that the gas is enriched to >~Z_sun/3 with an ISM-like
dust-to-metal ratio. The low-pressure scenario implies that OVI traces a cool flow with mass flow
rate of ~5 M_sun yr^-1, comparable to the star formation rate of the central galaxies. The OVI line
widths are consistent with the velocity shear expected within this flow. The low-pressure scenario
predicts a bimodality in absorption line ratios at ~100 kpc, due to the pressure jump across the accretion
shock.
