Planets have been detected around a variety of stars, including low-mass objects, such as brown
dwarfs. However, such extreme cases are challenging for planet formation models. Recent sub-millimeter
observations of disks around brown dwarf measured low spectral indices of the continuum emission
that suggest that dust grains grow to mm-sizes even in these very low mass environments. To understand
the first steps of planet formation in scaled-down versions of T-Tauri disks, we investigate the
physical conditions that can theoretically explain the growth from interstellar dust to millimeter-sized
grains in disks around brown dwarf. We modeled the evolution of dust particles under conditions
of low-mass disks around brown dwarfs. We used coagulation, fragmentation and disk-structure
models to simulate the evolution of dust, with zero and non-zero radial drift. For the non-zero radial
drift, we considered strong inhomogeneities in the gas surface density profile that mimic long-lived
pressure bumps in the disk. We studied different scenarios that could lead to an agreement between
theoretical models and the spectral slope found by millimeter observations. We find that fragmentation
is less likely and rapid inward drift is more significant for particles in brown dwarf disks than
in T-Tauri disks. We present different scenarios that can nevertheless explain millimeter-sized
grains. As an example, a model that combines the following parameters can fit the millimeter fluxes
measured for brown dwarf disks: strong pressure inhomogeneities of $\sim$ 40% of amplitude, a small
radial extent $\sim$ 15 AU, a moderate turbulence strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{turb}}= 10^{-3}$,
and average fragmentation velocities for ices $v_f = 10 m s^{-1}$.
