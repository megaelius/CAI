Space weathering is an important surface process occurring on the Moon and other airless bodies,
especially those that have no magnetic field. The optical effects of the Moon's space weathering
have been largely investigated in the laboratory for lunar samples and lunar analogues. However,
duplication of the pristine regolith on Earth is not possible. Here we report the space weathering
from the unique perspective of the Chang'E-3's (CE-3) "Yutu" rover, building on our previous work
(Wang et al. 2017; Wu and Hapke 2018). Measurement of the visually undisturbed uppermost regolith
as well as locations that have been affected by rocket exhaust from the spacecraft by the Visible-Near
Infrared Spectrometer (VNIS) revealed that the returned samples bring a biased information about
the pristine lunar regolith. The uppermost surficial regolith is much more weathered than the regolith
immediately below, and the finest fraction is rich in space weathered products. These materials
are very dark and attenuated throughout the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths, hence
reduce the reflectance and mask the absorption features. The effects on the spectral slope caused
by space weathering are wavelength-dependent: the visible and near-infrared continuum slope
(VNCS) increases while the visible slope (VS) decreases. In the visible wavelength, the optical
effects of space weathering and TiO2 are identical: both reduce albedo and blue the spectra. This
suggests that developing new TiO2 abundance algorithm is needed. Optical maturity indices are
composition related and hence only locally meaningful. Since optical remote sensing can only sense
the uppermost few microns of regolith and since this surface tends to be very weathered, the interpretation
of surface composition using optical remote sensing data needs to be carefully evaluated. Sampling
the uppermost surface is suggested.
