Ultra-high energy (UHE) photons play an important role as an independent probe of the photo-pion
production mechanism by UHE cosmic rays. Their observation, or non-observation, may constrain
astrophysical scenarios for the origin of UHECRs and help to understand the nature of the flux suppression
observed by several experiments at energies above $10^{19.5}$ eV. Whereas the interaction length
of UHE photons above $10^{17}$ eV ranges from a few hundred kpc up to tenths of Mpc, photons can interact
with the extragalactic background radiation initiating the development of electromagnetic cascades
which affect the fluxes of photons observed at Earth. The interpretation of the current experimental
results rely on the simulations of the UHE photon propagation. In this paper, we present the novel
Monte Carlo code EleCa to simulate the $Ele$ctromagnetic $Ca$scading initiated by high-energy
photons and electrons. We provide an estimation of the surviving probability for photons inducing
electromagnetic cascades as a function of their distance from the observer and we calculate the
distances within which we expect to observe UHE photons with energy between $10^{17}$ and $10^{19}$
eV. Furthermore, the flux of GZK photons at Earth is investigated in several astrophysical scenarios
where we vary both injection spectrum and composition at the source and the intensity of the intervening
extragalactic magnetic field. Although the photon propagation depends on several astrophysical
factors, our numerical predictions combined with future experimental observations (or non-observations)
of UHE photons -- in the energy range between $10^{17.5}$ eV and $10^{20}$ eV -- can help to constrain
these scenarios.
