Context. [...] One of the most efficient methods is the measurement of the equivalent width (EW)
of the Calcium II Triplet (CaT), corrected for the luminosity and temperature effects via magnitude
differences from the horizontal branch (HB). Methods. We use the Ks magnitude difference between
the star and the reddest part of the HB (RHB) to generate reduced equivalent widths (rEW) from the
datasets presented in Saviane et al. (2012) and Rutledge et al. (1997). Subsequently we calibrated
these rEW against three different metellicity (met) scales: the one presented in Carretta et al.
(2009), the met values given in Harris (2010) and a version of the former corrected via high-resolution
spectroscopic met. Results. We calculated the calibration relations for the two datasets and the
three met scales and found that they are approximately equivalent, with differences almost negligible.
We compared our nIR calibrations with the corresponding optical ones, and found them to be equivalent,
establishing that the luminosity-corrected rEW using the Ks magnitude is compatible with the one
obtained from the V magnitude. We then used the met obtained from the calibration to investigate
the internal met distributions of the GCs. Conclusions. We have established that the ([Fe/H]:rEW)
relation is independent from the mag used for the luminosity correction and find that the calibration
relations only change slightly for different met scales. The CaT technique using NIR photometry
is thus a powerful tool to derive met. In particular, it can be used to study the internal met spread
of a GC. We confirm the presence of at least two met populations in NGC 6656 and find that several other
GCs present peculiar met distributions.
