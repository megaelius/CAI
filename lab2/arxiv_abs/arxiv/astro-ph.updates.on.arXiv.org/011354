IRAS F11119+3257 is a quasar-dominated Ultra-Luminous InfraRed Galaxy, with a partially obscured
narrow-line seyfert 1 nucleus. In this paper, we present the NIR spectroscopy of F11119+3257, in
which we find unusual Paschen emission lines, and metastable He I* $\lambda$10830 absorption associated
with the previously reported atomic sodium and molecular OH mini-BAL (Broad Absorption Line) outflow.
Photo-ionization diagnosis confirms previous findings that the outflows are at kilo-parsec scales.
Such large-scale outflows should produce emission lines. We indeed find that high-ionization
emission lines ([O III], [Ne III], and [Ne V]) are dominated by blueshifted components at similar
speeds to the mini-BALs. The blueshifted components are also detected in some low-ionization emission
lines, such as [O II] $\lambda$3727 and some Balmer lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$),
even though their cores are dominated by narrow ($FWHM_{\rm NEL} = 570\pm40$km s$^{-1}$) or broad
components at the systemic redshift of $z=0.18966\pm0.00006$. The mass flow rate (230-730$~M_\odot
\rm yr^{-1}$) and the kinetic luminosity ($\dot{E}_k \sim 10^{43.6-44.8} $erg s$^{-1}$) are then
inferred jointly from the blueshifted emission and absorption lines. In the NIR spectrum of F11119+3257,
we also find that the Paschen emission lines are unique, in which a very narrow ($FWHM=260\pm20~$km
s$^{-1}$) component is shown in only Pa$\alpha$. This narrow component most probably comes from
heavily obscured star formation. Based on the Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ emissions, we obtain an
extinction at the $H$ band, $A_H~>~2.1$ (or a reddenning of $E_{B-V}~>~$3.7), and a star formation
rate of $SFR~>~130\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$ that resembles the estimates inferred from the FIR emissions
($SFR_{\rm FIR} = 190\pm90$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$).
