Detections and non-detections of Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission from $z>6$ galaxies ($<1$
Gyr after the Big Bang) can be used to measure the timeline of cosmic reionization. Of key interest
to measuring reionization's mid-stages, but also increasing observational challenge, are observations
at z > 7, where Ly$\alpha$ redshifts to near infra-red wavelengths. Here we present a search for z
> 7.2 Ly$\alpha$ emission in 53 intrinsically faint Lyman Break Galaxy candidates, gravitationally
lensed by massive galaxy clusters, in the KMOS Lens-Amplified Spectroscopic Survey (KLASS). With
integration times of ~7-10 hours, we detect no Ly$\alpha$ emission with S/N>5 in our sample. We determine
our observations to be 80% complete for 5$\sigma$ spatially and spectrally unresolved emission
lines with integrated line flux $>5.7\times10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. We define a photometrically
selected sub-sample of 29 targets at $z=7.9\pm0.6$, with a median 5$\sigma$ Ly$\alpha$ EW limit
of 58A. We perform a Bayesian inference of the average intergalactic medium (IGM) neutral hydrogen
fraction using their spectra. Our inference accounts for the wavelength sensitivity and incomplete
redshift coverage of our observations, and the photometric redshift probability distribution
of each target. These observations, combined with samples from the literature, enable us to place
a lower limit on the average IGM neutral hydrogen fraction of $> 0.76 \; (68\%), \; > 0.46 \; (95\%)$
at z ~ 8, providing further evidence of rapid reionization at z~6-8. We show that this is consistent
with reionization history models extending the galaxy luminosity function to $M_\textrm{UV}
\lesssim -12$, with low ionizing photon escape fractions, $f_\textrm{esc} \lesssim 15\%$.
