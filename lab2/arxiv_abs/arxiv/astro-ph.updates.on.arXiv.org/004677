Debris discs have often been described as gas-poor discs as the gas-to-dust ratio is expected to
be considerably lower than in primordial,protoplanetary discs. However, recent observations
have confirmed the presence of a non-negligible amount of cold gas in the circumstellar (CS) debris
discs around young main-sequence stars.This cold gas has been suggested to be related to the outgassing
of planetesimals and cometary-like objects. The aim of the paper is to investigate the presence
of hot gas in the surroundings of stars bearing cold-gas debris discs. High-resolution optical
spectra of all currently known cold-gas-bearing debris-disc systems, with the exception of $\beta$
Pic and Fomalhaut, have been obtained from different observatories.We have analysed the Ca II H
& K and the Na I D lines searching for non-photospheric absorptions of CS origin, usually attributed
to cometary-like activity. Narrow, stable Ca II and/or Na I absorption features have been detected
superimposed to the photospheric lines in 10 out of the 15 observed cold-gas-bearing debris disc.Features
are found at the radial velocity of the stars, or slightly blue- or red-shifted, and/or at the velocity
of the local interstellar medium (ISM). Some stars also present transient variable events or absorptions
extended towards red wavelengths. These are the first detections of such Ca II features in 7 out of
the 15 observed stars. In some of these stars, results suggest that the stable and variable absorptions
arise from relatively hot gas located in the CS close-in environment. This hot gas is detected in
at least ~80%, of edge-on cold-gas-bearing debris discs, while in only ~10% of the discs seen close
to face-on. We interpret this as a geometrical effect, and suggest that the non-detection of hot
gas absorptions is due to the disc inclination rather than to the absence of the hot-gas component.
