Context. Protoplanetary disks show large diversity regarding their morphology and dust composition.
With mid-infrared interferometry the thermal emission of disks can be spatially resolved, and
the distribution and properties of the dust within can be studied. Aims. Our aim is to perform a statistical
analysis on a large sample of 82 disks around low- and intermediate-mass young stars, based on mid-infrared
interferometric observations. We intend to study the distribution of disk sizes, variability,
and the silicate dust mineralogy. Methods. Archival mid-infrared interferometric data from the
MIDI instrument on the VLTI are homogeneously reduced and calibrated. Geometric disk models are
used to fit the observations to get spatial information about the disks. An automatic spectral decomposition
pipeline is applied to analyze the shape of the silicate feature. Results. We present the resulting
data products in the form of an atlas, containing N band correlated and total spectra, visibilities,
and differential phases. The majority of our data can be well fitted with a continuous disk model,
except for a few objects, where a gapped model gives a better match. From the mid-infrared size--luminosity
relation we find that disks around T Tauri stars are generally colder and more extended with respect
to the stellar luminosity than disks around Herbig Ae stars. We find that in the innermost part of
the disks ($r \lesssim 1$~au) the silicate feature is generally weaker than in the outer parts, suggesting
that in the inner parts the dust is substantially more processed. We analyze stellar multiplicity
and find that in two systems (AB Aur and HD 72106) data suggest a new companion or asymmetric inner
disk structure. We make predictions for the observability of our objects with the upcoming MATISSE
instrument, supporting the practical preparations of future MATISSE observations of T Tauri stars.
