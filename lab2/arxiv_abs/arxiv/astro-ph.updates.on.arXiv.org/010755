In the upcoming decade large astronomical surveys will discover millions of transients raising
unprecedented data challenges in the process. Only the use of the machine learning algorithms can
process such large data volumes. Most of the discovered transients will belong to the known classes
of astronomical objects. However, it is expected that some transients will be rare or completely
new events of unknown physical nature. The task of finding them can be framed as an anomaly detection
problem. In this work, we perform for the first time an automated anomaly detection analysis in the
photometric data of the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), which serves as a proof of concept for the applicability
of these methods to future large scale surveys. The analysis consists of the following steps: 1)
data selection from the OSC and approximation of the pre-processed data with Gaussian processes,
2) dimensionality reduction, 3) searching for outliers with the use of the isolation forest algorithm,
4) expert analysis of the identified outliers. The pipeline returned 81 candidate anomalies, 27
(33%) of which were confirmed to be from astrophysically peculiar objects. Found anomalies correspond
to a selected sample of 1.4% of the initial automatically identified data sample of ~2000 objects.
Among the identified outliers we recognised superluminous supernovae, non-classical Type Ia
supernovae, unusual Type II supernovae, one active galactic nucleus and one binary microlensing
event. We also found that 16 anomalies classified as supernovae in the literature are likely to be
quasars or stars. Our proposed pipeline represents an effective strategy to guarantee we shall
not overlook exciting new science hidden in the data we fought so hard to acquire. All code and products
of this investigation are made publicly available.
