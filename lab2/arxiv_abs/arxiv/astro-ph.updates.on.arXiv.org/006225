Two potential heating scenarios have been suggested to explain coronal loop observations. One
scenario is that the loops are formed of many strands, each heated independently by a series of small-scale
impulsive heating events, or nanoflares. Another hypothesis is that the heating is quasi-steady
and highly-stratified, i.e., "footpoint heating". The goal of this paper is to identify observables
that can be used to differentiate between these two heating scenarios. For footpoint heating, we
vary the heating magnitude and stratification, for impulsive heating, we vary the heating magnitude.
We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic codes to calculate the resulting temperature and density
evolution. We convolve the temperature and density with the response functions of four EUV channels
of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and one filter channel of Hinode's X-ray Telescope. We consider
two principal diagnostics: the time lag between the appearance of the loop in two different channels,
and the ratio of the peak intensities of the loop in the two channels. We find 1) that footpoint heating
can predict longer time lags than impulsive heating in some channel pairs, 2) that footpoint heating
can predict zero or negative time lags in some channel pairs, 3) the intensity ratio expected from
impulsive heating is confined to a narrower range than footpoint heating, and 4) the range of temperatures
expected in impulsive heating is broader than the range of temperatures expected in footpoint heating.
This preliminary study identifies observables that may be useful in discriminating between heating
models in future work.
