The gamma-ray emission in broad-line blazars is generally explained as inverse Compton (IC) radiation
of relativistic electrons in the jet scattering optical-UV photons from the Broad Line Region (BLR),
the so-called BLR External Compton scenario. We test this scenario on the Fermi gamma-ray spectra
of 106 broad-line blazars detected with the highest significance or largest BLR, by looking for
cut-off signatures at high energies compatible with gamma-gamma interactions with BLR photons.
We do not find evidence for the expected BLR absorption. For 2/3 of the sources, we can exclude any
significant absorption ($\tau_{max}<1$), while for the remaining 1/3 the possible absorption
is constrained to be 1.5-2 orders of magnitude lower than expected. This result holds also dividing
the spectra in high and low-flux states, and for powerful blazars with large BLR. Only 1 object out
of 10 seems compatible with substantial attenuation ($\tau_{max}>5$). We conclude that for 9 out
of 10 objects, the jet does not interact with BLR photons. Gamma-rays seem either produced outside
the BLR most of the time, or the BLR is ~100x larger than given by reverberation mapping. This means
that i) External Compton on BLR photons is disfavoured as the main gamma-ray mechanism, vs IC on IR
photons from the torus or synchrotron self-Compton; ii) the Fermi gamma-ray spectrum is mostly
intrinsic, determined by the interaction of the particle distribution with the seed-photons spectrum;
iii) without suppression by the BLR, broad-line blazars can become copious emitters above 100 GeV,
as demonstrated by 3C454.3. We expect the CTA sky to be much richer of broad-line blazars than previously
thought.
