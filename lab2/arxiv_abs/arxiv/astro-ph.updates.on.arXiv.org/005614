The advanced rheological models of Andrade (1910) and Sundberg & Cooper (2010) are compared to the
traditional Maxwell model to understand how each affects the tidal dissipation of heat within rocky
bodies. We find both the Andrade and Sundberg-Cooper rheologies can produce at least 10$\times$
the tidal heating compared to a traditional Maxwell model for a warm (1400-1600 K) Io-like satellite.
Sundberg-Cooper can cause even larger dissipation around a critical temperature and frequency.
These models allow cooler planets to stay tidally active in the face of orbital perturbations-a
condition we term 'tidal resilience.' This has implications for the time evolution of tidally active
worlds, and the long-term equilibria they fall into. For instance, if Io's interior is better modeled
by the Andrade or Sundberg-Cooper rheologies, the number of possible resonance-forming scenarios
that still produce a hot, modern Io is expanded, and these scenarios do not require an early formation
of the Laplace resonance. The two primary empirical parameters that define the Andrade anelasticity
are examined in several phase spaces to provide guidance on how their uncertainties impact tidal
outcomes, as laboratory studies continue to constrain their real values. We provide detailed reference
tables on the fully general equations required for others to insert the Andrade and Sundberg-Cooper
models into standard tidal formulae. Lastly, we show that advanced rheologies greatly impact the
heating of short-period exoplanets and exomoons, while the properties of tidal resilience can
mean a greater number of tidally active worlds among all extrasolar systems.
