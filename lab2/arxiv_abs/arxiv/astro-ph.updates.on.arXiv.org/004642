Time delays between the multiple images of strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (gl\sneia) have the
potential to deliver precise cosmological constraints, but the effects of microlensing on the
measurement have not been studied in detail. Here we quantify the effect of microlensing on the gl\snia\
yield of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the effect of microlensing on the precision
and accuracy of time delays that can be extracted from LSST gl\sneia. Microlensing has a negligible
effect on the LSST gl\snia\ yield, but it can be increased by a factor of $\sim$2 to 930 systems using
a novel photometric identification technique based on spectral template fitting. Crucially,
the microlensing of gl\sneia\ is achromatic until 3 rest-frame weeks after the explosion, making
the early-time color curves microlensing-insensitive time delay indicators. By fitting simulated
flux and color observations of microlensed gl\sneia\ with their underlying, unlensed spectral
templates, we forecast the distribution of absolute time delay error due to microlensing for LSST,
which is unbiased at the sub-percent level and peaked at 1\% for color curve observations in the achromatic
phase, while for light curve observations it is comparable to state-of-the-art mass modeling uncertainties
(4\%). About 70\% of LSST gl\snia\ images should be discovered during the achromatic phase, indicating
that microlensing time delay uncertainties can be minimized if prompt multicolor follow-up observations
are obtained. Accounting for microlensing, the 1--2 day time delay on the recently discovered gl\snia\
iPTF16geu can be measured to 40\% precision, limiting its cosmological utility.
