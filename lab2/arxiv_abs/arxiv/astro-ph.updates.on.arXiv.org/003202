The solar wind is highly structured in fast and slow flows. These two dynamical regimes remarkably
differ not only for the average values of magnetic field and plasma parameters but also for the type
of fluctuations they transport. Fast wind is characterized by large amplitude, incompressible
fluctuations, mainly Alfv\'{e}nic, slow wind is generally populated by smaller amplitude and
less Alfv\'{e}nic fluctuations, mainly compressive. The typical corotating fast stream is characterized
by a stream interface, a fast wind region and a slower rarefaction region formed by the trailing expansion
edge of the stream. Moving {between these two regions}, from faster to slower wind, we observe the
following behavior: a) the power level of magnetic fluctuations within the inertial range largely
decreases, keeping the typical Kolmogorov scaling; b) at proton scales, for about one decade right
beyond the high frequency break, the spectral index becomes flatter and flatter towards a value
around -2.7; c) at higher frequencies, before the electron scales, the spectral index remains around
-2.7 and, {based on suitable observations available for $4$ corotating streams}, the power level
does not change, irrespective of the flow speed. All these spectral features, characteristic of
high speed streams, suggest the existence of a sort of magnetic field background spectrum. This
spectrum would be common to both faster and slower wind but, any time the observer would cross the
inner part of a fluxtube channeling the faster wind into the interplanetary space, a turbulent and
large amplitude Alfv\'{e}nic spectrum would be superposed to it.
