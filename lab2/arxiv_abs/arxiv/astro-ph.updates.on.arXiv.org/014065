We report on a study of the high-mass star formation in the the HII region W28A2 by investigating the
molecular clouds extended over ~5-10 pc from the exciting stars using the 12CO and 13CO (J=1-0) and
12CO (J=2-1) data taken by the NANTEN2 and Mopra observations. These molecular clouds consist of
three velocity components with the CO intensity peaks at V_LSR ~ -4 km s$^{-1}$, 9 km s$^{-1}$ and
16 km s$^{-1}$. The highest CO intensity is detected at V_LSR ~ 9 km s$^{-1}$, where the high-mass
stars with the spectral types of O6.5-B0.5 are embedded. We found bridging features connecting
these clouds toward the directions of the exciting sources. Comparisons of the gas distributions
with the radio continuum emission and 8 um infrared emission show spatial coincidence/anti-coincidence,
suggesting physical associations between the gas and the exciting sources. The 12CO J=2-1 to 1-0
intensity ratio shows a high value (> 0.8) toward the exciting sources for the -4 km s$^{-1}$ and +9
km s$^{-1}$ clouds, possibly due to heating by the high-mass stars, whereas the intensity ratio
at the CO intensity peak (V_LSR ~ 9 km s$^{-1}$) lowers down to ~0.6, suggesting self absorption by
the dense gas in the near side of the +9 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. We found partly complementary gas distributions
between the -4 km s$^{-1}$ and +9 km s$^{-1}$ clouds, and the -4 km s$^{-1}$ and +16 km s$^{-1}$ clouds.
The exciting sources are located toward the overlapping region in the -4 km s$^{-1}$ and +9 km s$^{-1}$
clouds. Similar gas properties are found in the Galactic massive star clusters, RCW 38 and NGC 6334,
where an early stage of cloud collision to trigger the star formation is suggested. Based on these
results, we discuss a possibility of the formation of high-mass stars in the W28A2 region triggered
by the cloud-cloud collision.
