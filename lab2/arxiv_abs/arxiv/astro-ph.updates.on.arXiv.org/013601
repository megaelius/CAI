Spectra of unevolved metal-poor halo stars uniquely reflect the elemental abundances incorporated
during the earliest Galactic epoch. Their heavy-element content is well understood as the products
of neutron capture on iron-peak elements. However, the lightest elements just past the iron peak,
with atomic number 30<Z<52, show striking abundance patterns open to several interpretations.
Understanding their nature may illuminate the diverse halo, thick disk, or extragalactic origins
of metal-poor stars. For five metal-poor dwarfs, we analyzed high-resolution echelle UV spectra
from the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, as well as archival optical echelle spectra.
The goal was to derive reliable halo dwarf abundances and uncertainties for six trans-iron elements
from UV spectra, and optical abundances for four additional trans-Fe elements and two well-understood
heavier elements. Our two independent analyses showed that the largest source of discrepancy is
UV continuum placement. Once rectified, the internal results agree to 0.2 dex for moderately-unblended,
moderately strong lines. Our results similarly agree with previous work, except where new data
and unidentified Fe I lines are important. We show that these heavily congregate blueward of 2000A
and redward of 2600A. Our exclusion of trans-Fe lines blended by such lines proved critical for arsenic.
A metallicity-dependent odd-even effect is uncovered among trans-Fe elements: an odd-Z element
abundance is depressed relative to those of adjacent even-Z elements, especially at low metallicity.
This is supported by previous studies of Sr-Y-Zr, and also appears in some theoretical calculations.
To date, no calculations predict the high Mo/Ge ratio, independent of Mo/Fe, that we find in all five
stars.
