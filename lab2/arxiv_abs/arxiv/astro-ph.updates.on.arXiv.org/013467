Glitches correspond to sudden jumps of rotation frequency ($\nu$) and its derivative ($\dot{\nu}$)
of pulsars, the origin of which remains not well understood yet, partly because the jump processes
of most glitches are not well time-resolved. There are three large glitches of the Crab pulsar, detected
in 1989, 1996 and 2017, which were found to have delayed spin-up processes before the normal recovery
processes. Here we report two additional glitches of the Crab pulsar occurred in 2004 and 2011 for
which we discovered delayed spin up processes, and present refined parameters of the largest glitch
occurred in 2017. The initial rising time of the glitch is determined as $<0.48$ hour. We also carried
out a statistical study of these five glitches with observed spin-up processes. The two glitches
occurred in 2004 and 2011 have delayed spin-up time scales ($\tau_{1}$) of $1.7\pm0.8$\,days and
$1.6\pm0.4$\,days, respectively. We find that the $\Delta{\nu}$ vs. $|\Delta{\dot\nu}|$ relation
of these five glitches is similar to those with no detected delayed spin-up process, indicating
that they are similar to the others in nature except that they have larger amplitudes. For these five
glitches, the amplitudes of the delayed spin-up process ($|\Delta{\nu}_{\rm d1}|$) and recovery
process ($\Delta{\nu}_{\rm d2}$), their time scales ($\tau_{1}$, $\tau_{2}$), and permanent
changes in spin frequency ($\Delta{\nu}_{\rm p}$) and total frequency step ($\Delta{\nu}_{\rm
g}$) have positive correlations. From these correlations, we suggest that the delayed spin-up
processes are common for all glitches, but are too short and thus difficult to be detected for most
glitches.
