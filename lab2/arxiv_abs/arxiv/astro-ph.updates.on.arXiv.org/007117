We explore and demonstrate the capabilities of LSST to study Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe).
We first fit the light curves of 58 known SLSNe at z~0.1-1.6, using an analytical magnetar spin-down
model implemented in MOSFiT. We then use the posterior distributions of the magnetar and ejecta
parameters to generate thousands of synthetic SLSN light curves, and we inject those into the OpSim
to generate realistic ugrizy light curves. We define simple, measurable metrics to quantify the
detectability and utility of the light curve, and to measure the efficiency of LSST in returning
SLSN light curves satisfying these metrics. We combine the metric efficiencies with the volumetric
rate of SLSNe to estimate the overall discovery rate of LSST, and we find that ~10^4 SLSNe per year
with >10 data points will be discovered in the WFD survey at z<3.0, while only ~15 SLSNe per year will
be discovered in each DDF at z<4.0. To evaluate the information content in the LSST data, we refit
representative output light curves with the same model that was used to generate them. We correlate
our ability to recover magnetar and ejecta parameters with the simple light curve metrics to evaluate
the most important metrics. We find that we can recover physical parameters to within 30% of their
true values from ~18% of WFD light curves. Light curves with measurements of both the rise and decline
in gri-bands, and those with at least fifty observations in all bands combined, are most information
rich, with ~30% of these light curves having recoverable physical parameters to ~30% accuracy.
WFD survey strategies which increase cadence in these bands and minimize seasonal gaps will maximize
the number of scientifically useful SLSN light curves. Finally, although the DDFs will provide
more densely sampled light curves, we expect only ~50 SLSNe with recoverable parameters in each
field in the decade-long survey.
