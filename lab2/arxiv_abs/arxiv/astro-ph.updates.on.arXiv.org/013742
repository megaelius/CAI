The emission from the relativistic jets in blazars usually outshines their host galaxies, challenging
the determination of their distances and the characterization of the stellar population. The situation
becomes more favorable in the case of the extreme blazars (EHBLs), for which the bulk of the emission
of the relativistic jets is emitted at higher energies, unveiling the optical emission from the
host galaxy. The distance determination is fundamental for the study of the intrinsic characteristics
of the blazars, especially to estimate the intrinsic gamma-ray spectra distorted due to the interaction
with the Extragalactic Background Light. In this work we report on the properties of 2WHSP~J073326.7+515354
host galaxy in the optical band, which is one of the few EHBLs detected at TeV energies. We present
the first measurement of the distance of the source, $\mathrm{z}=0.06504\pm0.00002$ (velocity
dispersion $\sigma=237 \pm 9\,\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$). We also perform a detailed study of the stellar
population of its host galaxy. We find that the mass-weighted mean stellar age is $11.72\pm0.06\,\mathrm{Gyr}$
and the mean metallicity $[M/H]=0.159 \pm 0.016$. In addition, a morphological study of the host
galaxy is also carried out. The surface brightness distribution is modelled by a composition of
a dominant classical bulge ($R_e=3.77\pm1\arcsec $ or equivalently 4.74~kpc) plus an unresolved
source which corresponds to the active nucleus. The black hole mass is estimated using both the mass
relation with the velocity dispersion and the absolute magnitude from the bulge yielding comparable
results: $(4.8\pm0.9)\times10^8\,M_{\odot}$ and $(3.7\pm1.0)\times10^8\,M_{\odot}$, respectively.
