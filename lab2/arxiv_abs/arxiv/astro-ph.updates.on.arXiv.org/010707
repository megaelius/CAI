Water ice is important for the evolution and preservation of life. Identifying the distribution
of water ice in debris disks is therefore of great interest in the field of astrobiology. Furthermore,
icy dust grains are expected to play important roles throughout the entire planet formation process.
However, currently available observations only allow deriving weak conclusions about the existence
of water ice in debris disks. We investigate whether it is feasible to detect water ice in typical
debris disk systems. We take the following ice destruction mechanisms into account: sublimation
of ice, dust production through planetesimal collisions, and photosputtering by UV-bright central
stars. We consider icy dust mixture particles with various shapes consisting of amorphous ice,
crystalline ice, astrosilicate, and vacuum inclusions. We calculated optical properties of inhomogeneous
icy dust mixtures using effective medium theories, that is, Maxwell-Garnett rules. Subsequently,
we generated synthetic debris disk observables, such as spectral energy distributions and spatially
resolved thermal reemission and scattered light intensity and polarization maps with our code
DMS. We find that the prominent $\sim$ 3 $\mu\rm{m}$ and 44 $\mu\rm{m}$ water ice features can be
potentially detected in future observations of debris disks with the James Webb Space Telescope
and the Space Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics. We show that the sublimation of
ice, collisions between planetesimals, and photosputtering caused by UV sources clearly affect
the observational appearance of debris disk systems. In addition, highly porous ice tends to produce
highly polarized radiation at around 3 $\mu\rm{m}$. Finally, the location of the ice survival line
is determined by various dust properties such as a fractional ratio of ice versus dust, physical
states of ice, and the porosity of icy grains.
