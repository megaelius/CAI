Some fast radio bursts (FRBs) are expected to be associated with the afterglow emission of gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), while a short-lived, supermassive neutron star (NS) forms during the GRBs. I investigate
the possible contributions to the dispersion measure (DM) of the FRBs from the GRB ejecta and the
wind blown from the precollapsing NS. On the one hand, sometimes an internal X-ray plateau afterglow
could be produced by the NS wind, which indicates that a great number of electron-positron pairs
are carried by the wind. If the pair-generation radius satisfies a somewhat rigorous condition,
the relativistic and dense wind would contribute a high DM to the associated FRB, which can be comparable
to and even exceed the DM contributed by the intergalactic medium. On the other hand, if the wind only
carries a Goldreich-Julian particle flux, its DM contribution would become negligible; meanwhile,
the internal plateau afterglow would not appear. Alternatively, the FRB should be associated with
a GRB afterglow produced by the GRB external shock, i.e., an energy-injection-caused shallow-decay
afterglow or a normal single-power-law afterglow if the impulsive energy release of the GRB is high
enough. In the latter case, the DM contributed by the high-mass GRB ejecta could be substantially
important, in particular, for an environment of main-sequence stellar wind. In summary, a careful
assessment on the various DM contributors could be required for the cosmological application of
the expected FRB-GRB association. The future DM measurements of GRB-associated FRBs could provide
a constraint on the physics of NS winds.
