Blazars have been proposed as efficient particle accelerators and promising neutrino sources
long before the discovery of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos. The recent report by the IceCube
Collaboration of a $\sim 3.5\sigma$ excess of $13\pm5$ neutrino events in the direction of the blazar
TXS 0506+056 during a six month-long period in 2014-2015 as well as the detection of a single high-energy
neutrino, IceCube-170922A, during a major gamma-ray flare from the same blazar in 2017, have revived
the interest in theoretical scenarios for neutrino production in blazars. We perform comprehensive
analyses on the long-term electromagnetic behavior of TXS 0506+056 using optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray
data respectively from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), the Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory (Swift), the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI), and the Fermi Large Area Telescope
(Fermi-LAT). We also perform numerical modeling of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in
four different epochs. We find that the multi-epoch SEDs are consistent with a hybrid leptonic scenario,
where the gamma-rays are produced in the blazar zone via external inverse Compton scattering of
accelerated electrons, and high-energy neutrinos are produced via the photomeson production
process of co-accelerated protons. The multi-epoch SEDs can be satisfactorily explained with
the same jet parameters and variable external photon density and electron luminosity. Using the
maximal neutrino flux derived for each epoch, we conservatively predict $\sim 0.4-2$ muon neutrinos
in ten years of IceCube observations. Our results are consistent with the IceCube-170922A detection,
which can be explained as an upper fluctuation from the average neutrino rate expected from the source,
but in strong tension with the 2014-2015 neutrino flare, thus suggesting a production site other
than the blazar zone for the latter.
