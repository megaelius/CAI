We examine the conditions under which the disks of gas and dust orbiting young gas giant planets are
sufficiently conducting to experience turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability.
By modeling the ionization and conductivity in the disk around proto-Jupiter, we find that turbulence
is possible if the X-rays emitted near the Sun reach the planet's vicinity and either (1) the gas surface
densities are in the range of the minimum-mass models constructed by augmenting Jupiter's satellites
to Solar composition, while dust is depleted from the disk atmosphere, or (2) the surface densities
are much less, and in the range of gas-starved models fed with material from the Solar nebula, but
not so low that ambipolar diffusion decouples the neutral gas from the plasma. The results lend support
to both minimum-mass and gas-starved models of the protojovian disk: (1) The dusty minimum-mass
models have negligible internal angular momentum transfer by magnetic forces, as required for
the material to remain in place while the satellites form. (2) The gas-starved models have magnetically-active
surface layers and a decoupled interior "dead zone", analogous to the Solar nebula, with the active
layers yielding accretion stresses in the range assumed in constructing the models. The results
also point to areas where both classes of models can be further developed. Non-turbulent minimum-mass
models will lose dust from their atmospheres by settling, enabling gas to accrete through a thin
surface layer. In gas-starved models the stress-to-pressure ratio should increase with radius,
likely leading to episodic accretion outbursts.
