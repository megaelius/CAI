The anisotropy parameter $\beta$ characterizes the extent to which orbits in stellar systems are
predominantly radial or tangential, and is likely to constrain, for the stellar halo of the Milky
Way, scenarios for its formation and evolution. We have measured the anisotropy $\beta$ as a function
of Galactocentric radius from $5-100$ kpc for over 8600 metal poor ([Fe/H] $<-1.3$) halo K giants
from the LAMOST catalog with line-of-sight velocities and distances, matched to proper motions
from the second $Gaia$ data release. We construct full 6-D positions and velocities for the K giants
to directly measure the 3 components of the velocity dispersion $(\sigma_r, \sigma_\theta, \sigma_\phi)$
(in spherical coordinates). We find that the orbits in the halo are radial over our full Galactocentric
distance range reaching over 100 kpc. The anisotropy remains remarkably unchanged with Galactocentric
radius from approximately 5 to 25 kpc, with an amplitude that depends on the metallicity of the stars,
dropping from $\beta \approx 0.9$ for $-1.8 \leq$ [Fe/H] $< -1.3$ (for the bulk of the stars) to $\beta
\approx 0.6$ for the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] $< -1.8$). Considering our sample as a whole,
$\beta\approx0.8$ and, beyond 25 kpc, the orbits gradually become less radial and anisotropy decreases
to $\beta<0.3$ past 100 kpc. Within 8 kpc, $\beta<0.8$. The measurement of anisotropy is affected
by substructure and streams, particularly beyond a Galactocentric distance of approximately
25 kpc, where the Sagittarius stream is prominent in the data. These results are complimentary to
recent analysis of simulations by Loebman et al. and of SDSS/$Gaia$ DR1 data by Belokurov et al.
