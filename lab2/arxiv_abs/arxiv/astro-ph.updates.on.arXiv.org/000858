We present a detailed analysis of the formation, evolution, and possible longevity of metallicity
gradients in simulated dwarf galaxies. Specifically, we investigate the role of potentially orbit-changing
processes such as radial stellar migration and dynamical heating in shaping or destroying these
gradients. We also consider the influence of the star formation density threshold, investigating
both a low and high value (0.1 amu/$cm^{3}$ - 100 amu/$cm^{3}$). The Nbody-SPH models that we use
to self-consistently form and evolve dwarf galaxies in isolation show that, in the absence of significant
angular momentum, metallicity gradients are gradually built up during the evolution of the dwarf
galaxy, by ever more centrally concentrated star formation adding to the overall gradient. Once
formed, they are robust, survive easily in the absence of external disturbances and hardly decline
over several Gyr, and they agree well with observed metallicity gradients of dwarf galaxies in the
Local Group. The underlying orbital displacement of stars is quite limited in our models, being
of the order of only fractions of the half light radius over time-spans of 5 to 10 Gyr in all star formation
schemes. This is contrary to the strong radial migration found in massive disc galaxies, caused
by scattering of stars off the corotation resonance of spiral structures. In the dwarf regime the
stellar body only seems to undergo mild dynamical heating, due to the lack of long-lived spiral structures
and/or discs. The density threshold has profound influences on the star formation mode of the models,
but only a minor influence on the evolution of metallicity gradients. Increasing the threshold
1000-fold causes comparatively stronger dynamical heating of the stellar body due to the increased
turbulence and the scattering of stars off dense gas clouds, but the effect remains very limited
in absolute terms.
