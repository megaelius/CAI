This manuscript describes the public release of the Hubble Legacy Fields (HLF) project photometric
catalog for the extended GOODS-South region from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archival program
AR-13252. The analysis is based on the version 2.0 HLF data release that now includes all ultraviolet
(UV) imaging, combining three major UV surveys. The HLF data combines over a decade worth of 7475
exposures taken in 2635 orbits totaling 6.3 Msec with the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field
Channel (ACS/WFC) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) UVIS/IR Channels in the greater GOODS-S extragalactic
field, covering all major observational efforts (e.g., GOODS, GEMS, CANDELS, ERS, UVUDF and many
other programs; see Illingworth et al 2019, in prep). The HLF GOODS-S catalogs include photometry
in 13 bandpasses from the UV (WFC3/UVIS F225W, F275W and F336W filters), optical (ACS/WFC F435W,
F606W, F775W, F814W and F850LP filters), to near-infrared (WFC3/IR F098M, F105W, F125W, F140W
and F160W filters). Such a data set makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range from high resolution mosaics that are largely contiguous.
Here, we describe a photometric analysis of 186,474 objects in the HST imaging at wavelengths 0.2--1.6$\mu$m.
We detect objects from an ultra-deep image combining the PSF-homogenized and noise-equalized
F850LP, F125W, F140W and F160W images, including Gaia astrometric corrections. SEDs were determined
by carefully taking the effects of the point-spread function in each observation into account.
All of the data presented herein are available through the HLF website (https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hlf/).
