We outline a simple procedure designed for \emph{automatically} finding sets of multiple images
in strong lensing (SL) clusters. We show that by combining (a) an arc-finding (or source extracting)
program, (b) photometric redshift measurements, and (c) a preliminary light-traces-mass lens
model, multiple-image systems can be identified in a fully automated (`blind') manner. The presented
procedure yields an assessment of the likelihood of each arc to belong to one of the multiple-image
systems, as well as the preferred redshift for the different systems. These could be then used to
automatically constrain and refine the initial lens model for an accurate mass distribution. We
apply this procedure to \emph{Cluster Lensing And Supernova with Hubble} observations of three
galaxy clusters, MACS J0329.6-0211, MACS J1720.2+3536, and MACS J1931.8-2635, comparing the
results to published SL analyses where multiple images were verified by eye on a particular basis.
In the first cluster all originally identified systems are recovered by the automated procedure,
and in the second and third clusters about half are recovered. Other known systems are not picked
up, in part due to a crude choice of parameters, ambiguous photometric redshifts, or inaccuracy
of the initial lens model. On top of real systems recovered, some false images are also mistakenly
identified by the procedure, depending on the thresholds used. While further improvements to the
procedure and a more thorough scrutinisation of its performance are warranted, the work constitutes
another important step toward fully automatising SL analyses for studying mass distributions
of large cluster samples.
