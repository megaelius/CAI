Filaments are a key step on the path that leads from molecular clouds to star formation. However,
their characteristics are heavily debated, and the exact processes that lead to their formation
and fragmentation into dense cores still remain to be fully understood. We aim at characterising
the mass, kinematics, and stability against gravitational collapse of a statistically significant
sample of filaments in the Orion B molecular cloud, which is renown for its very low star formation
efficiency. We characterise the gas column densities and kinematics over a field of 1.9 deg$^2$,
using C$^{18}$O(J=1-0) data from the IRAM-30m large programme ORION-B. Using two different Hessian-based
filters, we extract and compare two filamentary networks, each containing over 100 filaments.
Independent of the extraction method, the filaments have widths of 0.12$\pm$0.04 pc, and show a
wide range of linear (1 - 100 $M_{\odot}$pc$^{-1}$) and volume densities (2.10$^3$ - 2.10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$).
Compared to previous studies, the filament population is dominated by low-density, thermally
sub-critical structures, suggesting that most of the identified filaments are not collapsing
to form stars. In fact, only ~1% of the Orion B cloud mass covered by our observations can be found in
super-critical, star-forming filaments, explaining the low star formation efficiency of the
region. The velocity profiles observed across the filaments show quiescence in the centre, and
coherency in the plane of the sky, despite being mostly supersonic. The filaments in Orion B apparently
belong to a continuum which contains a few elements comparable to already studied star-forming
filaments as well as many lower-density, gravitationally unbound structures. This comprehensive
study of the Orion B filaments shows that the mass fraction in super-critical filaments is a key factor
in determining star formation efficiency.
