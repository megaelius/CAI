E-science of photometric data requires automatic procedures and a precise recognition of periodic
patterns to perform science as well as possible on large data. Analytical equations that enable
us to set the best constraints to properly reduce processing time and hence optimize signal searches
play a crucial role in this matter. These are increasingly important because the production of unbiased
samples from variability indices and statistical parameters has not been achievable so far. We
discuss the constraints used in periodic signals detection methods as well as the uncertainties
in the estimation of periods and amplitudes. The frequency resolution necessary to investigate
a time series is assessed with a new approach that estimates the necessary sampling resolution from
shifts on the phase diagrams for successive frequency grid points.We demonstrate the underlying
meaning of the oversampling factor. We reassess the frequency resolutions required to find the
variability periods of EA stars and use the new resolutions to analyse a small sample of EA up Catalina
stars, i.e. EA stars previously classified as having insufficient number of observations at the
eclipses. As a result, the variability periods of four EA up stars were determined. Moreover, we
have a new approach to estimate the amplitude and period variations. From these estimations information
about the intrinsic variations of the sources are obtained. For a complete characterization of
the light curve signal the period uncertainty and period variation must be determined. Constraints
on periodic signal searches were analysed and delimited.
