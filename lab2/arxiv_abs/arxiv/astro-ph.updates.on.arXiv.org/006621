Barium stars are s-process enriched giants. They owe their chemical peculiarities to a past mass
transfer phase. During which they were polluted by their binary companion, which at the time was
an AGB star, but is now an extinct white dwarf. Barium stars are thus ideal targets for understanding
and constraining the s-process in low and intermediate-mass AGB stars. We derive the abundances
of a large number of heavy elements in order to shed light on the conditions of operation of the neutron
source responsible for the production of s-elements in the former companions of the barium stars.
Adopting a recently used methodology(Neyskens et al. 2015), we analyse a sample of 18 highly enriched
barium stars observed with the high-resolution HERMES spectrograph mounted on the MERCATOR telescope
(La Palma). We determine the stellar parameters and abundances using MARCS model atmospheres.
In particular, we derive the Nb/Zr ratio which was previously shown to be a sensitive thermometer
for the s-process nucleosynthesis. Indeed, in barium stars, $^{93}Zr$ has fully decayed into mono-isotopic
$^{93}Nb$ , so Nb/Zr is a measure of the temperature-sensitive $^{93}Zr/Zr$ isotopic ratio. HD
28159, previously classified as K5III and initially selected to serve as a reference cool K star
for our abundance analysis, turns out to be enriched in s-process elements, and as such is a new barium
star. Four stars, characterised by high nitrogen abundances, also tend to have high [Nb/Zr] and
[hs/ls] ratios. The derived Zr and Nb abundances provide more accurate constraints on the s-process
neutron source, identified to be $^{13}C(alpha,n)^{16}O$ for barium stars. The comparison with
stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis models shows that the investigated barium stars were polluted
by a low-mass (2-3 Solar mass) AGB star. HD 100503 is potentially identified as the highest metallicity
CEMP-rs star yet discovered.
