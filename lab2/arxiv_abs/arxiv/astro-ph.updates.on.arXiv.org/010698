Classification of intermediate redshift ($z$ = 0.3--0.8) emission line galaxies as star-forming
galaxies, composite galaxies, active galactic nuclei (AGN), or low-ionization nuclear emission
regions (LINERs) using optical spectra alone was impossible because the lines used for standard
optical diagnostic diagrams: [NII], H$\alpha$, and [SII] are redshifted out of the observed wavelength
range. In this work, we address this problem using four supervised machine learning classification
algorithms: $k$-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector classifier (SVC), random forest (RF),
and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. For input features, we use properties that can
be measured from optical galaxy spectra out to $z < 0.8$---[OIII]/H$\beta$, [OII]/H$\beta$, [OIII]
line width, and stellar velocity dispersion---and four colors ($u-g$, $g-r$, $r-i$, and $i-z$)
corrected to $z=0.1$. The labels for the low redshift emission line galaxy training set are determined
using standard optical diagnostic diagrams. RF has the best area under curve (AUC) score for classifying
all four galaxy types, meaning highest distinguishing power. Both the AUC scores and accuracies
of the other algorithms are ordered as MLP$>$SVC$>$KNN. The classification accuracies with all
eight features (and the four spectroscopically-determined features only) are 93.4% (92.3%) for
star-forming galaxies, 69.4% (63.7%) for composite galaxies, 71.8% (67.3%) for AGNs, and 65.7%
(60.8%) for LINERs. The stacked spectrum of galaxies of the same type as determined by optical diagnostic
diagrams at low redshift and RF at intermediate redshift are broadly consistent. Our publicly available
code (https://github.com/zkdtc/MLC_ELGs) and trained models will be instrumental for classifying
emission line galaxies in upcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys.
