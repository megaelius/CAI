$\eta$ Carinae is composed of two very massive stars orbiting each other in 5.5 years. The primary
star features the densest known stellar wind, colliding with that expelled by its companion. The
wind collision region dissipates energy and accelerate particles up to relativistic energies,
producing non thermal X- and $\gamma$-ray emission detected by Beppo-SAX, INTEGRAL, Swift, Suzaku,
Agile, Fermi and H.E.S.S.. The orbital variability of the system provides key diagnostic on the
physics involved and on the emission mechanisms. The low-energy component, which cuts off below
10 GeV and varies by a factor < 2 along the orbit, is likely of inverse Compton origin. The high energy
component varies by larger factors and differently during the two periastrons observed by Fermi.
These variations match the predictions of simula- tions assuming a magnetic field in the range 0.4-1
kG at the surface of the primary star. The high-energy component and the thermal X-ray emission were
weaker than expected around the 2014 periastron suggesting a modification of the inner wind density.
Diffuse shock acceleration in the complex geometry of the wind collision zone provides a convincing
match to the observations and new diagnostic tools to probe the geometry and energetics of the system.
A future instrument sensitive in the MeV energy range could discriminate between lepto-hadronic
and hadronic models for the gamma-ray emission. At higher energies, the Cherenkov Telescope Array
will distinguish orbital modulations of the high-energy component from these of ultraviolet-TeV
photo absorption providing a wealth of information constraining acceleration physics in more
extreme conditions than found in SNR.
