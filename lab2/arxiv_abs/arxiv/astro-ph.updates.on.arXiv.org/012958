The $\lambda$ = 2.06 $\mu$m absorption band of $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$ is widely used for the remote
sensing of atmospheric carbon dioxide, making it relevant to many important top-down measurements
of carbon flux. The forward models used in the retrieval algorithms employed in these measurements
require increasingly accurate line intensity and line shape data from which absorption cross-sections
can be computed. To overcome accuracy limitations of existing line lists, we used frequency-stabilized
cavity ring-down spectroscopy to measure 39 transitions in the $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$ absorption
band. We estimate the relative combined standard uncertainty for the measured intensities to be
$u_r$ = 0.09 %, which is dominated by several type B (systematic) contributions each with $u_r$ =
0.04 %. We predicted the $J$-dependence of the measured intensities using two theoretical models:
a one-dimensional quantum mechanical model with Herman-Wallis rotation-vibration corrections,
and a line-by-line ab initio model [Zak et al. JQSRT 2016;177:31-42]. For the second approach, we
fit only a single factor to rescale the theoretical integrated band intensity to be consistent with
the measured intensities. We find that the latter approach yields an equally adequate representation
of the fitted $J$-dependent intensity data and provides the most physically general representation
of the results. Our recommended value for the integrated band intensity equal to 7.180$\times$10$^{-21}$
cm molecule$^{-1}$ $\pm$ 6$\times$10$^{-24}$ cm molecule$^{-1}$ is based on the rescaled ab initio
model and corresponds to a fitted scale factor of 1.0065 $\pm$ 0.0002. Comparisons of literature
intensity values to our results reveal systematic deviations ranging from $-$1.1 % to 0.4 %.
