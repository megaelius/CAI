The combination of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering data has the potential to simultaneously
constrain both the cosmological galaxy formation models. However, to fully exploit this potential
one needs to understand the signals as well as their joint covariance matrix. In this paper we perform
a comprehensive exploration of these ingredients, through a combination of analytic and numerical
approaches. First, we derive analytic expressions for the projected galaxy correlation function
and stacked tangential shear profile and their respective covariances. Second, we measure these
quantities from mock galaxy catalogues derived from the Millennium-XXL simulation and semi-analytic
models of galaxy formation. We find that on large scales (R>10 Mpc), the galaxy bias is roughly
linear and deterministic. On smaller scales (R < 5 Mpc) the bias is a complicated function of scale
and luminosity, determined by the different spatial distribution and abundance of satellite galaxies
present when different magnitude cuts are applied, as well as by the dependence of the mass of haloes
hosting the central galaxies on magnitude. Our theoretical model for the covariances provides
a reasonably good description of the measured ones on small and large scales. However, on intermediate
scales (1<R<10 Mpc), the predicted errors are ~2-3 times smaller, suggesting that the inclusion
of higher-order, non-Gaussian terms in the covariance will be required for further improvements.
Importantly, both our theoretical and numerical methods show that the galaxy-galaxy lensing and
clustering signals are not independent from each other, but have a non-zero cross-covariance matrix
with significant bin-to-bin correlations. Future surveys aiming to combine these probes must
take this into account in order to obtain unbiased and realistic constraints.
