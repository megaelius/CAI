It has long been known that the vertical motions of Galactic disk stars increase with stellar age,
commonly interpreted as vertical heating through orbit scattering. Here we map the vertical actions
of disk stars as a function of age ($\tau\le$ 8 Gyrs) and across a large range of Galactocentric radii,
$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$, drawing on APOGEE and Gaia data. We fit $\widehat{J_z}(\overline{R}_{\rm
GC},\tau )$ as a combination of the vertical action at birth, $\widehat{J_{z,0}}$, and subsequent
heating $\widehat{\Delta J_z}_{\, {\rm 1Gyr}}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})$ that scales as $\tau^{\gamma(\overline{R}_{\rm
GC})}$. The inferred birth temperature, $\widehat{J_{z,0}}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})$ is 1 kpc
km/s for 3 kpc < $\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ < 10 kpc, consistent with the ISM velocity dispersion; but
it rapidly rises outward, to 8 kpc km/s for $\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ = 14 kpc, likely reflecting the
stars' birth in a warped or flared gas disk. We find the heating rate $\widehat{\Delta J_z}_{\, {\rm
1Gyr}}$ to be modest and nearly constant across all radii, 1.6 kpc km/s Gyr$^{-1}$. The stellar age
dependence $\gamma$ gently grows with Galactocentric radius, from $\gamma \simeq$ 1 for $\overline{R}_{\rm
GC}\lesssim R_\odot$ to $\gamma \simeq$ 1.3 at $\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ =14 kpc. The observed $J_z
- \tau$ relation at all radii is considerably steeper ($\gamma\gtrsim$ 1) than the time dependence
theoretically expected from orbit scattering, $J_z\propto t^{0.5}$. We illustrate how this conundrum
can be resolved if we also account for the fact that at earlier epochs the scatterers were more common,
and the restoring force from the stellar disk surface mass density was low. Our analysis may re-instate
gradual orbital scattering as a plausible and viable mechanism to explain the age-dependent vertical
motions of disk stars.
