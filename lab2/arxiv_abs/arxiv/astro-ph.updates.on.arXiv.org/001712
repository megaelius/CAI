This paper introduces a kinetic code that simulates gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow emission from
the external forward shock and presents examples of some of its applications. One interesting research
topic discussed in the paper is the high-energy radiation produced by Compton scattering of the
prompt GRB photons against the shock-accelerated electrons. The difference between the forward
shock emission in a wind-type and a constant-density medium is also studied, and the emission due
to Maxwellian electron injection is compared to the case with pure power-law electrons. The code
calculates the time-evolving photon and electron distributions in the emission region by solving
the relativistic kinetic equations for each particle species. For the first time, the full relativistic
equations for synchrotron emission/absorption, Compton scattering, and pair production/annihilation
were applied to model the forward shock emission. The synchrotron self-absorption thermalization
mechanism, which shapes the low-energy end of the electron distribution, was also included in the
electron equation. The simulation results indicate that inverse Compton scattering of the prompt
GRB photons can produce a luminous TeV emission component, even when pair production in the emission
region is taken into account. This very high-energy radiation may be observable in low-redshift
GRBs. The test simulations also show that the low-energy end of a pure power-law distribution of
electrons can thermalize owing to synchrotron self-absorption in a wind-type environment, but
without an observable impact on the radiation spectrum. Moreover, a flattening in the forward shock
X-ray light curve may be expected when the electron injection function is assumed to be purely Maxwellian
instead of a power law.
