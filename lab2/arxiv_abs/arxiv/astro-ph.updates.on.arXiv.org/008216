Metallicity of local galaxies is tightly related not only to stellar mass, i.e. the Mass-Metallicity
(MZ) Relation, but also to star formation rate (SFR) through the so-called Fundamental Metallicity
Relation (FMR), with more active galaxies showing lower metallicities Z at fixed mass. Interestingly,
the relation does not evolve with redshift, with high-z galaxies up to z~2.5 following the same FMR
defined by SDSS locally. However, FMR with different shapes have been proposed for local galaxies,
and the existence of a FMR and the role of the SFR has been recently questioned by some authors, who
do not confirm the dependence of the residuals of the MZ relation on SFR in their datasets, both locally
and at high-z. In this paper we first discuss the different parameterisations of this M*-Z-SFR relation
that appeared in the literature, to understand the origin of their different shapes. We then re-analysed
data from CALIFA and SDSS-IV MaNGA surveys, which were used to suggest no dependency of metallicity
on SFR in local galaxies. Contrary to those claims, we find that those datasets are instead fully
consistent with the FMR predictions, with the expected dependency on SFR at fixed mass. Finally,
we analysed those high-z data whose consistency with the FMR was questioned. While an internal dependency
on SFR among the sub-samples is difficult to detect at high-z due to the limited dynamic range sampled
in the three parameters and to the intrinsic scatter and uncertainties of such small samples, all
these datasets are compatible with the FMR defined locally by SDSS galaxies, confirming the no evolution
of the FMR in these data up to z~2.3
