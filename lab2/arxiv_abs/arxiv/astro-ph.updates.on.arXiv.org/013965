We study nonlinear structure formation in the Bound Dark Energy model (BDE), where dark energy (DE)
corresponds to a light scalar meson particle $\phi$ dynamically formed at a condensation energy
scale $\Lambda_c$. The evolution of this dark-energy meson is determined by the potential $V(\phi)=\Lambda_c^{4+2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$,
with a distinguishing phenomenology from other quintessence scenarios. Particularly, the expansion
rate of the universe is affected not only at late times, but also when the condensation of $\phi$ occurs,
which in linear theory leads to an enhancement (with respect to standard $\Lambda$CDM) of matter
perturbations on small scales. We study how much of this signature is still present at late times
as well as the properties of dark matter halos in the nonlinear regime through N-body simulations.
Our results show that nonlinear corrections wash out this feature from the matter power spectrum
even before DE becomes dominant. There is, however, a small but clear suppression of the BDE spectrum
of $2\%$ today on the largest scales due to the distinct late-time dynamics of DE. The differences
on the clustering power between BDE and $\Lambda$CDM are reflected in the halo mass function, where
small halos are more abundant in BDE as opposed to large heavy structures, whose formation is delayed
because of the expansion history of the universe. This result is well captured by the semi-analytical
Sheth-Tormen formula. However, despite these differences, the halo concentration parameter
is essentially the same in both models, which suggest that clustering inside the halos decouple
from the general expansion once the halos form.
