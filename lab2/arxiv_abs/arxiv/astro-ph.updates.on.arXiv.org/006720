Determinations of the UV luminosity function of AGN at high redshifts are important for constraining
the AGN contribution to reionization and understanding the growth of supermassive black holes.
Recent inferences of the luminosity function suffer from inconsistencies arising from inhomogeneous
selection and analysis of AGN data. We address this problem by constructing a sample of more than
80,000 colour-selected AGN from redshift z=0 to 7.5. While this sample is composed of multiple data
sets with spectroscopic redshifts and completeness estimates, we homogenise these data sets to
identical cosmologies, intrinsic AGN spectra, and magnitude systems. Using this sample, we derive
the AGN UV luminosity function from redshift z=0 to 7.5. The luminosity function has a double power
law form at all redshifts. The break magnitude $M_*$ of the AGN luminosity function shows a steep
brightening from $M_*\sim -24$ at z=0.7 to $M_*\sim -29$ at z=6. The faint-end slope $\beta$ significantly
steepens from $-1.7$ at $z<2.2$ to $-2.4$ at $z\simeq 6$. In spite of this steepening, the contribution
of AGN to the hydrogen photoionization rate at $z\sim 6$ is subdominant (< 3%), although it can be
non-negligible (~10%) if these luminosity functions hold down to $M_{1450}=-18$. Under reasonable
assumptions, AGN can reionize HeII by redshift z=2.9. At low redshifts (z<0.5), AGN can produce
about half of the hydrogen photoionization rate inferred from the statistics of HI absorption lines
in the IGM. Our global analysis of the luminosity function also reveals important systematic errors
in the data, particularly at z=2.2--3.5, which need to be addressed and incorporated in the AGN selection
function in future in order to improve our results. We make various fitting functions, luminosity
function analysis codes, and homogenised AGN data publicly available.
