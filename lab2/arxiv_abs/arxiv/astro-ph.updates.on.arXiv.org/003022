We present an open-source retrieval code named HELIOS-Retrieval (hereafter HELIOS-R), designed
to obtain chemical abundances and temperature-pressure profiles from inverting the measured
spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres. In the current implementation, we use an exact solution of
the radiative transfer equation, in the pure absorption limit, in our forward model, which allows
us to analytically integrate over all of the outgoing rays (instead of performing Gaussian quadrature).
Two chemistry models are considered: unconstrained chemistry (where the mixing ratios are treated
as free parameters) and equilibrium chemistry (enforced via analytical formulae, where only the
elemental abundances are free parameters). The nested sampling algorithm allows us to formally
implement Occam's Razor based on a comparison of the Bayesian evidence between models. We perform
a retrieval analysis on the measured spectra of the HR 8799b, c, d and e directly imaged exoplanets.
Chemical equilibrium is disfavored by the Bayesian evidence for HR 8799b, c and d. We find supersolar
C/O, C/H and O/H values for the outer HR 8799b and c exoplanets, while the inner HR 8799d and e exoplanets
have substellar C/O, substellar C/H and superstellar O/H values. If these retrieved properties
are representative of the bulk compositions of the exoplanets, then they are inconsistent with
formation via gravitational instability (without late-time accretion) and consistent with a
core accretion scenario in which late-time accretion of ices occurred differently for the inner
and outer exoplanets. For HR 8799e, we find that spectroscopy in the K band is crucial for constraining
C/O and C/H. HELIOS-R is publicly available as part of the Exoclimes Simulation Platform (ESP; www.exoclime.org).
