We compile two samples of cluster galaxies with complimentary hydrodynamic and N-body analysis
using FLASH code to ascertain how their differing populations drive their rotational profiles
and to better understand their dynamical histories. We select our main cluster sample from the X-ray
Galaxy Clusters Database (BAX), which are populated with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies.
The BAX clusters are tested for the presence of sub-structures, acting as proxies for core mergers,
culminating in sub-samples of 8 merging and 25 non-merging galaxy clusters. An additional sample
of 12 galaxy clusters with known dumbbell components is procured using galaxy data from the NASA/IPAC
Extragalactic Database (NED) to compare against more extreme environments. BAX clusters of each
sample are stacked onto a common RA-DEC space to produce rotational profiles within the range of
$0.0 - 2.5$ $r_{200}$. Merging stacks possess stronger core rotation at $\lesssim 0.5 r_{200}$
primarily contributed by a red galaxy sub-population from relaxing core mergers, this is alongside
high rotational velocities from blue galaxy sub-populations, until, they mix and homogenise with
the red sub-populations at $\sim r_{200}$, indicative of an infalling blue galaxy sub-population
with interactive mixing between both sub-populations at $\gtrsim r_{200}$. FLASH code is utilised
to simulate the merger phase between two originally independent clusters and test the evolution
of their rotational profiles. Comparisons with the dumbbell clusters leads to the inference that
the peculiar core rotations of some dumbbell clusters are the result of the linear motions of core
galaxies relaxing onto the potential during post second infall.
