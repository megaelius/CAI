Cosmic photons can be efficiently collected by broadband intensity mapping but information on
their emission redshift and frequency is largely lost. We introduce a technique to statistically
recover these otherwise collapsed dimensions by exploiting information in spatial fluctuations
and apply it to the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) All Sky and Medium Imaging Surveys. By spatially
cross-correlating photons in the GALEX far-UV (1500A) and near-UV (2300A) bands with a million
spectroscopic objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a function of redshift, we robustly detect
the redshift-dependent intensity of the UV background (UVB) modulated by its clustering bias up
to $z\sim2$. These measurements clearly reveal the imprints of UVB spectral features redshifting
through the filters. Using a simple parameterization, we simultaneously fit a UVB emissivity and
clustering bias factor to these observations and constrain the main spectral features of the UVB
spectrum: (i) the Lyman break, (ii) the non-ionizing UV continuum, which agrees with the Haardt
& Madau model but does not rely on any assumption regarding the nature of the sources, and (iii) the
Ly$\alpha$ emission, whose luminosity density is consistent with estimates of the combined galaxy
and AGN contributions at $z\sim1$. Because the technique probes the total background including
low surface brightness emission, we place constraints on the amount of UV light originating from
the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM). Finally, the clustering bias of UV photons is found to be
chromatic and evolving. Our frequency- and redshift-dependent UVB measurement delivers a summary
statistic of the universe's net radiation output from stars, black holes, and the IGM combined.
