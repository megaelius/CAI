Spectral energy distribution and its variability are basic tools for understanding the physical
processes operating in active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this paper we report the results of a one-year
near infra red (NIR) and optical monitoring of a sample of 22 AGN known to be gamma-ray emitters, aimed
at discovering correlations between optical and gamma-ray emission. We observed our objects with
the Rapid Eye Mount (REM) telescope in J, H, K, and R bands nearly twice every month during their visibility
window and derived light curves and spectral indexes. We also analyzed the gamma-ray data from the
Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope, making weekly averages. Six sources were never detected during
our monitoring, proving to be fainter than their historical Two micron all sky survey (2MASS) level.
All of the sixteen detected sources showed marked flux density variability, while the spectral
indexes remained unchanged within our sensitivity limits. Steeper sources showed, on average,
a larger variability. From the NIR light curves we also computed a variability speed index for each
detected source. Only one source (PKS 0208-512) underwent an NIR flare during our monitoring. Half
of the sources showed a regular flux density trend on a one-year time scale, but do not show any other
peculiar characteristic. The broadband spectral index alpha_ro appears to be a good proxy of the
NIR spectral index only for BL Lac objects. No clear correlation between NIR and gamma-ray data is
evident in our data, save for PKS 0537-441, PKS 0521-360, PKS 2155-304, and PKS 1424-418. The gamma-ray/NIR
flux ratio showed a large spread, QSO being generally gamma-louder than BL Lac, with a marked correlation
with the estimated peak frequency nu_peak of the synchrotron emission.
