We present a novel method for revealing the equation of state of high-density neutron star matter
through gravitational waves emitted during the postmerger phase of a binary neutron star system.
The method relies on a small number of detections of the peak frequency in the postmerger phase for
binaries of different (relatively low) masses, in the most likely range of expected detections.
From such observations, one can construct the derivative of the peak frequency versus the binary
mass, in this mass range. Through a detailed study of binary neutron star mergers for a large sample
of equations of state, we show that one can extrapolate the above information to the highest possible
mass (the threshold mass for black hole formation in a binary neutron star merger). In turn, this
allows for an empirical determination of the maximum mass of cold, nonrotating neutron stars to
within 0.1 M_sun, while the corresponding radius is determined to within a few percent. Combining
this with the determination of the radius of cold, nonrotating neutron stars of 1.6 M_sun (to within
a few percent, as was demonstrated in Bauswein et al., PRD, 86, 063001, 2012), allows for a clear distinction
of a particular candidate equation of state among a large set of other candidates. Our method is particularly
appealing because it reveals simultaneously the moderate and very high-density parts of the equation
of state, enabling the distinction of mass-radius relations even if they are similar at typical
neutron star masses. Furthermore, our method also allows to deduce the maximum central energy density
and maximum central rest-mass density of cold, nonrotating neutron stars with an accuracy of a few
per cent.
