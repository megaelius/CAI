Meteoritic evidence shows that the Solar system at birth contained significant quantities of short-lived
radioisotopes (SLRs) such as 60Fe and 26Al (with half-lives of 2.6 and 0.7 Myr respectively) produced
in supernova explosions and in the Wolf-Rayet winds that precede them. Proposed explanations for
the high SLR abundance include formation of the Sun in a supernova-triggered collapse or in a giant
molecular cloud (GMC) that was massive enough to survive multiple supernovae (SNe) and confine
their ejecta. However, the former scenario is possible only if the Sun is a rare outlier among massive
stars, while the latter appears to be inconsistent with the observation that 26Al is distributed
with a scale height significantly larger than GMCs. In this paper, we present a high-resolution
chemo-hydrodynamical simulation of the entire Milky-Way Galaxy, including stochastic star formation,
HII regions, SNe, and element injection, that allows us to measure for the distribution of 60Fe/56Fe
and 26Al/27Al ratios over all stars in the Galaxy. We show that the Solar System's abundance ratios
are well within the normal range, but that SLRs originate neither from triggering nor from confinement
in long-lived clouds as previously conjectured. Instead, we find that SLRs are abundant in newborn
stars because star formation is correlated on galactic scales, so that ejecta preferentially enrich
atomic gas that will subsequently be accreted onto existing GMCs or will form new ones. Thus new generations
of stars preferentially form in patches of the Galaxy contaminated by previous generations of stellar
winds and supernovae.
