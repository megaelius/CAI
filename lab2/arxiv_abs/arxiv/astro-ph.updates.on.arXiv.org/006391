Using the Very Long Baseline Array, we have made astrometric observations of the binary pulsar B1913+16
spanning an 18 month period in 2014 - 2015. From these observations we make the first determination
of the annual geometric parallax of B1913+16, measuring $\pi= 0.24^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ milliarcseconds
(68% confidence interval). The inferred parallax probability distribution differs significantly
from a Gaussian. Using our parallax measurement and prior information on the spatial and luminosity
distributions of the millisecond pulsar population, we infer a distance of $d=4.1^{+2.0}_{-0.7}$
kpc, which is significantly closer than the $9.8 \pm 3.1$ kpc suggested by the pulsar's dispersion
measure and analyses of the ionized interstellar medium. While the relatively low significance
of the parallax detection ($\sim$3$\sigma$) currently precludes an improved test of general relativity
using the orbital decay of PSR B1913+16, ongoing observations with improved control of systematic
astrometric errors could reach the 10% distance uncertainty required for this goal. The proper
motion measured by our VLBI astrometry differs substantially from that obtained by pulsar timing,
a discrepancy that has also been found between the proper motion measurements made by interferometers
and pulsar timing for some other pulsars and which we speculate is the result of timing noise or dispersion
measure variations in the timing data set. Our parallax and proper motion measurements yield a transverse
velocityof $15^{+8}_{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$ in the solar reference frame. Analysis incorporating galactic
rotation and solar motion finds the space velocity of the pulsar relative to its standard of rest
has a component 22$^{+7}_{-3}$ km s$^{-1}$ perpendicular to the galactic plane and components
of order 100 km s$^{-1}$ parallel to the galactic plane.
