Emission from high-dipole moment molecules such as HCN allows determination of the density in molecular
clouds, and is often considered to trace the "dense" gas available for star formation. We assess
the importance of electron excitation in various environments. The ratio of the rate coefficients
for electrons and H$_2$ molecules, $\simeq$10$^5$ for HCN, yields the requirements for electron
excitation to be of practical importance if $n({\rm H}_2) \leq\ 10^{5.5} ~ \rm cm^{-3}$ and $X({\rm
e}^-) \geq\ 10^{-5}$, where the numerical factors reflect critical values $n_{\rm{}c}({\rm H_2})$
and $X^*({\rm{}e}^-)$. This indicates that in regions where a large fraction of carbon is ionized,
$X({\rm e}^-)$ will be large enough to make electron excitation significant. The situation is in
general similar for other "high density tracers", including HCO$^+$, CN, and CS. But there are significant
differences in the critical electron fractional abundance, $X^*({\rm e}^-)$, defined by the value
required for equal effect from collisions with H$_2$ and e$^-$. Electron excitation is, for example,
unimportant for CO and C$^+$. Electron excitation may be responsible for the surprisingly large
spatial extent of the emission from dense gas tracers in some molecular clouds (Pety et al. 2017;
Kauffmann, Goldsmith et al. 2017). The enhanced estimates for HCN abundances and HCN/CO and HCN/HCO$^+$
ratios observed in the nuclear regions of luminous galaxies may be in part a result of electron excitation
of high dipole moment tracers. The importance of electron excitation will depend on detailed models
of the chemistry, which may well be non-steady state and non-static.
