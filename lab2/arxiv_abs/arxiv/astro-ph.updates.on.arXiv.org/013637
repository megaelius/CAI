In this study, we analyze molecular gas formation in neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) clouds using the
latest CO data obtained from the four-beam receiver system on a 45-m telescope (FOREST) unbiased
Galactic plane imaging survey with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope (FUGIN) and HI data taken from the
Very Large Array (VLA) Galactic plane survey (VGPS). We applied a dendrogram algorithm to the HI
data cube to identify HI clouds, and we calculated the HI mass and molecular gas mass by summing the
CO line intensity within each HI cloud. On the basis of the results, we created a catalog of 5,737 identified
HI clouds with local standard of rest (LSR) velocity of $V_{\rm LSR}\le -20$ km s$^{-1}$ in Galactic
longitude and latitude ranges of $20^\circ \le l \le 50^\circ$ and $-1^\circ \le b \le 1^\circ$,
respectively. We found that most of the HI clouds are distributed within a Galactocentric distance
of 16 kpc, most of which are in the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) phase. In addition, we determined that
the high-mass end of the mass HI function is well fitted with the power-law function with an index
of 2.3. Although two sequences of self-gravitating and diffuse clouds are expected to appear in
the M$_{\rm tot}$-M$_{{\rm H}_2}$ diagram according to previous works based on a plane-parallel
model, the observational data show only a single sequence with large scattering within these two
sequences. This implies that most of the clouds are mixtures of these two types of clouds. Moreover,
we suggest the following scenario of molecular gas formation: An HI-dominant cloud evolved with
increasing H$_2$ mass along a path of $M_{{\rm H}_2} \propto M_{\rm tot}^2$ by collecting diffuse
gas before reaching and moving along the curves of the two sequences.
