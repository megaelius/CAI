We report the identification of an extreme proto-cluster of galaxies in the early Universe whose
core (nicknamed Distant Red Core, DRC) is formed by at least ten dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs),
confirmed to lie at $z_{\rm spec} = 4.002$ via detection of [CI](1-0), $^{12}$CO(6-5), $^{12}$CO(4-3),
$^{12}$CO(2-1) and ${\rm H_2O} (2_{11} - 2_{02})$ emission lines, detected using ALMA and ATCA.
The spectroscopically-confirmed components of the proto-cluster are distributed over a ${\rm
260\, kpc \times 310\, kpc}$ region and have a collective obscured star-formation rate (SFR) of
$\sim 6500 \, M_\odot \, {\rm yr}^{-1}$, considerably higher than has been seen before in any proto-cluster
of galaxies or over-densities of DSFGs at $z \gtrsim 4$. Most of the star formation is taking place
in luminous DSFGs since no Ly$\alpha$ emitters are detected in the proto-cluster core, apart from
a Ly$\alpha$ blob located next to one of the DRC dusty components and extending over $60\,{\rm kpc}$.
The total obscured SFR of the proto-cluster could rise to ${\rm SFR} \sim 14,400 \, M_\odot \, {\rm
yr}^{-1}$ if all the members of an over-density of bright DSFGs discovered around DRC in a wide-field
LABOCA 870-$\mu$m image are part of the same structure. The total halo mass of DRC could be as high
as $\sim 4.4 \times 10^{13}\,M_\odot$ and could be the progenitor of a Coma-like cluster at $z = 0$.
The relatively short gas-depletion times of the DRC components suggest either the presence of a
mechanism able to trigger extreme star formation simultaneously in galaxies spread over a few hundred
kpc or the presence of gas flows from the cosmic web able to sustain star formation over several hundred
million years.
