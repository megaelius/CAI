With the detection of four candidate binary black hole (BBH) mergers by the Advanced LIGO detectors
thus far, it is becoming possible to constrain the properties of the BBH merger population in order
to better understand the formation of these systems. Black hole (BH) spin orientations are one of
the cleanest discriminators of formation history, with BHs in dynamically formed binaries in dense
stellar environments expected to have spins distributed isotropically, in contrast to isolated
populations where stellar evolution is expected to induce BH spins preferentially aligned with
the orbital angular momentum. In this work we propose a simple, model-agnostic approach to characterizing
the spin properties of LIGO's BBH population. Using measurements of the effective spin of the binaries,
which is LIGO's best constrained spin parameter, we introduce a simple parameter to quantify the
fraction of the population that is isotropically distributed, regardless of the spin magnitude
distribution of the population. Once the orientation characteristics of the population have been
determined, we show how measurements of effective spin can be used to directly constrain the underlying
BH spin magnitude distribution. Although we find that the majority of the current effective spin
measurements are too small to be informative, with LIGO's four BBH candidates we find a slight preference
for an underlying population with aligned spins over one with isotropic spins (with an odds ratio
of 1.1). We argue that it will be possible to distinguish symmetric and anti-symmetric populations
at high confidence with tens of additional detections, although mixed populations may take significantly
more detections to disentangle. We also derive preliminary spin magnitude distributions for LIGO's
black holes, under the assumption of aligned or isotropic populations.
