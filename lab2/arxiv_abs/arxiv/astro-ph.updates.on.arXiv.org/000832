We have derived ages for 13 young (<30 Myr) star-forming regions and find they are up to a factor
two older than the ages typically adopted in the literature. This result has wide-ranging implications,
including that circumstellar discs survive longer (~10-12 Myr) and that the average Class I lifetime
is greater (~1 Myr) than currently believed. For each star-forming region we derived two ages from
colour-magnitude diagrams. First we fitted models of the evolution between the zero-age main-sequence
and terminal-age main-sequence to derive a homogeneous set of main-sequence ages, distances and
reddenings with statistically meaningful uncertainties. Our second age for each star-forming
region was derived by fitting pre-main-sequence stars to new semi-empirical model isochrones.
For the first time (for a set of clusters younger than 50 Myr) we find broad agreement between these
two ages, and since these are derived from two distinct mass regimes that rely on different aspects
of stellar physics, it gives us confidence in the new age scale. This agreement is largely due to our
adoption of empirical colour-Teff relations and bolometric corrections for pre-main-sequence
stars cooler than 4000 K. The revised ages for the star-forming regions in our sample are: ~2 Myr for
NGC 6611 (Eagle Nebula; M 16), IC 5146 (Cocoon Nebula), NGC 6530 (Lagoon Nebula; M 8), and NGC 2244
(Rosette Nebula); ~6 Myr for {\sigma} Ori, Cep OB3b, and IC 348; ~10 Myr for {\lambda} Ori (Collinder
69); ~11 Myr for NGC 2169; ~12 Myr for NGC 2362; ~13 Myr for NGC 7160; ~14 Myr for {\chi} Per (NGC 884);
and ~20 Myr for NGC 1960 (M 36).
