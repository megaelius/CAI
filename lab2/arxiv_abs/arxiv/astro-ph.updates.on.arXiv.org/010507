We introduce the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopy Survey (${S}^5$), an on-going program to
map the kinematics and chemistry of stellar streams in the Southern Hemisphere. The initial focus
of ${S}^5$ has been spectroscopic observations of recently identified streams within the footprint
of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), with the eventual goal of surveying streams across the entire southern
sky. Stellar streams are composed of material that has been tidally striped from dwarf galaxies
and globular clusters and hence are excellent dynamical probes of the gravitational potential
of the Milky Way, as well as providing a detailed snapshot of its accretion history. Observing with
the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope's 2-degree-Field fibre positioner and AAOmega spectrograph,
and combining the precise photometry of DES DR1 with the superb proper motions from $Gaia$ DR2, allows
us to conduct an efficient spectroscopic survey to map these stellar streams. So far ${S}^5$ has
mapped 9 DES streams and 3 streams outside of DES; the former are the first spectroscopic observations
of these recently discovered streams. In addition to the stream survey, we use spare fibres to undertake
a Milky Way halo survey and a low-redshift galaxy survey. This paper presents an overview of the ${S}^5$
program, describing the scientific motivation for the survey, target selection, observation
strategy, data reduction and survey validation. Finally, we describe early science results on
stellar streams and Milky Way halo stars drawn from the survey. Updates on ${S}^5$, including future
public data release, can be found at \url{this http URL}.
