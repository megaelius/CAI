The formation of super-Earths is strongly linked to the structure of the protoplanetary disc, which
determines growth and migration. In the pebble accretion scenario, planets grow to the pebble isolation
mass, at which the planet carves a small gap in the gas disc halting the pebble flux and thus its growth.
The pebble isolation mass scales with the disc's aspect ratio, which directly depends on the disc
structure. I compare the growth of super-Earths in viscously heated discs and discs purely heated
by the central star with super-Earth observations. This allows two formation pathways of super-Earths
to be distinguished in the inner systems. Planets growing within 1 Myr in the viscously heated inner
disc reach pebble isolation masses that correspond directly to the inferred masses of the Kepler
observations for systems that feature planets in resonance or not in resonance. However, to explain
the period ratio distribution of Kepler planets -- where most Kepler planet pairs are not in mean
motion resonance configurations -- a fraction of these resonant chains has to be broken. In case
the planets are born early in a viscously heated disc, these resonant chains thus have to be broken
without planetary mergers. If super-Earths form either late or in purely passive discs, the pebble
isolation mass is too small to explain the Kepler observations, implying that planetary mergers
are important for the final system architecture. Resonant planetary systems thus have to experience
mergers already during the gas disc phase, so the planets can get trapped in resonance after reaching
5-10 Earth masses. In case instabilities are dominating the system architecture, the systems should
not be flat with mutually inclined orbits. This implies that future observations of planetary systems
with RV and transits could distinguish between these two formation channels of super-Earth. (abridged)
