The stellar populations of intermediate-redshift galaxies can shed light onto the growth of massive
galaxies in the last 8 billion years. We perform deep, multi-object rest-frame optical spectroscopy
with IMACS/Magellan of ~70 galaxies in the E-CDFS with redshift 0.65<z<0.75, apparent magnitude
R>22.7 and stellar mass >10^{10}Msun. Following the Bayesian approach adopted for previous
low-redshift studies, we constrain the stellar mass, mean stellar age and stellar metallicity
of individual galaxies from stellar absorption features. We characterize for the first time the
dependence of stellar metallicity and age on stellar mass at z~0.7 for all galaxies and for quiescent
and star-forming galaxies separately. These relations for the whole sample have a similar shape
as the z=0.1 SDSS analog, but are shifted by -0.28 dex in age and by -0.13 dex in metallicity, at odds
with simple passive evolution. We find that no additional star formation and chemical enrichment
are required for z=0.7 quiescent galaxies to evolve into the present-day quiescent population.
However, this must be accompanied by the quenching of a fraction of z=0.7 Mstar>10^{11}Msun
star-forming galaxies with metallicities comparable to those of quiescent galaxies, thus increasing
the scatter in age without affecting the metallicity distribution. However rapid quenching of
the entire population of massive star-forming galaxies at z=0.7 would be inconsistent with the
age/metallicity--mass relation for the population as a whole and with the metallicity distribution
of star-forming galaxies only, which are on average 0.12 dex less metal-rich than their local counterparts.
This indicates chemical enrichment until the present in at least a fraction of the z=0.7 massive
star-forming galaxies.[abridged]
