Galaxies continuously reprocess their interstellar material. One can therefore expect changing
dust grain properties in galaxies which have followed different evolutionary pathways. Determining
the intrinsic dust grain mix of a galaxy helps in reconstructing its evolutionary history. Early-type
galaxies occasionally display regular dust lanes in their central regions. Due to the relatively
simple geometry and composition of their stellar bodies, these galaxies are ideal to disentangle
dust mix variations from geometric effects. We therefore model the various components of such a
galaxy (FCC 167). We reconstruct its recent history, and investigate the possible fate of the dust
lane. MUSE and ALMA observations reveal a nested ISM structure. An ionised-gas disk pervades the
central regions of FCC 167, including those occupied by the main dust lane. Inward of the dust lane,
we also find a disk/ring of cold molecular gas where stars are forming and HII regions contribute
to the ionised-gas emission. Further in, the gas ionisation points towards an active galactic nucleus
and the fuelling of a central supermassive black hole from its surrounding ionised and molecular
reservoir. Observational constraints and radiative transfer models suggest the dust and gas are
distributed in a ring-like geometry and the dust mix lacks small grains. The derived dust destruction
timescales from sputtering in hot gas are short and we conclude that the dust must be strongly self-shielding
and clumpy, or will quickly be eroded and disappear. Our findings show how detailed analysis of individual
systems can complement statistical studies of dust-lane ETGs.
