The sky-averaged (global) highly redshifted 21-cm spectrum from neutral hydrogen is expected
to appear in the VHF range of $\sim20-200$ MHz and its spectral shape and strength are determined
by the heating properties of the first stars and black holes, by the nature and duration of reionization,
and by the presence or absence of exotic physics. Measurements of the global signal would therefore
provide us with a wealth of astrophysical and cosmological knowledge. However, the signal has not
yet been detected because it must be seen through strong foregrounds weighted by a large beam, instrumental
calibration errors, and ionospheric, ground and radio-frequency-interference effects, which
we collectively refer to as "systematics". Here, we present a signal extraction method for global
signal experiments which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of "training sets" to produce
systematics basis functions specifically suited to each observation. Instead of requiring precise
absolute knowledge of the systematics, our method effectively requires precise knowledge of how
the systematics can vary. After calculating eigenmodes for the signal and systematics, we perform
a weighted least square fit of the corresponding coefficients and select the number of modes to include
by minimizing an information criterion. We compare the performance of the signal extraction when
minimizing various information criteria and find that minimizing the Deviance Information Criterion
(DIC) most consistently yields unbiased fits. The methods used here are built into our widely applicable,
publicly available Python package, $\texttt{pylinex}$, which analytically calculates constraints
on signals and systematics from given data, errors, and training sets.
