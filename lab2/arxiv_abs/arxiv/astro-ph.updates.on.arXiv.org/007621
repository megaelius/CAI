The assembly process of our Galaxy can be retrieved using the motions and chemistry of individual
stars. Chemo-dynamical studies of the nearby halo have long hinted at the presence of multiple components
such as streams, clumps, duality and correlations between the stars' chemical abundances and orbital
parameters. More recently, the analysis of two large stellar surveys have revealed the presence
of a well-populated chemical elemental abundance sequence, of two distinct sequences in the colour-magnitude
diagram, and of a prominent slightly retrograde kinematic structure all in the nearby halo, which
may trace an important accretion event experienced by the Galaxy. Here report an analysis of the
kinematics, chemistry, age and spatial distribution of stars in a relatively large volume around
the Sun that are mainly linked to two major Galactic components, the thick disk and the stellar halo.
We demonstrate that the inner halo is dominated by debris from an object which at infall was slightly
more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud, and which we refer to as Gaia-Enceladus. The stars
originating in Gaia-Enceladus cover nearly the full sky, their motions reveal the presence of streams
and slightly retrograde and elongated trajectories. Hundreds of RR Lyrae stars and thirteen globular
clusters following a consistent age-metallicity relation can be associated to Gaia-Enceladus
on the basis of their orbits. With an estimated 4:1 mass-ratio, the merger with Gaia-Enceladus must
have led to the dynamical heating of the precursor of the Galactic thick disk and therefore contributed
to the formation of this component approximately 10 Gyr ago. These findings are in line with simulations
of galaxy formation, which predict that the inner stellar halo should be dominated by debris from
just a few massive progenitors.
