The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will monitor $\sim 2$ deg$^2$ toward the Galactic
bulge in a wide ($\sim 1-2~\mu$m) W149 filter at 15-minute cadence with exposure times of $\sim$50s
for 6 seasons of 72 days each, for a total $\sim$41,000 exposures taken over $\sim$432 days, spread
over the 5-year prime mission. This will be one of the deepest exposures of the sky ever taken, reaching
a photon-noise photometric precision of 0.01 mag per exposure and collecting a total of $\sim 10^9$
photons over the course of the survey for a W149$_{\rm AB}\sim 21$ star. Of order $4 \times 10^7$ stars
will be monitored with W149$_{\rm AB}$<21, and 10$^8$ stars with W145$_{\rm AB}$<23. The WFIRST
microlensing survey will detect $\sim$54,000 microlensing events, of which roughly 1% ($\sim$500)
will be due to isolated black holes, and $\sim$3% ($\sim$1600) will be due to isolated neutron stars.
It will be sensitive to (effectively) isolated compact objects with masses as low as the mass of Pluto,
thereby enabling a measurement of the compact object mass function over 10 orders of magnitude.
Assuming photon-noise limited precision, it will detect $\sim 10^5$ transiting planets with sizes
as small as $\sim 2~R_\oplus$, perform asteroseismology of $\sim 10^6$ giant stars, measure the
proper motions to $\sim 0.3\%$ and parallaxes to $\sim 10\%$ for the $\sim 6 \times 10^6$ disk and
bulge stars in the survey area, and directly detect $\sim 5 \times 10^3$ Trans-Neptunian objects
(TNOs) with diameters down to $\sim 10$ km, as well as detect $\sim 10^3$ occulations of stars by TNOs
during the survey. All of this science will completely serendipitous, i.e., it will not require
modifications of the WFIRST optimal microlensing survey design. Allowing for some minor deviation
from the optimal design, such as monitoring the Galactic center, would enable an even broader range
of transformational science.
