With the advent of large scale surveys the manual analysis and classification of individual radio
source morphologies is rendered impossible as existing approaches do not scale. The analysis of
complex morphological features in the spatial domain is a particularly important task. Here we
discuss the challenges of transferring crowdsourced labels obtained from the Radio Galaxy Zoo
project and introduce a proper transfer mechanism via quantile random forest regression. By using
parallelized rotation and flipping invariant Kohonen-maps, image cubes of Radio Galaxy Zoo selected
galaxies formed from the FIRST radio continuum and WISE infrared all sky surveys are first projected
down to a two-dimensional embedding in an unsupervised way. This embedding can be seen as a discretised
space of shapes with the coordinates reflecting morphological features as expressed by the automatically
derived prototypes. We find that these prototypes have reconstructed physically meaningful processes
across two channel images at radio and infrared wavelengths in an unsupervised manner. In the second
step, images are compared with those prototypes to create a heat-map, which is the morphological
fingerprint of each object and the basis for transferring the user generated labels. These heat-maps
have reduced the feature space by a factor of 248 and are able to be used as the basis for subsequent
ML methods. Using an ensemble of decision trees we achieve upwards of 85.7% and 80.7% accuracy when
predicting the number of components and peaks in an image, respectively, using these heat-maps.
We also question the currently used discrete classification schema and introduce a continuous
scale that better reflects the uncertainty in transition between two classes, caused by sensitivity
and resolution limits.
