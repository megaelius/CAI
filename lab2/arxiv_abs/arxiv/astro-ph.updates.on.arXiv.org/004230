Light curves show the flux variation from the target star and its orbiting planets as a function of
time. In addition to the transit features created by the planets, the flux also includes the reflected
light component of each planet, which depends on the planetary albedo. This signal is typically
referred to as phase curve and could be easily identified if there were no additional noise. As well
as instrumental noise, stellar activity, such as spots, can create a modulation in the data, which
may be very difficult to distinguish from the planetary signal. We analyze the limitations imposed
by the stellar activity on the detection of the planetary albedo, considering the limitations imposed
by the predicted level of instrumental noise and the short duration of the observations planned
in the context of the CHEOPS mission. As initial condition, we have assumed that each star is characterized
by just one orbiting planet. We built mock light curves that included a realistic stellar activity
pattern, the reflected light component of the planet and an instrumental noise level, which we have
chosen to be at the same level as predicted for CHEOPS. We then fit these light curves to try to recover
the reflected light component, assuming the activity patterns can be modeled with a Gaussian process.We
estimate that at least one full stellar rotation is necessary to obtain a reliable detection of the
planetary albedo. This result is independent of the level of noise, but it depends on the limitation
of the Gaussian process to describe the stellar activity when the light curve time-span is shorter
than the stellar rotation. Finally, in presence of typical CHEOPS gaps in the simulations, we confirm
that it is still possible to obtain a reliable albedo.
