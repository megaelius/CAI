A new mechanism to form a magnetic pressure supported, high temperature corona above the photosphere
of an accretion disk is explored using three dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations. The thermal properties of the disk are calculated self-consistently by balancing
radiative cooling through the surfaces of the disk with heating due to dissipation of turbulence
driven by magneto-rotational instability (MRI). As has been noted in previous work, we find the
dissipation rate per unit mass increases dramatically with height above the mid-plane, in stark
contrast to the alpha-disk model which assumes this quantity is a constant. Thus, we find that in
simulations with a low surface density (and therefore a shallow photosphere), the fraction of energy
dissipated above the photosphere is significant (about 3.4% in our lowest surface density model),
and this fraction increases as surface density decreases. When a significant fraction of the accretion
energy is dissipated in the optically thin photosphere, the gas temperature increases substantially
and a high temperature, magnetic pressure supported corona is formed. The volume-averaged temperature
in the disk corona is more than 10 times larger than at the disk mid-plane. Moreover, gas temperature
in the corona is strongly anti-correlated with gas density, which implies the corona formed by MRI
turbulence is patchy. This mechanism to form an accretion disk corona may help explain the observed
relation between the spectral index and luminosity from AGNs, and the soft X-ray excess from some
AGNs. It may also be relevant to spectral state changes in X-ray binaries.
