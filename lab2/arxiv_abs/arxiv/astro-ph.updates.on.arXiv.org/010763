The extended minimum of Solar Cycle 23, the extremely quiet solar-wind conditions prevailing and
the mini-maximum of Solar Cycle 24 drew global attention and many authors have since attempted to
predict the amplitude of the upcoming Solar Cycle 25, which is predicted to be the third successive
weak cycle; it is a unique opportunity to probe the Sun during such quiet periods. Earlier work has
established a steady decline, over two decades, in solar photospheric fields at latitudes above
$45^{\circ}$ and a similar decline in solar-wind micro-turbulence levels as measured by interplanetary
scintillation (IPS) observations. However, the relation between the photospheric magnetic fields
and those in the low corona/solar-wind are not straightforward. Therefore, in the present article,
we have used potential force-free source-surface (PFSS) extrapolations to deduce global magnetic-fields
using synoptic magnetograms observed with National Solar Observatory (NSO), Kitt Peak, USA (NSO/KP)
and Solar Optical Long-term Investigation of the Sun (NSO/SOLIS) instruments during 1975-2018.
Furthermore, we have measured the normalized scintillation index [m] using the IPS observations
carried out at the Institute of Space Earth Environment Research (ISEE), Japan during 1983-2017.
From these observations, we have found that, since the mid-1990s, the magnetic-field over different
latitudes at 2.5 $\rm R_{\odot}$ and 10 $\rm R_{\odot}$(extrapolated using PFSS method) has decreased
by $\approx 11.3-22.2 \%$. In phase with the declining magnetic-fields, the quantity m also declined
by $\approx 23.6 \%$. These observations emphasize the inter-relationship among the global magnetic-field
and various turbulence parameters in the solar corona and solar wind.
