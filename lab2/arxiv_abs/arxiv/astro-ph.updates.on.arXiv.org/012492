The late stellar evolutionary phases of low and intermediate-mass stars are strongly constrained
by their mass-loss rates. The wind surrounding cool evolved stars frequently shows non-spherical
features, thought to be due to an unseen companion orbiting the donor star. We study the morphology
of the circumbinary envelope, in particular around oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars. We run a grid of 70 3D hydrodynamics simulations of a progressively accelerating wind propagating
in the Roche potential formed by a mass-loosing evolved star in orbit with a main sequence companion.
We resolve the flow structure both in the immediate vicinity of the secondary, where bow shocks,
outflows and wind-captured disks form, and up to 40 orbital separations, where spiral arms, arcs
and equatorial density enhancements develop. When the companion is deeply engulfed in the wind,
the lower terminal wind speeds and more progressive wind acceleration around oxygen-rich AGB stars
make them more prone than carbon-rich AGB stars to display more disturbed outflows, a disk-like
structure around the companion and a wind concentrated in the orbital plane. In these configurations,
a large fraction of the wind is captured by the companion which leads to a significant shrinking of
the orbit over the mass-loss timescale, if the donor star is at least a few times more massive than
its companion. Provided the companion has a mass of at least a tenth of the mass of the donor star, it
can compress the wind in the orbital plane up to large distances. Our grid of models covers a wide scope
of configurations function of the dust chemical content, the terminal wind speed relative to the
orbital speed, the extension of the dust condensation region around the cool evolved star and the
mass ratio. It provides a frame of reference to interpret high-resolution maps of the outflows surrounding
cool evolved stars.
