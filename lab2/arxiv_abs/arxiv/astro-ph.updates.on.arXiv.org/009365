This paper presents combined ${\it Spitzer}$ IRAC and ${\it Hubble}$ COS results for a double-blind
survey of 195 single and 22 wide binary white dwarfs for infrared excesses and atmospheric metals.
The selection criteria include cooling ages in the range 9 to 300 Myr, and hydrogen-rich atmospheres
so that the presence of atmospheric metals can be confidently linked to ongoing accretion from a
circumstellar disc. The entire sample has infrared photometry, whereas 168 targets have corresponding
ultraviolet spectra. Three stars with infrared excesses due to debris discs are recovered, yielding
a nominal frequency of $1.5_{-0.5}^{+1.5}$ per cent, while in stark contrast, the fraction of stars
with atmospheric metals is $45\pm4$ per cent. Thus, only one out of 30 polluted white dwarfs exhibits
an infrared excess at 3-4 $\mu$m in IRAC photometry, which reinforces the fact that atmospheric
metal pollution is the most sensitive tracer of white dwarf planetary systems. The corresponding
fraction of infrared excesses around white dwarfs with wide binary companions is consistent with
zero, using both the infrared survey data and an independent assessment of potential binarity for
well-established dusty and polluted stars. In contrast, the frequency of atmospheric pollution
among the targets in wide binaries is indistinct from apparently single stars, and moreover the
multiplicity of polluted white dwarfs in a complete and volume-limited sample is the same as for
field stars. Therefore, it appears that the delivery of planetesimal material onto white dwarfs
is ultimately not driven by stellar companions, but by the dynamics of planetary bodies.
