Recent studies suggest that ultra-short period planets (USPs), Earth-sized planets with sub-day
periods, constitute a statistically distinct sub-sample of {\it Kepler} planets: USPs have smaller
radii ($1-1.4R_\oplus$) and larger mutual inclinations with neighboring planets than nominal
{\it Kepler} planets, and their period distribution is steeper than longer-period planets. We
study a "low-eccentricity" migration scenario for the formation of USPs, in which a low-mass planet
with initial period of a few days maintains a small but finite eccentricity due to secular forcings
from exterior companion planets, and experiences orbital decay due to tidal dissipation. USP formation
in this scenario requires that the initial multi-planet system have modest eccentricities ($\gtrsim
0.1$) or angular momentum deficit. During the orbital decay of the inner-most planet, the system
can encounter several apsidal and nodal precession resonances that significantly enhance eccentricity
excitation and increase the mutual inclination between the inner planets. We develop an approximate
method based on eccentricity and inclination eigenmodes to efficiently evolve a large number of
multi-planet systems over Gyr timescales in the presence of rapid (as short as $\sim 100$~years)
secular planet-planet interactions and other short-range forces. Through a population synthesis
calculation, we demonstrate that the "low-$e$ migration" mechanism can naturally produce USPs
from the large population of {\it Kepler} multis under a variety of conditions, with little fine
tuning of parameters. This mechanism favors smaller inner planets with more massive and eccentric
companion planets, and the resulting USPs have properties that are consistent with observations.
