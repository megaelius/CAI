Time-distance helioseismology is a set of powerful tools to study features below the Sun's surface.
Inverse methods are needed to interpret time-distance measurements, with many examples in the
literature. However, techniques that utilize a more statistical approach to inferences, and broadly
used in the astronomical community, are less-commonly found in helioseismology. This article
aims to introduce a potentially powerful inversion scheme based on Bayesian probability theory
and Monte Carlo sampling that is suitable for local helioseismology. We describe the probabilistic
method and how it is conceptually different from standard inversions used in local helioseismology.
Several example calculations are carried out to compare and contrast the setup of the problems and
the results that are obtained. The examples focus on two important phenomena studied with helioseismology:
meridional circulation and supergranulation. Numerical models are used to compute synthetic
observations, providing the added benefit of knowing the solution against which the results can
be tested. For demonstration purposes, the problems are formulated in two and three dimensions,
using both ray- and Born-theoretical approaches. The results seem to indicate that the probabilistic
inversions not only find a better solution with much more realistic estimation of the uncertainties,
but they also provide a broader view of the range of solutions possible for any given model, making
the interpretation of the inversion more quantitative in nature. Unlike the progress being made
in fundamental measurement schemes in local helioseismology that image the far side of the Sun,
or have detected signatures of global Rossby waves, among many others, inversions of those measurements
have had significantly less success. Such statistical methods may help overcome some of these barriers
to move the field forward.
