Aims. R Coronae Australis (R CrA) is the brightest star of the Coronet nebula of the Corona Australis
(CrA) star forming region. It has very red colors, probably due to dust absorption and it is strongly
variable. High contrast instruments allow for an unprecedented direct exploration of the immediate
circumstellar environment of this star. Methods. We observed R CrA with the near-IR channels (IFS
and IRDIS) of SPHERE at VLT. In this paper, we used four different epochs, three of them from open time
observations while one is from the SPHERE guaranteed time. The data were reduced using the DRH pipeline
and the SPHERE Data Center. On the reduced data we implemented custom IDL routines with the aim to
subtract the speckle halo.We have also obtained pupil-tracking H-band (1.45-1.85 micron) observations
with the VLT/SINFONI near-infrared medium-resolution (R~3000) spectrograph. Results. A companion
was found at a separation of 0.156" from the star in the first epoch and increasing to 0.18400 in the
final one. Furthermore, several extended structures were found around the star, the most noteworthy
of which is a very bright jet-like structure North-East from the star. The astrometric measurements
of the companion in the four epochs confirm that it is gravitationally bound to the star. The SPHERE
photometry and the SINFONI spectrum, once corrected for extinction, point toward an early M spectral
type object with a mass between 0.3 and 0.55 M?. The astrometric analyis provides constraints on
the orbit paramenters: e~0.4, semi-major axis at 27-28 au, inclination of ~ 70{\deg} and a period
larger than 30 years. We were also able to put constraints of few MJup on the mass of possible other
companions down to separations of few tens of au.
