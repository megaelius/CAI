We report molecular line and dust continuum observations toward the high-mass star forming region
G331.5-0.1, one of the most luminous regions of massive star-formation in the Milky Way, located
at the tangent region of the Norma spiral arm, at a distance of 7.5 kpc. Molecular emission was mapped
toward the G331.5-0.1 GMC in the CO (J=1-0) and C18O (J=1-0) lines with NANTEN, while its central
region was mapped in CS (J=2-1 and J=5-4) with SEST, and in CS (J=7-6) and 13CO (J=3-2) with ASTE. Continuum
emission mapped at 1.2 mm with SIMBA and at 0.87 mm with LABOCA reveal the presence of six compact and
luminous dust clumps, making this source one of the most densely populated central regions of a GMC
in the Galaxy. The dust clumps are associated with molecular gas and they have the following average
properties: size of 1.6 pc, mass of 3.2x10^3 Msun, molecular hydrogen density of 3.7x10^4 cm^{-3},
dust temperature of 32 K, and integrated luminosity of 5.7x10^5 Lsun, consistent with values found
toward other massive star forming dust clumps. The CS and 13CO spectra show the presence of two velocity
components: a high-velocity component at ~ -89 km s^{-1}, seen toward four of the clumps, and a low-velocity
component at ~ -101 km s^{-1} seen toward the other two clumps. Radio continuum emission is present
toward four of the molecular clumps, with spectral index estimated for two of them of 0.8+-0.2 and
1.2+-0.2. A high-velocity molecular outflow is found at the center of the brightest clump, with
a line width of 26 km s^{-1} (FWHM) in CS (J=7-6). Observations of SiO (J=7-6 and J=8-7), and SO (J_K=8_8-7_7
and J_K=8_7-7_6) lines provide estimates of the gas rotational temperature toward this outflow
>120 K and >75 K, respectively.
