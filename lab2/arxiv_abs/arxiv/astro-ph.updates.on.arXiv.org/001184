Absorption-line spectroscopy of multiply-lensed QSOs near a known foreground galaxy provides
a unique opportunity to go beyond the traditional one-dimensional application of QSO probes and
establish a crude three-dimensional (3D) map of halo gas around the galaxy that records the line-of-sight
velocity field at different locations in the gaseous halo. Two intermediate-redshift galaxies
are targeted in the field around the quadruply-lensed QSO HE0435-1223 at redshift z=1.689, and
absorption spectroscopy along each of the lensed QSOs is carried out in the vicinities of these galaxies.
One galaxy is a typical, star-forming L* galaxy at z=0.4188 and projected distance of rho=50 kpc
from the lensing galaxy. The other is a super-L* barred spiral at z=0.7818 and rho=33 kpc. Combining
known orientations of the quadruply-lensed QSO to the two foreground galaxies with the observed
MgII absorption profiles along individual QSO sightlines has for the first time led to spatially
resolved kinematics of tenuous halo gas on scales of 5-10 kpc at z>0.2. A MgII absorber is detected
in every sightline observed through the halos of the two galaxies, and the recorded absorber strength
is typical of what is seen in previous close QSO--galaxy pair studies. While the multi-sightline
study confirms the unity covering fraction of MgII absorbing gas at rho < 50 kpc from star-forming
disks, the galaxies also present two contrasting examples of complex halo gas kinematics. Different
models, including a rotating disk, collimated outflows, and gaseous streams from either accretion
or tidal/ram-pressure stripping, are considered for comparisons with the absorption-line observations,
and infalling streams/stripped gas of width >~ 10 kpc are found to best describe the observed
gas kinematics across multiple sightlines.
