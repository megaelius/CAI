We present high angular resolution multi-wavelength data of the 3C 298 radio-loud quasar host galaxy
(z=1.439) taken using the W.M. Keck Observatory OSIRIS integral field spectrograph with adaptive
optics, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3,
and the Very Large Array (VLA). Extended emission is detected in the rest-frame optical nebular
emission lines H$\beta$, [OIII], H$\alpha$, [NII], and [SII], as well as molecular lines CO (J=3-2)
and (J=5-4). Along the path of 3C 298's relativistic jets we detect conical outflows of ionized gas
with velocities up to 1700 km s$^{-1}$ and outflow rate of 450-1500 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. Near the
spatial center of the conical outflow, CO (J=3-2) emission shows a molecular gas disc with a total
molecular mass ($\rm M_{H_{2}}$) of 6.6$\pm0.36\times10^{9}$M$_{\odot}$. On the molecular
disc's blueshifted side we observe a molecular outflow with a rate of 2300 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and
depletion time scale of 3 Myr. We detect no narrow H$\alpha$ emission in the outflow regions, suggesting
a limit on star formation of 0.3 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$. Quasar driven winds are evacuating
the molecular gas reservoir thereby directly impacting star formation in the host galaxy. The observed
mass of the supermassive black hole is $10^{9.37-9.56}$M$_{\odot}$ and we determine a dynamical
bulge mass of 1-1.7$\rm\times10^{10}\frac{R}{1.6 kpc}$ M$_{\odot}$. The bulge mass of 3C 298
resides 2-2.5 orders of magnitude below the expected value from the local M$\rm_{bulge}-M_{BH}$
relationship. A second galactic disc observed in nebular emission is offset from the quasar by 9
kpc suggesting the system is an intermediate stage merger. These results show that galactic scale
negative feedback is occurring early in the merger phase of 3C 298, well before the coalescence of
the galactic nuclei and assembly on the local relationship.
