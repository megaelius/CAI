We present the jet kinematics of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 4C +21.35 using time-resolved
KaVA very long baseline interferometry array radio maps obtained from September 2014 to July 2016.
During two out of three observing campaigns, observations were performed bi-weekly at 22 and 43
GHz quasi-simultaneously. At 22 GHz, we identified three jet components near the core with apparent
speeds up to (14.4+/-2.1)c. The timing of the ejection of a new component detected in 2016 is consistent
with a gamma-ray flare in November 2014. At 43 GHz, we found four inner jet (<3 mas) components with
speeds from (3.5+/-1.4)c to (6.8+/-1.5)c. Jet component speeds tend to be higher with increasing
distances from the core. We compared our data with archival Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data
from the Boston University (BU) 43 GHz and the Monitoring Of Jets in Active galactic nuclei with VLBA
Experiments (MOJAVE) 15.4 GHz monitoring programs. Whereas MOJAVE data and our data are in good
agreement, jet speeds obtained from the BU Program data in the same time period are about twice as
high as the ones we obtain from the KaVA data. The discrepancy at 43 GHz indicates that radio arrays
with different angular resolution identify and trace different jet features even when the data
are obtained at the same frequency and at the same time. The flux densities of jet components decay
exponentially, in agreement with a synchrotron cooling time scale of about 1 year. Using known electron
Lorentz factor values (about 9,000), we estimate the magnetic field strength to be around 1-3 micro-Tesla.
When adopting a jet viewing angle of 5 degrees, the intrinsic jet speed is of order 0.99c.
