The flux, spectrum and angular distribution of the excess neutrino signal detected by IceCube between
50TeV and 2PeV are inconsistent with those expected for Galactic sources. The coincidence of the
excess, $E_\nu^2\Phi_\nu=3.6\pm1.2\times10^{-8}(GeV/ cm^2 sr s)$, with the Waxman-Bahcall
(WB) bound, $E_\nu^2\Phi_{WB}=3.4\times10^{-8}(GeV/cm^2 sr s)$, is probably a clue to the origin
of IceCube's neutrinos. The most natural explanation of this coincidence is that both the neutrino
excess and the ultra-high energy, $>10^{19}$ eV, cosmic-ray (UHECR) flux are produced by the
same population of cosmologically distributed sources, producing CRs, likely protons, at a similar
rate, $E^2 dQ/dE=0.5\times10^{44}(erg/Mpc^3yr)$ (at z=0), across a wide range of energies, from
$10^{15}$ eV to $>10^{20}$ eV, and residing in environments (such as starburst galaxies) in
which CRs of rigidity $E/Z< 10^{17}$ eV lose much of their energy to pion production. Identification
of the neutrino sources will allow one to identify the UHECR accelerators, to resolve open questions
related to the accelerator models, and to study neutrino properties (related e.g. to flavor oscillations
and coupling to gravity) with an accuracy many orders of magnitude better than is currently possible.
The most promising method for identifying the sources is by association of a neutrino with an electromagnetic
signal accompanying a transient event responsible for its generation. The neutrino flux that is
produced within the sources, and that may thus be directly associated with transient events, may
be significantly lower than the total observed neutrino flux, which may be dominated by neutrino
production at the environment in which the sources reside.
