The distribution of Helium in the intracluster medium (ICM) permeating galaxy clusters is not well
constrained due to the very high plasma temperature. Therefore, the plasma is often assumed to be
homogeneous. A non-uniform Helium distribution can however lead to biases when measuring key cluster
parameters. This has motivated one-dimensional models that evolve the ICM composition assuming
that the effects of magnetic fields can be parameterized or ignored. Such models for non-isothermal
clusters show that Helium can sediment in the cluster core leading to a peak in concentration offset
from the cluster center. The resulting profiles have recently been shown to be linearly unstable
when the weakly-collisional character of the magnetized plasma is considered. In this paper, we
present a modified version of the MHD code Athena, which makes it possible to evolve a weakly-collisional
plasma subject to a gravitational field and stratified in both temperature and composition. We
thoroughly test our implementation and confirm excellent agreement against several analytical
results. In order to isolate the effects of composition, in this initial study we focus our attention
on isothermal plasmas. We show that plasma instabilities, feeding off gradients in composition,
can induce turbulent mixing and saturate by re-arranging magnetic field lines and alleviating
the composition gradient. Composition profiles that increase with radius lead to instabilities
that saturate by driving the average magnetic field inclination to roughly $45^{\circ}$. We speculate
that this effect may alleviate the core insulation observed in homogeneous settings, with potential
consequences for the associated cooling flow problem.
