Super-Eddington accretion onto massive black hole seeds may be commonplace in the early Universe,
where the conditions exist for rapid accretion. Direct collapse black holes are often invoked as
a possible solution to the observation of super massive black holes (SMBHs) in the pre-reionisation
Universe. We investigate here how feedback, mainly in the form of bipolar jets, from super-Eddington
accreting seed black holes will affect their subsequent growth. We find that, nearly independent
of the mass loading of the bipolar jets, the violent outflows generated by the jets evacuate a region
of approximately 0.1 pc surrounding the black hole seed. However, the jet outflows are unable to
break free of the halo and their impact is limited to the immediate vicinity of the black hole. The
outflows suppress any accretion for approximately a dynamical time. The gas then cools, recombines
and falls back to the centre where high accretion rates are again observed. The overall effect is
to create an effective accretion rate with values of between 0.1 and 0.5 times the Eddington rate.
If this episodic accretion rate is maintained for order 500 million years then the black hole will
increase in mass by a factor of between 3 and 300 but far short of the factor of $10^4$ required for the
seeds to become the SMBHs observed at $z>6$. Therefore, direct collapse black holes born into atomic
cooling haloes and which experience strong negative mechanical feedback will require external
influences (e.g. rapid major mergers with other haloes) to promote efficient accretion and reach
SMBH masses within a few hundred million years.
