We model the late evolution and mass loss history of rapidly rotating Wolf-Rayet stars in the mass
range $5\,\rm{M}_{\odot}\dots 100\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$. We find that quasi-chemically homogeneously
evolving single stars computed with enhanced mixing retain very little or no helium and are compatible
with Type\,Ic supernovae. The more efficient removal of core angular momentum and the expected
smaller compact object mass in our lower mass models lead to core spins in the range suggested for
magnetar driven superluminous supernovae. Our more massive models retain larger specific core
angular momenta, expected for long-duration gamma-ray bursts in the collapsar scenario. Due to
the absence of a significant He envelope, the rapidly increasing neutrino emission after core helium
exhaustion leads to an accelerated contraction of the whole star, inducing a strong spin-up, and
centrifugally driven mass loss at rates of up to $10^{-2}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}~\rm{yr^{-1}}$ in the
last years to decades before core collapse. Since the angular momentum transport in our lower mass
models enhances the envelope spin-up, they show the largest relative amounts of centrifugally
enforced mass loss, i.e., up to 25\% of the expected ejecta mass. Our most massive models evolve into
the pulsational pair-instability regime. We would thus expect signatures of interaction with
a C/O-rich circumstellar medium for Type~Ic superluminous supernovae with ejecta masses below
$\sim 10\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and for the most massive engine-driven explosions with ejecta masses
above $\sim 30\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$. Signs of such interaction should be observable at early epochs
of the supernova explosion, and may be related to bumps observed in the light curves of superluminous
supernovae, or to the massive circumstellar CO-shell proposed for Type~Ic superluminous supernova
