We propose a new, likelihood-free approach to inferring the primordial matter power spectrum and
cosmological parameters from arbitrarily complex forward models of galaxy surveys where all relevant
statistics can be determined from numerical simulations, i.e. black-boxes. Our approach, which
we call simulator expansion for likelihood-free inference (SELFI), builds upon approximate Bayesian
computation using a novel effective likelihood, and upon the linearisation of black-box models
around an expansion point. Consequently, we obtain simple "filter equations" for an effective
posterior of the primordial power spectrum, and a straightforward scheme for cosmological parameter
inference. We demonstrate that the workload is computationally tractable, fixed a priori, and
perfectly parallel. As a proof of concept, we apply our framework to a realistic synthetic galaxy
survey, with a data model accounting for physical structure formation and incomplete and noisy
galaxy observations. In doing so, we show that the use of non-linear numerical models allows the
galaxy power spectrum to be safely fitted up to at least $k_\mathrm{max} = 0.5$ $h$/Mpc, outperforming
state-of-the-art backward-modelling techniques by a factor of $\sim 5$ in the number of modes used.
The result is an unbiased inference of the primordial matter power spectrum across the entire range
of scales considered, including a high-fidelity reconstruction of baryon acoustic oscillations.
It translates into an unbiased and robust inference of cosmological parameters. Our results pave
the path towards easy applications of likelihood-free simulation-based inference in cosmology.
