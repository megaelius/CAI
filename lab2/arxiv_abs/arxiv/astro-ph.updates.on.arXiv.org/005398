We present a statistical analysis of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) imaged by the Heliospheric Imager
(HI) instruments aboard NASAs twin-spacecraft STEREO mission between April 2007 and August 2017
for STEREO-A and between April 2007 and September 2014 for STEREO-B. The analysis exploits a catalogue
that was generated within the FP7 HELCATS project. Here, we focus on the observational characteristics
of CMEs imaged in the heliosphere by the inner (HI-1) cameras. More specifically, in this paper we
present distributions of the basic observational parameters - namely occurrence frequency, central
position angle (PA) and PA span - derived from nearly 2000 detections of CMEs in the heliosphere by
HI-1 on STEREO-A or STEREO-B from the minimum between Solar Cycles 23 and 24 to the maximum of Cycle
24; STEREO-A analysis includes a further 158 CME detections from the descending phase of Cycle 24,
by which time communication with STEREO-B had been lost. We compare heliospheric CME characteristics
with properties of CMEs observed at coronal altitudes, and with sunspot number. As expected, heliospheric
CME rates correlate with sunspot number, and are not inconsistent with coronal rates once instrumental
factors/differences in cataloguing philosophy are considered. As well as being more abundant,
heliospheric CMEs, like their coronal counterparts, tend to be wider during solar maximum. Our
results confirm previous coronagraph analyses suggesting that CME launch sites don't simply migrate
to higher latitudes with increasing solar activity. At solar minimum, CMEs tend to be launched from
equatorial latitudes while, at maximum, CMEs appear to be launched over a much wider latitude range;
this has implications for understanding the CME/solar source association. Our analysis provides
some supporting evidence for the systematic dragging of CMEs to lower latitude as they propagate
outwards.
