Based on Hubble Space Telescope observations from the Local Cosmology from Isolated Dwarfs project,
we present the star formation histories, as a function of galactocentric radius, of four isolated
Local Group dwarf galaxies: two dSph galaxies, Cetus and Tucana, and two transition galaxies (dTrs),
LGS-3 and Phoenix. The oldest stellar populations of the dSphs and dTrs are, within the uncertainties,
coeval ($\sim 13 Gyr$) at all galactocentric radii. We find that there are no significative differences
between the four galaxies in the fundamental properties (such as the normalized star formation
rate or age-metallicity relation) of their outer regions (radii greater than four exponential
scale lengths); at large radii, these galaxies consist exclusively of old ($\geq 10.5 Gyr$) metal-poor
stars. The duration of star formation in the inner regions vary from galaxy to galaxy, and the extended
central star formation in the dTrs produces the dichotomy between dSph and dTr galaxy types. The
dTr galaxies show prominent radial stellar population gradients: the centers of these galaxies
host young ($\leq 1 Gyr$) populations while the age of the last formation event increases smoothly
with increasing radius. This contrasts with the two dSph galaxies. Tucana shows a similar, but milder,
gradient, but no gradient in age is detected Cetus. For the three galaxies with significant stellar
population gradients, the exponential scale length decreases with time. These results are in agreement
with outside-in scenarios of dwarf galaxy evolution, in which a quenching of the star formation
toward the center occurs as the galaxy runs out of gas in the outskirts.
