In the colliding-wind region of massive binaries, non-thermal radio emission occurs. This non-thermal
radio emission (due to synchrotron radiation) has so far been observed at centimetre wavelengths.
At millimetre wavelengths, the stellar winds and the colliding-wind region emit more thermal free-free
radiation, and it is expected that any non-thermal contribution will be difficult or impossible
to detect. We aim to determine if the material in the colliding-wind region contributes substantially
to the observed millimetre fluxes of a colliding-wind binary. We also try to distinguish the synchrotron
emission from the free-free emission. We monitored the massive binary Cyg OB2 #8A at 3 mm with the
NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer of the Institut de Radioastronomie
Millimetrique (IRAM). The data were collected in 14 separate observing runs (in 2014 and 2016),
and provide good coverage of the orbital period. The observed millimetre fluxes range between 1.1
and 2.3 mJy, and show phase-locked variability, clearly indicating that a large part of the emission
is due to the colliding-wind region. A simple synchrotron model gives fluxes with the correct order
of magnitude, but with a maximum that is phase-shifted with respect to the observations. Qualitatively
this phase shift can be explained by our neglect of orbital motion on the shape of the colliding-wind
region. A model using only free-free emission results in only a slightly worse explanation of the
observations. Additionally, on the map of our observations we also detect the O6.5 III star Cyg OB2
#8B, for which we determine a 3 mm flux of 0.21 +- 0.033 mJy. The question of whether synchrotron radiation
or free-free emission dominates the millimetre fluxes of Cyg OB2 #8A remains open. More detailed
modelling of this system, based on solving the hydrodynamical equations, is required to give a definite
answer.
