We present Spitzer Space Telescope time-series photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m of 2MASS J11193254$-$1137466AB
and WISEA J114724.10$-$204021.3, two planetary-mass, late-type ($\sim$L7) brown dwarf members
of the $\sim$10 Myr old TW Hya Association. These observations were taken in order to investigate
whether or not a tentative trend of increasing variability amplitude with decreasing surface gravity
seen for L3-L5.5 dwarfs extends to later-L spectral types and to explore the angular momentum evolution
of low-mass objects. We examine each light curve for variability and find a rotation period of 19.39$^{+0.33}_{-0.28}$
hours and semi-amplitudes of 0.798$^{+0.081}_{-0.083}$% at 3.6 $\mu$m and 1.108$^{+0.093}_{-0.094}$%
at 4.5 $\mu$m for WISEA J114724.10$-$204021.3. For 2MASS J11193254$-$1137466AB, we find a single
period of 3.02$^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ hours with semi-amplitudes of 0.230$^{+0.036}_{-0.035}$%
at 3.6 $\mu$m and 0.453 $\pm$ 0.037% at 4.5 $\mu$m, which we find is possibly due to the rotation of
one component of the binary. Combining our results with 12 other late-type L dwarfs observed with
Spitzer from the literature, we find no significant differences between the 3.6 $\mu$m amplitudes
of low surface gravity and field gravity late-type L brown dwarfs at Spitzer wavelengths, and find
tentative evidence (75% confidence) of higher amplitude variability at 4.5 $\mu$m for young, late-type
Ls. We also find a median rotation period of young brown dwarfs (10-300 Myr) of $\sim$10 hr, more than
twice the value of the median rotation period of field age brown dwarfs ($\sim$4 hr), a clear signature
of brown dwarf rotational evolution.
