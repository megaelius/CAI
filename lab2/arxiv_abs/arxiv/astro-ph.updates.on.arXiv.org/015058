We present nebular spectra of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2019yvq, which had a bright flash of
blue and ultraviolet light after exploding, followed by a rise similar to other SNe Ia. Although
SN 2019yvq displayed several other rare characteristics such as persistent high ejecta velocity
near peak brightness, it was not especially peculiar and if the early "excess" emission were not
observed, it would likely be included in cosmological samples. The excess flux can be explained
by several different physical models linked to the details of the progenitor system and explosion
mechanism. Each has unique predictions for the optically thin emission at late times. In our nebular
spectra, we detect strong [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291, 7324 and Ca NIR triplet emission, consistent
with a double-detonation explosion. We do not detect H, He, or [O I] emission, predictions for some
single-degenerate progenitor systems and violent white dwarf mergers. The amount of swept-up
H or He is <2.8 x 10^-4 and 2.4 x 10^-4 Msun, respectively. Aside from strong Ca emission, the SN 2019yvq
nebular spectrum is similar to those of typical SNe Ia with the same light-curve shape. Comparing
to double-detonation models, we find that the Ca emission is consistent with a model with a total
progenitor mass of 1.15 Msun. However, we note that a lower progenitor mass better explains the early
light-curve and peak luminosity. The unique properties of SN 2019yvq suggest that thick He-shell
double-detonations only account for $1.1^{+2.1}_{-1.1}\%$ of the total "normal" SN Ia rate. SN
2019yvq is one of the best examples yet that multiple progenitor channels appear necessary to reproduce
the full diversity of "normal" SNe Ia.
