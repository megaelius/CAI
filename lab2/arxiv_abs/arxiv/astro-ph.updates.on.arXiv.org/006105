The structure of a thermonuclear detonation wave can be solved accurately and, thus, may serve as
a testbed for studying different approximations that are included in multi-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations of supernova. We present the structure of thermonuclear detonations for the equal
mass fraction of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O (CO) and for pure $^{4}$He (He) over a wide range of upstream
plasma conditions. The lists of isotopes we constructed allow us to determine the detonation speeds,
as well as the final states for these detonations, with an uncertainty of the percent level (obtained
here for the first time). We provide our results with a numerical accuracy of $\sim0.1\%$, which
provides an efficient benchmark for future studies. We further show that CO detonations are pathological
for all upstream density values, which differs from previous studies, which concluded that for
low upstream densities CO detonations are of the Chapman-Jouget (CJ) type. We postulate that these
claims were probably due to low numerical accuracy. We provide an approximate condition, independent
of reaction rates, that allows to estimate whether arbitrary upstream values will support a detonation
wave of the CJ type. Using this argument, we are able to show that CO detonations are pathological
and to verify that He detonations are of the CJ type, as was previously claimed for He. Our analysis
of the reactions that control the approach to nuclear statistical equilibrium, which determines
the length scale of this stage, reveals that at high densities, the reactions $^{11}$B$+p\leftrightarrow3^{4}$He
plays a significant role, which was previously unknown. We also demonstrate that the study of thermonuclear
detonation waves is very efficient in exposing numerical bugs, and report on dozens of numerical
bugs in the \textit{Helmholtz} equation of state and in the MESA code, some of them quite severe.
