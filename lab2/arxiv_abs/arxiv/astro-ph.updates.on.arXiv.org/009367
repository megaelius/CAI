Davies et al. (2019) established that for L^* galaxies the fraction of baryons in the circumgalactic
medium (CGM) is inversely correlated with the mass of their central supermassive black holes (BHs)
in the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulation. The interpretation is that, over time, a more massive BH has
provided more energy to transport baryons beyond the virial radius, which additionally reduces
gas accretion and star formation. We continue this research by focusing on the relationship between
the 1) BH masses, 2) physical and observational properties of the CGM, and 3) galaxy colours for Milky
Way-mass systems. The ratio of the cumulative BH feedback energy over the gaseous halo binding energy
is a strong predictor of the CGM gas content, with BHs injecting >~10x the binding energy resulting
in gas-poor haloes. Observable tracers of the CGM, including CIV, OVI, and HI absorption line measurements,
are found to be effective tracers of the total z~0 CGM halo mass. We use high-cadence simulation outputs
to demonstrate that BH feedback pushes baryons beyond the virial radius within 100 Myr timescales,
but that CGM metal tracers take longer (0.5-2.5 Gyr) to respond. Secular evolution of galaxies results
in blue, star-forming or red, passive populations depending on the cumulative feedback from BHs.
The reddest quartile of galaxies with M_*=10^{10.2-10.7} M_solar (median u-r = 2.28) has a CGM mass
that is 2.5x lower than the bluest quartile (u-r=1.59). We propose strategies for observing the
predicted lower CGM column densities and covering fractions around galaxies hosting more massive
BHs using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on Hubble.
