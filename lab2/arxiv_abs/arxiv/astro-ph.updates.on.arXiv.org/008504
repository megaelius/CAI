Strong lensing provides a powerful means of investigating the nature of dark matter as it probes
the mass function and density profiles of halos on sub-galactic scales. We present an extension
of a forward modeling framework that uses flux ratios from quadruply imaged quasars (quads) to measure
the shape and amplitude of the halo mass function, including line of sight (LOS) halos and main deflector
subhalos. We apply this machinery to 50 mock lenses --- roughly the number of known quads --- with
mass functions exhibiting a free-streaming cutoff parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$.
Assuming cold dark matter (CDM), we forecast bounds on $m_{\rm{hm}}$ and the corresponding thermal
relic particle masses for scenarios with a range of tidal destruction severity. With significant
tidal destruction, at $2 \sigma$ we constrain $m_{\rm{hm}}<10^{7.9} \left(10^{8.4}\right)
M_{\odot}$, or a 4.4 (3.1) keV thermal relic, with image flux uncertainties from measurements and
lens modeling of $2\% \left(6\%\right)$. With less severe tidal destruction we constrain $m_{\rm{hm}}<10^{7}
\left(10^{7.4}\right) M_{\odot}$, or an 8.2 (6.2) keV thermal relic. If dark matter is warm, with
$m_{\rm{hm}} = 10^{7.7} M_{\odot}$ (5.1 keV), we would favor WDM with $m_{\rm{hm}} > 10^{7.7} M_{\odot}$
over CDM with relative likelihoods of 22:1 and 8:1 with flux uncertainties of $2\%$ and $6\%$, respectively.
These bounds improve over those obtained by modeling only main deflector subhalos because LOS objects
produce additional flux perturbations, especially for high redshift systems. These results indicate
that $\sim 50$ quads can conclusively differentiate between warm and cold dark matter.
