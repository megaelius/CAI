The article is dedicated to one of the most undeservedly overlooked properties of the cosmological
models: the behaviour at, near and due to a jump discontinuity. It is most interesting that while
the usual considerations of the cosmological dynamics deals heavily in the singularities produced
by the discontinuities of the second kind (a.k.a. the essential discontinuities) of one (or more)
of the physical parameters, almost no research exists to date that would turn to their natural extension/counterpart:
the singularities induced by the discontinuities of the first kind (a.k.a. the jump discontinuities).
It is this oversight that this article aims to amend. In fact, it demonstrates that the inclusion
of such singularities allows one to produce a number of very interesting scenarios of cosmological
evolution. For example, it produces the cosmological models with a finite value of the equation
of state parameter $w=p/\rho$ even when both the energy density and the pressure diverge, while
at the same time keeping the scale factor finite. Such a dynamics is shown to be possible only when
the scale factor experiences a finite jump at some moment of time. Furthermore, if it is the first
derivative of the scale factor that experiences a jump, then a whole new and different type of a sudden
future singularity appears. Finally, jump discontinuities suffered by either a second or third
derivatives of a scale factor lead to cosmological models experiencing a sudden dephantomization
-- or avoiding the phantomization altogether. This implies that theoretically there should not
be any obstacles for extending the cosmological evolution beyond the corresponding singularities;
therefore, such singularities can be considered a sort of a cosmological phase transition.
