Second only to initial mass, the rate of wind-driven mass loss determines the final mass of a massive
star and the nature of its remnant. Motivated by the need to reconcile observational values and theory,
we use a recently vetted technique to analyze the mass-loss rates in a sample of OB stars that generate
bowshock nebulae. We measure peculiar velocities from new Gaia parallax and proper motion data
and their spectral types from new optical and infrared spectroscopy. For our sample of 67 central
stars in morphologically selected bowshocks nebulae, 67 are OB stars. The median peculiar velocity
is 11 km/s, significantly smaller than classical `runaway star' velocities. Mass-loss rates for
these O and early B stars agree with recently lowered theoretical predictions, ranging from ~10^-7
Msun/yr for mid-O dwarfs to 10^-9 Msun/yr for late-O dwarfs---a factor of about 2.7 lower than the
often-used Vink et al. (2001) formulation. Our results provide the first observational mass-loss
rates for B0--B3 dwarfs and giants---10^-9 to 10^-8 Msun/yr. We find evidence for an increase in
the mass-loss rates below a critical effective temperature, consistent with predictions of the
bi-stability phenomenon in the range Teff=19,000--27,000 K. The sample exhibits a correlation
between modified wind momentum and luminosity, consistent in slope but lower by 0.43 dex in magnitude
compared to canonical wind-luminosity relations. We identify a small subset of objects deviating
most significantly from theoretical expectations as probable radiation-driven bow wave nebulae
by virtue of their low stellar-to-nebular luminosity ratios. For these, the inferred mass-loss
rates must be regarded as upper limits.
