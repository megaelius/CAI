Advances in instrumentation have recently extended detailed measurements of gas kinematics to
large samples of high-redshift galaxies. Relative to most nearby, thin disk galaxies, in which
gas rotation accurately traces the gravitational potential, the interstellar medium (ISM) of
z>1 galaxies is typically more dynamic and exhibits elevated turbulence. If not properly modeled,
these effects can strongly bias dynamical mass measurements. We use high-resolution FIRE-2 cosmological
zoom-in simulations to analyze the physical effects that must be considered to correctly infer
dynamical masses from gas kinematics. Our analysis covers a range of galaxy properties from low-redshift
Milky-Way-mass galaxies to massive high-redshift galaxies (M_* > 10^11 M_sun at z=1). Selecting
only snapshots where a disk is present, we calculate the rotational profile v_phi(r) of the cool
(10^3.5 K < T < 10^4.5 K) gas and compare it to the circular velocity v_c=sqrt(GM/r). In the simulated
galaxies, the gas rotation traces the circular velocity at intermediate radii, but the two quantities
diverge significantly in the center and in the outer disk. Our simulations appear to over-predict
observed rotational velocities in the centers of massive galaxies (likely from a lack of black hole
feedback), so we focus on larger radii. Gradients in the turbulent pressure at these radii can provide
additional radial support and bias dynamical mass measurements low by up to 40%. In both the interior
and exterior, the gas' motion can be significantly non-circular due to e.g. bars, satellites, and
inflows/outflows. We discuss the accuracy of commonly-used analytic models for pressure gradients
(or "asymmetric drift") in the ISM of high-redshift galaxies.
