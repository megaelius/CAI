Systems of close-in super-Earths display striking diversity in planetary bulk density and composition.
Giant impacts are expected to play a role in the formation of many of these worlds. Previous works,
focused on the mechanical shock caused by a giant impact, have shown that these impacts can eject
large fractions of the planetary envelope, offering a partial explanation for the observed spread
in exoplanet compositions. Here, we examine the thermal consequences of giant impacts, and show
that the atmospheric loss caused by these effects can significantly exceed that caused by mechanical
shocks for hydrogen-helium (H/He) envelopes. When a giant impact occurs, part of the impact energy
is converted into thermal energy, heating the rocky core and the envelope. We find that the ensuing
thermal expansion of the envelope can lead to a period of sustained, rapid mass loss through a Parker
wind, resulting in the partial or complete erosion of the H/He envelope. The fraction of the envelope
lost depends on the planet's orbital distance from its host star and its initial thermal state, and
hence age. Planets closer to their host stars are more susceptible to thermal atmospheric loss triggered
by impacts than ones on wider orbits. Similarly, younger planets, with rocky cores which are still
hot and molten from formation, suffer greater atmospheric loss. This is especially interesting
because giant impacts are expected to occur $10{-}100~\mathrm{Myr}$ after formation. For planets
where the thermal energy of the core is much greater than the envelope energy, the impactor mass required
for significant atmospheric removal is $M_\mathrm{imp} / M_p \sim \mu / \mu_c \sim 0.1$, approximately
the ratio of the heat capacities of the envelope and core. When the envelope energy dominates the
total energy budget, complete loss can occur when the impactor mass is comparable to the envelope
mass.
