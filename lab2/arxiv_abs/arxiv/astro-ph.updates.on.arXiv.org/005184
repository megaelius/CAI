The mass of the stellar precursor of supernova (SN) 1987A and the burst of neutrinos observed at the
moment of the explosion are consistent with the core-collapse formation of a neutron star. However,
no compelling evidence for the presence in SN 1987A of a compact object of any kind has been found yet
in any band of the electromagnetic spectrum, prompting questions on whether the neutron star survived
and, if it did, on its properties. Starting from the analysis of recent Chandra observations, here
we appraise the current observational situation. We derived limits on the X-ray luminosity of a
compact object with a nonthermal, Crab-pulsar-like spectrum of the order of $\approx$$(1$-$5)\times10^{35}$
erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to limits on the rotational energy loss of a possible X-ray pulsar in
SN 1987A of $\approx$$(0.5$-$1.5)\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. However, a much brighter X-ray
source cannot be excluded if, as is likely, it is enshrouded in a cloud of absorbing matter with metallicity
similar to that expected in the outer layers of a massive star towards the end of its life. We found
that other limits obtained from various arguments and observations in other energy ranges either
are unbinding or allow a similar maximum luminosity of the order of $\approx$$10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
We conclude that while a pulsar alike the one in the Crab Nebula in both luminosity and spectrum is
hardly compatible with the observations, there is ample space for an `ordinary' X-ray-emitting
young neutron star, born with normal initial spin period, temperature and magnetic field, to be
hiding inside the evolving remnant of SN 1987A.
