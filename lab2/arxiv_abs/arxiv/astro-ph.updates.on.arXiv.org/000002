WASP-43b (Hellier et al.; Gillon et al.) is one of the closest-orbiting hot Jupiters, with a semimajor
axis a = 0.01526 +/- 0.00018 AU and a period of only 0.81 days. However, it orbits one of the coolest
stars with a hot Jupiter (K7V, Tstar = 4520 +/- 120 K), giving the planet a modest equilibrium temperature
of Teq = 1440 +/- 40 K, assuming zero Bond albedo and uniform planetary energy redistribution. This
has resulted in strong signal-to-noise-ratio (S/N) observations and deep eclipses in both Warm
Spitzer channels (3.6 and 4.5 microns). The eclipse depths and brightness temperatures from our
jointly fit model are 0.346 +/- 0.013% and 1684 +/- 24 K at 3.6 microns and 0.382 +/- 0.015% and 1485
+/- 24 K at 4.5 microns. The eclipse timings improved the estimate of the orbital period, P, by a factor
of three (P = 0.81347459 +/- 2.1x10-7 days) compared to Gillon et al. and put an upper limit on the eccentricity
(e = 0.007+0.013-0.004). We use our Spitzer eclipse depths with two previously reported ground-based
data points in the J and K bands to constrain the atmospheric properties of WASP-43b. The data rule
out a strong thermal inversion in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-43b. Model atmospheres with no
thermal inversions and fiducial oxygen-rich compositions are able to explain all the available
data. These data, however, are insufficient to place stringent constraints on the molecular mixing
ratios. The data suggest low day-night energy redistribution in the planet, consistent with previous
studies, with a nominal upper limit of about 35% for the fraction of energy incident on the dayside,
but redistributed to the nightside.
