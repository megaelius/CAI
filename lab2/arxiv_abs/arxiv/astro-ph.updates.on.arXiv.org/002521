We investigate sizes of $z\sim6-8$ dropout galaxies using the complete data of the Abell 2744 cluster
and parallel fields in the Hubble Frontier Fields program. By directly fitting light profiles of
observed galaxies with lensing-distorted S\'ersic profiles on the image plane with the \texttt{glafic}
software, we accurately measure intrinsic sizes of 31 $z\sim6-7$ and eight $z\sim8$ galaxies,
including those as faint as $M_{\mathrm{UV}}\simeq-17$. We find that half-light radii $r_\mathrm{e}$
positively correlates with UV luminosity at each redshift, although the correlation is not very
tight. Largest ($r_\mathrm{e}>0.8$ kpc) galaxies are mostly red in UV color while smallest
($r_\mathrm{e} < 0.05$ kpc) ones tend to be blue. We also find that galaxies with multiple cores
tend to be brighter. Combined with previous results at $2.5\lesssim z\lesssim12$, our result confirms
that the average $r_{\mathrm{e}}$ of bright ($(0.3-1)L^\star_{z=3}$) galaxies scales as $r_{\mathrm{e}}\propto(1+z)^{-m}$
with $m=1.31\pm0.1$. We find that the ratio of $r_\mathrm{e}$ to virial radius is virtually constant
at $3.5\pm0.1\%$ over a wide redshift range, where the virial radii of hosting dark matter halos
are derived based on the abundance matching. This constant ratio is consistent with the disk formation
model by Mo et al. (1998) with $j_\mathrm{d}\sim m_\mathrm{d}$, where $j_\mathrm{d}$ and $m_\mathrm{d}$
are the fractions of the angular momentum and mass within halos confined in the disks. A comparison
with various types of local galaxies indicates that our galaxies are most similar to circumnuclear
star-forming regions of barred galaxies in the sense that a sizable amount of stars are forming in
a very small area.
