Given a solar luminosity L_Ar = 0.75 L_0 at the beginning of the Archean 3.8 Gyr ago, where L_0 is the
present-day one, if the heliocentric distance r of the Earth was r_Ar = 0.956 r_0, the solar irradiance
would have been as large as I_Ar = 0.82 I_0. It would allowed for a liquid ocean on the terrestrial surface
which, otherwise, would have been frozen, contrary to the empirical evidence. By further assuming
that some physical mechanism subsequently displaced the Earth towards its current distance in
such a way that the irradiance stayed substantially constant over the entire Archean from 3.8 Gyr
to 2.5 Gyr ago, a relative recession rate as large as \dot r/r \simeq 3.4 x 10^-11 yr^-1 would have been
required. Although such a figure is roughly of the same order of magnitude of the value of the Hubble
parameter 3.8 Gyr ago H_Ar = 1.192 H_0 = 8.2 x 10^-11 yr^-1, standard general relativity rules out
cosmological explanations for the hypothesized Earth' s recession rate. Instead, a class of modified
theories of gravitation with nonminimal coupling between the matter and the metric naturally predicts
a secular variation of the relative distance of a localized two-body system, thus yielding a potentially
viable candidate to explain the putative recession of the Earth' s orbit. Another competing mechanism
of classical origin which could, in principle, allow for the desired effect is the mass loss which
either the Sun or the Earth itself may have experienced during the Archean. On the one hand, this implies
that our planet should have lost 2% of its present mass in the form of eroded/evaporated hydrosphere
which, thus, should have been two orders of magnitude larger than now. On the other hand, it is widely
believed that the Sun could have lost mass at an enhanced rate due to a stronger solar wind in the past
for not more than \sim 0.2-0.3 Gyr.
