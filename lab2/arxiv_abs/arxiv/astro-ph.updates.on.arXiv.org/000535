We show the existence of the strong inverse correlation between the temporal variations of the toroidal
component of the magnetic field in the solar tachocline (the bottom of the convective zone) and the
Earth magnetic field (the Y-component). The possibility that the hypothetical solar axions, which
can transform into photons in external electric or magnetic fields (the inverse Primakoff effect),
can be the instrument by which the magnetic field of the Sun convective zone modulates the magnetic
field of the Earth is considered. We propose the axion mechanism of Sun luminosity and "solar dynamo
-- geodynamo" connection, where the energy of one of the solar axion flux components emitted in M1
transition in 57Fe nuclei is modulated at first by the magnetic field of the solar tachocline zone
(due to the inverse coherent Primakoff effect) and after that is resonantly absorbed in the core
of the Earth, thereby playing the role of the energy modulator of the Earth magnetic field. Within
the framework of this mechanism estimations of the strength of the axion coupling to a photon (g_{a
\gamma} = 7.07e-11 1/GeV), the axion-nucleon coupling (g_{an} = 3.20e-7), the axion-electron
coupling (g_{ae} = 5.28e-11) and the axion mass (m_a = 17eV) have been obtained. It is also shown that
the claimed axion parameters do not contradict to any known experimental and theoretical model-independent
limitations. We consider the effect of dark matter in the form of 17eV axions on the extragalactic
back-ground light (EBL) and find that the theoretical spectral intensity of the EBL from decaying
axions as a function of the observed wavelength is in good agreement with the known experimental
data for the near ultraviolet, optical and near infrared bands (1500-20000 angstrom).
