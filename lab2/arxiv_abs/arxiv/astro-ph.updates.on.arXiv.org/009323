The study of young Sun-like stars is of fundamental importance to understand the magnetic activity
and rotational evolution of the Sun. Space-borne photometry by the Kepler telescope provides unprecedented
datasets to investigate these phenomena in Sun-like stars. We present a new analysis of the entire
Kepler photometric time series of the moderately young Sun-like star Kepler-17 that is accompanied
by a transiting hot Jupiter. We applied a maximum-entropy spot model to the long-cadence out-of-transit
photometry of the target to derive maps of the starspot filling factor versus the longitude and the
time. These maps are compared to the spots occulted during transits to validate our reconstruction
and derive information on the latitudes of the starspots. We find two main active longitudes on the
photosphere of Kepler-17, one of which has a lifetime of at least $\sim 1400$ days, although with
a varying level of activity. The latitudinal differential rotation is of solar type, that is, with
the equator rotating faster than the poles. We estimate a minimum relative amplitude $\Delta \Omega/
\Omega$ between $\sim 0.08 \pm 0.05$ and $0.14 \pm 0.05$, our determination being affected by the
finite lifetime of individual starspots and depending on the adopted spot model parameters. We
find marginal evidence of a short-term intermittent activity cycle of $\sim 48$ days and an indication
of a longer cycle of $400-600$ days characterized by an equatorward migration of the mean latitude
of the spots as in the Sun. The rotation of Kepler-17 is likely to be significantly affected by the
tides raised by its massive close-by planet. We confirm the reliability of maximum-entropy spot
models to map starspots in young active stars and characterize the activity and differential rotation
of this young Sun-like planetary host.
