We exploit EAGLE, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, to reproduce the selection of the
observed sub-millimeter (submm) galaxy population by selecting the model galaxies at $z \geq 1$
with mock submm fluxes $S_{850} \geq 1$ mJy. There is a reasonable agreement between the galaxies
within this sample and the properties of the observed submm population, such as their star formation
rates (SFRs) at $z<3$, redshift distribution and many integrated galaxy properties. We find that
the bulk of the $S_{850} \geq 1$ mJy model population is at $z = 2.5$, and that they are massive galaxies
($M_* \sim 10^{11}$ Msol) with high dust masses ($M_{\mathrm{dust}} \sim 10^{8}$ Msol), gas fractions
($f_{\mathrm{gas}} \approx 50$%) and SFRs ($\dot M_* \approx 100$ Msol/yr). They have major and
minor merger fractions similar to the general population, suggesting that mergers are not the primary
driver of the model submm galaxies. Instead, the $S_{850} \geq 1$ mJy model galaxies yield high SFRs
primarily because they maintain a significant gas reservoir as a result of hosting an undermassive
black hole. In addition, we find that not all highly star-forming EAGLE galaxies have submm fluxes
$S_{850} > 1$ mJy. Thus, we investigate the nature of $z \geq 1$ highly star-forming Submm-Faint
galaxies (i.e., $\dot M_* \geq 80$ Msol/yr but $S_{850}< 1$ mJy). We find they are similar to the model
submm galaxies; being gas rich and hosting undermassive black holes, however they are typically
lower mass ($M_* \sim 10^{10}$ Msol) and are at higher redshifts ($z>4$). These typically higher-$z$
galaxies show stronger evidence for having been triggered by major mergers, and critically, they
are likely missed by current submm surveys due to their higher dust temperatures. This suggests
a potentially even larger contribution to the SFR density at $z > 3$ from dust-obscured systems than
implied by current observations.
