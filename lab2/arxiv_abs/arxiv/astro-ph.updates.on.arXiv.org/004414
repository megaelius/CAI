Significant observational effort has been devoted to determining volumetric type Ia supernova
rates at high redshifts, leading to clues about the nature of Ia supernova progenitors and constraints
on the iron production in the universe. A complementary approach is to investigate type Ia supernova
rates in individual, more nearby, galaxies. The popular A+B model for the specific supernova rate,
while reliable for a wide range of galaxy properties, diverges for large specific star formation
rates. Applying it outside its range of validity could lead to the prediction of excessive type Ia
supernova rates. Moreover, the A+B model it is not directly derived from a delay time distribution.
We here introduce a new model which is explicitly motivated by a simple delay time distribution composed
of a prompt and a delayed component. The model is in remarkably good agreement with current observational
constraints. It yields a prompt fraction of $f_{p}= 0.11^{+0.10}_{-0.06}$ in agreement with results
based on volumetric rates of type Ia supernovae at high redshift (Rodney et al. 2014). The model is
tested against realistic star formation rates from the Illustris-1 simulation and is found to be
self consistent in the asymptotic limits. An analytic function that encapsulates the features
of the new model is shown to be in excellent agreement with the data. In terms of goodness of fit, the
new model is strongly preferred over the A+B model. At $\log{({\rm sSFR})} \gtrsim -9$ there are
no constraints from observations. Observations in this regime will further constrain the delay
time distribution of type Ia supernovae at short delay times.
