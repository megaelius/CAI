Fine-scale braiding of coronal magnetic loops by continuous footpoint motions may power coronal
heating via nanoflares, which are spontaneous fine-scale bursts of internal reconnection. An
initial nanoflare may trigger an avalanche of reconnection of the braids, making a microflare or
larger subflare. In contrast to this internal triggering of subflares, we observe external triggering
of subflares in a braided coronal magnetic field observed by the {\it High-resolution Coronal Imager
(Hi-C)}. We track the development of these subflares using 12 s cadence images acquired by {\it SDO}/AIA
in 1600, 193, 94 \AA, and registered magnetograms of {\it SDO}/HMI, over four hours centered on the
{\it Hi-C} observing time. These data show numerous recurring small-scale brightenings in transition-region
emission happening on polarity inversion lines where flux cancellation is occurring. We present
in detail an example of an apparent burst of reconnection of two loops in the transition region under
the braided coronal field, appropriate for releasing a short reconnected loop downward and a longer
reconnected loop upward. The short loop presumably submerges into the photosphere, participating
in observed flux cancellation. A subflare in the overlying braided magnetic field is apparently
triggered by the disturbance of the braided field by the reconnection-released upward loop. At
least 10 subflares observed in this braided structure appear to be triggered this way. How common
this external trigger mechanism for coronal subflares is in other active regions, and how important
it is for coronal heating in general, remain to be seen.
