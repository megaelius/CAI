We present the analysis of photometric, spectroscopic, and morphological properties for differently
selected samples of passive galaxies up to z=1 extracted from the zCOSMOS-20k spectroscopic survey.
This analysis intends to explore the dependence of galaxy properties on the selection criterion
adopted, study the degree of contamination due to star-forming outliers, and provide a comparison
between different commonly used selection criteria. We extracted from the zCOSMOS-20k catalog
six different samples of passive galaxies, based on morphology, optical colors, specific star-formation
rate, a best fit to the observed spectral energy distribution, and a criterion that combines morphological,
spectroscopic, and photometric information. The morphological sample has the higher percentage
of contamination in colors, specific star formation rate and presence of emission lines, while
the red & passive ETGs sample is the purest, with properties mostly compatible with no star formation
activity; however, it is also the less economic criterion in terms of information used. The best
performing among the other criteria are the red SED and the quiescent ones, providing a percentage
of contamination only slightly higher than the red & passive ETGs criterion (on average of a
factor of ~2) but with absolute values of the properties of contaminants still compatible with a
red, passively evolving population. We also provided two revised definitions of early type galaxies
based on restframe color-color and color-mass criteria, that better reproduce the observed bimodalities.
The analysis of the number densities shows evidences of mass-assembly downsizing, with galaxies
at 10.25<log(M/Msun)<10.75 increasing their number by a factor ~2-4 from z=0.6 to z=0.2,
by a factor ~2-3 from z=1 to z=0.2 at 10.75<log(M/Msun)<11, and by only ~10-50% from z=1 to
z=0.2 at 11<log(M/Msun)<11.5.
