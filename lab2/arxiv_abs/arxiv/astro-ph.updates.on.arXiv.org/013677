We discovered a new growth mode of dust grains to km-sized bodies in protoplanetary disks that evolve
by viscous accretion and magnetically driven disk winds (MDWs). We solved an approximate coagulation
equation of dust grains with time-evolving disks that consist of both gas and solid components by
a one dimensional model. With the collisional growth of dust grains, all solid particles initially
drift inward toward the central star by the gas drag force. However, the radial profile of gas pressure,
$P$, is modified by the MDW that disperses the gas in an inside-out manner. As a result, a local concentration
of solid particles is created by the converging radial flux of drifting dust grains at the location
with the convex upward profile of $P$. When the dimensionless stopping time, or the Stokes number,
St, there exceeds unity, the solid particles spontaneously reach the growth dominated state because
of the positive feedback between the suppressed radial drift and the enhanced accumulation of dust
particles that drift from the outer part. These consecutive processes proceed even for spherical
dust grains under the Epstein gas drag. Once the solid particles are in the drift limited state, the
above mentioned condition of St $\gtrsim 1$ for the dust growth is equivalent with \begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\rm d}/\Sigma_{\rm g} \gtrsim \eta, \nonumber \end{equation} where $\Sigma_{\rm d}/\Sigma_{\rm
g}$ is the dust-to-gas surface-density ratio and $\eta$ is dimensionless radial pressure-gradient
force. As a consequence of the successful growth of dust grains, a ring-like structure containing
planetesimal-sized bodies is formed at the inner part of the protoplanetary disks. Such a ring-shaped
concentration of planetesimals is expected to play a vital role in the subsequent planet formation.
