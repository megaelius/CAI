The new CARMENES instrument comprises two high-resolution and high-stability spectrographs
that are used to search for habitable planets around M dwarfs in the visible and near-infrared regime
via the Doppler technique. Characterising our target sample is important for constraining the
physical properties of any planetary systems that are detected. The aim of this paper is to determine
the fundamental stellar parameters of the CARMENES M-dwarf target sample from high-resolution
spectra observed with CARMENES. We also include several M-dwarf spectra observed with other high-resolution
spectrographs, that is CAFE, FEROS, and HRS, for completeness. We used a {chi}^2 method to derive
the stellar parameters effective temperature T_eff, surface gravity log g, and metallicity [Fe/H]
of the target stars by fitting the most recent version of the PHOENIX-ACES models to high-resolution
spectroscopic data. These stellar atmosphere models incorporate a new equation of state to describe
spectral features of low-temperature stellar atmospheres. Since T_eff, log g, and [Fe/H] show
degeneracies, the surface gravity is determined independently using stellar evolutionary models.
We derive the stellar parameters for a total of 300 stars. The fits achieve very good agreement between
the PHOENIX models and observed spectra. We estimate that our method provides parameters with uncertainties
of {sigma} T_eff = 51 K, {sigma} log g = 0.07, and {sigma} [Fe/H] = 0.16, and show that atmosphere models
for low-mass stars have significantly improved in the last years. Our work also provides an independent
test of the new PHOENIX-ACES models, and a comparison for other methods using low-resolution spectra.
In particular, our effective temperatures agree well with literature values, while metallicities
determined with our method exhibit a larger spread when compared to literature results.
