Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient volume to make precision
predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant scales. Here we use our new IllustrisTNG
simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter,
galaxies and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase
the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up
to k ~ 10 h/Mpc by 20%. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close
to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift
to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with SDSS
at its mean redshift z ~ 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour,
apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range 10^9-10^10 Msun/h^2.
Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering
bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy auto-correlation
function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope gamma is nearly invariant
with stellar mass, but declines from gamma ~ 1.8 at redshift z=0 to gamma ~ 1.6 at redshift z ~ 1, beyond
which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale-dependencies in the bias of different
observational tracers of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic
acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic
peaks of around ~5%.
