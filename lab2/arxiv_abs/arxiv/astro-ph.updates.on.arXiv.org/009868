Context. Bright stellar positions are now known with an uncertainty below 1 mas thanks to Gaia DR2.
Between 2019-2020, the Galactic plane will be the background of Jupiter. The dense stellar background
will lead to an increase in the number of occultations, while the Gaia DR2 catalogue will reduce the
prediction uncertainties for the shadow path. Aims. We observed a stellar occultation by the Galilean
moon Europa (J2) and propose a campaign for observing stellar occultations for all Galilean moons.
Methods. During a predicted period of time, we measured the light flux of the occulted star and the
object to determine the time when the flux dropped with respect to one or more reference stars, and
the time that it rose again for each observational station. The chords obtained from these observations
allowed us to determine apparent sizes, oblatness, and positions with kilometre accuracy. Results.
We present results obtained from the first stellar occultation by the Galilean moon Europa observed
on 2017 March 31. The apparent fitted ellipse presents an equivalent radius of 1561.2 $\pm$ 3.6 km
and oblatenesses 0.0010 $\pm$ 0.0028. A very precise Europa position was determined with an uncertainty
of 0.8 mas. We also present prospects for a campaign to observe the future events that will occur between
2019 and 2021 for all Galilean moons. Conclusions. Stellar occultation is a suitable technique
for obtaining physical parameters and highly accurate positions of bright satellites close to
their primary. A number of successful events can render the 3D shapes of the Galilean moons with high
accuracy. We encourage the observational community (amateurs included) to observe the future
predicted events.
