By comparing the dynamical mass and lensing mass of early type lens galaxies, one can constrain both
the cosmological parameters and the density profiles of galaxies. In this paper, we explore the
constraining power of this method on cosmological parameters, using a compiled sample of 157 galaxy-scale
strong lensing systems, which is currently the largest sample with both high resolution imaging
and stellar dynamical data. These selected lenses are all early-type galaxies with E or S0 morphologies
and without significant substructures or close companion galaxies. We assume a power-law mass
model for the lenses, and consider three different parameterizations for the slope ($\gamma$ )
of the total mass density profile ($\rho(r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$) to include the effect of the dependence
of lens mass model on redshift and surface mass density. By fitting simultaneously the cosmological
model and the lens mass model, we find that the cosmological parameters are not very well constrained
with current data, and the posterior distribution on $\Omega_m$ is heavily dependent on the choice
of parameterization for the lens mass model. By employing the Bayesian information criterion,
we find the lens mass model including dependencies on both redshift and surface mass density is favored.
We observe the dependencies of $\gamma$ on the redshift and the surface mass density at > 3 $\sigma$
and> 5 $\sigma$ levels, respectively. We conclude that unless the significant dependencies of
$\gamma$ on both the redshift and the surface mass density are properly taken into account, the strong
gravitational lensing systems under consideration cannot served as a kind of promising cosmological
probes.
