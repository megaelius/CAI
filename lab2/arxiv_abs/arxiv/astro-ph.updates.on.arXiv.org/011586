We present a physical characterization of MMJ100026.36+021527.9 (a.k.a. ``MAMBO-9''), a dusty
star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at $z=5.850\pm0.001$. This is the highest redshift unlensed DSFG (and
fourth most distant overall) found to-date, and is the first source identified in a new 2mm blank-field
map in the COSMOS field. Though identified in prior samples of DSFGs at 850$\mu$m-1.2mm with unknown
redshift, the detection at 2mm prompted further follow-up as it indicated a much higher probability
that the source was likely to sit at $z>4$. Deep observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter and
submillimeter Array (ALMA) presented here confirm the redshift through the secure detection of
$^{12}$CO($J\!=$6$\rightarrow$5) and p-H$_{2}$O(2$_{1,1}\!\rightarrow$2$_{0,2}$). MAMBO-9
is comprised of a pair of galaxies separated by 6kpc with corresponding star-formation rates of
590M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and 220M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ total molecular hydrogen gas mass of (1.7$\pm$0.4)$\times10^{11}$M$_\odot$,
dust mass of (1.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{9}$M$_\odot$ and stellar mass of (3.2$^{+1.0}_{-1.5}$)$\times10^{9}$M$_\odot$.
The total halo mass, (3.3$\pm$0.8)$\times10^{12}$M$_\odot$, is predicted to exceed $>10^{15}$M$_\odot$
by $z=0$. The system is undergoing a merger-driven starburst which will increase the stellar mass
of the system tenfold in $\tau_{\rm depl}=40-80$Myr, converting its large molecular gas reservoir
(gas fraction of 96$^{+1}_{-2}$%) into stars. MAMBO-9 evaded firm spectroscopic identification
for a decade, following a pattern that has emerged for some of the highest redshift DSFGs found. And
yet, the systematic identification of unlensed DSFGs like MAMBO-9 is key to measuring the global
contribution of obscured star-formation to the star-formation rate density at $z>4$, the formation
of the first massive galaxies, and the formation of interstellar dust at early times ($<$1Gyr).
