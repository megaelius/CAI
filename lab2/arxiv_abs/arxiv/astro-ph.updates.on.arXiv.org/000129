(Abridged) Aims. In the present part of our survey we search for ammonia emitters in the Aquila rift
complex which trace the densest regions of molecular clouds. Methods. From a CO survey carried out
with the Delingha 14-m telescope we selected ~150 targets for observations in other molecular lines.
Here we describe the mapping observations in the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines of the first
49 sources performed with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. Results. The NH3(1,1) and (2,2) emission
lines are detected in 12 and 7 sources, respectively. Among the newly discovered NH3 sources, our
sample includes the following well-known clouds: the starless core L694-2, the Serpens cloud Cluster
B, the Serpens dark cloud L572, the filamentary dark cloud L673, the isolated protostellar source
B335, and the complex star-forming region Serpens South. Angular sizes between 40" and 80" (~0.04-0.08
pc) are observed for compact starless cores but as large as 9' (~0.5 pc) for filamentary dark clouds.
The measured kinetic temperatures of the clouds lie between 9K and 18K. From NH3 excitation temperatures
of 3-8K we determine H2 densities with typical values of ~(0.4-4) 10^4 cm^-3. The masses of the mapped
cores range between ~0.05 and ~0.5M_solar. The relative ammonia abundance, X= [NH3]/[H2], varies
from 10^-7 to 5 10^-7 with the mean <X> = (2.7+/-0.6) 10^-7 (estimated from spatially resolved
cores assuming the filling factor eta = 1). In two clouds, we observe kinematically split NH3 profiles
separated by ~1 km/s. The splitting is most likely due to bipolar molecular outflows for one of which
we determine an acceleration of <~ 0.03 km/s/yr. A starless core with significant rotational
energy is found to have a higher kinetic temperature than the other ones which is probably caused
by magnetic energy dissipation.
