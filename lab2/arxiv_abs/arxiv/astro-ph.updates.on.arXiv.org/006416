The presentations, discussions and findings from the inaugural `PhyStat-$\nu$' workshop held
at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU) near Tokyo in 2016 are
described. PhyStat-$\nu$ was the first workshop to focus solely on statistical issues across the
broad range of modern neutrino physics, bringing together physicists who are active in the analysis
of neutrino data with experts in statistics to explore statistical issues in the field. It is a goal
of PhyStat-$\nu$ to help serve the neutrino physics community by providing a forum within which
such statistical issues can be discussed and disseminated broadly. This paper is adapted from a
summary document that was initially circulated amongst the participants soon after the workshop.
Another PhyStat-$\nu$ workshop is being held at CERN in January 2019, building on the discussions
in 2016. Advances in experimental neutrino physics in recent years have led to much larger datasets
and more diversity in the properties of neutrinos that are being investigated. The discussions
here raised several areas where improved statistical errors and more complicated interpretations
of the data require statistical methods to be revisited, as well as topics where broader discussions
between experimentalists, phenomenologists and theorists will required, which are summarised
here. It is important to record the state of the field as it stands today, as much is expected to change
over the coming years, including the emergence of more inter-collaborational studies and increasing
sophistication in global parameter fitting and model selection methods. The document is also intended
to serve as a reference for pedagogical material for those who are new to the use of modern statistical
techniques to describe experimental data, as well as those who are well-versed in these techniques
and wish to apply them to new data.
