Galaxy clusters are excellent cosmological probes provided that their formation and evolution
within the large scale environment are precisely understood. Therefore studies with simulated
galaxy clusters have flourished. However detailed comparisons between simulated and observed
clusters and their population - the galaxies - are complicated by the diversity of clusters and their
surrounding environment. An original way initiated by Bertschinger as early as 1987, to legitimize
the one-to-one comparison exercise down to the details, is to produce simulations constrained
to resemble the cluster under study within its large scale environment. Subsequently several methods
have emerged to produce simulations that look like the local Universe. This paper highlights one
of these methods and its essential steps to get simulations that not only resemble the local Large
Scale Structure but also that host the local clusters. It includes a new modeling of the radial peculiar
velocity uncertainties to remove the observed correlation between the decreases of the simulated
cluster masses and of the amount of data used as constraints with the distance from us. This method
has the particularity to use solely radial peculiar velocities as constraints: no additional density
constraints are required to get local cluster simulacra. The new resulting simulations host dark
matter halos that match the most prominent local clusters such as Coma. Zoom-in simulations of the
latter and of a volume larger than the 30 Mpc/h radius inner sphere become now possible to study local
clusters and their effects. Mapping the local Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and Sachs-Wolfe effects can
follow.
