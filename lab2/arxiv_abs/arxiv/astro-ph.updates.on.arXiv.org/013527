Sulphur is one of the most abundant elements in the Universe. Surprisingly, sulphuretted molecules
are not as abundant as expected in the interstellar medium, and the identity of the main sulphur reservoir
is still an open question. Our goal is to investigate the H$_{2}$S chemistry in dark clouds, as this
stable molecule is a potential sulphur reservoir. Using millimeter observations of CS, SO, H$_{2}$S,
and their isotopologues, we determine the physical conditions and H$_{2}$S abundances along the
cores TMC 1-C, TMC 1-CP, and Barnard 1b. The gas-grain model Nautilus is then used to model the sulphur
chemistry and explore the impact of photo-desorption and chemical desorption on the H$_2$S abundance.
Our model shows that chemical desorption is the main source of gas-phase H$_2$S in dark cores. The
measured H$_{2}$S abundance can only be fitted if we assume that the chemical desorption rate decreases
by more than a factor of 10 when $n_{\rm H}>2\times10^{4}$. This change in the desorption rate is
consistent with the formation of thick H$_2$O and CO ice mantles on grain surfaces. The observed
SO and H$_2$S abundances are in good agreement with our predictions adopting an undepleted value
of the sulphur abundance. However, the CS abundance is overestimated by a factor of $5-10$. Along
the three cores, atomic S is predicted to be the main sulphur reservoir. We conclude that the gaseous
H$_2$S abundance is well reproduced, assuming undepleted sulphur abundance and chemical desorption
as the main source of H$_2$S. The behavior of the observed H$_{2}$S abundance suggests a changing
desorption efficiency, which would probe the snowline in these cores. Our model, however, overestimates
the observed gas-phase CS abundance. Given the uncertainty in the sulphur chemistry, our data are
consistent with a cosmic elemental S abundance with an uncertainty of a factor of 10.
