This paper reports on the X-ray emission evolution of the ultra-luminous Galactic X-ray pulsar,
Swift J0243.6+6124, during the 2017-2018 giant outburst observed by the MAXI GSC. The 2-30 keV light
curve and the energy spectra confirm that the luminosity $L_\mathrm{X}$ reached $2.5\times 10^{39}$
erg s$^{-1}$, 10 times higher than the Eddington limit. When the source was luminous with $L_\mathrm{X}\gtrsim
0.9\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, it exhibited a negative correlation on a hardness-intensity
diagram. However, two hardness ratios, a soft color ($=$ 4-10 keV / 2-4 keV) and a hard color ($=$ 10-20
keV / 4-10 keV), showed somewhat different behavior across a characteristic luminosity of $L_\mathrm{c}\simeq
5\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The soft color changed more than the hard color when $L_\mathrm{X}
< L_\mathrm{c}$, whereas the opposite was observed above $L_\mathrm{c}$. The spectral change
above $L_\mathrm{c}$ was represented by a broad enhanced feature at $\sim 6$ keV. The pulse profiles
made a transition from a single-peak to a double-peak one as the source brightened across $L_\mathrm{c}$.
These spectral and pulse-shape properties can be interpreted by a scenario that the accretion columns
on the neutron star surface, producing the Comptonized X-ray emission, gradually became taller
as $L_\mathrm{X}$ increased. The broad 6 keV enhancement could be a result of cyclotron-resonance
absorption at $\sim 10$ keV, corresponding to a surface magnetic field $B_\mathrm{s}\simeq 1.1\times
10^{12}$ G. The spin-frequency derivatives calculated with the Fermi GBM data showed a smooth correlation
with $L_\mathrm{X}$ up to the outburst peak, and its linear coefficient is comparable to those of
X-ray binary pulsars whose $B_\mathrm{s}$ are $(1-8)\times 10^{12}$ G. These results suggest
that $B_\mathrm{s}$ of Swift J0243.6$+$6124 is a few times $10^{12}$ G.
