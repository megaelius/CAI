We report constraints on cosmological parameters from the angular power spectrum of a cosmic microwave
background (CMB) gravitational lensing potential map created using temperature data from 2500
deg$^2$ of South Pole Telescope (SPT) data supplemented with data from Planck in the same sky region,
with the statistical power in the combined map primarily from the SPT data. We fit the corresponding
lensing angular power spectrum to a model including cold dark matter and a cosmological constant
($\Lambda$CDM), and to models with single-parameter extensions to $\Lambda$CDM. We find constraints
that are comparable to and consistent with constraints found using the full-sky Planck CMB lensing
data. Specifically, we find $\sigma_8 \Omega_{\rm m}^{0.25}=0.598 \pm 0.024$ from the lensing
data alone with relatively weak priors placed on the other $\Lambda$CDM parameters. In combination
with primary CMB data from Planck, we explore single-parameter extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM
model. We find $\Omega_k = -0.012^{+0.021}_{-0.023}$ or $M_{\nu}< 0.70$eV both at 95% confidence,
all in good agreement with results that include the lensing potential as measured by Planck over
the full sky. We include two independent free parameters that scale the effect of lensing on the CMB:
$A_{L}$, which scales the lensing power spectrum in both the lens reconstruction power and in the
smearing of the acoustic peaks, and $A^{\phi \phi}$, which scales only the amplitude of the CMB lensing
reconstruction power spectrum. We find $A^{\phi \phi} \times A_{L} =1.01 \pm 0.08$ for the lensing
map made from combined SPT and Planck temperature data, indicating that the amount of lensing is
in excellent agreement with what is expected from the observed CMB angular power spectrum when not
including the information from smearing of the acoustic peaks.
