The study of exoplanetary atmospheres is key to understand the differences between their physical,
chemical and dynamical processes. Up to now, the bulk of atmospheric characterization analysis
has been conducted on transiting planets. On some sufficiently bright targets, high-resolution
spectroscopy (HRS) has also been successfully tested for non-transiting planets. We study the
dayside of the non-transiting planet HD 102195b using the GIANO spectrograph mounted at TNG, demonstrating
the feasibility of atmospheric characterization measurements and molecular detection for non-transiting
planets with the HRS technique using 4-m class telescopes. The Doppler-shifted planetary signal
changes on the order of many km/s during the observations, in contrast with the telluric absorption
which is stationary in wavelength, allowing us to remove the contamination from telluric lines
while preserving the features of the planetary spectrum. The emission signal from HD 102195b's
atmosphere is then extracted by cross-correlating the residual spectra with atmospheric models.
We detect molecular absorption from water vapor at 4.4$\sigma$ level. We also find convincing evidence
for the presence of methane, which is detected at the 4.1$\sigma$ level. The two molecules are detected
with a combined significance of 5.3$\sigma$, at a semi-amplitude of the planet radial velocity
$K_P=128\pm 6$ km/s. We estimate a planet true mass of $M_P=0.46\pm 0.03~M_J$ and orbital inclination
between 72.5 and 84.79$^{\circ}$ (1$\sigma$). Our analysis indicates a non-inverted atmosphere
for HD 102195b, as expected given the relatively low temperature of the planet, inefficient to keep
TiO/VO in gas phase. Moreover, a comparison with theoretical expectations and chemical model predictions
corroborates our methane detection and suggests that the detected $CH_4$ and $H_2O$ signatures
could be consistent with a low C/O ratio.
