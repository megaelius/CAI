Dusty debris disks around pre- and main-sequence stars are potential signposts for the existence
of planetesimals and exoplanets. Giant planet formation is therefore expected to play a key role
in the evolution of the disk. This is indirectly confirmed by extant sub-millimeter near-infrared
images of young protoplanetary and cool dusty debris disks around main sequence stars usually showing
substantial spatial structures. A majority of recent discoveries of imaged giant planets have
been obtained around young, early-type stars hosting a circumstellar disk. In this context, we
have carried out a direct imaging program designed to maximize our chances of giant planet discovery
and targeting twenty-two young, early-type stars. About half of them show indication of multi-belt
architectures. Using the IRDIS dual-band imager and the IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE
to acquire high-constrast coronagraphic differential near-infrared images, we have conducted
a systematic search in the close environment of these young, dusty and early-type stars. We confirmed
that companions detected around HIP 34276, HIP 101800 and HIP 117452 are stationary background
sources and binary companions. The companion candidates around HIP 8832, HIP 16095 and HIP 95619
are determined as background contamination. For stars for which we infer the presence of debris
belts, a theoretical minimum mass for planets required to clear the debris gaps can be calculated
. The dynamical mass limit is at least $0.1 M_J$ and can exceed $1 M_J$. Direct imaging data is typically
sensitive to planets down to $\sim 3.6 M_J$ at 1 $''$, and $1.7 M_J$ in the best case. These two limits
tightly constrain the possible planetary systems present around each target. These systems will
be probably detectable with the next generation of planet imagers.
