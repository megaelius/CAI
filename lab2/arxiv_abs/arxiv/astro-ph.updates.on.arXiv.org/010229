When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow
caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study
this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry
array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images
of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have
resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter
of 42+/-3 micro-as, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a
flux ratio ~10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes,
with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different
days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black
hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained
in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light
around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M = (6.5+/-0.7) x 10^9
Msun. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive
black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also
present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not
accessible.
