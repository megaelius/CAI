We have observed the symbiotic stellar system R Aqr, aiming to describe the gravitational interaction
between the white dwarf (WD) and the wind from the Mira star, the key phenomenon driving the symbiotic
activity and the formation of nebulae in such systems. We present high-resolution ALMA maps of the
12CO and 13CO J=3-2 lines, the 0.9 mm continuum distribution, and some high-excitation molecular
lines in R Aqr. The maps, which have resolutions ranging between 40 milliarcsecond (mas) and less
than 20 mas, probe the circumstellar regions at suborbital scales as the distance between the stars
is ~ 40 mas. Our observations show the gravitational effects of the secondary on the stellar wind.
The AGB star was identified in our maps from the continuum and molecular line data, and we estimated
the probable position of the secondary from a new estimation of the orbital parameters. The (preliminary)
comparison of our maps with theoretical predictions is surprisingly satisfactory and the main
expected gravitational effects are directly mapped for the first time. We find a strong focusing
in the equatorial plane of the resulting wind, which shows two plumes in opposite directions that
have different velocities and very probably correspond to the expected double spiral due to the
interaction. Our continuum maps show the very inner regions of the nascent bipolar jets, at scales
of some AU. Continuum maps obtained with the highest resolution show the presence of a clump that
very probably corresponds to the emission of the ionized surroundings of the WD and of a bridge of
material joining both stars, which is likely material flowing from the AGB primary to the accretion
disk around the WD secondary.
