The detection of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) is one of the most important goals of modern
cosmology since PGWs can both provide substantial evidence for primordial inflation and shed light
on its physical nature. Small scale experiments on gravitational waves such as Ligo-Virgo and,
in future, LISA and Einstein Telescope (ET), are sensitive to the stochastic background, $\Omega_{\rm{GW}}$.
So they can be used to constrain the inflationary parameters. In performing this kind of analysis
the primordial spectrum of gravitational waves is usually parametrized with a power law that includes
only the amplitude and the spectral tilt. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of such constraints
showing that the higher-order terms in the power law approximation (i.e. the runnings of the tensor
tilt) can lead to non-negligible corrections on small scales. We start investigating these corrections
in the simplest scenario of slow-roll inflation that predicts an almost scale-invariant, slightly
red tilted primordial spectrum of gravitational waves. Nevertheless we estimate a correction
on $\Omega_{\rm GW}$ of about 39\% on the Ligo-Virgo scales. Then we focus on blue models of inflation
analyzing the robustness of the constraints that can be obtained using small scale measurements
of the stochastic background. We prove that it is effectively possible to constrain the inflationary
parameters on the CMB scales with the small scale data, but also that the higher-order corrections
are non-negligible on small scales. We constrain a physical model of blue inflation that employs
a pseudo scalar axion naturally coupled to gauge fields. We prove that, once the higher-order corrections
are considered in the analysis, future experiments can tightly constraints the spectral tilt $n_{\rm
t}$ improving at least of an order of magnitude the constraints.
