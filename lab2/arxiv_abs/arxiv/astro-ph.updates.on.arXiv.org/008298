HL Tau is a Class I-II protostar embedded in an infalling and rotating envelope and possibly associated
with a planet forming disk, and it is co-located in a 0.1 pc molecular cloud with two nearby young stellar
objects. Our ALMA observations revealed two arc-like structures on a 1000 au scale connected to
the disk, and their kinematics could not be explained with any conventional model of infalling and
rotational motions. In this work, we investigate the nature of these arc-like structures connected
to the HL Tau disk. We conducted new observations in the 13CO and C18O (3-2; 2-1) lines with JCMT and
IRAM 30m, and obtained the ACA data with the 7-m array. With the single-dish, ACA, and ALMA data, we
analyzed the gas motions on both 0.1 pc and 1000 au scales in the HL Tau region. We constructed new kinematical
models of an infalling and rotating envelope with the consideration of relative motion between
HL Tau and the envelope. By including the relative motion between HL Tau and its protostellar envelope,
our kinematical model can explain the observed velocity features in the arc-like structures. The
morphologies of the arc-like structures can also be explained with an asymmetric initial density
distribution in our model envelope. In addition, our single-dish results support that HL Tau is
located at the edge of a large-scale (0.1 pc) expanding shell driven by the wind or outflow from XZ
Tau, as suggested in the literature. The estimated expanding velocity of the shell is comparable
to the relative velocity between HL Tau and its envelope in our kinematical model. These results
hints that the large-scale expanding motion likely impacts the protostellar envelope around HL
Tau and affects its gas kinematics. We found that the mass infalling rate from the envelope onto the
HL Tau disk can be decreased by a factor of two due to this impact by the large-scale expanding shell.
