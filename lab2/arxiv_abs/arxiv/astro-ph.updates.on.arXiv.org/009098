We study the impact of the tidal field on the survivability of star clusters following instantaneous
gas expulsion. Our model clusters are formed with a centrally-peaked star-formation efficiency
profile as a result of star-formation taking place with a constant efficiency per free-fall time.
We define the impact of the tidal field as the ratio of the cluster half-mass radius to its Jacobi radius
immediately after gas expulsion, $\lambda = r_{h}/R_{J}$. We vary $\lambda$ by varying either
the Galactocentric distance, or the size (hence volume density) of star clusters. We propose a new
method to measure the violent relaxation duration, in which we compare the total mass-loss rate
of star clusters with their stellar evolutionary mass-loss rate. That way, we can robustly estimate
the bound mass fraction of our model clusters at the end of violent relaxation. The duration of violent
relaxation correlates linearly with the Jacobi radius, when considering identical clusters at
different Galactocentric distances. In contrast, it is nearly constant for the solar neighbourhood
clusters, slightly decreasing with $\lambda$. The violent relaxation does not last longer than
50 Myr in our simulations. Identical model clusters placed at different Galactocentric distances
have the same final bound fraction, despite experiencing different impacts of the tidal field.
The solar neighbourhood clusters with different densities experience only limited variations
of their final bound fraction. In general, we conclude that the cluster survivability after instantaneous
gas expulsion, as measured by their bound mass fraction at the end of violent relaxation, $F_{bound}$,
is independent of the impact of the tidal field, $\lambda$.
