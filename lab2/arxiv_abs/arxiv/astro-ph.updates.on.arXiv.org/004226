At the Astrochemistry Focus Group, we discussed what is still missing in our understanding even
with new knowledge given at this conference, and what can be done for that within 10 years from now.
Still missing in understanding are UV-photons and cosmic-rays interactions with icy dust grains,
Sulphur and Phosphorus chemistry, Metallicity effect, Duration (time) effect, COM formation
and destruction, phase transition, dust-gas interface, dust evolution, etc. What we should do
are multi-scale high spectral resolution molecular observations, laboratory work, theory, radiative
transfer, etc. We need careful modeling without simplifying things. Next, I introduce our research
on Planck cold clumps. We observed thirteen Planck cold clumps with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/SCUBA-2
and with the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. The N$_2$H$^+$ distribution obtained with the Nobeyama
telescope is quite similar to SCUBA-2 dust distribution. The 82 GHz HC$_3$N, 82 GHz CCS, and 94 GHz
CCS emission are often distributed differently with respect to the N$_2$H$^+$ emission. The CCS
emission, which is known to be abundant in starless molecular cloud cores, is often very clumpy in
the observed targets. We made deep single-pointing observations in DNC, HN$^{13}$C, N$_2$D$^+$,
cyclic C$_3$H$_2$ toward nine clumps. The detection rate of N$_2$D$^+$ is 50\%. In two of the starless
clumps observe, the CCS emission is distributed as it surrounds the N$_2$H$^+$ core (chemically
evolved gas), which resembles the case of L1544, a prestellar core showing collapse. In addition,
we detected both DNC and N$_2$D$^+$. These two clumps are most likely on the verge of star formation.
We introduce the Chemical Evolution Factor (CEF) for starless cores to describe the chemical evolutionary
stage, and analyze the observed Planck cold clumps.
