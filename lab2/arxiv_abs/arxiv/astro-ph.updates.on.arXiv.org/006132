We present a detailed spatial analysis of stellar populations based on long-slit optical spectra
in a sample of eight luminous early-type galaxies selected from nearby sparse groups and pairs,
three of them may be interacting with a galaxy of similar mass. We have measured luminosity-weighted
averages of age, [M/H], [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] to add empirical data relative to the influence
of galaxy mass, environment, interaction, and AGN feedback in their formation and evolution. The
stellar population of the individual galaxies were determined through the stellar population
synthesis code STARLIGHT using semi-empirical simple stellar population models. Radial variations
of luminosity-weighted means of age, [M/H], [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] were measured up to half
of the effective radius of each galaxy. We found trends between these values and the nuclear stellar
velocity dispersion. There are also relations between the metallicity/age gradients and the velocity
dispersion. Contributions of 1-4 Gyr old stellar populations were found in IC5328 and NGC6758 as
well as 4-8 Gyr old ones in NGC5812. Extended gas is present in IC5328, NGC1052, NGC1209, and NGC6758,
and the presence of a LINER is identified in all these galaxies. The regions up to one effective radius
of all galaxies are dominated by $\alpha$-enhanced metal-rich old stellar populations likely
due to rapid star formation episodes that induced efficient chemical enrichment. On average, the
age and [$\alpha$/Fe] gradients are null and the [M/H] gradients are negative, although discordant
cases were found. We found no correlation between the stellar population properties and the LINER
presence as well as between the stellar properties and environment or gravitational interaction,
suggesting that the influence of progenitor mass can-not be discarded in the formation and evolution
of early-type galaxies.
