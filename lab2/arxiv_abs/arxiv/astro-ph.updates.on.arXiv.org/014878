Relative magnetic helicity is conserved by magneto-hydrodynamic evolution even in the presence
of moderate resistivity. For that reason, it is often invoked as the most relevant constraint to
the dynamical evolution of plasmas in complex systems, such as solar and stellar dynamos, photospheric
flux emergence, solar eruptions, and relaxation processes in laboratory plasmas. However, such
studies often indirectly imply that relative magnetic helicity in a given spatial domain can be
algebraically split into the helicity contributions of the composing subvolumes, i.e., that it
is an additive quantity. A limited number of very specific applications have shown that this is not
the case. Progress in understanding the non-additivity of relative magnetic helicity requires
removal of restrictive assumptions in favour of a general formalism that can be used both in theoretical
investigations as well as in numerical applications. We derive the analytical gauge-invariant
expression for the partition of relative magnetic helicity between contiguous finite-volumes,
without any assumptions on either the shape of the volumes and interface, or the employed gauge.
The non-additivity of relative magnetic helicity in finite volumes is proven in the most general,
gauge-invariant formalism, and verified numerically. More restrictive assumptions are adopted
to derive known specific approximations, yielding a unified view of the additivity issue. As an
example, the case of a flux rope embedded in a potential field shows that the non-additivity term
in the partition equation is, in general, non-negligible. The relative helicity partition formula
can be applied to numerical simulations to precisely quantify the effect of non-additivity on global
helicity budgets of complex physical processes.
