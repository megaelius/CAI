We present optically thin solutions for magnetized, advective disc-outflow symbiosis around
black holes (BHs). The main objective is to explain the bright, hard state observations of accreting
systems with stellar-mass to supermassive BHs. We include the effects of magnetic fields and radiation
counterpart in entropy gradient based on the first law of thermodynamics to represent energy advection.
The cooling process includes bremsstrahlung, synchrotron radiation, and inverse Comptonization
process. One of our main ventures is to explain some long-standing issues of ultra-luminous X-ray
sources (ULXs). The existing physical scenarios to explain their unusual high luminosity are either
the existence of the missing class of intermediate-mass BH (IMBH), or super-Eddington accretion
around a stellar-mass BH. However, most ULXs with steep power-law spectrum can be well explained
through super-Eddington accretion, while the existence of IMBH is indeed disputed extensively.
Nevertheless, the interpretation of ULXs with a hard power-law dominated state remains mysterious.
Here we show that our magnetically dominated disc-outflow symbiosis around rapidly spinning stellar-mass
BHs can achieve such large luminosity even for sub-Eddington accretion rate. The magnetic field
at the outer zone of the advective flow is more than the corresponding Eddington limit. Such field
becomes dynamically dominant near the BH through continuous accretion process due to flux freezing,
but maintaining its Eddington limit. This unique field configurations enhance the synchrotron,
and synchrotron self-Comptonization process to achieve very large luminosity. Through the same
mechanism, our solutions for supermassive BHs can explain the unusual large luminosity of ultra-luminous
quasars.
