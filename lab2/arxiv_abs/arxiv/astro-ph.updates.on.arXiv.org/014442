The size of the dust torus in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their high-luminosity counterparts,
quasars, can be inferred from the time delay between UV/optical accretion disk continuum variability
and the response in the mid-infrared (MIR) torus emission. This dust reverberation mapping (RM)
technique has been successfully applied to $\sim 70$ $z\lesssim 0.3$ AGN and quasars. Here we present
first results of our dust RM program for distant quasars covered in the SDSS Stripe 82 region combining
$\sim 20$-yr ground-based optical light curves with 10-yr MIR light curves from the WISE satellite.
We measure a high-fidelity lag between W1-band (3.4 $\mu$m) and $g$ band for 587 quasars over $0.3\lesssim
z\lesssim 2$ ($\left<z\right>\sim 0.8$) and two orders of magnitude in quasar luminosity. They
tightly follow (intrinsic scatter $\sim 0.17$ dex in lag) the IR lag-luminosity relation observed
for $z<0.3$ AGN, revealing a remarkable size-luminosity relation for the dust torus over more than
four decades in AGN luminosity, with little dependence on additional quasar properties such as
Eddington ratio and variability amplitude. This study motivates further investigations in the
utility of dust RM for cosmology, and strongly endorses a compelling science case for the combined
10-yr Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (optical) and 5-yr Nancy Grace Roman
Space Telescope 2$\mu$m light curves in a deep survey for low-redshift AGN dust RM with much lower
luminosities and shorter, measurable IR lags. The compiled optical and MIR light curves for 7,384
quasars in our parent sample are made public with this work.
