The discovery of an ultrafast outflow has been reported in the z=0.0658 narrow line Seyfert galaxy
IRAS 13224-3809 (Parker et al. 2017a). The ultrafast outflow was first inferred through the detection
of highly blueshifted absorption lines (Parker et al. 2017a) and then confirmed with a principal
component analysis (PCA) (Parker et al. 2017b). Two of the reported properties of this outflow differed
from those typically detected in other AGN with ultrafast outflows. First, the outflow velocity
was found not to vary with v=0.236c +/- 0.006c. Second, the equivalent width of the highly blueshifted
absorption line was reported to be anti-correlated with the 3-10 keV flux of this source. We present
a re-analysis of the XMM-Newton observations of IRAS 13224-3809 considering the influence of background.
We also undertook a different analysis approach in combining the spectra and investigated the change
of the properties of the outflow as a function of 3-10 keV flux and time. We confirm the presence of
an ultrafast outflow in IRAS 13224-3809, however, we find that the background spectra used in the
Parker et al. analyses dominate the source spectra for energies near the blueshifted iron lines.
By reducing the source extraction regions to improve the signal-to-noise ratio we discover larger
than previously reported outflow velocities and find that the outflow velocity varies from ~0.2c
to ~0.3c and increases with 3-10~keV flux. The previously reported anti-correlation between equivalent
width of the iron line and 3-10 keV flux disappears when the background spectra are reduced by optimizing
the source extraction regions.
