We consider six isomeric groups (CH3N, CH5N, C2H5N, C2H7N, C3H7N and C3H9N) to review the presence
of amines and aldimines within the interstellar medium (ISM). Each of these groups contains at least
one aldimine or amine. Methanimine (CH2NH) from CH3N and methylamine (CH3NH2) from CH 5 N isomeric
group were detected a few decades ago. Recently, the presence of ethanimine (CH3CHNH) from C2H5N
isomeric group has been discovered in the ISM. This prompted us to investigate the possibility of
detecting any aldimine or amine from the very next three isomeric groups in this sequence: C2H7N,
C3H7N and C3H9N. We employ high-level quantum chemical calculations to estimate accurate energies
of all the species. According to enthalpies of formation, optimized energies, and expected intensity
ratio, we found that ethylamine (precursor of glycine) from C2H7N isomeric group, (1Z)-1-propanimine
from C3H7N isomeric group, and trimethylamine from C3H9N isomeric group are the most viable candidates
for the future astronomical detection. Based on our quantum chemical calculations and from other
approximations (from prevailing similar types of reactions), a complete set of reaction pathways
to the synthesis of ethylamine and (1Z)-1-propanimine is prepared. Moreover, a large gas-grain
chemical model is employed to study the presence of these species in the ISM. Our modeling results
suggest that ethylamine and (1Z)-1-propanimine could efficiently be formed in hot-core regions
and could be observed with present astronomical facilities. Radiative transfer modeling is also
implemented to additionally aid their discovery in interstellar space.
