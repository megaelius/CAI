We present high time resolution optical photometric data of the polar VV Puppis obtained simultaneously
in three filters (u', HeII $\lambda$4686, r') with the ULTRACAM camera mounted at the ESO-VLT telescope.
An analysis of a long 50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the source, retrieved from the database, is
also provided. Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are clearly detected in the optical during
the source bright phase intervals when the accreting pole is visible, confirming the association
of the QPOs with the basis of the accretion column. QPOs are detected in the three filters at a mean
frequency of $\sim$ 0.7 Hz with a similar amplitude $\sim$ 1\%. Mean orbitally-averaged power spectra
during the bright phase show a rather broad excess with a quality factor Q= $\nu$/$\Delta \nu$ = 5-7
but smaller data segments commonly show a much higher coherency with Q up to 30. The XMM (0.5--10 keV)
observation provides the first accurate estimation of the hard X-ray component with a high kT $\sim$
40 keV temperature and confirms the high EUV-soft/hard ratio in the range of (4--15) for VV Pup. The
detailed X-ray orbital light curve displays a short $\Delta \phi \simeq 0.05$ ingress into self-eclipse
of the active pole, indicative of a accretion shock height of $\sim$ 75 km. No significant X-ray QPOs
are detected with an amplitude upper limit of $\sim$30\% in the range (0.1--5) Hz. Detailed hydrodynamical
numerical simulations of the post-shock accretion region with parameters consistent with VV Pup
demonstrate that the expected frequencies from radiative instability are identical for X-rays
and optical regime at values $\nu$ $\sim$ (40--70) Hz, more than one order magnitude higher than
observed. This confirms previous statements suggesting that present instability models are unable
to explain the full QPO characteristics within the parameters commonly known for polars.
