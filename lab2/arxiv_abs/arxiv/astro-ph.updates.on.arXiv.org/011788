The Particle Telescope (PATE) of FORESAIL-1 mission is described. FORESAIL-1 is a CubeSat mission
to polar Low Earth Orbit. Its scientific objectives are to characterize electron precipitation
from the radiation belts and to observe energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) originating from the Sun
during the strongest solar flares. For that purpose, the 3-unit CubeSat carries a particle telescope
that measures energetic electrons in the nominal energy range of 80--800 keV in seven energy channels
and energetic protons at 0.3--10 MeV in ten channels. In addition, particles penetrating the whole
telescope at higher energies will be measured in three channels: one $>$800 keV electron channel,
two integral proton channels at $>$10 MeV energies. The instrument contains two telescopes at right
angles to each other, one measuring along the spin axis of the spacecraft and one perpendicular to
it. During a spin period (nominally 15 s), the rotating telescope will, thus, deliver angular distributions
of protons and electrons, at 11.25-degree clock-angle resolution, which enables one to accurately
determine the pitch-angle distribution and separate the trapped and precipitating particles.
During the last part of the mission, the rotation axis will be accurately pointed toward the Sun,
enabling the measurement of the energetic hydrogen from that direction. Using the geomagnetic
field as a filter and comparing the rates observed by the two telescopes, the instrument can observe
the solar ENA flux for events similar to the only one so far observed in December 2006. We present the
Geant4-simulated energy and angular response functions of the telescope and assess its sensitivity
showing that they are adequate to address the scientific objectives of the mission.
