Context: High-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) can undergo accretion episodes that strongly
affect the star evolution, the dynamics of the disk, and its chemical evolution. Recently reported
extraordinary bursts in the methanol maser emission may be the observational signature of accretion
events in deeply embedded HMYSOs. Aims: We analyze the light curve of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in S255IR-NIRS3
during the 2015-2016 burst. Methods: 8.5-year monitoring data with an average sampling interval
of 5 days were obtained with the Torun 32 m radio telescope. Archival data were added, extending the
time series to ~27 years. Results: The maser emission showed moderate (25-30%) variability on timescales
of months to years over ~23 years since its discovery. The main burst was preceded by a one-year increase
of the total flux density by a factor of 2.5, then it grew by a factor of 10 over ~0.4 years and declined
by a factor of 8 during the consecutive 2.4 years. The peak maser luminosity was a factor of 24.5 higher
than the pre-burst quiescent value. The light curves of individual features showed considerable
diversity but indicated a general trend of suppression of the maser emission at blueshifted (<4.7
km s$^{-1}$) velocities when the redshifted emission rapidly grew and new emission features appeared
at velocities >5.8 km s$^{-1}$. This new emission provided a contribution of about 80% to the maser
luminosity around the peak of the burst. Conclusions: The onset of the maser burst exactly coincides
with that of the infrared burst estimated from the motion of the light echo. This strongly supports
the radiative pumping scheme of the maser transition. The growth of the maser luminosity is the result
of an increasing volume of gas where the maser inversion is achieved.
