A primary goal of the SCUBA-2 Web survey is to perform tomography of the early inter-galactic medium
by studying systems containing some of the brightest quasi-stellar objects (QSOs; 2.5<z<3.0)
and nearby submillimetre galaxies. As a first step, this paper presents a search for the best candidate
systems and aims to characterize the galaxies that host the QSOs. To achieve this, a sample of 13 hyper-luminous
(L_AGN>10^14 L_\odot) QSOs with previous submillimetre continuum detections were followed up
with CO(3-2) observations using the NOEMA interferometer. All but one of the QSOs are directly detected
in CO(3-2); for the non-detection, our observations show a continuum flux density an order of magnitude
brighter than the other sources. In three of the fields, a companion potentially suitable for tomography
is detected in CO line emission within 25 arcsec of the QSO, and in one field a known radio source at
a different refshift is detected in the continuum. We derive gas masses, dynamical masses and far-infrared
luminosities, and show that the QSOs in our sample have similar properties as compared to less luminous
QSOs and SMGs in the literature, despite the fact that their black hole masses (which are proportional
to L_AGN) are 1-2 orders of magnitude larger. We discuss two interpretations of these observations:
selection effects, such as preferential face-on viewing angles and picking out objects in the tail
ends of the scatter in host-galaxy mass and black-hole mass relationships, have made these objects
appear discrepant; or the black hole masses have been overestimated because the accretion rates
are super-Eddington.
