Analyses of infrared signatures of CO$_2$ in water dominated ices in the ISM can give information
on the physical state of CO$_2$ in icy grains and on the thermal history of the ices themselves. In
many sources, CO$_2$ was found in the `pure' crystalline form, as signatured by the splitting in
the bending mode absorption profile. To a large extent, pure CO$_2$ is likely to have formed from
segregation of CO$_2$ from a CO$_2$:H$_2$O mixture during thermal processing. Previous laboratory
studies quantified the temperature dependence of segregation, but no systematic measurement
of the concentration dependence of segregation is available. In this study, we measured both the
temperature dependence and concentration dependence of CO$_2$ segregation in CO$_2$:H$_2$O
mixtures, and found that no pure crystalline CO$_2$ forms if the CO$_2$:H$_2$O ratio is less than
23%. Therefore the segregation of CO$_2$ is not always a good thermal tracer of the ice mantle. We
found that the position and width of the broad component of the asymmetric stretching vibrational
mode of $^{13}$CO$_2$ change linearly with the temperature of CO$_2$:H$_2$O mixtures, but are
insensitive to the concentration of CO$_2$. We recommend using this mode, which will be observable
towards low mass protostellar envelopes and dense clouds with the James Webb Space Telescope, to
trace the thermal history of the ice mantle, especially when segregated CO$_2$ is unavailable.
We used the laboratory measured $^{13}$CO$_2$ profile to analyze the ISO-SWS observations of ice
mantles towards Young Stellar Objects, and the astrophysical implications are discussed.
