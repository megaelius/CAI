Context. The TESS and PLATO missions are expected to find vast numbers of new transiting planet candidates.
However, only a fraction of these candidates will be legitimate planets, and the candidate validation
will require a significant amount of follow-up resources. Radial velocity follow-up can be carried
out only for the most promising candidates around bright, slowly rotating, stars. Thus, before
devoting RV resources to candidates, they need to be vetted using cheaper methods, and, in the cases
for which an RV confirmation is not feasible, the candidate's true nature needs to be determined
based on these alternative methods alone. Aims. We study the applicability of multicolour transit
photometry in the validation of transiting planet candidates when the candidate signal arises
from a real astrophysical source. We seek to answer how securely can we estimate the true uncontaminated
star-planet radius ratio when the light curve may contain contamination from unresolved light
sources inside the photometry aperture when combining multicolour transit observations with
a physics-based contamination model. Methods. The study is based on simulations and ground-based
transit observations. The analyses are carried out with a contamination model integrated into
the PyTransit v2 transit modelling package, and the observations are carried out with the MuSCAT2
multicolour imager installed in the 1.5 m TCS in the Teide Observatory. Results. We show that multicolour
transit photometry can be used to estimate the amount of flux contamination and the true radius ratio.
Combining the true radius ratio with an estimate for the stellar radius yields the true absolute
radius of the transiting object, which is a valuable quantity in statistical candidate validation,
and enough in itself to validate a candidate whose radius falls below the theoretical lower limit
for a brown dwarf.
