We apply two compression methods to the galaxy power spectrum monopole/quadrupole and bispectrum
monopole measurements from the BOSS DR12 CMASS sample. Both methods reduce the dimension of the
original data-vector to the number of cosmological parameters considered, using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve
algorithm with an analytic covariance model. In the first case, we infer the posterior through MCMC
sampling from the likelihood of the compressed data-vector (MC-KL). The second, faster option,
works by first Gaussianising and then orthogonalising the parameter space before the compression;
in this option (G-PCA) we only need to run a low-resolution preliminary MCMC sample for the Gaussianization
to compute our posterior. Both compression methods accurately reproduce the posterior distributions
obtained by standard MCMC sampling on the CMASS dataset for a $k$-space range of $0.03-0.12\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$.
The compression enables us to increase the number of bispectrum measurements by a factor of $\sim
23$ over the standard binning (from 116 to 2734 triangles used), which is otherwise limited by the
number of mock catalogues available. This reduces the $68\%$ credible intervals for the parameters
$\left(b_1,b_2,f,\sigma_8\right)$ by $\left(-24.8\%,-52.8\%,-26.4\%,-21\%\right)$, respectively.
The best-fit values we obtain are $(b_1=2.31\pm0.17,b_2=0.77\pm0.19,$ $f(z_{\mathrm{CMASS}})=0.67\pm0.06,\sigma_8(z_{\mathrm{CMASS}})=0.51\pm0.03)$.
Using these methods for future redshift surveys like DESI, Euclid and PFS will drastically reduce
the number of simulations needed to compute accurate covariance matrices and will facilitate tighter
constraints on cosmological parameters.
