We study turbulent gas diffusion affects on the observed $r$-process abundances in Milky Way stars,
by a combination of an analytical approach and a Monte Carlo simulation. Higher $r$-process event
rates and faster diffusion, lead to more efficient mixing corresponding to a reduced scatter of
$r$-process abundances and causing $r$-process enriched stars to start appearing at lower metallicity
values. We use three independent observations to constrain the model parameters: (i) the scatter
of radioactively stable $r$-process element abundances, (ii) the largest $r$-process enrichment
values observed in any solar neighborhood stars and (iii) the isotope abundance ratios of different
radioactive $r$-process elements ($^{244}$Pu/$^{238}$U and $^{247}$Cm/$^{238}$U) at the early
solar system as compared to their formation ratios. Our results indicate that the Galactic $r$-process
rate and the diffusion coefficient are respectively $r<4\times 10^{-5}\mbox{ yr}^{-1}, D>0.1
\mbox{ kpc}^2\mbox{Gyr}^{-1}$ ($r<4\times 10^{-6}\mbox{ yr}^{-1}, D>0.5 \mbox{ kpc}^2\mbox{Gyr}^{-1}$
for collapsars or similarly prolific $r$-process sources) with allowed values satisfying an approximate
anti-correlation such that $D\approx r^{-2/3}$, implying that the time between two $r$-process
events that enrich the same location in the Galaxy, is $\tau_{\rm mix}\approx 100-200\mbox{ Myr}$.
This suggests that a fraction of $\sim 0.8$ ($\sim 0.5$) of the observed $^{247}$Cm ($^{244}$Pu)
abundance is dominated by one $r$-process event in the early solar system. Radioactively stable
element abundances are dominated by contributions from $\sim 10$ different events in the early
solar system. For metal poor stars (with [Fe/H]$\lesssim -2$), their $r$-process abundances are
dominated by either a single or several events, depending on the star formation history.
