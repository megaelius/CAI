We study a suite of extremely high-resolution cosmological FIRE simulations of dwarf galaxies
($M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{10}$$M_{\odot}$), run to $z=0$ with $30 M_{\odot}$ resolution, sufficient
(for the first time) to resolve the internal structure of individual supernovae remnants within
the cooling radius. Every halo with $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{8.6} M_{\odot}$ is populated by a
resolved {\em stellar} galaxy, suggesting very low-mass dwarfs may be ubiquitous in the field.
Our ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs; $M_{\ast}<10^{5}\,M_{\odot}$) have their star formation truncated
early ($z\gtrsim2$), likely by reionization, while classical dwarfs ($M_{\ast}>10^{5} M_{\odot}$)
continue forming stars to $z<0.5$. The systems have bursty star formation (SF) histories, forming
most of their stars in periods of elevated SF strongly clustered in both space and time. This allows
our dwarf with $M_{\ast}/M_{\rm halo} > 10^{-4}$ to form a dark matter core $>200$pc, while lower-mass
UFDs exhibit cusps down to $\lesssim100$pc, as expected from energetic arguments. Our dwarfs with
$M_{\ast}>10^{4}\,M_{\odot}$ have half-mass radii ($R_{\rm 1/2}$) in agreement with Local Group
(LG) dwarfs; dynamical mass vs. $R_{1/2}$ and the degree of rotational support also resemble observations.
The lowest-mass UFDs are below surface brightness limits of current surveys but are potentially
visible in next-generation surveys (e.g. LSST). The stellar metallicities are lower than in LG
dwarfs; this may reflect pre-enrichment of the LG by the massive hosts or Pop-III stars. Consistency
with lower resolution studies implies that our simulations are numerically robust (for a given
physical model).
