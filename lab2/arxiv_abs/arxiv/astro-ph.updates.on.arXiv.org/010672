We analyse the multi-frequency radio spectral properties of $41$ 6GHz-detected ALMA-identified,
submillimetre galaxies (SMGs), observed at 610MHz, 1.4GHz, 6GHz with GMRT and the VLA. Combining
high-resolution ($\sim0.5''$) 6GHz radio and ALMA $870\,\mu$m imaging (tracing rest-frame $\sim20$GHz,
and $\sim250\,\mu$m dust continuum), we study the far-infrared/radio correlation via the logarithmic
flux ratio $q_{\rm IR}$, measuring $\langle q_{\rm IR}\rangle=2.20\pm 0.06$ for our sample. We
show that the high-frequency radio sizes of SMGs are $\sim1.9\pm 0.4\times$ ($\sim2$-$3$kpc)
larger than those of the cool dust emission, and find evidence for a subset of our sources being extended
on $\sim 10$kpc scales at 1.4GHz. By combining radio flux densities measured at three frequencies,
we can move beyond simple linear fits to the radio spectra of high-redshift star-forming galaxies,
and search for spectral curvature, which has been observed in local starburst galaxies. At least
a quarter (10/41) of our sample show evidence of a spectral break, with a median $\langle\alpha^{1.4\,{\rm
GHz}}_{610\,{\rm GHz}}\rangle=-0.60\pm 0.06$, but $\langle\alpha^{6\,{\rm GHz}}_{1.4\,{\rm
GHz}}\rangle=-1.06\pm 0.04$ -- a high-frequency flux deficit relative to simple extrapolations
from the low-frequency data. We explore this result within this subset of sources in the context
of age-related synchrotron losses, showing that a combination of weak magnetic fields ($B\sim35\,\mu$G)
and young ages ($t_{\rm SB}\sim40$--$80\,$Myr) for the central starburst can reproduce the observed
spectral break. Assuming these represent evolved (but ongoing) starbursts and we are observing
these systems roughly half-way through their current episode of star formation, this implies starburst
durations of $\lesssim100$Myr, in reasonable agreement with estimates derived via gas depletion
timescales.
