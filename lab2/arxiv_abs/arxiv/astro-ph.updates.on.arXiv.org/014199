Among the possible extensions of General Relativity that have been put forward in order to address
some long standing issues in our understanding of the Universe, Scalar-Tensor Theories have received
a lot of attention for their simplicity. Interestingly, some of these predict a potentially observable
non-linear phenomenon, known as \textit{spontaneous scalarisation}, in the presence of highly
compact matter distributions, like the case of neutron stars. Neutron stars are ideal laboratories
to investigate the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and in particular they are known
to harbour the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. Here, for the first time, we present a detailed
study of magnetised neutron stars in Scalar-Tensor Theories. First, we show that the formalism
developed for the study of magnetised neutron stars in General Relativity, based on the \textit{eXtended
Conformally Flat Condition}, can easily be extended in the presence of a non-minimally coupled
scalar field, retaining many of its numerical advantages. We then carry out a study of the parameter
space considering the two extreme geometries of purely toroidal and purely poloidal magnetic fields,
varying both the strength of the magnetic field and the intensity of scalarisation. We compare our
results with magnetised general-relativistic solutions and un-magnetised scalarised solutions,
showing how the mutual interplay between magnetic and scalar fields affect the magnetic and the
scalarisation properties of neutron stars. In particular, we focus our discussion on magnetic
deformability, maximum mass and range of scalarisation.
