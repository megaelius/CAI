In order to benefit from the 4-year unprecedented precision of the Kepler data, we extracted light
curves from the pixel photometric data of the Kepler space telescope for 15 Blazhko RR Lyrae stars.
For collecting all the flux from a given target as accurately as possible, we defined tailor-made
apertures for each star and quarter. In some cases the aperture finding process yielded sub-optimal
result, because some flux have been lost even if the aperture contains all available pixels around
the star. This fact stresses the importance of those methods that rely on the whole light curve instead
of focusing on the extrema (O-C diagrams and other amplitude independent methods). We carried out
detailed Fourier analysis of the light curves and the amplitude independent O-C diagram. We found
12 (80%) multiperiodically modulated stars in our sample. This ratio is much higher than previously
found. Resonant coupling between radial modes, a recent theory to explain of the Blazhko effect,
allows single, multiperiodic or even chaotic modulations. Among the stars with two modulations
we found three stars (V355 Lyr, V366 Lyr and V450 Lyr) where one of the periods dominate in amplitude
modulation, but the other period has larger frequency modulation amplitude. The ratio between
the primary and secondary modulation periods is almost always very close to ratios of small integer
numbers. It may indicate the effect of undiscovered resonances. Furthermore, we detected the excitation
of the second radial overtone mode $f_2$ for three stars where this feature was formerly unknown.
Our data set comprises the longest continuous, most precise observations of Blazhko RR Lyrae stars
ever published. These data which is made publicly available will be unprecedented for years to come.
