Core helium-burning red clump (RC) stars are excellent standard candles in the Milky Way: beyond
3 kpc, RC stars may have more precise distance estimates from spectrophotometry than from Gaia parallaxes.
However, RC stars have $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ very similar to some red giant branch (RGB) stars.
Especially for low-resolution R=2000 spectroscopic studies with $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, and
[Fe/H] estimated of limited precision, separating RC stars from RGB through established method
can incur ~20% contamination. Recently, Hawkins et al. (2018) demonstrated that the additional
information in single-epoch spectra, such as the C/N ratio, can be exploited to cleanly differentiate
RC and RGB stars. In this second paper of the series, we establish a data-driven mapping from spectral
flux space to independently determined asteroseismic parameters, the frequency and the period
separations. From this, we identify 210,371 RC stars from the publicly available LAMOST DR3 and
APOGEE DR14 data, with ~9% of contamination. We provide an RC sample of 92,249 stars with a contamination
of only ~3%, by restricting the combined analysis to LAMOST stars with${\rm S/N}_{\rm pix} \ge 75$.
This demonstrates that high-S/N, low-resolution spectra covering a broad wavelength range can
identify RC samples at least as pristine as their high-resolution counterparts. As coming and ongoing
surveys such as TESS, DESI, and LAMOST will continue to improve the overlapping training spectroscopic-asteroseismic
sample, the method presented in this study provides an efficient and straightforward way to derive
a vast yet pristine RC stars to reveal the 3D structure of the Milky Way.
