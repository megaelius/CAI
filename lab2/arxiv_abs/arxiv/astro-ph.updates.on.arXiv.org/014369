We investigate number count statistics as measures for transition to homogeneity of the matter
distribution in the Universe and analyse how such statistics might be `dressed' by the assumed survey
selection function. Since the estimated survey selection function -- which ideally accounts for
selection bias in the observed distribution -- is degenerate with the estimated underlying distribution
of galaxies, the ability to identify the correct survey selection function is of importance for
obtaining reliable estimates for clustering statistics. Selection functions of existing galaxy
catalogues are modelled from data to resemble the redshift distribution and mean density of the
observed galaxies. Proposed estimates of the selection function for upcoming surveys in addition
resemble the angular distribution of the observed galaxies. We argue that such modelling of the
selection function could potentially underestimate the deviance from homogeneity at scales probed
by existing catalogues. We investigate the impact of conventionally applied methods for estimation
of the survey selection function on number count in sphere statistics in a toy model setting. The
example density distribution is asymptotically homogeneous, while non-linear density fluctuations
are present regionally. We find that density oscillations with period comparable to characteristic
scales of the survey are suppressed when conventional estimates of the survey selection function
are invoked, resulting in number count statistics which are biased towards homogeneity. For our
concrete toy model with maximum density contrasts of 1 and period of the density oscillation comparable
in size to the survey radius, we find that the homogeneity scale is underestimated by ~40%, however
this quantitative result is dependent on the model setup including the form of the simplistic density
field considered and the survey geometry.
