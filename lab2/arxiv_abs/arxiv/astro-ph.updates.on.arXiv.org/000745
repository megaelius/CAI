MLPQNA stands for Multi Layer Perceptron with Quasi Newton Algorithm and it is a machine learning
method which can be used to cope with regression and classification problems on complex and massive
data sets. In this paper we give the formal description of the method and present the results of its
application to the evaluation of photometric redshifts for quasars. The data set used for the experiment
was obtained by merging four different surveys (SDSS, GALEX, UKIDSS and WISE), thus covering a wide
range of wavelengths from the UV to the mid-infrared. The method is able i) to achieve a very high accuracy;
ii) to drastically reduce the number of outliers and catastrophic objects; iii) to discriminate
among parameters (or features) on the basis of their significance, so that the number of features
used for training and analysis can be optimized in order to reduce both the computational demands
and the effects of degeneracy. The best experiment, which makes use of a selected combination of
parameters drawn from the four surveys, leads, in terms of DeltaZnorm (i.e. (zspec-zphot)/(1+zspec)),
to an average of DeltaZnorm = 0.004, a standard deviation sigma = 0.069 and a Median Absolute Deviation
MAD = 0.02 over the whole redshift range (i.e. zspec <= 3.6), defined by the 4-survey cross-matched
spectroscopic sample. The fraction of catastrophic outliers, i.e. of objects with photo-z deviating
more than 2sigma from the spectroscopic value is < 3%, leading to a sigma = 0.035 after their removal,
over the same redshift range. The method is made available to the community through the DAMEWARE
web application.
