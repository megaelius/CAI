Binary post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars are thought to be the products of a strong
but poorly-understood interaction during the AGB phase. The aim of this contribution is to update
the orbital elements of a sample of galactic post-AGB binaries observed in a long-term radial-velocity
monitoring campaign. Radial velocities are computed from high signal-to-noise spectra by use
of a cross-correlation method. The radial-velocity curves are fitted by using both a least-squares
algorithm and a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. We use a Monte Carlo method to compute uncertainties
on the orbital elements. The resulting mass functions are used to derive a companion mass distribution
by optimising the predicted to the observed cumulative mass-function distributions, after correcting
for observational bias. As a result, we derive and update orbital elements for 33 galactic post-AGB
binaries, among which 3 are new orbits. The orbital periods of the systems range from 100 to about
3000 days. Over 70 percent (23 out of 33) of our binaries have significant non-zero eccentricities
ranging over all periods. Their orbits are non-circular despite the fact that the Roche-lobe radii
are smaller than the maximum size of a typical AGB star and tidal circularisation should have been
strong when the objects were on the AGB. We derive a distribution of companion masses that is peaked
around 1.09 $M_\odot$ with a standard deviation of 0.62 $M_\odot$. The large spread in companion
masses highlights the diversity of post-AGB binary systems. Furthermore, we find that only post-AGB
stars with high effective temperatures (> 5500 K) in wide orbits are depleted in refractory elements,
suggesting that re-accretion of material from a circumbinary disc is an ongoing process. It appears,
however, that chemical depletion is inefficient for the closest orbits irrespective of the actual
surface temperature.
