X-ray catalogues provide a wealth of information on many source types, ranging from compact objects
to galaxies, clusters of galaxies, stars, and even planets. Thanks to the huge volume of X-ray sources
provided in the 3XMM catalogue, along with many source specific products, many new examples from
rare classes of sources can be identified. Through visualising spectra and lightcurves from about
80 observations included in the incremental part of the 3XMM catalogue, 3XMM-DR5, as part of the
quality control of the catalogue, we identified two new X-ray sources, 3XMM J183333.1+225136 and
3XMM J184916.1+652943, that were highly variable. This work aims to investigate their nature.
Through simple model fitting of the X-ray spectra and analysis of the X-ray lightcurves of 3XMM J183333.1+225136
and 3XMM J184916.1+652943, along with complementary photometry from the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor,
Pan-Starrs and the Stella/WiFSIP and Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) spectra, we suggest that
the two sources might be magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs) of the polar type and we determine
some of their properties. Both CVs have very hard spectra, showing no soft excess. They are both situated
in the local neighbourhood, located within $\sim$1 kpc. 3XMM J183333.1+225136 has an orbital period
of 2.15 hours. It shows features in the lightcurve that may be a total eclipse of the white dwarf. 3XMM
J184916.1+652943 has an orbital period of 1.6 hours. Given that only a small sky area was searched
to identify these CVs, future sensitive all sky surveys such as the eROSITA project should be very
successful at uncovering large numbers of such sources.
