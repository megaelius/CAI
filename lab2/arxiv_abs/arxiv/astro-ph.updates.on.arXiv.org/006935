Modifications of the matter power spectrum due to baryonic physics are one of the major theoretical
uncertainties in cosmological weak lensing measurements. Developing robust mitigation schemes
for this source of systematic uncertainty increases the robustness of cosmological constraints,
and may increase their precision if they enable the use of information from smaller scales. Here
we explore the performance of two mitigation schemes for baryonic effects in weak lensing cosmic
shear: the PCA method and the halo-model approach in \textsc{HMcode}. We construct mock tomographic
shear power spectra from four hydrodynamical simulations, and run simulated likelihood analyses
with \textsc{CosmoLike} assuming LSST-like survey statistics. With an angular scale cut of $\ell_{\rm
max}<2000$, both methods successfully remove the biases in cosmological parameters due to the
various baryonic physics scenarios, with the PCA method causing less degradation in the parameter
constraints than \textsc{HMcode}. For a more aggressive $\ell_{\rm max}=$5000, the PCA method
performs well for all but one baryonic physics scenario, requiring additional training simulations
to account for the extreme baryonic physics scenario of Illustris; \textsc{HMcode} exhibits tensions
in the 2D posterior distributions of cosmological parameters due to lack of freedom in describing
the power spectrum for $k > 10\ h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. We investigate variants of the PCA method and
improve the bias mitigation through PCA by accounting for the noise properties in the data via Cholesky
decomposition of the covariance matrix. Our improved PCA method allows us to retain more statistical
constraining power while effectively mitigating baryonic uncertainties even for a broad range
of baryonic physics scenarios.
