For decades the limited thickness of Vesta's basaltic crust, revealed by the link between the asteroid
and the howardite-eucrite-diogenite family of meteorites, and its survival to collisional erosion
offered an important constraint for the study of the early evolution of the Solar System. Some results
of the Dawn mission, however, cast doubts on our understanding of Vesta's interior composition
and of the characteristics of its basaltic crust, weakening this classical constraint. In this
work we investigate the late accretion and erosion experienced by Vesta's crust after its differentiation
and recorded in the composition of eucrites and diogenites and show that it offers an astrochemical
window into the earliest evolution of the Solar System. In our proof-of-concept case study focusing
on the late accretion and erosion of Vesta's crust during the growth and migration of Jupiter, the
water enrichment of eucrites appears to be a sensitive function of Jupiter's migration while the
enrichment in highly-siderophile elements of diogenites appears to be particularly sensitive
to the size-frequency distribution of the planetesimals. The picture depicted by the enrichments
created by late accretion in eucrites and diogenites is not qualitatively affected by the uncertainty
on the primordial mass of Vesta. Crustal erosion, instead, is more significantly affected by said
uncertainty and Vesta's crust survival appears to be mainly useful to study violent collisional
scenarios where highly energetic impacts can strip significant amounts of vestan material while
limitedly contributing to Vesta's late accretion. Our results suggest that the astrochemical
record of the late accretion and erosion of Vesta's crust provided by eucrites and diogenites can
be used as a tool to investigate any process or scenario associated to the evolution of primordial
Vesta and of the early Solar System.
