AIMS. We calculate the stellar density using star counts obtained from Gaia DR2 up to a Galactocentric
distance R=20 kpc with a deconvolution technique for the parallax errors. Then we analyse the density
in order to study the structure of the outer Galactic disc, mainly the warp. METHODS. In order to carry
out the deconvolution, we used the Lucy inversion technique for recovering the corrected star counts.
We also used the Gaia luminosity function of stars with $M_G<10$ to extract the stellar density from
the star counts. RESULTS. The stellar density maps can be fitted by an exponential disc in the radial
direction $h_r=2.07\pm0.07$ kpc, with a weak dependence on the azimuth, extended up to 20 kpc without
any cut-off. The flare and warp are clearly visible. The best fit of a symmetrical S-shaped warp gives
$z_w= z_\odot+(37\pm 4.2(stat.)-0.91(syst.))$ pc $(R/R_\odot )^{2.42\pm 0.76(stat.) + 0.129
(syst.)} sin(\phi+9.3\pm 7.37 (stat.) +4.48 (syst.))$ for the whole population. When we analyse
the northern and southern warps separately, we obtain an asymmetry of an $\sim25\%$ larger amplitude
in the north. This result may be influenced by extinction because the Gaia G band is quite prone to
extinction biases. However, we tested the accuracy of the extinction map we used, which shows that
the extinction is determined very well in the outer disc. Nevertheless, we recall that we do not know
the full extinction error, and neither do we know the systematic error of the map, which may influence
the final result. The analysis was also carried out for very luminous stars alone ($M_G<-2$), which
on average represents a younger population. We obtain similar scale-length values, while the maximum
amplitude of the warp is $20-30\%$ larger than with the whole population. The north-south asymmetry
is maintained.
