By means of a varied-shape thermophysical model (VS-TPM) of Hanus et al. (2015) that takes into account
asteroid shape and pole uncertainties, we analyze the thermal IR data acquired by the NASA's WISE
satellite of about 300 asteroids with derived convex shape models. We utilize publicly available
convex shape models and rotation states as input for the TPM. For more than one hundred asteroids,
the TPM gives us an acceptable fit to the thermal IR data allowing us to report their size, thermal
inertia, surface roughness or visible geometric albedo. This work more than doubles the number
of asteroids with determined thermophysical properties. In the remaining cases, the shape model
and pole orientation uncertainties, specific rotation or thermophysical properties, poor thermal
IR data or their coverage prevent the determination of reliable thermophysical properties. Finally,
we present the main results of the statistical study of derived thermophysical parameters within
the whole population of main-belt asteroids and within few asteroid families. Our sizes are, in
average, consistent with the radiometric sizes reported by Mainzer et al. (2016). The thermal inertia
increases with decreasing size, but a large range of thermal inertia values is observed within the
similar size ranges between D~10-100 km. We derived unexpectedly low thermal inertias (<20 SI)
for several asteroids with sizes 10<D<50 km, indicating a very fine and mature regolith on their
surface. The thermal inertia values seem to be consistent within several collisional families.
The fast rotators with P<4 h tend to have slightly larger thermal inertia values, so probably are
not covered by a fine regolith. This could be explained, for example, by the loss of the fine regolith
due to the centrifugal force, or by the ineffectiveness of the regolith production (e.g., by the
thermal cracking mechanism of Delbo' et al. 2014).
