We carry out a phase curve analysis of the KELT-9 system using photometric observations from NASA's
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite . The measured secondary eclipse depth and peak-to-peak
atmospheric brightness modulation are $651\pm 15$ ppm and $569\pm 14$ ppm, respectively. The planet's
brightness variation reaches maximum $26\pm 5$ minutes before the midpoint of secondary eclipse,
indicating a slight eastward shift in the dayside hotspot. We also detect stellar pulsations on
KELT-9 with a characteristic period of $7.58678\pm 0.00091$ hours. The dayside brightness temperature
assuming zero geometric albedo is $4570\pm 90$ K, and the nightside temperature is $3020\pm90$
K, comparable to the dayside temperatures of the hottest known exoplanets. In addition, we detect
a significant phase curve signal at the first harmonic of the orbital frequency and a marginal signal
at the second harmonic. While the amplitude of the first harmonic component is consistent with the
predicted ellipsoidal distortion modulation assuming equilibrium tides, the phase of this photometric
variation is shifted relative to the expectation. Placing KELT-9b in the context of other exoplanets
with phase curve observations, we find that the elevated nightside temperature and relatively
low day-night temperature contrast agree with the predictions of atmospheric models that include
H$_{2}$ dissociation and recombination. The nightside temperature of KELT-9b implies an atmospheric
composition containing 52% molecular and 48% atomic hydrogen, and an emission spectrum lacking
the broadband molecular features that are prominent on cooler hot Jupiters. Meanwhile, the near-infrared
transmission spectrum is predicted to be similarly featureless, with a positive slope due to H$^-$
opacity.
