Dispersive delays due to the Solar wind introduce excess noise in high-precision pulsar timing
experiments, and must be removed in order to achieve the accuracy needed to detect, e.g., low-frequency
gravitational waves. In current pulsar timing experiments, this delay is usually removed by approximating
the electron density distribution in the Solar wind either as spherically symmetric, or with a two-phase
model that describes the contributions from both high- and low-speed phases of the Solar wind. However,
no dataset has previously been available to test the performance and limitations of these models
over extended timescales and with sufficient sensitivity. Here we present the results of such a
test with an optimal dataset of observations of pulsar J0034-0534, taken with the German stations
of LOFAR. We conclude that the spherical approximation performs systematically better than the
two-phase model at almost all angular distances, with a residual root-mean-square (rms) given
by the two-phase model being up to 28% larger than the result obtained with the spherical approximation.
Nevertheless, the spherical approximation remains insufficiently accurate in modelling the
Solar-wind delay (especially within 20 degrees of angular distance from the Sun), as it leaves timing
residuals with rms values that reach the equivalent of 0.3 microseconds at 1400 MHz. This is because
a spherical model ignores the large daily variations in electron density observed in the Solar wind.
In the short term, broadband observations or simultaneous observations at low frequencies are
the most promising way forward to correct for Solar-wind induced delay variations.
