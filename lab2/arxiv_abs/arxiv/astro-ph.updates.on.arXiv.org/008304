We report the statistical properties of stars and brown dwarfs obtained from four radiation hydrodynamical
simulations of star cluster formation, the metallicities of which span a range from 1/100 to 3 times
the solar value. Unlike previous similar investigations of the effects of metallicity on stellar
properties, these new calculations treat dust and gas temperatures separately and include a thermochemical
model of the diffuse interstellar medium. The more advanced treatment of the interstellar medium
gives rise to very different gas and dust temperature distributions in the four calculations, with
lower metallicities generally resulting in higher temperatures and a delay in the onset of star
formation. Despite this, once star formation begins, all four calculations produce stars at similar
rates and many of the statistical properties of their stellar populations are difficult to distinguish
from each other and from those of observed stellar systems. We do find, however, that the greater
cooling rates at high gas densities due to the lower opacities at low metallicities increase the
fragmentation on small spatial scales (disc, filament, and core fragmentation). This produces
an anti-correlation between the close binary fraction of low-mass stars and metallicity similar
to that which is observed, and an increase in the fraction of protostellar mergers at low metallicities.
There are also indications that at lower metallicity close binaries may have lower mass ratios and
the abundance of brown dwarfs to stars may increase slightly. However, these latter two effects
are quite weak and need to be confirmed with larger samples.
