Nearly-axisymmetric gaps and rings are commonly observed in protoplanetary discs. The leading
theory regarding the origin of these patterns is that they are due to dust trapping at the edges of
gas gaps induced by the gravitational torques from embedded planets. If the concentration of solids
at the gap edges becomes high enough, it could potentially result in planetesimal formation by the
streaming instability. We test this hypothesis by performing global 1-D simulations of dust evolution
and planetesimal formation in a protoplanetary disc that is perturbed by multiple planets. We explore
different combinations of particle sizes, disc parameters, and planetary masses, and find that
planetesimals form in all these cases. We also compare the spatial distribution of pebbles from
our simulations with protoplanetary disc observations. Planets larger than one pebble isolation
mass catch drifting pebbles efficiently at the edge of their gas gaps, and depending on the efficiency
of planetesimal formation at the gap edges, the protoplanetary disc transforms within a few 100,000
years to either a transition disc with a large inner hole devoid of dust or to a disc with narrow bright
rings. For simulations with planetary masses lower than the pebble isolation mass, the outcome
is a disc with a series of weak ring patterns but no strong depletion between the rings. Lowering the
pebble size artificially to 100 micrometer-sized "silt", we find that regions between planets
get depleted of their pebble mass on a longer time-scale of up to 0.5 million years. These simulations
also produce fewer planetesimals than in the nominal model with millimeter-sized particles and
always have at least two rings of pebbles still visible after 1 Myr.
