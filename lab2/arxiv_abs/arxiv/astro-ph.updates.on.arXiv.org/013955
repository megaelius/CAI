Current instruments and spectral analysis programs are now able to decompose the integrated spectrum
of a stellar system into distributions of ages and metallicities. The reliability of these methods
have rarely been tested on nearby systems with resolved stellar ages and metallicities. Here we
derive the age-metallicity distribution of M54, the nucleus of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal
galaxy, from its integrated MUSE spectrum. We find a dominant old (8-14 Gyr), metal-poor (-1.5 dex)
and a young (1 Gyr), metal-rich (+0.25 dex) component - consistent with the complex stellar populations
measured from individual stars in the same MUSE data set. There is excellent agreement between the
(mass-weighted) average age and metallicity of the resolved and integrated analyses. Differences
are only 3% in age and 0.2 dex metallicitiy. By co-adding individual stars to create M54's integrated
spectrum, we show that the recovered age-metallicity distribution is insensitive to the magnitude
limit of the stars or the contribution of blue horizontal branch stars - even when including additional
blue wavelength coverage from the WAGGS survey. However, we find that the brightest stars can induce
the spurious recovery of an old ($>8$ Gyr), metal-rich (+0.25 dex) stellar population, which is
otherwise not expected from our understanding of chemical enrichment in M54. The overall derived
stellar mass-to-light ratio of M54 is M/L$_{\mathrm{V}}=1.46$ with a scatter of 0.22 across the
field-of-view, which we attribute to the stochastic contribution of a young, metal-rich component.
These findings provide strong evidence that complex stellar population distributions can be reliably
recovered from integrated spectra of extragalactic systems.
