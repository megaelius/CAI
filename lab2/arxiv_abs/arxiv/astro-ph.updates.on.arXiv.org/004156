Despite the important advances in space asteroseismology during the last decade, the early phases
of evolution of stars with masses above $\sim$15 M$_{\odot}$ have been only vaguely explored up
to now. Our goal is to detect, analyze and interpret variability in the early-B type supergiant HD\,2905
using long-term, ground based, high resolution spectroscopy. We gather a total of 1141 high-resolution
spectra covering some 2900 days. We complement these observations with the $Hipparcos$ light curve,
which includes 160 data points obtained during a time span of $\sim$1200 days. We investigate spectroscopic
variability of up to 12 diagnostic lines by using the zero and first moments of the line profiles.
We perform a frequency analysis of both the spectroscopic and photometric dataset. HD\,2905 is
a spectroscopic variable with peak-to-peak amplitudes in the zero and first moments of the photospheric
lines of up to 15\% and 30 \kms, respectively. The amplitude of the line-profile variability is correlated
with the line formation depth in the photosphere and wind. All investigated lines present complex
temporal behavior indicative of multi-periodic variability with timescales of a few days to several
weeks. The Scargle periodograms of the {\it Hipparcos\/} light curve and the first moment of purely
photospheric lines reveal a low-frequency amplitude excess and a clear dominant frequency at $\sim$0.37
d$^{-1}$. In the spectroscopy, several additional frequencies are present in the range 0.1 - 0.4
d$^{-1}$. These may be associated with heat-driven gravity modes, convectively-driven gravity
waves, or sub-surface convective motions. Additional frequencies are detected below 0.1 d$^{-1}$.
In the particular case of H$\alpha$, these are produced by rotational modulation of a non-spherically
symmetric stellar wind.
