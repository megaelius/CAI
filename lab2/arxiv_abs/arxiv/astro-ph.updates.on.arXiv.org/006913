The nearby Herbig Be star HD100546 is known to be a laboratory for the study of protoplanets and their
relation with the circumstellar disk that is carved by at least 2 gaps. We observed the HD100546 environment
with high contrast imaging exploiting several different observing modes of SPHERE, including
datasets with/without coronagraphs, dual band imaging, integral field spectroscopy and polarimetry.
The picture emerging from these different data sets is complex. Flux-conservative algorithms
images clearly show the disk up to 200au. More aggressive algorithms reveal several rings and warped
arms overlapping the main disk. The bright parts of this ring lie at considerable height over the
disk mid-plane at about 30au. Our images demonstrate that the brightest wings close to the star in
the near side of the disk are a unique structure, corresponding to the outer edge of the intermediate
disk at ~40au. Modeling of the scattered light from the disk with a geometrical algorithm reveals
that a moderately thin structure can well reproduce the light distribution in the flux-conservative
images. We suggest that the gap between 44 and 113 au span between the 1:2 and 3:2 resonance orbits
of a massive body located at ~70au that might coincide with the candidate planet HD100546b detected
with previous thermal IR observations. In this picture, the two wings can be the near side of a ring
formed by disk material brought out of the disk at the 1:2 resonance with the same massive object.
While we find no clear evidence confirming detection of the planet candidate HD100546c in our data,
we find a diffuse emission close to the expected position of HD100546b. This source can be described
as an extremely reddened substellar object surrounded by a dust cloud or its circumplanetary disk.
Its astrometry is broadly consistent with a circular orbital motion on the disk plane.
