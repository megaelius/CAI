We present our statistical analysis of the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) variability
and physical properties of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We constructed optical
light curves using data from the QUEST-La Silla AGN variability survey. To model the variability,
we used the structure function, among the excess variance and the amplitude from Damp Random Walk
(DRW) modelling. For the measurement of SMBH physical properties, we used public spectra from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our analysis is based on an original sample of 2345 sources detected
in both SDSS and QUEST-La Silla. For 1473 of these sources we could perform a proper measurement of
the spectral and variability properties, and 1348 of these sources were classified as variable
($91.5\%$). We found that the amplitude of the variability ($A$) depends solely on the rest frame
emission wavelength and the Eddington ratio, where $A$ anti-correlates with both $\lambda_{rest}$
and $L/L_{\text{Edd}}$. This suggests that AGN variability does not evolve over cosmic time, and
its amplitude is inversely related to the accretion rate. We found that the logarithmic gradient
of the variability ($\gamma$) does not correlate significantly with any SMBH physical parameter,
since there is no statistically significant linear regression model with an absolute value of the
slope higher than 0.1. Finally, we found that the general distribution of $\gamma$ measured for
our sample differs from the distribution of $\gamma$ obtained for light curves simulated from a
DRW process. For 20.6\% of the variable sources in our sample, a DRW model is not appropriate to describe
the variability, since $\gamma$ differers considerably from the expected value of 0.5.
