Among the growing list of confirmed exoplanets, the number of planets identified in dense star clusters
remains sparse. Previous analyses have suggested this may be due in part to dynamical interactions
that unbind large fractions of planets from their host stars, limiting the survival of planetary
systems in clusters. Thus, alternative detection strategies may be necessary to study planets
in clusters that may no longer be bound to a host star. Here, we use the cluster Monte Carlo code CMC
to explore the evolution of planetary systems in dense star clusters. Depending on a number of initial
conditions, we show that $10-50\%$ of primordial planetary systems are broken through dynamical
encounters over a cluster's full lifetime, populating clusters with "free-floating" planets.
Furthermore, a large number ($30-80\%$) of planets are ejected from their host cluster through
strong dynamical encounters and/or tidal loss. Additionally, we show that planets naturally mix
with stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in the central regions of their host cluster. As a consequence,
up to a few hundreds of planets will be tidally disrupted through close passages of BHs. We show these
BH-planet tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur in clusters at a rate of up to $10^{-5}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$
in a Milky Way-type galaxy. We predict BH-planet TDEs should be detected by upcoming transient surveys
such as LSST at a rate of roughly a few events per year. The observed rate of BH-planet TDEs would place
new constraints upon the formation and survival of both planetary systems and BHs in dense star clusters.
Additionally, depending on various assumptions including the initial number of planets and their
orbital properties, we predict that typical globular clusters may contain a few dynamically-formed
NS-planet systems at present as well as up to roughly 100 dynamically-formed WD-planet systems.
