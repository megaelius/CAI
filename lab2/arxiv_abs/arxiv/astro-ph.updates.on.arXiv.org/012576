We study the multiplicity of host stars to known transiting extra-solar planets to test competing
theories on the formation mechanisms of hot Jupiters. We observed 45 exoplanet host stars using
VLT/SPHERE/IRDIS to search for potential companions. For each identified candidate companion
we determined the probability that it is gravitationally bound to its host by performing common
proper motion checks and modelling of synthetic stellar populations around the host. We detected
new candidate companions around K2-38, WASP-72, WASP-80, WASP-87, WASP-88, WASP-108, WASP-118,
WASP-120, WASP-122, WASP123, WASP-130, WASP-131 and WASP-137. The closest candidates were detected
at separations of $0.124''\pm0.007''$ and $0.189''\pm0.003''$ around WASP-108 and WASP-131;
the measured $K$ band contrasts indicate that these are stellar companions of $0.35\pm0.02\,M_{\odot}$
and $0.62^{+0.05}_{-0.04}\,M_{\odot}$, respectively. Including the re-detection and confirmation
of previously known companions in 13 other systems we derived a multiplicity fraction of $55.4^{+5.9}_{-9.4}\,\%$.
For the representative sub-sample of 40 hot Jupiter host stars among our targets, the derived multiplicity
rate is $54.8^{+6.3}_{-9.9}\,\%$. Our data do not confirm any trend that systems with eccentric
planetary companions are preferably part of multiple systems. On average, we reached a magnitude
contrast of $8.5\pm0.9$ mag at an angular separation of 0.5''. This allows to exclude additional
stellar companions with masses larger than $0.08$ M$_\odot$ for almost all observed systems; around
the closest and youngest systems this sensitivity is achieved at physical separations as small
as 10 au. The presented study shows that SPHERE is an ideal instrument to detect and characterize
close companions to exoplanetary host stars.
