The short GRB 170817A was early detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). This observation
was consistent with a gravitational-wave transient (so-called GW170817) reported by LIGO detectors.
In addition to a quasi-thermal infrared/optical emission, this burst exhibited an atypical low-luminosity
emission with absence of the extended emission at early stage. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis
of this burst in terms of an off-axis emission from a uniform and structured jet is presented. The
GBM light curve obtained exhibits a $\gamma$-ray peak with a decay flux consistent with synchrotron
reverse-shock emission observed at high latitudes, and a black-body component consistent with
a cocoon emission. Whereas the emission can be observed at viewing angles larger than 35$^\circ$
in a structured jet, viewing angles larger than 30$^\circ$ from a uniform jet cannot be observed.
The X-ray and radio data are described by using the synchrotron forward-shock model implemented
in a special relativistic hydrodynamics code. The $\gamma$-ray GBM peak, X-ray and radio data are
consistent with synchrotron reverse- and forward-shock models in a fast/slow-cooling regime,
respectively. The best-fit values of the equivalent kinetic energy, circumburst medium and viewing
angle lie in the ranges $2\times 10^{51}\lesssim E \lesssim 9\times 10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$, $ 5\times
10^{-3}\lesssim {\rm n} \lesssim 5\times 10^{-2}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and $19^\circ \lesssim \theta_{\rm
obs}\lesssim20^\circ$, respectively, for a half-opening angle $\theta_j=12^\circ$, provided
that the progenitor environment is entrained with strong magnetic fields. It provides compelling
evidence about the magnetic field amplification in the binary neutron star merger. GW detection
will bring new light to the merger scenario for short GRBs, and thus understanding the multiwavelength
emission continues to be an important task.
