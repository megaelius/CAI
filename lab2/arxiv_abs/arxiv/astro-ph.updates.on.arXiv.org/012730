We study the evolution of the virial parameter, $\alpha$, and the star formation activity of a star
forming region in a numerical simulation and two observational samples likely to be at different
evolutionary stages, the Pipe and the G14.225 clouds. We consider a numerical simulation of turbulence
in the warm atomic gas, in which clouds form by a combination of thermal instability and turbulent
compressions. In this simulation we select a region with physical properties similar to those of
the Pipe in both its global physical properties and the dense cores it contains, and show that this
region evolves to become similar to the G14.225 cloud and its substructure in the course of $\sim$1.5
Myr. Within this region, we follow the evolution of $\alpha$ and the star formation activity of the
cores over this time interval, during which they grow in mass by accretion and develop further substructure
of higher density. We find that the individual cores evolve by exhibiting first a mild decrease in
$\alpha$ followed by a rapid increase when star formation begins. We suggest this evolution is due
to an early loss of external compressive kinetic energy followed by an increase of the gravitationally
driven motions. Nevertheless, collectively, the ensamble of clumps and cores reproduces the recently
observed trend of decreasing $\alpha$ for objects of higher mass. We also find that the star formation
rate and star formation efficiency increase monotonically as the region evolves. Thus, we propose
that the energy balance, $\alpha$, and the star formation activity determine the evolutionary
stage of a star forming region, and that a star forming region like the Pipe may evolve into a G14.225-like
stage over the course of a few megayears if it is allowed to accrete from its environment. This evolution
is consistent with the recently proposed scenario of hierarchical gravitational collapse.
