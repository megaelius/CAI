Solar flare ribbons provide an important clue to the magnetic reconnection process and associated
magnetic field topology in the solar corona. We detected a large-scale secondary flare ribbon of
a circular shape that developed in association with two successive M-class flares and one CME. The
ribbon revealed interesting properties such as 1) a quasi-circular shape and enclosing the central
active region; 2) the size as large as 500\arcsec\, by 650\arcsec\,, 3) successive brightenings
in the clockwise direction at a speed of \kms{160} starting from the nearest position to the flaring
sunspots, 4) radial contraction and expansion in the northern and the southern part, respectively
at speeds of $\leq$ \kms{10}. Using multi-wavelength data from \textit{SDO}, \textit{RHESSI},
XRT, and Nobeyama, along with magnetic field extrapolations, we found that: 1) the secondary ribbon
location is consistent with the field line footpoints of a fan-shaped magnetic structure that connects
the flaring region and the ambient decaying field; 2) the second M2.6 flare occurred when the expanding
coronal loops driven by the first M2.0 flare encountered the background decayed field. 3) Immediately
after the second flare, the secondary ribbon developed along with dimming regions. Based on our
findings, we suggest that interaction between the expanding sigmoid field and the overlying fan-shaped
field triggered the secondary reconnection that resulted in the field opening and formation of
the quasi-circular secondary ribbon. We thus conclude that interaction between the active region
and the ambient large-scale fields should be taken into account to fully understand the entire eruption
process.
