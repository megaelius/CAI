Metals observed in the atmospheres of white dwarfs suggest that many have recently accreted planetary
bodies. In some cases, the compositions observed suggest the accretion of material dominantly
from the core (or the mantle) of a differentiated planetary body. Collisions between differentiated
exoplanetesimals produce such fragments. In this work, we take advantage of the large numbers of
white dwarfs where at least one siderophile (core-loving) and one lithophile (rock-loving) species
have been detected to assess how commonly exoplanetesimals differentiate. We utilise N-body simulations
that track the fate of core and mantle material during the collisional evolution of planetary systems
to show that most remnants of differentiated planetesimals retain core fractions similar to their
parents, whilst some are extremely core-rich or mantle-rich. Comparison with the white dwarf data
for calcium and iron indicates that the data are consistent with a model in which $66^{+4}_{-6}\%$
have accreted the remnants of differentiated planetesimals, whilst $31^{+5}_{-5}\%$ have Ca/Fe
abundances altered by the effects of heating (although the former can be as high as $100\%$, if heating
is ignored). These conclusions assume pollution by a single body and that collisional evolution
retains similar features across diverse planetary systems. These results imply that both collisions
and differentiation are key processes in exoplanetary systems. We highlight the need for a larger
sample of polluted white dwarfs with precisely determined metal abundances to better understand
the process of differentiation in exoplanetary systems.
