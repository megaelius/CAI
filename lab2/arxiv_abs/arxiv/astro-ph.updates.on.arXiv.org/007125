(Abridged) We explore 7 clusters from LoCuSS at z~0.2 with spectra of ~2700 cluster members from
the ACReS Hectospec survey covering a region which corresponds to about three virial radii for each
cluster. We measure fluxes of five emission lines of cluster members enabling us to unambiguously
derive O/H gas metallicities, and also SFRs from extinction corrected Halpha fluxes. We compare
our cluster galaxy sample with a field sample of ~1000 galaxies at similar redshifts observed with
Hectospec. We find that star-forming cluster and field galaxies show similar median specific SFRs
in a given mass bin, but their O/H values are displaced to higher values at projected radii of R<R200
compared with galaxies at larger radii and in the field. The comparison with metallicity-SFR-mass
model predictions with inflowing gas indicates a slow-quenching scenario in which strangulation
is initiated when galaxies pass R~R200 by stopping the inflow of gas. The metallicities of cluster
members inside R200 are thereby increasing, but their SFRs are hardly affected for a period of time,
because these galaxies consume available disk gas. We use the fraction of star-forming cluster
galaxies as a function of clustercentric radius compared to predictions from the Millennium simulation
to constrain quenching timescales to be 1-2Gyrs. This is consistent with a slow-then-rapid quenching
scenario. Slow quenching (strangulation) starts when the gas inflow is stopped when the galaxy
passes R200 with a phase in which cluster galaxies are still star-forming, but they show elevated
metallicities tracing the ongoing quenching. This phase lasts for 1-2Gyrs, meanwhile the galaxies
travel to denser inner regions of the cluster, and is followed by a "rapid" phase: a rapid complete
quenching of star formation due to the increasing ram-pressure towards the cluster center which
can also strip the cold gas in massive galaxies.
