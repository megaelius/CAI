Context. HCN is a major constituent of the circumstellar envelopes of carbon-rich evolved stars,
and rotational lines from within its vibrationally excited states probe parts of these regions
closest to the stellar surface. A number of such lines are known to show maser action. Historically,
in one of them, the 177 GHz $J=2\rightarrow1$ line in the $l$-doubled bending mode has been found
to show relatively strong maser action, with results only published for a single object, the archetypical
high-mass loss asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star IRC+10216. Aims. To examine how common 177 GHz
HCN maser emission is, we conducted an exploratory survey for this line toward a select sample of
carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars that are observable from the southern hemisphere. Methods.
We used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment 12 meter submillimeter Telescope (APEX) equipped with
a new receiver to simultaneously observe three $J=2\rightarrow1$ HCN rotational transitions,
the $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm c}},0)$ and $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm d}},0)$ $l$-doublet components, and the line
from the (0,0,0) ground state. Results. The $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm c}},0)$ maser line is detected toward
11 of 13 observed sources, which all show emission in the (0,0,0) transition. In most of the sources,
the peak intensity of the $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm c}},0)$ line rivals that of the (0,0,0) line; in two sources,
it is even stronger. Except for the object with the highest mass-loss rate, IRC+10216, the $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm
c}},0)$ line covers a smaller velocity range than the (0,0,0) line. Conclusions. Maser emission
in the 177 GHz $J=2\rightarrow1$ $(0,1^{{1}_{\rm c}},0)$ line of HCN appears to be common in carbon-rich
AGB stars. (Abbreviated)
