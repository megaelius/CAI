We introduce the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), a tool developed for machine vision that
we propose as a new metric for the systematic characterization of observations of atomic and molecular
gas and the study of molecular cloud formation models. In essence, the HOG technique takes as input
extended spectral-line observations from two tracers and provides an estimate of their spatial
correlation across velocity channels. We characterize HOG using synthetic observations of HI
and $^{13}$CO(J=1-0) emission from numerical simulations of MHD turbulence leading to the formation
of molecular gas after the collision of two atomic clouds. We find a significant spatial correlation
between the two tracers in velocity channels where $v_{HI}\approx v_{^{13}CO}$, independent
of the orientation of the collision with respect to the line of sight. We use HOG to investigate the
spatial correlation of the HI, from the THOR survey, and the $^{13}$CO(J=1-0) emission, from the
GRS, toward the portion of the Galactic plane 33.75$\lt l\lt$35.25$^{o}$ and $|b|\lt$1.25$^{o}$.
We find a significant spatial correlation between the tracers in extended portions of the studied
region. Although some of the regions with high spatial correlation are associated with HI self-absorption
features, suggesting that it is produced by the cold atomic gas, the correlation is not exclusive
to this kind of region. The HOG results also indicate significant differences between individual
regions: some show spatial correlation in channels around $v_{HI}\approx v_{^{13}CO}$ while
others present this correlation in velocity channels separated by a few km/s. We associate these
velocity offsets to the effect of feedback and to the presence of physical conditions that are not
included in the atomic-cloud-collision simulations, such as more general magnetic field configurations,
shear, and global gas infall.
