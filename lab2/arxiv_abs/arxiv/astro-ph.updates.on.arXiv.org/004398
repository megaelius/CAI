In this paper, weak turbulence theory is used to investigate the nonlinear evolution of the parametric
instability in 3D low-$\beta$ plasmas at wavelengths much greater than the ion inertial length
under the assumption that slow magnetosonic waves are strongly damped. It is shown analytically
that the parametric instability leads to an inverse cascade of Alfv\'en wave quanta, and several
exact solutions to the wave kinetic equations are presented. The main results of the paper concern
the parametric decay of Alfv\'en waves that initially satisfy $e^+ \gg e^-$, where $e^+$ and $e^-$
are the frequency ($\,f$) spectra of Alfv\'en waves propagating in opposite directions along the
magnetic field lines. If $e^+$ initially has a peak frequency $f_0$ (at which $f e^+$ is maximized)
and an "infrared" scaling $f^p$ at smaller $f$ with $-1 < p < 1$, then $e^+$ acquires an $f^{-1}$ scaling
throughout a range of frequencies that spreads out in both directions from $f_0$. At the same time,
$e^-$ acquires an $f^{-2}$ scaling within this same frequency range. If the plasma parameters and
infrared $e^+$ spectrum are chosen to match conditions in the fast solar wind at a heliocentric distance
of 0.3 astronomical units (AU), then the nonlinear evolution of the parametric instability leads
to an $e^+$ spectrum that matches fast-wind measurements from the Helios spacecraft at 0.3 AU, including
the observed $f^{-1}$ scaling at $f \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-4} \mbox{ Hz}$. The results of this paper
suggest that the $f^{-1}$ spectrum seen by Helios in the fast solar wind at $f \gtrsim 3\times 10^{-4}
\mbox{ Hz}$ is produced in situ by parametric decay and that the $f^{-1}$ range of $e^+$ extends over
an increasingly narrow range of frequencies as $r$ decreases below 0.3 AU. This prediction will
be tested by measurements from the Parker Solar Probe.
