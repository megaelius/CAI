Ultraviolet (UV) observations of local star-forming galaxies have begun to establish an empirical
baseline for interpreting the rest-UV spectra of reionization-era galaxies. However, existing
high-ionization emission line measurements at $z>6$ ($\mathrm{W_{C IV, 0}} \gtrsim 20$ {\AA})
are uniformly stronger than observed locally ($\mathrm{W_{C IV, 0}} \lesssim 2$ {\AA}), likely
due to the relatively high metallicities ($Z/Z_\odot > 0.1$) typically probed by UV surveys of nearby
galaxies. We present new HST/COS spectra of six nearby ($z<0.01$) extremely metal-poor galaxies
(XMPs, $Z/Z_\odot \lesssim 0.1$) targeted to address this limitation and provide constraints
on the highly-uncertain ionizing spectra powered by low-metallicity massive stars. Our data reveal
a range of spectral features, including one of the most prominent nebular C IV doublets yet observed
in local star-forming systems and strong He II emission. Using all published UV observations of
local XMPs to-date, we find that nebular C IV emission is ubiquitous in very high specific star formation
rate systems at low metallicity, but still find equivalent widths smaller than those measured in
individual lensed systems at $z>6$. Our moderate-resolution HST/COS data allow us to conduct an
analysis of the stellar winds in a local nebular C IV emitter, which suggests that some of the tension
with $z>6$ data may be due to existing local samples not yet probing sufficiently high $\mathrm{\alpha/Fe}$
abundance ratios. Our results indicate that C IV emission can play a crucial role in the JWST and ELT
era by acting as an accessible signpost of very low metallicity ($Z/Z_\odot < 0.1$) massive stars
in assembling reionization-era systems.
