In the early Universe finding massive galaxies that have stopped forming stars present an observational
challenge as their rest-frame ultraviolet emission is negligible and they can only be reliably
identified by extremely deep near-infrared surveys. These have revealed the presence of massive,
quiescent early-type galaxies appearing in the universe as early as z$\sim$2, an epoch 3 Gyr after
the Big Bang. Their age and formation processes have now been explained by an improved generation
of galaxy formation models where they form rapidly at z$\sim$3-4, consistent with the typical masses
and ages derived from their observations. Deeper surveys have now reported evidence for populations
of massive, quiescent galaxies at even higher redshifts and earlier times, however the evidence
for their existence, and redshift, has relied entirely on coarsely sampled photometry. These early
massive, quiescent galaxies are not predicted by the latest generation of theoretical models.
Here, we report the spectroscopic confirmation of one of these galaxies at redshift z=3.717 with
a stellar mass of 1.7$\times$10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ whose absorption line spectrum shows no current
star-formation and which has a derived age of nearly half the age of the Universe at this redshift.
The observations demonstrates that the galaxy must have quickly formed the majority of its stars
within the first billion years of cosmic history in an extreme and short starburst. This ancestral
event is similar to those starting to be found by sub-mm wavelength surveys pointing to a possible
connection between these two populations. Early formation of such massive systems is likely to
require significant revisions to our picture of early galaxy assembly.
