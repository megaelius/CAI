Many previous authors have attempted to find explanations for Westeros's climate, characterized
by a generally moderate, Earth-like climate punctuated by extremely long and cold winters, separated
by thousands of years. One explanation that has been proposed is that the planet orbits in a Sitnikov
configuration, where two equal-mass stars (or a star and a black hole) orbit each other on slightly
eccentric orbits, and the planet moves along a line through the barycenter perpendicular to the
primaries' orbital plane (Freistetter & Gr\"utzbauch 2018). We modify an intermediate-complexity
GCM to include the effects of such an orbit and integrate it for thousands of years to determine whether
such an orbit can a) be habitable and b) explain the climatic variations observed by the inhabitants
of Westeros, in both double-star and star-black hole configurations. While configurations with
low primary eccentricity and initial conditions that permit only small excursions from the ecliptic
plane are habitable, these orbits are too stable to explain Westerosi climate. We find that while
orbits with more bounded chaos are able to produce rare anomalously long and cold winters similar
to Westeros's Long Night, huge variations in incident stellar flux on normal orbital timescales
should render these planets uninhabitable. We note that the presence of an orbital megastructure,
either around the planet or the barycenter, could block some of the sunlight during crossings of
the primaries' orbital plane and preserve Westeros's habitability. While we find that bounded
chaotic Sitnikov orbits are a viable explanation for Westeros's Long Night, we propose that chaotic
variations of the planet's axial tilt or semimajor axis, potentially due to torques from nearby
planets or stars, may be a more realistic explanation than Sitnikov orbits.
