We have studied the long-term evolution of star clusters of the solar neighborhood, starting from
their birth in gaseous clumps until their complete dissolution in the Galactic tidal field. We have
combined the "local-density-driven cluster formation model" of Parmentier & Pfalzner (2013)
with direct N-body simulations of clusters following instantaneous gas expulsion. We have studied
the relation between cluster dissolution time, $t_{dis}$, and cluster "initial" mass, $M_{init}$,
defined as the cluster {mass at the end of the dynamical response to gas expulsion (i.e. violent relaxation),
when the cluster age is 20-30 Myr}. We consider the "initial" mass to be consistent with other works
which neglect violent relaxation. The model clusters formed with a high star formation efficiency
(SFE -- i.e. gas mass fraction converted into stars) follow a tight mass-dependent relation, in
agreement with previous theoretical studies. However, the low-SFE models present a large scatter
in both the "initial" mass and the dissolution time, and a shallower mass-dependent relation than
high-SFE clusters. Both groups differ in their structural properties on the average. Combining
two populations of clusters, high- and low-SFE ones, with domination of the latter, yields a cluster
dissolution time for the solar neighborhood in agreement with that inferred from observations,
without any additional destructive processes such as giant molecular cloud encounters. An apparent
mass-independent relation may emerge for our low-SFE clusters when we neglect low-mass clusters
(as expected for extra-galactic observations), although more simulations are needed to investigate
this aspect.
