The hypervelocity star (HVS) survey conducted at the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) identified
42 B-type stars in the Galactic halo whose radial velocity in the Galactic rest-frame exceeds $+275\,$km$\,$s${}^{-1}$.
In order to unravel the nature and origin of those high-velocity outliers, their complete six-dimensional
phase space information is needed. To this end, we complemented positions and proper motions from
the second data release of {\it Gaia} with revised radial velocities and spectrophotometric distances
that are based on a reanalysis of the available MMT spectra of 40 objects using state-of-the-art
model spectra and a tailored analysis strategy. The resulting position and velocity vectors for
37 stars were then used as input for a subsequent kinematic investigation to obtain as complete a
picture as possible. The combination of projected rotational velocity, position in the Kiel diagram,
and kinematic properties suggests that all objects in the sample except two (B576, B598) are very
likely to be main sequence stars. While the available data are still not precise enough to constrain
the place of origin for 19 program stars, we identified eight objects that either come from the outer
rim of the Galactic disk or not from the disk at all, along with ten that presumably stem from the Galactic
disk. For almost all of those 18 targets with more or less well-constrained spatial origin, the Galactic
center (GC) is disqualified as a possible place of origin. The most notable exception is B576, the
origin of which coincides extremely well with the GC when assuming a blue horizontal branch (BHB)
nature for it. HVS$\,$22 is by far the most extreme object in the sample. Although its origin is completely
unconstrained, an ejection from the GC by the Hills mechanism is the most plausible explanation
for its current Galactic rest-frame velocity of $1530^{+690}_{-560}\,$km$\,$s${}^{-1}$.
