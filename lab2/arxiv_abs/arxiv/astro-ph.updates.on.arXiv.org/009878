We construct samples of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with low-frequency radio data from
the recent released TGSS AD1 catalog at 150 MHz. With these samples, we compare the properties of
jet power for blazars, radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RL-NLS1s), young radio sources
(YRSs) and radio galaxies. The jet-disk connection, and the unification of jetted AGNs are explored.
On the Eddington ratio --- Eddington-scaled jet power plane, jetted AGNs can be generally divided
into two populations. Low power radio galaxies, low excitation FR IIs (LEG/FR IIs), and most YRSs
show larger jet power than accretion power, while FSRQs, RL-NLS1s, and high excitation FR IIs (HEG/FR
IIs) are on the contrary. LEG/FR IIs share similar jet power properties with HEG/FR IIs, while their
accretion properties are different with the latter. These facts suggest an evolutional sequence
from HEG/FR IIs, LEG/FR IIs to FR Is, where the accretion and jet activities get dimmed gradually.
LEG/FR IIs are the transitional objects that accretion processes have switched off, while jets
are still active. After correcting the contribution from radio core of blazars, the unification
between blazars and radio galaxies is confirmed with the jet power distributions. The unification
involved RL-NLS1s is more complicated than the simple scenarios of black hole growth or orientation
effect. In addition, our results manifest that low synchrotron peaked BL Lacs (LBLs) contain two
distinct groups on the distribution of jet power, with one group similar with FSRQs and the other
similar with intermediate synchrotron peaked BL Lacs. The LBLs with higher jet powers might be the
aligned counterparts of LEG/FR IIs.
