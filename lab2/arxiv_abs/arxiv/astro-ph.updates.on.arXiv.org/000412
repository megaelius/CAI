We report the first results from the Clusters Around Radio-Loud AGN (CARLA) program, a Cycle 7 and
8 Spitzer Space Telescope snapshot program to investigate the environments of a large sample of
obscured and unobscured luminous radio-loud AGN at 1.2 < z < 3.2. These data, obtained for
387 fields, reach 3.6 and 4.5 um depths of [3.6] (AB) = 22.6 and [4.5] (AB) = 22.9 at the 95% completeness
level, which is two to three times fainter than L* in this redshift range. By using the color cut [3.6]-[4.5]
> -0.1 (AB), which efficiently selects high-redshift (z > 1.3) galaxies of all types, we identify
galaxy cluster member candidates in the fields of the radio-loud AGN. The local density of these
IRAC-selected sources is compared to the density of similarly selected sources in blank fields.
We find that 92% of the radio-loud AGN reside in environments richer than average. The majority (55%)
of the radio-loud AGN fields are found to be overdense at a > 2 {\sigma} level; 10% are overdense
at a > 5 {\sigma} level. A clear rise in surface density of IRAC-selected sources towards the position
of the radio-loud AGN strongly supports an association of the majority of the IRAC-selected sources
with the radio-loud AGN. Our results provide solid statistical evidence that radio-loud AGN are
likely beacons for finding high-redshift galaxy (proto-)clusters. We investigate how environment
depends on AGN type (unobscured radio-loud quasars vs. obscured radio galaxies), radio luminosity
and redshift, finding no correlation with either AGN type or radio luminosity. We find a decrease
in density with redshift, consistent with galaxy evolution for this uniform, flux-limited survey.
These results are consistent with expectations from the orientation-driven AGN unification model,
at least for the high radio luminosity regimes considered in this sample.
