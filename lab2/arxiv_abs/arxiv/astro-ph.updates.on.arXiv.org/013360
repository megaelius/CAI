Observations of the off-limb corona with the SWAP wide-field telescope in the 174\,\AA\ passband
onboard the PROBA2 mission provide an opportunity to study post-eruptive processes in the dimming
regions. We investigate morphology, temporal evolution, and plasma properties for four `deep'
off-disk coronal dimmings associated with limb coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in 2010\,--\,2017.
Using the SWAP fixed-difference images, we revealed ray-like structures that appeared in the dimming
recovery phase stretching quasi-radially to distances from 1.1 to 1.6\,$\mathrm{R}_{\odot}$
and existing from tens of minutes to several hours. Similar rays were detected earlier at distances
above 1.7\,$\mathrm{R}_{\odot}$ by the UVCS onboard the SOHO. These structures apparently represent
the coronal roots of the flux rope trunks observed by the LASCO-C2 onboard SOHO. The EUVI data onboard
the STEREO show the origins of these structures on the disc as fan rays much brighter in the 171\,\AA\
band than in 193\,\AA , which suggests their temperature being less than 2\,MK. The differential
emission measure (DEM) analysis based on the AIA multi-wavelength images onboard the SDO showed
that the emission measure (EM) in these rays compared to the pre-eruption plasma state increased
up to 45\,\% at temperatures of 0.6\,--\,0.8\,MK, whereas EM of the ambient coronal plasma with
temperatures of 1.3\,--\,3.7\,MK dropped by 19\,--\,43\,\%. For the event on 18 August 2010, the
PLASTIC instrument onboard STEREO detected signatures of the cold streams in the CME tail as enriched
with the ions Fe$^{8+}$\,--\,Fe$^{10+}$, which may be associated with the post-eruptive rays
in the solar corona.
