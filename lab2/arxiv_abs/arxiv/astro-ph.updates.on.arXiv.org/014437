The observer peculiar motion produces boosting effects in the anisotropy pattern of the background
with frequency spectral behaviours related to its spectrum. We study how the spectral behaviour
of the background isotropic monopole emission is transferred to the frequency spectra at higher
multipoles, l. We perform the analysis in terms of spherical harmonic expansion up to a certain lmax,
for various background models from radio to far-IR. We derive a system of linear equations to obtain
spherical harmonic coefficients and provide explicit solutions up to lmax=6 as linear combinations
of the signals at N=lmax+1 colatitudes. Using the symmetry of associated Legendre polynomials
with respect to {\pi}/2 the system can be separated into two subsystems, one for l=0 and even l, the
other for odd l. This improves the solutions accuracy with respect to an arbitrary colatitudes choice.
We apply the method to various types of monopole spectra represented by analytical or semi-analytical
functions, i.e. to four types of CMB distorted spectra, four types of extragalactic backgrounds
superimposed to the CMB Planckian spectrum and some combinations of them. We present our results
in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients, relationships between the observed and intrinsic
monopole spectra, maps and angular power spectra. We compare the method results with the ones obtained
using more computationally demanding numerical integrations or map generation/inversion. The
simplicity and efficiency of the method can significantly alleviate the computational effort
needed for accurate predictions and for the analysis of data from future projects. We discuss the
superposition of the CMB intrinsic anisotropies and of the effects induced by the observer motion,
exploring for the possibility of constraining the intrinsic dipole embedded in the kinematic dipole,
in the presence of CMB spectral distortions.
