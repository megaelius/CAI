We study the redshift evolution of the gas-phase O/H and N/O abundances, both (i) for individual
ISM regions within single spatially-resolved galaxies and (ii) when dealing with average abundances
in the whole ISM of many unresolved galaxies. We make use of a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation
including detailed chemical enrichment, which properly takes into account the variety of different
stellar nucleosynthetic sources of O and N in galaxies. We identify $33$ galaxies in the simulation,
lying within dark matter halos with virial mass in the range $10^{11}\le M_{\text{DM}} \le 10^{13}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$
and reconstruct how they evolved with redshift. For the local and global measurements, the observed
increasing trend of N/O at high O/H can be explained, respectively, (i) as the consequence of metallicity
gradients which have settled in the galaxy interstellar medium, where the innermost galactic regions
have the highest O/H abundances and the highest N/O ratios, and (ii) as the consequence of an underlying
average mass-metallicity relation that galaxies obey as they evolve across cosmic epochs, where
-- at any redshift -- less massive galaxies have lower average O/H and N/O ratios than the more massive
ones. We do not find a strong dependence on the environment. For both local and global relations,
the predicted N/O--O/H relation is due to the mostly secondary origin of N in stars. We also predict
that the O/H and N/O gradients in the galaxy interstellar medium gradually flatten as functions
of redshift, with the average N/O ratios being strictly coupled with the galaxy star formation history.
Because N production strongly depends on O abundances, we obtain a universal relation for the N/O--O/H
abundance diagram whether we consider average abundances of many unresolved galaxies put together
or many abundance measurements within a single spatially-resolved galaxy.
