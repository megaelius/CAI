Extremely irradiated hot Jupiters, exoplanets reaching dayside temperatures ${>}$2000 K, stretch
our understanding of planetary atmospheres and the models we use to interpret observations. While
these objects are planets in every other sense, their atmospheres reach temperatures at low pressures
comparable only to stellar atmospheres. In order to understand our \textit{a priori} theoretical
expectations for the nature of these objects, we self-consistently model a number of extreme hot
Jupiter scenarios with the PHOENIX model atmosphere code. PHOENIX is well-tested on objects from
cool brown dwarfs to expanding supernovae shells and its expansive opacity database from the UV
to far-IR make PHOENIX well-suited for understanding extremely irradiated hot Jupiters. We find
several fundamental differences between hot Jupiters at temperatures ${>}$2500 K and their cooler
counterparts. First, absorption by atomic metals like Fe and Mg, molecules including SiO and metal
hydrides, and continuous opacity sources like H$^-$ all combined with the short-wavelength output
of early-type host stars result in strong thermal inversions, without the need for TiO or VO. Second,
many molecular species, including H$_2$O, TiO, and VO are thermally dissociated at pressures probed
by eclipse observations, biasing retrieval algorithms that assume uniform vertical abundances.
We discuss other interesting properties of these objects, as well as future prospects and predictions
for observing and characterizing this unique class of astrophysical object, including the first
self-consistent model of the hottest known jovian planet, KELT-9b.
