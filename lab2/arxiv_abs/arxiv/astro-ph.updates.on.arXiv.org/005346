This study concentrates on advancing mathematical and computational methodology for radar tomography
imaging in which the unknown volumetric velocity distribution of a wave within a bounded domain
is to be reconstructed. Our goal is to enable effective simulation and inversion of a large amount
of full-wave data within a realistic 2D or 3D geometry. For propagating and inverting the wave, we
present a rigorous multigrid-based forward approach which utilizes the finite-difference time-domain
method and a nested finite element grid structure. Based on the multigrid approach, we introduce
and validate a multiresolution algorithm which allows regularization of the unknown distribution
through a coarse-to-fine inversion scheme. In this approach, sparse signals can be effectively
inverted, as the coarse fluctuations are reconstructed before the finer ones. Furthermore, the
number of nonzero entries in the system matrix can be compressed and thus the inversion procedure
can be speeded up. As a test scenario we investigate satellite-based asteroid interior reconstruction.
We use both full-wave and projected wave data and estimate the accuracy of the inversion under different
error sources: noise and positioning inaccuracies. The results suggest that the present full-wave
inversion approach allows recovering the interior with a single satellite recording backscattering
data. It seems that robust results can be achieved, when the peak-to-peak signal-to-noise ratio
is above 10 dB. Furthermore, it seems that reconstructing the deep interior can be enhanced if two
satellites can be utilized in the measurements.
