We present a statistical study of 62 coronal dimming events associated with Earth-directed CMEs
during the quasi-quadrature period of STEREO and SDO. This unique setting allows us to study both
phenomena in great detail and compare characteristic quantities statistically. Coronal dimmings
are observed on-disk by SDO/AIA and HMI, while the CME kinematics during the impulsive acceleration
phase is studied close to the limb with STEREO/EUVI and COR, minimizing projection effects. The
dimming area, its total unsigned magnetic flux and its total brightness, reflecting properties
of the total dimming region at its final extent, show the highest correlations with the CME mass ($c\sim0.6-0.7$).
Their corresponding time derivatives, describing the dynamics of the dimming evolution, show
the strongest correlations with the CME peak velocity ($c\sim 0.6$). The highest correlation of
$c=0.68\pm0.08$ is found with the mean intensity of dimmings, indicating that the lower the CME
starts in the corona, the faster it propagates. No significant correlation between dimming parameters
and the CME acceleration was found. However, for events where high-cadence STEREO observations
were available, the mean unsigned magnetic field density in the dimming regions tends to be positively
correlated with the CME peak acceleration ($c=0.42\pm0.20$). This suggests that stronger magnetic
fields result in higher Lorentz forces providing stronger driving force for the CME acceleration.
Specific coronal dimming parameters correlate with both, CME and flare quantities providing further
evidence for the flare-CME feedback relationship. For events in which the CME occurs together with
a flare, coronal dimmings statistically reflect the properties of both phenomena.
