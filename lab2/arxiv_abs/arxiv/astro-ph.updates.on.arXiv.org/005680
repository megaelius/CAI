We present analysis of the magnetic field in seven solar flare regions accompanied by the pulsations
of hard X-ray (HXR) emission. These flares were studied by Kuznetsov et al. (2016) (Paper~I), and
chosen here because of the availability of the vector magnetograms for their parent active regions
(ARs) obtained with the SDO/HMI data. In Paper~I, based on the observations only, it was suggested
that a magnetic flux rope (MFR) might play an important role in the process of generation of the HXR
pulsations. The goal of the present paper is to test this hypothesis by using the extrapolation of
magnetic field with the non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) method. Having done this, we found
that before each flare indeed there was an MFR elongated along and above a magnetic polarity inversion
line (MPIL) on the photosphere. In two flare regions the sources of the HXR pulsations were located
at the footpoints of different magnetic field lines wrapping around the central axis, and constituting
an MFR by themselves. In five other flares the parent field lines of the HXR pulsations were not a part
of an MFR, but surrounded it in the form of an arcade of magnetic loops. These results show that, at
least in the analyzed cases, the "single flare loop" models do not satisfy the observations and magnetic
field modeling, while are consistent with the concept that the HXR pulsations are a consequence
of successive episodes of energy release and electron acceleration in different magnetic flux
tubes (loops) of a complex AR. An MFR could generate HXR pulsations by triggering episodes of magnetic
reconnection in different loops in the course of its non-uniform evolution along an MPIL. However,
since three events studied here were confined flares, actual eruptions may not be required to trigger
sequential particle acceleration episodes in the magnetic systems containing an MFR.
