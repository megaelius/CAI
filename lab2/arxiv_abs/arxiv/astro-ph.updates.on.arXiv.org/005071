Large-scale solar eruptions have been extensively explored over many years. However, the properties
of small-scale events with associated shocks have been rarely investigated. We present the analyses
of a small-scale short-duration event originating from a small region. The impulsive phase of the
M1.9-class flare lasted only for four minutes. The kinematic evolution of the CME hot channel reveals
some exceptional characteristics including a very short duration of the main acceleration phase
($<$ 2 minutes), a rather high maximal acceleration rate ($\sim$50 km s$^{-2}$) and peak velocity
($\sim$1800 km s$^{-1}$). The fast and impulsive kinematics subsequently results in a piston-driven
shock related to a metric type II radio burst with a high starting frequency of $\sim$320 MHz of the
fundamental band. The type II source is formed at a low height of below $1.1~\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$
less than $\sim2$ minutes after the onset of the main acceleration phase. Through the band split
of the type II burst, the shock compression ratio decreases from 2.2 to 1.3, and the magnetic field
strength of the shock upstream region decreases from 13 to 0.5 Gauss at heights of 1.1 to 2.3 $~\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$.
We find that the CME ($\sim4\times10^{30}\,\mathrm{erg}$) and flare ($\sim1.6\times10^{30}\,\mathrm{erg}$)
consume similar amount of magnetic energy. The same conclusion for large-scale eruptions implies
that small- and large-scale events possibly share the similar relationship between CMEs and flares.
The kinematic particularities of this event are possibly related to the small footpoint-separation
distance of the associated magnetic flux rope, as predicted by the Erupting Flux Rope model.
