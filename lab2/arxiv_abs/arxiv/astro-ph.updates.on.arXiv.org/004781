Observational efforts to image the immediate environment of a black hole at the scale of the event
horizon benefit from the development of efficient imaging codes that are capable of producing synthetic
data, which may be compared with observational data. We aim to present RAPTOR, a new public code that
produces accurate images, animations, and spectra of relativistic plasmas in strong gravity by
numerically integrating the equations of motion of light rays and performing time-dependent radiative
transfer calculations along the rays. The code is compatible with any analytical or numerical spacetime.
It is hardware-agnostic and may be compiled and run both on GPUs and CPUs. We describe the algorithms
used in RAPTOR and test the code's performance. We have performed a detailed comparison of RAPTOR
output with that of other radiative-transfer codes and demonstrate convergence of the results.
We then applied RAPTOR to study accretion models of supermassive black holes, performing time-dependent
radiative transfer through general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations
and investigating the expected observational differences between the so-called fast-light and
slow-light paradigms. Using RAPTOR to produce synthetic images and light curves of a GRMHD model
of an accreting black hole, we find that the relative difference between fast-light and slow-light
light curves is less than 5%. Using two distinct radiative-transfer codes to process the same data,
we find integrated flux densities with a relative difference less than 0.01%. For two-dimensional
GRMHD models, such as those examined in this paper, the fast-light approximation suffices as long
as errors of a few percent are acceptable. The convergence of the results of two different codes demonstrates
that they are, at a minimum, consistent.
