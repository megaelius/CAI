NGC 4494 is one of several intermediate-luminosity elliptical galaxies inferred to have an unusually
diffuse dark matter halo. We use the chi^2-made-to-measure particle code NMAGIC to construct axisymmetric
models of NGC 4494 from photometric and various kinematic data. The extended kinematics include
light spectra in multiple slitlets out to 3.5 R_e, and hundreds of planetary nebulae velocities
out to ~7 R_e, thus allowing us to probe the dark matter content and orbital structure in the halo.
We use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate confidence boundaries for the halo parameters, given
our data and modelling set-up. We find that the true potential of the dark matter halo is recovered
within Delta G (merit function)<26 (Delta chi^2<59) at 70% confidence level (C.L.), and
within Delta G<32 (Delta chi^2<70) at 90% C.L.. These numbers are much larger than the usually
assumed Delta chi^2=2.3 (4.6) for 70% (90%) C.L. for two free parameters, perhaps case-dependent,
but calling into question the general validity of the standard assumptions used for halo and black
hole mass determinations. The best-fitting models for NGC 4494 have a dark matter fraction of about
0.6\pm0.1 at 5R_e (70% C.L.), and are embedded in a dark matter halo with circular velocity ~200 km/s.
The total circular velocity curve (CVC) is approximately flat at v_c=220 km/s outside ~0.5R_e.
The orbital anisotropy of the stars is moderately radial. These results are independent of the assumed
inclination of the galaxy, and edge-on models are preferred. Comparing with the halos of NGC 3379
and NGC 4697, whose velocity dispersion profiles also decrease rapidly from the center outwards,
the outer CVCs and dark matter halos are quite similar. NGC 4494 shows a particularly high dark matter
fraction inside ~3R_e, and a strong concentration of baryons in the center.
