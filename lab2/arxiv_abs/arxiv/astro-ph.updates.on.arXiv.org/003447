We address the turbulent-fragmentation scenario for the origin of the stellar initial mass function
(IMF), using a large set of numerical simulations of randomly driven supersonic MHD turbulence.
While radiation and outflows from protostars are often invoked, the turbulent-fragmentation
model successfully predicts the main features of the observed stellar IMF assuming an isothermal
equation of state without any stellar feedback. As a test of the model, we focus on the case of a magnetized
isothermal gas, neglecting stellar feedback, while pursuing a large dynamic range in both space
and time scales in order to generate a large number of stars, covering the full spectrum of stellar
masses from brown dwarfs to massive stars. Our simulations represent a generic 4 pc region within
a typical Galactic molecular cloud (MC), with a mass of 3,000 Msun, an rms velocity ten times the isothermal
sound speed and five times the average Alfven velocity, in agreement with MC observations. We achieve
a maximum resolution of 50 AU and a maximum duration of star formation of 4.0 Myr, forming up to a thousand
sink particles whose mass distribution closely match the observed stellar IMF. A large set of medium-size
simulations is used to test the sink particle scheme, while larger simulations are used to test the
numerical convergence of the IMF and the dependence of the IMF turnover on physical parameters predicted
by the turbulent-fragmentation model. We find clear evidence of numerical convergence and strong
support for the model predictions, including the initial time evolution of the IMF. We conclude
that the physics of isothermal MHD turbulence is sufficient to explain the origin of the IMF.
