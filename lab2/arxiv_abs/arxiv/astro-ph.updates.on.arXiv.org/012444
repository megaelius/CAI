We discuss how reactive and dissipative non-linearities affect the intrinsic response of superconducting
thin-film resonators. We explain how most, if not all, of the complex phenomena commonly seen can
be described by a model in which the underlying resonance is a single-pole Lorentzian, but whose
centre frequency and quality factor change as external parameters, such as readout power and frequency,
are varied. What is seen during a vector-network-analyser measurement is series of samples taken
from an ideal Lorentzian that is shifting and spreading as the readout frequency is changed. According
to this model, it is perfectly proper to refer to, and measure, the resonant frequency and quality
factor of the underlying resonance, even though the swept-frequency curves appear highly distorted
and hysteretic. In those cases where the resonance curve is highly distorted, the specific shape
of the trajectory in the Argand plane gives valuable insights into the second-order physical processes
present. We discuss the formulation and consequences of this approach in the case of non-linear
kinetic inductance, two-level-system loss, quasiparticle generation, and a generic model based
on a power-law form. The generic model captures the key features of specific dissipative non-linearities,
but additionally leads to insights into how general dissipative processes create characteristic
forms in the Argand plane. We provide detailed formulations in each case, and indicate how they lead
to the wide variety of phenomena commonly seen in experimental data. We also explain how the properties
of the underlying resonance can be extracted from this data. Overall, our paper provides a self-contained
compendium of behaviour that will help practitioners interpret and determine important parameters
from distorted swept-frequency measurements.
