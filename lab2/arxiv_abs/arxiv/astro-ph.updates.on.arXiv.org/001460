The microquasar GX 339-4 was observed by Suzaku five times, spaced by a few days, during its transition
back to the hard state at the end of its 2010-2011 outburst. The 2-10 keV source flux decreases by a
factor ~10 between the beginning and the end of the monitoring. Simultaneous radio and OIR observations
highlighted the re-ignition of the radio emission just before the beginning of the campaign, the
maximum radio emission being reached between the two first Suzaku pointings, while the IR peaked
a few weeks latter. A fluorescent iron line is always significantly detected. Fits with a gaussian
or Laor profiles give statistically equivalent results. In the case of a Laor profile, fits of the
five data sets simultaneously agree with a disk inclination angle of ~20 degrees. The disk inner
radius is <10-30 R_g in the first two observations but almost unconstrained in the last three.
A soft X-ray excess is also present in these two first observations. Fits with a multicolor disk component
give disk inner radii in agreement with those obtained with the iron line fits. The use of a physically
more realistic model, including a blurred reflection component and a comptonization continuum,
give some hints of the increase of the disk inner radius but the significances are always weak. Interestingly,
the addition of warm absorption significantly improves the fit of OBS1 while it is not needed in the
other observations. The radio-jet re-ignition occurring between OBS1 and OBS2, these absorption
features may indicate the natural evolution from a disk wind and a jet. The comparison with a long
2008 Suzaku observation of GX 339-4 in a persistent faint hard state where a narrow iron line clearly
indicates a disk recession, is discussed.
