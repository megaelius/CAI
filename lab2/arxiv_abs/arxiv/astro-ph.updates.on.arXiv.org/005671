We present the Technicolor Dawn simulations, a suite of cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations of the first 1.2 billion years. By modeling a spatially-inhomogeneous UVB on-the-fly
with 24 frequency bins and resolving dark matter halos down to $10^8 M_\odot$ within 12$h^{-1}$
Mpc volumes, the Technicolor Dawn simulations unify a wide variety of observations of the IGM, CGM,
galaxies, and reionization into a single framework. The only empirically-tuned parameter, the
fraction of ionizing photons that escape the interstellar medium, is adjusted to match observations
of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and the cosmic microwave background. With this single calibration,
the Technicolor Dawn simulations can reproduce the history of reionization; the stellar mass-star
formation rate relation of galaxies; the number density and metallicity of DLAs at $z \sim 5$; the
abundance of weak metal absorbers; the UVB amplitude; and the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum
at $z = 5.4$. The galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions are underproduced by $\leq 2 \times$,
suggesting an overly vigorous subgrid feedback model. The mean transmission in the Lyman-$\alpha$
forest is underproduced at $z < 6$, indicating tension between measurements of the UVB amplitude
and Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission. The observed SiIV column density distribution is reasonably
well-reproduced ($\sim 1 \sigma$ low). By contrast, CIV remains significantly underproduced
despite being boosted by an intense $> 4$ Ryd UVB. Solving this problem by increasing metal yields
would overproduce both weak absorbers and DLA metallicities. Instead, the observed strength of
high-ionization emission from high-redshift galaxies and absorption from their environments
suggest that the ionizing flux from conventional stellar population models is too soft.
