Atmospheric circulation patterns derived from multi-spectral remote sensing can serve as a guide
for choosing a suitable entry site for a future in situ probe mission. Since the Voyager-2 flybys
in the 1980s, three decades of observations from ground- and space-based observatories have generated
a picture of Ice Giant circulation that is complex, perplexing, and altogether unlike that seen
on the Gas Giants. This review seeks to reconcile the various competing circulation patterns from
an observational perspective, accounting for spatially-resolved measurements of: zonal albedo
contrasts and banded appearances; cloud-tracked zonal winds; temperature and para-H$_2$ measurements
above the condensate clouds; and equator-to-pole contrasts in condensable volatiles (methane
and hydrogen sulphide) in the deeper troposphere. These observations identify three distinct
latitude domains: an equatorial domain of deep upwelling and upper-tropospheric subsidence,
potentially bounded by peaks in the retrograde zonal jet and analogous to Jovian cyclonic belts;
a mid-latitude transitional domain of upper-tropospheric upwelling, vigorous cloud activity,
analogous to Jovian anticyclonic zones; and a polar domain of strong subsidence, volatile depletion,
and small-scale (and potentially seasonally-variable) convective activity. Taken together,
the multi-wavelength observations suggest a tiered structure of stacked circulation cells (at
least two in the troposphere and one in the stratosphere), potentially separated in the vertical
by (i) strong molecular weight gradients associated with cloud condensation, and by (ii) transitions
from a thermally-direct circulation regime at depth to a wave-driven circulation regime at high
altitude. The inferred circulation can be tested in the coming decade by 3D simulations and by observations
from future world-class facilities. [Abridged]
