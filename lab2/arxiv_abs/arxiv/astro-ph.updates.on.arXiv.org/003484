The physical significance of tidal deformation in astronomical systems has long been known. The
recently discovered universal I-Love-Q relations, which connect moment of inertia, quadrupole
tidal Love number, and spin-induced quadrupole moment of compact stars, also underscore the special
role of tidal deformation in gravitational wave astronomy. Motivated by the observation that such
relations also prevail in Newtonian stars and crucially depend on the stiffness of a star, we consider
the tidal Love numbers of Newtonian polytropic stars whose stiffness is characterised by a polytropic
index $n$. We first perturbatively solve the Lane-Emden equation governing the profile of polytropic
stars through the application of the scaled delta expansion method and then formulate perturbation
series for the multipolar tidal Love number about the two exactly solvable cases with $n=0$ and $n=1$,
respectively. Making use of these two series to form a two-point Pad\'e approximant, we find an approximate
expression of the quadrupole tidal Love number, whose error is less than $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ per
cent (0.39 per cent) for $n\in[0,1]$ ($n\in[0,3]$). Similarly, we also determine the mass moments
for polytropic stars accurately. Based on these findings, we are able to show that the I-Love-Q relations
are in general stationary about the incompressible limit irrespective of the equation of state
(EOS) of a star. Moreover, for the I-Love-Q relations, there is a secondary stationary point near
$n \approx 0.4444$, thus showing the insensitivity to $n$ for $n\in[0,1]$. Our investigation clearly
tracks the universality of the I-Love-Q relations from their validity for stiff stars such as neutron
stars to their breakdown for soft stars.
