The scatter in the galaxy size versus stellar mass (Mstar) relation gets largely reduced when, rather
than the half-mass radius Re, the size at a fixed surface density is used. Here we address why this
happens. We show how a reduction is to be expected because any two galaxies with the same Mstar have
at least one radius with identical surface density, where the galaxies have identical size. However,
the reason why the scatter is reduced to the observed level is not trivial, and we pin it down to the
galaxy surface density profiles approximately following Sersic profiles with their Re and Sersic
index (n) anti-correlated (i.e., given Mstar, n increases when Re decreases). Our analytical results
describe very well the behavior of the observed galaxies as portrayed in the NASA Sloan Atlas (NSA),
which contains more than half a million local objects with 7 < log(Mstar/Msun) < 11.5. The comparison
with NSA galaxies also allows us to find the optimal values for the mass surface density (2.4m0.9p1.3
Msun/pc2) and surface brightness (r-band 24.7pm0.5 mag/arcsec2) that minimize the scatter, although
the actual values depend somehow on the subset of NSA galaxies used for optimization. The physical
reason for the existence of optimal values is unknown but, as Trujillo+20 point out, they are close
to the gas surface density threshold to form stars and thus may trace the physical end of a galaxy.
Our NSA-based size--mass relation agrees with theirs on the slope as well as on the magnitude of the
scatter. As a by-product of the narrowness of the size--mass relation (only 0.06 dex), we propose
to use the size of a galaxy to measure its stellar mass. In terms of observing time, it is not more demanding
than the usual photometric techniques and may present practical advantages in particular cases.
