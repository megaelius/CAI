R Coronae Borealis stars (RCBs) are the best candidates to be the products of white dwarf mergers
in the intermediate mass range ($0.4<M_{tot}<1.1$ M$_{\odot}$). After a merger, a He envelope
surrounds a CO core, and a short-lived supergiant phase starts. RCBs correspond to that phase. They
are known to be hydrogen-deficient and carbon-rich supergiant stars. They are rare; They are also
highly diverse in chemical abundances, brightness and photosphere temperature. To understand
their evolutionary path, constrain their spatial distribution and test their formation rate,
we aim to increase significantly the number of known RCBs. To do so, we need first to create a list of
targets of interest rich in RCB stars, that will be subsequently followed-up spectroscopically
to reveal their true nature. Fortunately, RCBs are producing dust and are therefore surrounded
by warm circumstellar dust shells. Using the all-sky 2MASS and WISE infrared surveys, our goal is
to discriminate RCBs among other dust-producing stars. A series of selection criteria was applied
to colour-colour diagrams and to the brightness of all objects catalogued. The criteria were designed
using all 102 known RCB stars. RCB SED models were also used to understand the limits of the criteria
and the possible bias in terms of shell temperature selected. The analysis was complicated by the
unpredictable photometric declines that RCB stars are known to undergo. With a detection efficiency
of about 85\%, our analysis selected only 2356 targets among the 563 million objects catalogued
in the WISE All-Sky survey. This short list of targets of interest supersedes a previously published
one made from the preliminary WISE data release. This list, published in the CDS Vizier database,
will allow us to increase significantly the number of known RCB stars.
