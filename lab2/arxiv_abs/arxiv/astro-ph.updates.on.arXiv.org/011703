(abridged) The ambiguous origin of [CII] 158um in the interstellar medium complicates its use for
diagnostics concerning the star-formation rate and physical conditions in photodissociation
regions (PDRs). We observed the giant HII region N11 in the Large Magellanic Cloud with SOFIA/GREAT
in order to investigate the origin of [CII] to obtain the total H2 gas content, the fraction of CO-dark
H2 gas, and the influence of environmental effects such as stellar feedback. We present an innovative
spectral decomposition method that allows statistical trends to be derived. The [CII] line is resolved
in velocity and compared to HI and CO, using a Bayesian approach to decompose the profiles. A simple
model accounting for collisions in the neutral atomic and molecular gas was used in order to derive
the H2 column density traced by C+. The profile of [CII] most closely resembles that of CO, but the
integrated [CII] line width lies between that of CO and that of HI. Using various methods, we find
that [CII] mostly originates from the neutral gas. We show that [CII] mostly traces the CO-dark H2
gas but there is evidence of a weak contribution from neutral atomic gas preferentially in the faintest
components. Most of the molecular gas is CO-dark. The fraction of CO-dark H2 gas decreases with increasing
CO column density, with a slope that seems to depend on the impinging radiation field from nearby
massive stars. Finally we extend previous measurements of the photoelectric-effect heating efficiency,
which we find is constant across regions probed with Herschel, with [CII] and [OI] being the main
coolants in faint and diffuse, and bright and compact regions, respectively, and with PAH emission
tracing the CO-dark H2 gas heating where [CII] and [OI] emit. Our study highlights the importance
of velocity-resolved PDR diagnostics and higher spatial resolution for HI observations.
