Given its unchallenged capabilities in terms of sensitivity and spatial resolution, the combination
of imaging spectropolarimetry and numeric Stokes inversion represents the dominant technique
currently used to remotely sense the physical properties of the solar atmosphere and, in particular,
its important driving magnetic field. Solar magnetism manifests itself in a wide range of spatial,
temporal, and energetic scales. The ubiquitous but relatively small and weak fields of the so-called
quiet Sun are believed today to be crucial for answering many open questions in solar physics, some
of which have substantial practical relevance due to the strong Sun-Earth connection. However,
such fields are very challenging to detect because they require spectropolarimetric measurements
with high spatial (sub-arcsec), spectral (<100 mA), and temporal (<10 s) resolution along with
high polarimetric sensitivity (<0.001 of the intensity). We collect and discuss both well-established
and upcoming instrumental solutions developed during the last decades to push solar observations
toward the above-mentioned parameter regime. This typically involves design trade-offs due to
the high dimensionality of the data and signal-to-noise-ratio considerations, among others.
We focus on the main three components that form a spectro-polarimeter, namely, wavelength discriminators,
the devices employed to encode the incoming polarization state into intensity images (polarization
modulators), and the sensor technologies used to register them. We consider the instrumental solutions
introduced to perform this kind of measurements at different optical wavelengths and from various
observing locations, i.e., ground-based, from the stratosphere or near space.
