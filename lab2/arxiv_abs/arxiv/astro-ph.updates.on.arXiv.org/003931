In this paper, we perform a forecast analysis to test the capacity of future baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments to constrain phenomenological interacting
dark energy models using the Fisher matrix formalism. We consider a Euclid-like experiment, in
which BAO measurements is one of the main goals, to constrain the cosmological parameters of alternative
cosmological models. Moreover, additional experimental probes can more efficiently provide
information on the parameters forecast, justifying also the inclusion in the analysis of a future
ground-based CMB experiment mainly designed to measure the polarization signal with high precision.
In the interacting dark energy scenario, a coupling between dark matter and dark energy modifies
the conservation equations such that the fluid equations for both constituents are conserved as
the total energy density of the dark sector. In this context, we consider three phenomenological
models which have been deeply investigated in literature over the past years. We find that the combination
of both CMB and BAO information can break degeneracies among the dark sector parameters for all three
models, although to different extents. We found powerful constraints on, for example, the coupling
constant when comparing it with present limits for two of the models, and their future statistical
3-$\sigma$ bounds could potentially exclude the null interaction for the combination of probes
that is considered. However, for one of the models, the constraint on the coupling parameter does
not improve the present result (achieved using a large combination of surveys), and a larger combination
of probes appears to be necessary to eventually claim that interaction is favored or not in that context.
