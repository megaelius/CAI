Since the advent of the Swift satellite it has been possible to obtain precise localisations of GRB
positions of sub-arcsec accuracy within seconds, facilitating ground-based robotic telescopes
to automatically slew to the target within seconds. This has yielded a plethora of observational
data for the afterglow phase of the GRB, but the quantity of data (<2 keV) covering the initial
prompt emission still remains small. Only in a handful of cases has it been possible obtain simultaneous
coverage of the prompt emission in a multi-wavelength regime (gamma-ray to optical), as a result
of: observing the field by chance prior to the GRB (e.g. 080319B/naked-eye burst), long-prompt
emission (e.g., 080928, 110205A) or triggered on a pre-cursor (e.g., 041219A, 050820A, 061121).
This small selection of bursts have shown both correlated and uncorrelated gamma-ray and optical
light curve behaviour, and the multi-wavelength emission mechanism remains far from resolved
(i.e. single population synchrotron self-Component, electron distributions, additional neutron
components or residual collisions). Such multi-wavelength observations during the GRB prompt
phase are pivotal in providing further insight on the poorly understood prompt emission mechanism.
We add to this small sample the Swift burst 121217A that had two distinct periods of prompt emission
separated by ~700 s, observed by Swift/BAT, Swift/XRT and Fermi/GBM. As a result of the time delay
of the second emission, it enabled optical imaging (from 3 to 7 bands) to be taken with the GROND instrument
to a resolution as fine as 10s. This multi-wavelength data will hopefully allow us to shed more light
on the current picture of prompt emission physics.
