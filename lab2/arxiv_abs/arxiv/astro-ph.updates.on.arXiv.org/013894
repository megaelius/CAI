We present panchromatic observations and modeling of the Calcium-rich supernova 2019ehk in the
star-forming galaxy M100 (d$\approx$16.2 Mpc) starting 10 hours after explosion and continuing
for ~300 days. SN 2019ehk shows a double-peaked optical light curve peaking at $t = 3$ and $15$ days.
The first peak is coincident with luminous, rapidly decaying $\textit{Swift}$-XRT discovered
X-ray emission ($L_x\approx10^{41}~\rm{erg~s^{-1}}$ at 3 days; $L_x \propto t^{-3}$), and a
Shane/Kast spectral detection of narrow H$\alpha$ and He II emission lines ($v \approx 500$ km/s)
originating from pre-existent circumstellar material. We attribute this phenomenology to radiation
from shock interaction with extended, dense material surrounding the progenitor star at $r<10^{15}$
cm and the resulting cooling emission. We calculate a total CSM mass of $\sim$ $7\times10^{-3}$
$\rm{M_{\odot}}$ with particle density $n\approx10^{9}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$. Radio observations
indicate a significantly lower density $n < 10^{4}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$ at larger radii. The photometric
and spectroscopic properties during the second light curve peak are consistent with those of Ca-rich
transients (rise-time of $t_r =13.4\pm0.210$ days and a peak B-band magnitude of $M_B =-15.1\pm0.200$
mag). We find that SN 2019ehk synthesized $(3.1\pm0.11)\times10^{-2} ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ of ${}^{56}\textrm{Ni}$
and ejected $M_{\rm ej} = (0.72\pm 0.040)~\rm{M_{\odot}}$ total with a kinetic energy $E_{\rm
k}=(1.8\pm0.10)\times10^{50}~\rm{erg}$. Finally, deep $\textit{HST}$ pre-explosion imaging
at the SN site constrains the parameter space of viable stellar progenitors to massive stars in the
lowest mass bin (~10 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) in binaries that lost most of their He envelope or white dwarfs.
The explosion and environment properties of SN 2019ehk further restrict the potential WD progenitor
systems to low-mass hybrid HeCO WD + CO WD binaries.
