We present full-sky maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and polarized synchrotron and
thermal dust emission, derived from the third set of Planck frequency maps. These products have
significantly lower contamination from instrumental systematic effects than previous versions.
The methodologies used to derive these maps follow closely those described in earlier papers, adopting
four methods (Commander, NILC, SEVEM, and SMICA) to extract the CMB component, as well as three methods
(Commander, GNILC, and SMICA) to extract astrophysical components. Our revised CMB temperature
maps agree with corresponding products in the Planck 2015 delivery, whereas the polarization maps
exhibit significantly lower large-scale power, reflecting the improved data processing described
in companion papers; however, the noise properties of the resulting data products are complicated,
and the best available end-to-end simulations exhibit relative biases with respect to the data
at the few percent level. Using these maps, we are for the first time able to fit the spectral index
of thermal dust independently over 3 degree regions. We derive a conservative estimate of the mean
spectral index of polarized thermal dust emission of beta_d = 1.55 +/- 0.05, where the uncertainty
marginalizes both over all known systematic uncertainties and different estimation techniques.
For polarized synchrotron emission, we find a mean spectral index of beta_s = -3.1 +/- 0.1, consistent
with previously reported measurements. We note that the current data processing does not allow
for construction of unbiased single-bolometer maps, and this limits our ability to extract CO emission
and correlated components. The foreground results for intensity derived in this paper therefore
do not supersede corresponding Planck 2015 products. For polarization the new results supersede
the corresponding 2015 products in all respects.
