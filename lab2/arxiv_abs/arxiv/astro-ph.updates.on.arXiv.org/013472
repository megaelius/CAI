The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) is currently in the process of transforming
our view of star-forming galaxies in the distant ($z\gtrsim1$) universe. Before ALMA, most of what
we knew about dust-obscured star formation in distant galaxies was limited to the brightest submillimetre
sources -- the so-called submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) -- and even the information on those sources
was sparse, with resolved (i.e., sub-galactic) observations of the obscured star formation and
gas reservoirs typically restricted to the most extreme and/or strongly lensed sources. Starting
with the beginning of early science operations in 2011, the last nine years of ALMA observations
have ushered in a new era for studies of high-redshift star formation. With its long baselines, ALMA
has allowed observations of distant dust-obscured star formation with angular resolutions comparable
to -- or even far surpassing -- the best current optical telescopes. With its bandwidth and frequency
coverage, it has provided an unprecedented look at the associated molecular and atomic gas in these
distant galaxies through targeted follow-up and serendipitous detections/blind line scans.
Finally, with its leap in sensitivity compared to previous (sub-)millimetre arrays, it has enabled
the detection of these powerful dust/gas tracers much further down the luminosity function through
both statistical studies of color/mass-selected galaxy populations and dedicated deep fields.
We review the main advances ALMA has helped bring about in our understanding of the dust and gas properties
of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim1$) star-forming galaxies during these first nine years of its science
operations, and we highlight the interesting questions that may be answered by ALMA in the years
to come.
