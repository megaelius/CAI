Recent observations of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that heavy elements may be diluted in the gaseous
envelope, providing a compositional gradient that could stabilise ordinary convection and produce
a stably-stratified layer near the core of these planets. This region could consist of semi-convective
layers with a staircase-like density profile, which have multiple convective zones separated
by thin stably-stratified interfaces, as a result of double-diffusive convection. These layers
could have important effects on wave propagation and tidal dissipation that have not been fully
explored. We analyse the effects of these layers on the propagation and transmission of internal
waves within giant planets, extending prior work in a local Cartesian model. We adopt a simplified
global Boussinesq planetary model in which we explore the internal waves in a non-rotating spherical
body. We begin by studying the free modes of a region containing semi-convective layers. We then
analyse the transmission of internal waves through such a region. The free modes depend strongly
on the staircase properties, and consist of modes with both internal and interfacial gravity wave-like
behaviour. We determine the frequency shifts of these waves as a function of the number of steps to
explore their potential to probe planetary internal structures. We also find that wave transmission
is strongly affected by the presence of a staircase. Very large-wavelength waves are transmitted
efficiently, but small-scale waves are only transmitted if they are resonant with one of the free
modes. The effective size of the core is therefore larger for non-resonant modes.
