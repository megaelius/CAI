Previously, the X-ray emission of zeta Puppis was found to be variable with light curves harbouring
"trends" with a typical timescale longer than the exposure length. The origin of these changes was
proposed to be linked to large-scale structures in the wind, but further characterization of the
variability at high energies was needed. Since then, a number of new X-ray observations have become
available. Furthermore, a cyclic behaviour with a 1.78d period was identified in long optical photometric
runs, which is thought to be associated with the launching mechanism of large-scale wind structures.
We analysed these new X-ray data, revisited the old data, and compared X-ray with optical data, including
when simultaneous. We found that the behaviour in X-rays cannot be explained in terms of a perfect
clock because the amplitude and shape of its variations change with time. For example, zeta Puppis
was much more strongly variable between 2007 and 2011 than before and after this interval. Comparing
the X-ray spectra of the star at maximum and minimum brightness yields no compelling difference
beyond the overall flux change: the temperatures, absorptions, and line shapes seem to remain constant,
well within errors. The only common feature between X-ray datasets is that the variation amplitudes
appear maximum in the medium (0.6-1.2keV) energy band. Finally, no clear and coherent correlation
can be found between simultaneous X-ray and optical data. Only a subgroup of observations may be
combined coherently with the optical period of 1.78d, although the simultaneous optical behaviour
is unknown. The currently available data do not reveal any obvious, permanent, and direct correlation
between X-ray and optical variations. The origin of the X-ray variability therefore still needs
to be ascertained, highlighting the need for long-term monitoring in multiwavelengths, i.e. X-ray,
UV, and optical.
