Fuzzy dark matter of ultra-light axions has gained attention, largely in light of the galactic scale
problems associated with cold dark matter. But the large de Broglie wavelength, believed to possibly
alleviate these problems, also leads to fluctuations that place constraints on ultra-light axions.
We adapt and extend a method, previously devised to describe the effect of gaseous fluctuations
on cold dark matter cusps, in order to determine the imprints of ultra-light axion haloes on the motion
of classical test particles. We first evaluate the effect of fluctuations in a statistically homogeneous
medium of classical particles, then in a similar system of ultra light axions. In the first case,
one recovers the classical two body relaxation time (and diffusion coefficients) from white noise
density fluctuations. In the second situation, the fluctuations are not born of discreteness noise
but from the finite de Broglie wavelength; correlation therefore exists over this scale, while
white noise is retained on larger scales, elucidating the correspondence with classical relaxation.
The resulting density power spectra and correlation functions are compared with those inferred
from numerical simulations, and the relaxation time arising from the associated potential fluctuations
is evaluated. We then apply our results to estimate the heating of disks embedded in axion dark haloes.
We find that this implies an axion mass $m \ga 2 \times 10^{-22} {\rm eV}$. We finally apply our model
to the case of the central cluster of Eridanus II, confirming that far stronger constraints on $m$
may in principle be obtained, and discussing the limitations associated with the assumptions leading
to these.
