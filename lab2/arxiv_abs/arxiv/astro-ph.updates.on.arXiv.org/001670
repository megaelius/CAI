We use our variable Eddington tensor (VET) radiation hydrodynamics code to perform two-dimensional
simulations to study the impact of radiation forces on atmospheres composed of dust and gas. Our
setup closely follows that of Krumholz & Thompson, assuming that dust and gas are well-coupled
and that the radiation field is characterized by blackbodies with temperatures >~ 80 K, as might
be found in ultraluminous infrared galaxies. In agreement with previous work, we find that Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities develop in radiation supported atmospheres, leading to inhomogeneities that limit
momentum exchange between radiation and dusty gas, and eventually providing a near balance of the
radiation and gravitational forces. However, the evolution of the velocity and spatial distributions
of the gas differs significantly from previous work, which utilized a less accurate flux-limited
diffusion (FLD) method. Our VET simulations show continuous net acceleration of the gas, with no
steady-state reached by the end of the simulation. In contrast, FLD results show little net acceleration
of the gas and settle in to a quasi-steady, turbulent state with low velocity dispersion. The discrepancies
result primarily from the inability of FLD to properly model the variation of the radiation field
around structures that are less than a few optical depths across. We conclude that radiation feedback
remains a viable mechanism for driving high-Mach number turbulence. We discuss implications for
observed systems and global numerical simulations of feedback, but more realistic setups are needed
to make robust observational predictions and assess the prospect of launching outflows with radiation.
