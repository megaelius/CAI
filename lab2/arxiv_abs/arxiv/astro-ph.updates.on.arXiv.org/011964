We analyse publicly available, individual spectra of four, massive ($M>10^{11}M_{\odot}$) early-type
galaxies with redshifts in the range 1.4 < z < 2 to determine their stellar content, extending our
previous work up to z~2. The wide wavelength range of the VLT/X-Shooter spectroscopic data in the
UV-Optical-NIR arms along with the availability of spectro-photometry allows us to explore different
techniques to obtain the stellar population properties, namely through age/metallicity sensitive
spectral indices, full spectral fitting and broad-band photometric fitting. Moreover, together
with the widely used optical Lick indices we consider further indices in the UV rest-frame, and demonstrate
that UV indices significantly help the accuracy of the resulting population parameters. We find
galaxy ages ranging from 0.2 to 4 Gyr, where the oldest galaxy is found at the lowest redshift, with
an excellent agreement between ages determined via indices, full spectral fitting or broad-band
colours. These ages are in perfect agreement with ages of local galaxies at the same velocity dispersion
when we assume pure passive evolution. Total metallicities derived from indices show some scatter
(between less than half-solar to very high values, ([Z/H]~0.6]). We speculate on possible mechanisms
explaining these values, but given the sample size and low S/N of the spectra no conclusion can be
made. Indices in the UV-rest frame generally lead to similar conclusions as optical indices. For
the oldest galaxy (4 Gyr) we show that its UV-indices can only be explained by stellar population
models including a UV contribution from old stellar populations, suggesting that old, UV bright
populations start to inhabit mature galaxies of a few Gyr of age. This is the highest redshift (z~1.4)
detection of the UV-upturn up to date.
