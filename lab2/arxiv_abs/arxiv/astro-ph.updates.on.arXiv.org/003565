Interpreting abundances of Damped Ly-$\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs) from absorption-line spectroscopy
has typically been a challenge because of the presence of dust. Nevertheless, because DLAs trace
distant gas-rich galaxies regardless of their luminosity, they provide an attractive way of measuring
the evolution of the metallicity of the neutral gas with cosmic time. This has been done extensively
so far, but typically not taking proper dust corrections into account. The aims of this paper are
to: $i)$ provide a simplified way of calculating dust corrections, based on a single observed [$X$/Fe],
$ii)$ assess the importance of dust corrections for DLA metallicities and their evolution, and
$iii)$ investigate the cosmic evolution of iron for a large DLA sample. We derive dust corrections
based on the observed [Zn/Fe], [Si/Fe], or [S/Fe], and confirm their robustness. We present dust-corrected
metallicities in a scale of [Fe/H]$_{\rm tot}$ for 266 DLAs over a broad range of $z$, and assess the
extent of dust corrections for different metals at different metallicities. Dust corrections
in DLAs are important even for Zn (typically of 0.1-0.2, and up to 0.45 dex), which is often neglected.
Finally, we study the evolution of the dust-corrected metallicity with $z$. The DLA metallicities
decrease with redshift, by a factor of 50-100 from today to $\sim$ 12.6 billions ago ($z=$ 5). When
including dust corrections, the metallicity evolution is more steep than previously thought.
At low $z$, the average DLA metallicities are $\sim$ 0.3 dex higher than without corrections. The
upper envelope of the relation between metallicity and $z$ reaches solar metallicity at $z\lesssim$
0.5, although some systems can have solar metallicity already out to $z\sim$ 3.
