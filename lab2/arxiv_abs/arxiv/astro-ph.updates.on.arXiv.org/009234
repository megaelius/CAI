The future of precision cosmology could benefit from cross-correlations between intensity maps
of unresolved neutral hydrogen (HI) and more conventional optical galaxy surveys. A major challenge
that needs to be overcome is removing the 21cm foreground emission that contaminates the cosmological
HI signal. Using N-body simulations we simulate HI intensity maps and optical catalogues which
share the same underlying cosmology. Adding simulated foreground contamination and using state-of-the-art
reconstruction techniques we investigate the impacts that 21cm foregrounds and other systematics
have on these cross-correlations. We find that the impact a FASTICA 21cm foreground clean has on
the cross-correlations with spectroscopic optical surveys with well-constrained redshifts
is minimal. However, problems arise when photometric surveys are considered: we find that a redshift
uncertainty {\sigma}_z {\geq} 0.04 causes significant degradation in the cross power spectrum
signal. We diagnose the main root of these problems, which relates to arbitrary amplitude changes
along the line-of-sight in the intensity maps caused by the foreground clean and suggest solutions
which should be applicable to real data. These solutions involve a reconstruction of the line-of-sight
temperature means using the available overlapping optical data along with an artificial extension
to the HI data through redshift to address edge effects. We then put these solutions through a further
test in a mock experiment that uses a clustering-based redshift estimation technique to constrain
the photometric redshifts of the optical sample. We find that with our suggested reconstruction,
cross-correlations can be utilized to make an accurate prediction of the optical redshift distribution.
