The most luminous galaxies at high-redshift are generally considered to be hosted in massive dark-matter
halos of comparable number density, hence residing at the center of overdensities/protoclusters.
We assess the validity of this assumption by investigating the clustering around the brightest
galaxies populating the cosmic web at redshift $z\sim8-9$ through a combination of semi-analytic
modeling and Monte Carlo simulations of mock Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 observations. The innovative
aspect of our approach is the inclusion of a log-normal scatter parameter $\Sigma$ in the galaxy
luminosity versus halo mass relation, extending to high-$z$ the conditional luminosity function
framework extensively used at low redshift. Our analysis shows that the larger the value of $\Sigma$,
the less likely that the brightest source in a given volume is hosted in the most massive halo, and
hence the weaker the overdensity of neighbors. We derive a minimum value of $\Sigma$ as a function
of redshift by considering stochasticity in the halo assembly times, which affects galaxy ages
and star formation rates in our modeling. We show that $\Sigma_{min}(z)\sim0.15-0.3$, with $\Sigma_{min}$
increasing with redshift as a consequence of shorter halo assembly periods at higher redshifts.
Current observations ($m_{AB}\sim27$) of the environment of spectroscopically confirmed bright
sources at $z>7.5$ do not show strong evidence of clustering and are consistent with our modeling
predictions for $\Sigma\geq\Sigma_{min}$. Deeper future observations reaching $m_{AB}\sim28.2-29$
would have the opportunity to clearly quantify the clustering strength, and hence to constrain
$\Sigma$, investigating the physical processes that drive star formation in the early Universe.
