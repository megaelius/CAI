For a molecular cloud clump to form stars some transport of magnetic flux is required from the denser,
inner regions to the outer regions of the cloud, otherwise this can prevent the collapse. Fast magnetic
reconnection which takes place in the presence of turbulence can induce a process of reconnection
diffusion (RD). Extending earlier numerical studies of reconnection diffusion in cylindrical
clouds, we consider more realistic clouds with spherical gravitational potentials and also account
for the effects of the gas self-gravity. We demonstrate that within our setup RD is efficient. We
have also identified the conditions under which RD becomes strong enough to make an initially subcritical
cloud clump supercritical and induce its collapse. Our results indicate that the formation of a
supercritical core is regulated by a complex interplay between gravity, self-gravity, the magnetic
field strength and nearly transonic and trans-Alfv\'enic turbulence, confirming that RD is able
to remove magnetic flux from collapsing clumps, but only a few of them become nearly critical or supercritical,
sub-Alfv\'enic cores, which is consistent with the observations. Besides, we have found that the
supercritical cores built up in our simulations develop a predominantly helical magnetic field
geometry which is also consistent with observations. Finally, we have evaluated the effective
values of the turbulent reconnection diffusion coefficient and found that they are much larger
than the numerical diffusion, especially for initially trans-Alfv\'enic clouds, ensuring that
the detected magnetic flux removal is due to to the action of the RD rather than to numerical diffusivity.
