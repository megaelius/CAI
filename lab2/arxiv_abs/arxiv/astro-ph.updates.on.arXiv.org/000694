Massive stars are of fundamental importance for almost all aspects of astrophysics, but there still
exist large gaps in our understanding of their properties and formation because they are rare and
therefore distant. It has been found that most O-stars are multiples. HD 150 136 is the nearest system
to Earth with >100 M_sol, and provides a unique opportunity to study an extremely massive system.
Recently, evidence for the existence of a third component in HD 150 136, in addition to the tight spectroscopic
binary that forms the main component, was found in spectroscopic observations. Our aim was to image
and obtain astrometric and photometric measurements of this component using long baseline optical
interferometry to further constrain the nature of this component. We observed HD150136 with the
near-infrared instrument AMBER attached to the ESO VLT Interferometer. The recovered closure
phases are robust to systematic errors and provide unique information on the source asymmetry.
Therefore, they are of crucial relevance for both image reconstruction and model fitting of the
source structure. The third component in HD 150 136 is clearly detected in the high-quality data
from AMBER. It is located at a projected angular distance of 7.3 mas, or about 13 AU at the line-of-sight
distance of HD 150 136, at a position angle of 209 degrees East of North, and has a flux ratio of 0.25
with respect to the inner binary. We resolved the third component of HD 150 136 in J, H and K filters.
The luminosity and color of the tertiary agrees with the predictions and shows that it is also an O
main-sequence star. The small measured angular separation indicates that the tertiary may be approaching
the periastron of its orbit. These results, only achievable with long baseline near infrared interferometry,
constitute the first step towards the understanding of the massive star formation mechanisms.
