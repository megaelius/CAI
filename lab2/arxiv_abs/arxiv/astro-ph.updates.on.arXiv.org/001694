%methods {We used the EMIR receiver and FTS spectrometer at the IRAM 30m to construct absorption
spectra toward bright extra-galactic background sources at 195 kHz spectral resolution ($\approx$
0.6 \kms). We used the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer to synthesize absorption spectra of \hthcop\
and HCO toward the galactic HII region W49.} %results {HCO, \cc3h\ and CF\p\ were detected toward
the blazars \bll\ and 3C111 having \EBV\ = 0.32 and 1.65 mag. HCO was observed in absorption from ``spiral-arm''
clouds in the galactic plane occulting W49. The complement of detectable molecular species in the
85 - 110 GHz absorption spectrum of diffuse/translucent gas is now fully determined at rms noise
level $\delta_\tau \approx 0.002$ at \EBV\ = 0.32 mag (\AV\ = 1 mag) and $\delta_\tau$/\EBV\ $\approx\
0.003$ mag$^{-1}$ overall.} %conclusions {As with OH, \hcop\ and \cch, the relative abundance
of \cc3h\ varies little between diffuse and dense molecular gas, with N(\cc3h)/N({\it o-c}-\c3h2)
$\approx$ 0.1. We find N(CF\p)/N(H$^{13}$CO\p) $\approx 5$, N(CF\p)/N(\cch) $\approx$ 0.005-0.01
and because N(CF\p) increases with \EBV\ and with the column densities of other molecules we infer
that fluorine remains in the gas phase as HF well beyond \AV\ = 1 mag. We find N(HCO)/N(H$^{13}$CO\p)
= 16 toward \bll, 3C111 and the 40 km/s spiral arm cloud toward W49, implying X(HCO) $\approx 10^{-9}$,
about 10 times higher than in dark clouds. The behaviour of HCO is consistent with previous suggestions
that it forms from C\p\ and \HH, even when \AV\ is well above 1 mag. The survey can be used to place useful
upper limits on some species, for instance N(\hhco)/N(\HH CS) $>$ 32 toward 3C111, compared
to 7 toward TMC-1, confirming the possibility of a gas phase formation route to \hhco.}
