Galaxy cluster outskirts provide an intriguing testbed for theories of cosmic structure formation
and galaxy formation, marking the transition from the mildly non-linear cosmic web to the highly
non-linear, virialised, cluster environment. It is here that cluster environment begins to influence
the gaseous content of galaxies, and here that we expect to find shocks in the intra-cluster medium
(ICM) associated with infalling galaxy groups and gas accretion from the cosmic web. Using a suite
of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations of a single galaxy cluster from the nIFTy comparison
project, we investigate what current state-of-the-art astrophysics codes predict for ICM structure,
kinematics, and thermodynamics in cluster outskirts. These include non-radiative simulations,
which probe differences in schemes for solving the equations of hydrodynamics, and full physics
simulations, which probe differences in galaxy formation modeling. Our analysis reveals that
the ICM in cluster outskirts is relatively insensitive to both choice of code and galaxy formation
prescription. Spherically averaged gas density profiles follow the underlying dark matter, scaled
by the cosmic baryon fraction, while temperature and velocity profiles show signatures of strong
shocks, short-lived interior to the virial radius and longer-lived at larger radii. These shocks
can be understood as the combined response to infalling gas accreted along filaments, which we demonstrate
by reconstructing the local cosmic web, and along the orbits of accreted substructures. Our results
make clear that cluster outskirts are shaped by large-scale gravitational dynamics and strong,
inefficiently radiating, shocks.
