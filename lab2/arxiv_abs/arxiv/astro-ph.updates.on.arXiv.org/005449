We perform a kinematic and morphological analysis of 44 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim2$ in the
COSMOS legacy field using near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck/MOSFIRE and F160W imaging from
CANDELS/3D-HST as part of the ZFIRE survey. Our sample consists of cluster and field galaxies from
$2.0 < z < 2.5$ with K band multi-object slit spectroscopic measurements of their H$\alpha$ emission
lines. H$\alpha$ rotational velocities and gas velocity dispersions are measured using the Heidelberg
Emission Line Algorithm (HELA), which compares directly to simulated 3D data-cubes. Using a suite
of simulated emission lines, we determine that HELA reliably recovers input S$_{0.5}$ and angular
momentum at small offsets, but $V_{2.2}/\sigma_g$ values are offset and highly scattered. We examine
the role of regular and irregular morphology in the stellar mass kinematic scaling relations, deriving
the kinematic measurement S$_{0.5}$, and finding $\log(S_{0.5}) = (0.38\pm0.07)\log(M/M_{\odot}-10)
+ (2.04\pm0.03)$ with no significant offset between morphological populations and similar levels
of scatter ($\sim0.16$ dex). Additionally, we identify a correlation between M$_{\star}$ and
$V_{2.2}/\sigma_g$ for the total sample, showing an increasing level of rotation dominance with
increasing M$_{\star}$, and a high level of scatter for both regular and irregular galaxies. We
estimate the specific angular momenta ($j_{disk}$) of these galaxies and find a slope of $0.36\pm0.12$,
shallower than predicted without mass-dependent disk growth, but this result is possibly due to
measurement uncertainty at M$_{\star}$ $<$ 9.5. However, through a K-S test we find irregular galaxies
to have marginally higher $j_{disk}$ values than regular galaxies, and high scatter at low masses
in both populations.
