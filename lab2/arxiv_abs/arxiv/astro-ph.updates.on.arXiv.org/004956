The detection of many extrasolar gas giants with high eccentricities indicates that dynamical
instabilities in planetary systems are common. These instabilities can alter the orbits of gas
giants as well as the orbits of terrestrial planets and therefore eject or move a habitable planet
out of the habitable zone. In this work 423 simulations with 153 different hypothetical planetary
systems with gas giants and terrestrial planets have been modelled to explore the orbital stability
of habitable planets. The initial parameter variations include the number, distances and masses
of the giant planets and the star type. Linear correlations between the initial number and the initial
distances of gas giants and the survival rate of habitable planets were found. Planetary systems
consisting of two giant planets are fairly benign to terrestrial planets, whereas six giant planets
very often lead to a complete clearing of the habitable zone. Systems with initial distances of five
Hill Radii between the giant planets have a high chance to harbour a habitable planet, although more
compact systems are very destructive. The giant planet masses have a smaller impact on the stability
of habitable worlds. Additionally, a link between the present-day orbit of an observed giant exoplanet
and the survival rate of habitable planets was established. As a rule of thumb, observed gas giants
with eccentricities higher than 0.4 and inclinations higher than 20 degrees have experienced strong
planet-planet scatterings and are unlikely to have a habitable planet in its system. Furthermore,
it was found that habitable planets surrounding a K or M-star have a higher survival rate than those
surrounding a G-star.
