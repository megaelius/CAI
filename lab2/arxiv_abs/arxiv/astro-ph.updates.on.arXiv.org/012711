We investigate the connection between galaxy--galaxy mergers and enhanced black hole (BH) growth
using the cosmological hydrodynamical \eagle simulation. We do this via three methods of analysis,
investigating: the merger fraction of AGN, the AGN fraction of merging systems and the AGN fraction
of galaxies with close companions. In each case, we find an increased abundance of AGN within merging
systems relative to control samples of inactive or isolated galaxies (by up to a factor of $\approx
4$ depending on the analysis method used), confirming that mergers are enhancing BH accretion rates
for at least a subset of the galaxy population. The greatest excess of AGN triggered via a merger are
found in lower mass ($M_* \sim 10^{10}$~\Msol) gas rich ($f_{\mathrm{gas}} > 0.1$) central galaxies
with lower mass BHs ($M_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{7}$~\Msol) at lower redshifts ($z<1$). We find
no enhancement of AGN triggered via mergers in more massive galaxies ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{11}$~\Msol).
The enhancement of AGN is not uniform throughout the phases of a merger, and instead peaks within
the early \emph{remnants} of merging systems (typically lagging $\approx 300$~Myr post-coalescence
of the two galaxies at $z=0.5$). We argue that neither major ($M_{\mathrm{*,1}} / M_{\mathrm{*,2}}
\geq \frac{1}{4}$) nor minor mergers ($\frac{1}{10} < M_{\mathrm{*,1}} / M_{\mathrm{*,2}} <
\frac{1}{4}$) are statistically relevant for enhancing BH masses globally. Whilst at all redshifts
the galaxies experiencing a merger have accretion rates that are on average 2--3 times that of isolated
galaxies, the majority of mass that is accreted onto BHs occurs outside the periods of a merger. We
compute that on average no more than 15\% of a BHs final day mass comes from the enhanced accretion
rates triggered via a merger.
