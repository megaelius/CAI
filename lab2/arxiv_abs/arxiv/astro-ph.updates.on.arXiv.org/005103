We present a multi-wavelength analysis of 48 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) detected in the LABOCA/ACT
Survey of Clusters at All Redshifts, LASCAR, which acquired new 870 $\mu$m and ATCA 2.1 GHz observations
of ten galaxy clusters detected through their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) signal by the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope. Far-infrared observations were also conducted with the PACS (100/160 $\mu$m)
and SPIRE (250/350/500 $\mu$m) instruments on $Herschel$ for sample subsets of five and six clusters.
LASCAR 870 $\mu$m, maps were reduced using a multi-scale iterative pipeline that removes the SZE
increment signal, yielding point-source sensitivities of $\sigma\sim2\rm{\,mJy\,beam}^{-1}$.
We detect in total 49 sources at the $4\sigma$ level, and conduct a detailed multi-wavelength analysis
considering our new radio and far-IR observations plus existing near-IR and optical data. One source
is identified as a foreground galaxy, 28 SMGs are matched to single radio sources, 4 have double radio
counterparts, and 16 are undetected at 2.1 GHz but tentatively associated in some cases to near-IR/optical
sources. We estimate photometric redshifts for 34 sources with secure (25) and tentative (9) matches
at different wavelengths, obtaining a median $z=2.8^{+2.1}_{-1.7}$. Compared to previous results
for single-dish surveys, our redshift distribution has a comparatively larger fraction of sources
at $z>3$ and the high-redshift tail is more extended. This is consistent with millimeter spectroscopic
confirmation of a growing number of high-$z$ SMGs and relevant for testing of cosmological models.
Analytical lens modeling is applied to estimate magnification factors for 42 SMGs at cluster-centric
radii $>1.2$'; with the demagnified flux densities and source-plane areas, we obtain integral
number counts that agree with previous submillimeter surveys.
