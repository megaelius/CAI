A significant fraction of high redshift star-forming disc galaxies are known to host giant clumps,
whose formation, nature and role in galaxy evolution are yet to be understood. In this work we first
present a new automated method based on deep neural networks to detect clumps in galaxy images and
show that it is more sensitive and faster than previous proposed methods. We then use this method
to systematically detect clumps in the rest-frame optical and UV images of a complete sample of $\sim1500$
star forming galaxies at $1<z<3$ in the CANDELS survey as well as in images from the VELA forward modeled
zoom-in cosmological simulations. We show that observational effects have a dramatic impact on
the derived clump properties leading to an overestimation of the clump mass up to a factor of 10, which
highlights the importance of fair and direct comparisons between observations and simulations.
After correcting for these effects with a simple mixture density network, we estimate that the clump
stellar mass function follows a power-law down to the completeness limit ($10^{7}$ solar masses)
with the majority of the clumps being less massive than $10^9$ solar masses. We find that between
$20-40\%$ of $\sim10^{10}$ solar mass star-forming galaxies contain at least one massive ($M_c>10^{7}M_\odot$)
off-centered clump but only $\sim2-5\%$ of the total galaxy stellar mass is in those clumps. We also
show indications that the contribution of clumps to the stellar mass is more important in extended
and low mass galaxies. The simulations explored in this work overall reproduce the shape of the observed
clump stellar mass function when confronted under the same conditions although tend to lie in the
lower limit of the confidence intervals of the observations. This agreement suggests that most
of the observed clumps are formed in-situ through violent disk instabilities.
