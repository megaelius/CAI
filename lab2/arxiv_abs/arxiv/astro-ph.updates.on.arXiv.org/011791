This paper contains the results from the first 30 months of the NELIOTA project for impacts of NEOs/meteoroids
on the lunar surface. Our analysis on the statistics concerning the efficiency of the campaign and
the parameters of the projectiles and the impacts is presented. The parameters of the lunar impact
flashes based on simultaneous observations in two wavelength bands are used to estimate the distributions
of the masses, sizes and frequency of the impactors. These statistics can be used both in space engineering
and science. The photometric fluxes of the flashes are measured using aperture photometry and their
apparent magnitudes are calculated using standard stars. Assuming that the flashes follow a black
body law of irradiation, the temperatures can be derived analytically, while the parameters of
the projectiles are estimated using fair assumptions on their velocity and luminous efficiency
of the impacts. 79 lunar impact flashes have been observed with the 1.2 m Kryoneri telescope in Greece.
The masses of the meteoroids range between 0.7 g and 8 kg and their respective sizes between 1-20 cm
depending on their assumed density, impact velocity, and luminous efficiency. We find a strong
correlation between the observed magnitudes of the flashes and the masses of the meteoroids. Moreover,
an empirical relation between the emitted energies of each band has been derived allowing the estimation
of the physical parameters of the meteoroids that produce low energy impact flashes. The NELIOTA
project has so far the highest detection rate and the faintest limiting magnitude for lunar impacts
compared to other ongoing programs. Based on the impact frequency distribution on Moon, we estimate
that sporadic meteoroids with typical masses less than 100 g and sizes less than 5 cm enter the mesosphere
of the Earth with a rate ~108 meteoroids/hr and also impact Moon with a rate of ~8 meteoroids/hr.
