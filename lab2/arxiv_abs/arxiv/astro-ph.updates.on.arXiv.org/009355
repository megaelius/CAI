Our knowledge of high redshift, broad absorption line (BAL) quasars (QSOs) remains limited due
to their apparent deficiency in the QSO population. We present an observational study of 22 BAL QSOs
at $3\lesssim z \lesssim5$ based on optical/near-IR spectroscopy, which delivers the largest
such sample ever studied in the redshift range. The near-IR spectroscopy covers the H$\beta$ and/or
Mg II broad emission lines for these quasars, allowing us to estimate their central black hole (BH)
masses in a robust way. In a subset consisting of seven strong BAL QSOs, we see the prevalence of weak
[O III] emission and large C IV broad emission-line (BEL) blueshift ($\sim$3200 km s$^{-1}$). In
another subset consisting of thirteen BAL QSOs having simultaneous observations in Mg II and H$\beta$,
we found a strong correlation between 3000~\AA\ and 5000~\AA\ continuum luminosity, consistent
with previous non-BAL QSO studies; however, there is no correlation between the FWHM of Mg II and
H$\beta$, possibly due to the effects of strong nuclear outflows traced by BALs and/or C IV-BEL blueshifts.
In combination with additional two low-ionization BAL (LoBAL) samples at $1<z<2.5$ and $0.5<z<1$,
respectively, we investigate the cosmological evolution of the LoBAL population at $0.5\lesssim
z\lesssim 5$. There is an increasing trend in Eddington ratio with increasing redshift, while the
BH mass distribution appears to peak at $3<z<4$ in the augmented LoBAL sample, indicative of a "special"
evolution phase, in which nuclear outflows may play an important role in shaping their broad/narrow
emission-line regions as well as regulating the growth of their central BHs.
