Cometary dust particles are remnants of the primordial accretion of refractory material that occurred
during the initial stages of the Solar System formation. Understanding their physical structure
can help constrain their accretion process. We have developed a simple numerical simulation of
aggregate impact flattening to interpret the properties of particles collected by COSIMA. The
aspect ratios of flattened particles from both simulations and observations are compared to differentiate
between initial families of aggregates characterized by different fractal dimensions $D_f$.
This dimension can differentiate between certain growth modes. The diversity of aspect ratios
measured by COSIMA is consistent with either two families of aggregates with different initial
$D_f$ (a family of compact aggregates with fractal dimensions close to 2.5-3 and some fluffier aggregates
with fractal dimensions around 2). Alternatively, the distribution of morphologies seen by COSIMA
could originate from a single type of aggregation process, such as DLPA, but to explain the range
of aspect ratios observed by COSIMA a large range of dust particle cohesive strength is necessary.
Furthermore, variations in cohesive strength and velocity may play a role in the higher aspect ratio
range detected (>0.3). Our work allows us to explain the particle morphologies observed by COSIMA
and those generated by laboratory experiments in a consistent framework. Taking into account all
observations from the three dust instruments on-board Rosetta, we favor an interpretation of our
simulations based on two different families of dust particles with significantly distinct fractal
dimensions ejected from the cometary nucleus.
