We demonstrate dynamical pathways from main-belt asteroid and Centaur orbits to those in co-orbital
motion with Jupiter, including the retrograde (inclination $i>90^o$) state. We estimate that
at any given time, there should be $\sim1$ kilometer-scale or larger escaped asteroid in a transient
direct (prograde) orbit with semimajor axis near that of Jupiter's ($a\simeq a_J$), with proportionally
more smaller objects as determined by their size distribution. Most of these objects would be in
the horseshoe dynamical state, which are hard to detect due to their moderate eccentricities (spending
most of their time beyond 5 AU) and longitudes relative to Jupiter being spread nearly all over the
sky. We also show that $\approx$1% of the transient asteroid co-orbital population is on retrograde
orbits with Jupiter. This population, like the recently identified asteroid (514107) 2015 BZ$_{509}$,
can spend millions of years with $a\simeq a_J$ including tens or hundreds of thousands of years formally
in the retrograde 1:-1 co-orbital resonance. Escaping near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are thus likely
the precursors to the handful of known high-inclination objects with $a\simeq a_J$. We compare
the production of jovian co-orbitals from escaping NEAs with those from incoming Centaurs. We find
that temporary direct co-orbitals are likely dominated by Centaur capture, but we only find production
of (temporary) retrograde jovian co-orbitals (including very long-lived ones) from the NEA source.
We postulate that the primordial elimination of the inner Solar System's planetesimal population
could provide a supply route for a metastable outer Solar System reservoir for the high-inclination
Centaurs.
