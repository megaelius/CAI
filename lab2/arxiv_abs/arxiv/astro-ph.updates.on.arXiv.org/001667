Recently Strohmayer and Mahmoodifar presented evidence for a coherent oscillation in the X-ray
light curve of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1751-305, using data taken by RXTE during the
2002 outburst of this source. They noted that a possible explanation includes the excitation of
a non-radial oscillation mode of the neutron star, either in the form of a g-mode or an r-mode. The
r-mode interpretation has connections with proposed spin-evolution scenarios for systems such
as XTE J1751-305. Here we examine in detail this interesting possible interpretation. Using the
ratio of the observed oscillation frequency to the star's spin frequency, we derive an approximate
neutron star mass-radius relation which yields reasonable values for the mass over the range of
expected stellar radius (as constrained by observations of radius-expansion burst sources).
However, we argue that the large mode amplitude suggested by the Strohmayer and Mahmoodifar analysis
would inevitably lead to a large spin-down of the star, inconsistent with its observed spin evolution,
regardless of whether the r-mode itself is in a stable or unstable regime. We therefore conclude
that the r-mode interpretation of the observed oscillation is not consistent with our current understanding
of neutron star dynamics and must be considered unlikely. Finally we note that, subject to the availability
of a sufficiently accurate timing model, a direct gravitational-wave search may be able to confirm
or reject an r-mode interpretation unambiguously, should such an event, with a similar inferred
mode amplitude, recur during the Advanced detector era.
