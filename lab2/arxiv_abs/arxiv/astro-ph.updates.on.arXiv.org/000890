Quasar accretion disk winds observed via broad absorption lines (BALs) in the UV produce strong
continuous absorption in X-rays. The X-ray absorber is believed to serve critically as a radiative
shield to enable radiative driving. However, "mini-BAL" and narrow absorption line outflows have
dramatically less X-ray absorption than BALs. Here we examine X-ray and rest-frame UV spectra of
8 mini-BAL quasars with outflow speeds in the range 0.1c to 0.2c to test whether extreme speeds require
a strong shield. We find that the X-ray absorption is weak or moderate, with neutral-equivalent
column densities N_H < few times 10^22 cm^-2, consistent with mini-BALs at lower speeds. We use
photoionization models to show that this amount of shielding is too weak to control the outflow ionizations
and, therefore, it is not important for the acceleration. Shielding in complex geometries also
seems unlikely because the alleged shield would need to extinguish the ionizing far-UV flux while
avoiding detection in X-rays and the near-UV. We argue that the outflow ionizations are kept moderate,
instead, by high gas densities in small clouds. If the mini-BALs form at radial distances of order
R ~ 2 pc from the central quasar (broadly consistent with theoretical models and with the mini-BAL
variabilities observed here and in previous work), and the total column densities in the mini-BAL
gas are N_H ~< 10^21 cm^-2, then the total radial extent of outflow clouds is only Delta-R_clouds
~< 3 x 10^13 cm and the radial filling factor is Delta-R_clouds/R ~< 5 x 10^-6 for weak/negligible
shielding. Compared to the transverse sizes >~ 8 x 10^15 cm (based on measured line depths), the
outflows have shapes like thin "pancakes" viewed face-on, or they occupy larger volumes like a spray
of many dense clouds with a small volume filling factor. These results favor models with magnetic
confinement in magnetic disk winds.
