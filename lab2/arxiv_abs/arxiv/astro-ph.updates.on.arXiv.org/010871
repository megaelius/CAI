We re-analyze data from the gravitational-wave event GW170817 and its host galaxy NGC4993 to demonstrate
the importance of accurate total and peculiar velocities when measuring the Hubble constant using
Standard Sirens. We show that a number of reasonable choices can be made to estimate the velocities
for this event, but that systematic differences remain between these measurements depending on
which data is used. This leads to significant changes in the recovered Hubble constant inferred
from GW170817. We present Bayesian Model Averaging as one way to account for these differences,
and doing so obtain $H_{0}=66.8^{+13.4}_{-9.2}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. Adding
additional information on the viewing angle from high resolution imaging of the radio counterpart
refines this to $H_{0}=64.8^{+7.3}_{-7.2}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. During this
analysis we also present an alternative Bayesian model for evaluating the posterior on $H_{0}$
from Standard Sirens that works more closely with observed quantities from redshift and peculiar
velocity surveys. Our results more accurately capture the true uncertainty on the total and peculiar
velocities of NGC4993 and show that more effort should be made to explore how well different datasets
characterize galaxy groups and the velocity field in the local Universe; Standard Siren measurements
must take these differences into account to obtain unbiased cosmological constraints. The conclusions
of this work are also relevant for measurements of the Hubble constant from other isolated low redshift
probes, i.e., individual Standard Candles and from Fast Radio Bursts, however the importance of
precise velocities diminishes as the number of measurements increases because the random component
of the peculiar velocity averages out.
