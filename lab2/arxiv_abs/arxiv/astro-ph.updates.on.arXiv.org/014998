We explore two widely used empirical models for the galaxy-halo connection, subhalo abundance
matching (SHAM) and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and compare their predictions with
the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG (TNG) for a range of statistics that quantify the galaxy
distribution at $n_{\rm gal}\approx1.3\times10^{-3}\,[{\rm Mpc}/h]^{-3}$. We observe that
in their most straightforward implementations, both models fail to reproduce the two-point clustering
measured in TNG. We find that SHAM models constructed using the relaxation velocity, $V_{\rm relax}$,
and the peak velocity, $V_{\rm peak}$, perform best, and match the clustering reasonably well,
although neither model captures adequately the one-halo clustering. Splitting the total sample
into sub-populations, we discover that SHAM overpredicts the clustering of high-mass, blue, star-forming,
and late-forming galaxies and uderpredicts that of low-mass, red, quiescent, and early-forming
galaxies. We also study various baryonic effects, finding that subhalos in the dark-mater-only
simulation have consistently higher values of their SHAM-proxy properties than their full-physics
counterparts. We then consider a two-dimensional implementation of the HOD model augmented with
a secondary parameter (environment, velocity anisotropy, $\sigma^2R_{\rm halfmass}$, and total
potential) and tuned so as to match the two-point clustering of the IllustrisTNG galaxies on large
scales. We analyze these galaxy populations adopting alternative statistical tools such as galaxy-galaxy
lensing, void-galaxy cross-correlations and cumulants of the smoothed density field, finding
that the hydrodynamical galaxy distribution disfavors $\sigma^2 R_{\rm halfmass}$ and the total
potential as secondary parameters, while the environment and velocity anisotropy samples are
consistent with full-physics across all statistical probes examined.
