The formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies in low-density environments are less understood
than classical elliptical galaxies in high-density environments. Isolated galaxies are defined
as galaxies without massive neighbors within scales of galaxy groups. The effect of the environment
at several Mpc scales on their properties has been barely explored. Here we study the role of large-scale
environment in some physical properties of 573 isolated elliptical galaxies out to z=0.08. We use
three environmental estimators of the large-scale structure within a projected radius of 5 Mpc
around isolated galaxies: the tidal strength parameter, the projected density eta_k, and the distance
to the fifth nearest neighbor galaxy. We find 80% of galaxies at lower densities correspond to 'red
and dead' elliptical galaxies. Blue and red galaxies do not tend to be located in different environments
according to eta_k. Almost all the isolated ellipticals in the densest large-scale environments
are red or quenched, where a third of them are low-mass galaxies. The percentage of isolated elliptical
galaxies located in the AGN region of the BPT diagram is 64%. We have identified 33 blue, star-forming
isolated ellipticals using both color and sSFR. Half of them are star-forming nuclei in the BPT diagram,
which is 5% of the galaxies in this diagram. The large-scale environment is not playing the primary
role to determine the color or sSFR of isolated elliptical galaxies. The large-scale environment
seems to be negligible from a stellar mass scale around 10^10.6 Msun, probably because of the dominant
presence of AGN at higher masses. For lower masses, the processes of cooling and infall of gas from
large scales are very inefficient in ellipticals. AGN might also be an essential ingredient to keep
most of the low-mass isolated elliptical galaxies quenched.
