We use a suite of $N$-body simulations to study intrinsic alignments (IA) of halo shapes with the
surrounding large-scale structure in the $\Lambda$CDM model. For this purpose, we develop a novel
method to measure multipole moments of the three-dimensional power spectrum of the $E$-mode field
of halo shapes with the matter/halo distribution, $P_{\delta E}^{(\ell)}(k)$ (or $P^{(\ell)}_{{\rm
h}E}$), and those of the auto-power spectrum of the $E$ mode, $P^{(\ell)}_{EE}(k)$, based on the
$E$/$B$-mode decomposition. The IA power spectra have non-vanishing amplitudes over the linear
to nonlinear scales, and the large-scale amplitudes at $k\lesssim 0.1~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ are related
to the matter power spectrum via a constant coefficient ($A_{\rm IA}$), similar to the linear bias
parameter. We find that the cross- and auto-power spectra $P_{\delta E}$ and $P_{EE}$ at nonlinear
scales, $k\gtrsim 0.1~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, show different $k$-dependences relative to the matter
power spectrum, suggesting a violation of the nonlinear alignment model commonly used to model
contaminations of cosmic shear signals. The IA power spectra exhibit baryon acoustic oscillations,
and vary with halo samples of different masses, redshifts and cosmological parameters ($\Omega_{\rm
m}, S_8$). The cumulative signal-to-noise ratio for the IA power spectra is about 60\% of that for
the halo density power spectrum, where the super-sample covariance is found to give a significant
contribution to the total covariance. Our results demonstrate that the IA power spectra of galaxy
shapes, measured from imaging and spectroscopic surveys for an overlapping area of the sky, can
be powerful tools to probe the underlying matter power spectrum, the primordial curvature perturbations,
and cosmological parameters, in addition to the standard galaxy density power spectrum.
