Compact groups (CGs) provide an environment in which interactions between galaxies and with the
intra-group medium enable and accelerate galaxy transitions from actively star forming to quiescent.
Galaxies in transition from active to quiescent can be selected, by their infrared (IR) colors,
as canyon or infrared transition zone (IRTZ) galaxies. We used a sample of CG galaxies with IR data
from the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) allowing us to calculate the stellar mass and
star formation rate (SFR) for each galaxy. Furthermore, we present new CO(1-0) data for 27 galaxies
and collect data from the literature to calculate the molecular gas mass for a total sample of 130
galaxies. This data set allows us to study the difference in the molecular gas fraction (Mmol/Mstar)
and star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/Mmol) between active, quiescent, and transitioning (i.e.,
canyon and IRTZ) galaxies. We find that transitioning galaxies have a mean molecular gas fraction
and a mean SFE that are significantly lower than those of actively star-forming galaxies. The molecular
gas fraction is higher than that of quiescent galaxies, whereas the SFE is similar. These results
indicate that the transition from actively star-forming to quiescent in CG galaxies goes along
with a loss of molecular gas, possibly due to tidal forces exerted from the neighboring galaxies
or a decrease in the gas density. In addition, the remaining molecular gas loses its ability to form
stars efficiently, possibly owing to turbulence perturbing the gas, as seen in other, well-studied
examples such as Stephan's Quintet and HCG~57. Thus, the amount and properties of molecular gas
play a crucial role in the environmentally driven transition of galaxies from actively star forming
to quiescent.
