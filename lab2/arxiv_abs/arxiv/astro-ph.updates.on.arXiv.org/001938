Black holes (BHs) formed from the direct collapse of primordial gas in the early Universe are strong
candidates for the seeds of supermassive BHs residing in the centers of massive galaxies today and
powering quasars at z > 6. These direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) are thought to form from pristine
primordial gas collapsing in atomic cooling haloes in the presence of a strong molecule-dissociating,
Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation field, which prevents the cooling of the gas to temperatures below
~ 10^4 K. The runaway gravitational collapse of this hot gas leads to the formation of a supermassive
star which collapses to form a 10^4 - 10^6 M_Sun BH. Given that star forming galaxies are likely to
be the source of the LW radiation in this scenario, it is likely that some ionizing radiation from
these galaxies accompanies the LW radiation. We present cosmological simulations resolving the
collapse of primordial gas into an atomic cooling halo, including the effects of both LW and ionizing
radiation. We find that in cases where the gas is not self-shielded from the ionizing radiation,
the collapse can be delayed by ~ 25 Myr. When the ionized gas does collapse, the free electrons that
are present catalyze H2 formation, leading to a H2 fraction sufficiently high to allow the gas to
self-shield from the LW radiation. In turn, H2 cooling becomes efficient in the center of the halo,
and DCBH formation is prevented. We emphasize, however, that in many cases the gas collapsing into
atomic cooling haloes at high redshift is self-shielding to ionizing radiation. Therefore, it
is only in a fraction of such haloes in which DCBH formation is prevented due to reionization. In cases
where it is prevented, though, it is likely that a small Population III galaxy forms instead.
