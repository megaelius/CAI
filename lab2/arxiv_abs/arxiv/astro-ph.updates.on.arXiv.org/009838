Using the latest sample of 48 spiral galaxies having a directly measured supermassive black hole
mass, $M_{BH}$, we determine how the maximum disk rotational velocity, $v_{max}$ (and the implied
dark matter halo mass, $M_{DM}$), correlates with the (i) $M_{BH}$, (ii) central velocity dispersion,
$\sigma_0$, and (iii) spiral-arm pitch angle, $\phi$. We find that $M_{BH}\propto v_{max}^{10.62\pm1.37}\propto
M_{DM}^{4.35\pm0.66}$, significantly steeper than previously reported, and with a root mean
square scatter ($0.58$ dex) similar to that about the $M_{BH}$-$\sigma_0$ relation for spiral
galaxies - in stark disagreement with claims that $M_{BH}$ does not correlate with disks. Moreover,
this $M_{BH}$-$v_{max}$ relation is consistent with the unification of the Tully-Fisher relation
(involving the total stellar mass, $M_{*,tot}$) and the steep $M_{BH}\propto M_{*,tot}^{3.05\pm0.53}$
relation observed in spiral galaxies. We also find that $\sigma_0\propto v_{max}^{1.55\pm0.25}\propto
M_{DM}^{0.63\pm0.11}$, consistent with past studies connecting stellar bulges (with $\sigma_0\gtrsim100\,{\rm
km\,s}^{-1}$), dark matter halos, and a nonconstant $v_{max}/\sigma_0$ ratio. Finally, we report
that $\tan|\phi|\propto(-1.18\pm0.19)\log{v_{max}}\propto(-0.48\pm0.09)\log M_{DM}$,
providing a novel formulation between the geometry (i.e., the logarithmic spiral-arm pitch angle)
and kinematics of spiral galaxy disks. While the $v_{max}$-$\phi$ relation may facilitate distance
estimations to face-on spiral galaxies through the Tully-Fisher relation and using $\phi$ as a
proxy for $v_{max}$, the $M_{DM}$-$\phi$ relation provides a path for determining dark matter
halo masses from imaging data alone. Furthermore, based on a spiral galaxy sample size that is double
the size used previously, the self-consistent relations presented here provide dramatically
revised constraints for theory and simulations.
