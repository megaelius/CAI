We present the large-scale structure catalogs from the recently completed extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). Derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) -IV Data Release 16
(DR16), these catalogs provide the data samples, corrected for observational systematics, and
the associated catalogs of random positions sampling the survey selection function. Combined,
they allow large-scale clustering measurements suitable for testing cosmological models. We
describe the methods used to create these catalogs for the eBOSS DR16 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and
Quasar samples. The quasar catalog contains 343,708 redshifts with $0.8 < z < 2.2$ over 4,808\,deg$^2$.
We combine 174,816 eBOSS LRG redshifts over 4,242\,deg$^2$ in the redshift interval $0.6 < z < 1.0$
with SDSS-III BOSS LRGs in the same redshift range to produce a combined sample of 377,458 galaxy
redshifts distributed over 9,493\,deg$^2$. The algorithms for estimating redshifts have improved
compared to previous eBOSS results such that 98 per cent of LRG observations resulted in a successful
redshift, with less than one per cent catastrophic failures ($\Delta z > 1000$ ${\rm km~s}^{-1}$).
For quasars, these rates are 95 and 2 per cent (with $\Delta z > 3000$ ${\rm km~s}^{-1}$). We apply
corrections for trends both resulting from the imaging data used to select the samples for spectroscopic
follow-up and the spectroscopic observations themselves. For example, the quasar catalog obtains
a $\chi^2$/DoF $= 776/10$ for a null test against imaging depth before corrections and a $\chi^2$/DoF
$= 6/8$ after. The catalogs, combined with careful consideration of the details of their construction
found here-in, allow companion papers to present cosmological results with negligible impact
from observational systematic uncertainties.
