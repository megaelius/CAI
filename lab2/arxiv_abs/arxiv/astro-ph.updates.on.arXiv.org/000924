We present ALMA observations of the [C II] 158 micron fine structure line and dust continuum emission
from the host galaxies of five redshift 6 quasars. We also report complementary observations of
250 GHz dust continuum and CO (6-5) line emission from the z=6.00 quasar SDSS J231038.88+185519.7.
The ALMA observations were carried out in the extended array at 0.7" resolution. We have detected
the line and dust continuum in all five objects. The derived [C II] line luminosities are 1.6x10^{9}
to 8.8x10^{9} Lsun and the [C II]-to-FIR luminosity ratios are 3.0-5.6x10^{-4}, which is comparable
to the values found in other high-redshift quasar-starburst systems and local ultra-luminous
infrared galaxies. The sources are marginally resolved and the intrinsic source sizes (major axis
FWHM) are constrained to be 0.3" to 0.6" (i.e., 1.7 to 3.5 kpc) for the [C II] line emission and 0.2"
to 0.4" (i.e., 1.2 to 2.3 kpc) for the continuum. These measurements indicate that there is vigorous
star formation over the central few kpc in the quasar host galaxies. The ALMA observations also constrain
the dynamical properties of the atomic gas in the starburst nuclei. The intensity-weighted velocity
maps of three sources show clear velocity gradients. Such velocity gradients are consistent with
a rotating, gravitationally bound gas component, although they are not uniquely interpreted as
such. Under the simplifying assumption of rotation, the implied dynamical masses within the [C
II]-emitting regions are of order 10^{10} to 10^{11} Msun. Given these estimates, the mass ratios
between the SMBHs and the spheroidal bulge are an order of magnitude higher than the mean value found
in local spheroidal galaxies, which is in agreement with results from previous CO observations
of high redshift quasars.
