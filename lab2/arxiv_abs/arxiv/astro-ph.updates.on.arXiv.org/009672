We provide a detailed comparison of two different models for the halo redshift space power spectrum,
namely the commonly applied TNS model and an effective field theory of large scale structure (EFTofLSS)
inspired model. In a least $\chi^2$ analysis using simulation data, we determine ranges of validity
for the models. In all our analyses we vary all nuisance parameters and the growth rate of structure,
$f$, using survey specifications typical of Stage IV galaxy surveys. We determine that the TNS model
with a Lorentzian damping and using standard Eulerian perturbative modelling outperforms other
variants of the TNS model. But we also find that the EFTofLSS-based model is able to fit the data down
to smaller scales compared to this optimal TNS variant at $z=0.5$, while the two models perform equally
well at $z=1$. We then conduct an exploratory Fisher analysis to investigate parameter degeneracies,
using the full anisotropic power spectrum. Next, we move on to a Bayesian MCMC analysis utilising
the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole spectra, with a restricted range of scales for the latter
in order for the $f$ constraints to remain unbiased. In contrast to the exploratory Fisher matrix
forecasts, our MCMC analysis finds that the EFTofLSS-based model provides tighter marginalised
constraints on the growth rate at $z=0.5$ than the TNS model, despite having additional nuisance
parameters. The two perform comparatively at $z=1$. We also investigate the impact of priors on
nuisance parameters which can be reasonably obtained from higher order statistics or external
data sets. We find that conservative priors have limited impact on the constraints. Finally, we
extend previous work to provide a consistent comparison between Fisher matrix and MCMC forecasts
for the EFTofLSS model using the multipole expansion formalism, and reach good agreement between
them.
