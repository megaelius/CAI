To understand the history and formation mechanisms of galaxies it is crucial to determine their
current multidimensional structure. Here we focus on stellar population properties, such as metallicity
and [$\alpha$/Fe] enhancement. We devise a new technique to recover the distribution of these parameters
using spatially resolved, line-of-sight averaged data. Our chemodynamical method is based on
the made-to-measure (M2M) framework and results in an $N$-body model for the abundance distribution.
We test our method on a mock dataset and find that the radial and azimuthal profiles are well-recovered,
however only the overall shape of the vertical profile matches the true profile. We apply our procedure
to spatially resolved maps of mean [Z/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] for the Andromeda Galaxy, using an earlier
barred dynamical model of M31. We found that the metallicity is enhanced along the bar, with possible
maxima at the ansae. In the edge-on view the [Z/H] distribution has an X shape due to the boxy/peanut
bulge; the average vertical metallicity gradient is equal to $-0.132\pm0.006$ dex/kpc. We identify
a metallicity-enhanced ring around the bar which also has relatively lower [$\alpha$/Fe]. The
highest [$\alpha$/Fe] is found in the centre, due to the classical bulge. Away from the centre, the
$\alpha$-overabundance in the bar region increases with height, which could be an indication of
a thick disc. We argue that the galaxy assembly resulted in a sharp peak of metallicity in the central
few hundred parsecs and a more gentle negative gradient in the remaining disc, but no [$\alpha$/Fe]
gradient. The formation of the bar lead to the re-arrangement of the [Z/H] distribution, causing
a flat gradient along the bar. Subsequent star formation close to the bar ends may have produced the
metallicity enhancements at the ansae and the [Z/H] enhanced lower-$\alpha$ ring.
