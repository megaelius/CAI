Context. Recent high angular resolution polarimetric continuum observations of circumstellar
disks provide new insights into their magnetic field. However, direct constraints are limited
to the plane of sky component of the magnetic field. Observations of Zeeman split spectral lines
are a potential approach to enhance these insights by providing complementary information. Aims.
We investigate which constraints for magnetic fields in circumstellar disks can be obtained from
Zeeman observations of the $113~\mathrm{GHz}$ CN lines. Furthermore, we analyze the requirements
to perform these observations and their dependence on selected quantities. Methods. We simulate
the Zeeman splitting with the radiative transfer (RT) code POLARIS (Reissl et al. 2016) extended
by our Zeeman splitting RT extension ZRAD (Brauer et al. 2017), which is based on the line RT code Mol3D
(Ober et al. 2015). Results. We find that Zeeman observations of the $113~\mathrm{GHz}$ CN lines
provide significant insights into the magnetic field of circumstellar disks. However, with the
capabilities of recent and upcoming instrument/observatories, even spatially unresolved observations
would be challenging. Nevertheless, these observations are feasible for the most massive disks
with a strong magnetic field and high abundance of CN/H. The most restrictive quantity is the magnetic
field strength, which should be at least in the order of $\sim1~\mathrm{mG}$. In addition, the inclination
of the disk should be around $60\deg$ to preserve the ability to derive the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic
field strength and to obtain a sufficiently high circularly polarized flux.
