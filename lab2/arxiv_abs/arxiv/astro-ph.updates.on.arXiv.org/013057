To date, only 69 pulsars have been identified with a detected pulsed radio emission below 100 MHz.
A LOFAR-core LBA census and a dedicated campaign with the Nan\c{c}ay LOFAR station in stand-alone
mode were carried out in the years 2014$-$2017 in order to extend the known population in this frequency
range. In this paper, we aim to extend the sample of known radio pulsars at low frequencies and to produce
a catalogue in the frequency range of 25-80 MHz. This will allow future studies to probe the local
Galactic pulsar population, in addition to helping explain their emission mechanism, better characterising
the low-frequency turnover in their spectra, and obtaining new information about the interstellar
medium through the study of dispersion, scattering, and scintillation. We observed 102 pulsars
that are known to emit radio pulses below 200 MHz and with declination above \SI{-30}{\degree}.
We used the the Low Band Antennas (LBA) of the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) international station
FR606 at the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Observatory in stand-alone mode, recording data between 25-80 MHz.
complemented with a few additional candidates. Out of our sample of 102 pulsars, we detected 64.
We confirmed the existence of ten pulsars detected below 100 MHz by the LOFAR LBA census for the first
time \citep{bilous_lofar_2019} and we added two more pulsars that had never before been detected
in this frequency range. We provided average pulse profiles, DM values, and mean flux densities
(or upper limits in the case of non-detections). The comparison with previously published results
allows us to identify a hitherto unknown spectral turnover for five pulsars, confirming the expectation
that spectral turnovers are a widespread phenomenon.
