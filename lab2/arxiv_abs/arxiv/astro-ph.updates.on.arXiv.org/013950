Quenched galaxies are often observed to contain a strong bulge component. The key question is whether
this reflects a causal connection - can star formation be quenched dynamically by bulges or the spheroids
of early-type galaxies? We systematically investigate the impact of these morphological components
on star formation, by performing a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of isolated galaxies containing
a spheroid. We vary the bulge mass and scale radius, while the total initial stellar, halo and gas
mass are kept constant, with a gas fraction of 5 per cent. In addition, we consider two different sub-grid
star formation prescriptions. The first follows most simulations in the literature by assuming
a constant star formation efficiency per free-fall time, whereas in the second model it depends
on the gas virial parameter, following high-resolution simulations of turbulent fragmentation.
Across all simulations, central spheroids increase the gas velocity dispersion towards the galactic
centre. This increases the gravitational stability of the gas disc, suppresses fragmentation
and star formation, and results in galaxies hosting extremely smooth and quiescent gas discs that
fall below the galaxy main sequence. These effects amplify when using the more sophisticated, dynamics-dependent
star formation model. Finally, we discover a pronounced relation between the central stellar surface
density and star formation rate (SFR), such that the most bulge-dominated galaxies show the strongest
deviation from the main sequence. We conclude that the SFR of galaxies is not only set by the balance
between accretion and feedback, but carries a (sometimes dominant) dependence on the gravitational
potential.
