Blow-up of solutions for the cosmological fluid equations, often dubbed shell-crossing or orbit
crossing, denotes the breakdown of the single-stream regime of the cold-dark-matter fluid. At
this instant, the velocity becomes multi-valued and the density singular. Shell-crossing is well
understood in one dimension (1D), but not in higher dimensions. This paper is about quasi-one-dimensional
(Q1D) flow that depends on all three coordinates but differs only slightly from a strictly 1D flow,
thereby allowing a perturbative treatment of shell-crossing using the Euler--Poisson equations
written in Lagrangian coordinates. The signature of shell-crossing is then just the vanishing
of the Jacobian of the Lagrangian map, a regular perturbation problem. In essence the problem of
the first shell-crossing, which is highly singular in Eulerian coordinates, has been desingularized
by switching to Lagrangian coordinates, and can then be handled by perturbation theory. Here, all-order
recursion relations are obtained for the time-Taylor coefficients of the displacement field,
and it is shown that the Taylor series has an infinite radius of convergence. This allows the determination
of the time and location of the first shell-crossing, which is generically shown to be taking place
earlier than for the unperturbed 1D flow. The time variable used for these statements is not the cosmic
time $t$ but the linear growth time $\tau \sim t^{2/3}$. For simplicity, calculations are restricted
to an Einstein--de Sitter universe in the Newtonian approximation, and tailored initial data are
used. However it is straightforward to relax these limitations, if needed.
