FARSIDE (Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark ages and Exoplanets) is a Probe-class
concept to place a low radio frequency interferometric array on the farside of the Moon. A NASA-funded
design study, focused on the instrument, a deployment rover, the lander and base station, delivered
an architecture broadly consistent with the requirements for a Probe mission. This notional architecture
consists of 128 dual polarization antennas deployed across a 10 km area by a rover, and tethered to
a base station for central processing, power and data transmission to the Lunar Gateway. FARSIDE
would provide the capability to image the entire sky each minute in 1400 channels spanning frequencies
from 100 kHz to 40 MHz, extending down two orders of magnitude below bands accessible to ground-based
radio astronomy. The lunar farside can simultaneously provide isolation from terrestrial radio
frequency interference, auroral kilometric radiation, and plasma noise from the solar wind. This
would enable near-continuous monitoring of the nearest stellar systems in the search for the radio
signatures of coronal mass ejections and energetic particle events, and would also detect the magnetospheres
for the nearest candidate habitable exoplanets. Simultaneously, FARSIDE would be used to characterize
similar activity in our own solar system, from the Sun to the outer planets, including the hypothetical
Planet Nine. Through precision calibration via an orbiting beacon, and exquisite foreground characterization,
FARSIDE would also measure the Dark Ages global 21-cm signal at redshifts z=50-100. The unique observational
window offered by FARSIDE would enable an abundance of additional science ranging from sounding
of the lunar subsurface to characterization of the interstellar medium in the solar system neighborhood.
