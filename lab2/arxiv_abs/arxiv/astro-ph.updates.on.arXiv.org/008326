It has been recently proposed that the ejected matter from white dwarf (WD) binary mergers can produce
transient, optical and infrared emission similar to the "kilonovae" of neutron star (NS) binary
mergers. To confirm this we calculate the electromagnetic emission from WD-WD mergers and compare
with kilonova observations. We simulate WD-WD mergers leading to a massive, fast rotating, highly
magnetized WD with an adapted version of the smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) code Phantom.
We thus obtain initial conditions for the ejecta such as escape velocity, mass and initial position
and distribution. The subsequent thermal and dynamical evolution of the ejecta is obtained by integrating
the energy-conservation equation accounting for expansion cooling and a heating source given
by the fallback accretion onto the newly-formed WD and its magneto-dipole radiation. We show that
magnetospheric processes in the merger can lead to a prompt, short gamma-ray emission of up to $\approx
10^{46}$~erg in a timescale of $0.1$--$1$~s. The bulk of the ejecta initially expands non-relativistically
with velocity $0.01~c$ and then it accelerates to $0.1~c$ due to the injection of fallback accretion
energy. The ejecta become transparent at optical wavelengths around $\sim 7$~days post-merger
with a luminosity $10^{41}$--$10^{42}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. The X-ray emission from the fallback accretion
becomes visible around $\sim 150$--$200$~day post-merger with a luminosity of $10^{39}$~erg~s$^{-1}$.
We also predict the post-merger time at which the central WD should appear as a pulsar depending on
the value of the magnetic field and rotation period.
