The LIGO/Virgo Scientific Collaboration recently announced the detection of a compact object
binary merger, GW190412, as the first asymmetric binary black hole (BBH) merger with mass ratio
$q\approx0.25$. Other than the mass ratio, this BBH has shown to have a positive effective spin of
around $\chi_{\rm eff}\approx0.28$. Assuming a field formation channel, associating this effective
spin to either the primary or the secondary BH each has its implications: If the spin of the BBH comes
form the primary BH, it has consequences for the efficiency of angular momentum transport in the
formation of the BH. If, on the other hand, the spin is due to the secondary BH through tidal spin-up
processes, one has to note that (i) such processes have very short delay-times, and (ii) subsequently,
their local merger rate is determined by local star formation rate at assumed formation metallicity
of the BBH. We show that the predicted merger rate density from this channel is $\lesssim 0.3~\rm
Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ and in tension with the rather high local merger rate of such systems which we estimate
from this single event to be $\sim 1.7^{+2.5}_{-1.4}~\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ (90\% confidence interval,
and assuming 50 days of observing time). Large natal kicks ($v\gtrsim 500\,{\rm km/s}$) would be
required to get such BBHs with an in-plane spin component to account for the marginal detection of
precession in GW190412. However, this would only exacerbate the tension as the estimated local
merger rate would be further decreased. Similarly, the formation of such systems through the dynamical
assembly is exceedingly rare, leaving this system a dilemma hard to account for with the currently
accepted paradigms of BBH formation.
