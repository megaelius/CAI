Prior to star formation, pre-stellar cores accumulate matter towards the centre. As a consequence,
their central density increases while the temperature decreases. Understanding the evolution
of the chemistry and physics in this early phase is crucial to study the processes governing the formation
of a star. We aim at studying the chemical differentiation of a prototypical pre-stellar core, L1544,
by detailed molecular maps. In contrast with single pointing observations, we performed a deep
study on the dependencies of chemistry on physical and external conditions. We present the emission
maps of 39 different molecular transitions belonging to 22 different molecules in the central 6.25
arcmin$^2$ of L1544. We classified our sample in five families, depending on the location of their
emission peaks within the core. Furthermore, to systematically study the correlations among different
molecules, we have performed the principal component analysis (PCA) on the integrated emission
maps. The PCA allows us to reduce the amount of variables in our dataset. Finally, we compare the maps
of the first three principal components with the H$_2$ column density map, and the T$_{dust}$ map
of the core. The results of our qualitative analysis is the classification of the molecules in our
dataset in the following groups: (i) the $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ family (carbon chain molecules), (ii)
the dust peak family (nitrogen-bearing species), (iii) the methanol peak family (oxygen-bearing
molecules), (iv) the HNCO peak family (HNCO, propyne and its deuterated isotopologues). Only HC$^{18}$O$^+$
and $^{13}$CS do not belong to any of the above mentioned groups. The principal component maps allow
us to confirm the (anti-)correlations among different families that were described in a first qualitative
analysis, but also points out the correlation that could not be inferred before.
