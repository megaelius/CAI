We observed the slowly revolving pulsar 1E 161348-5055 (1E 1613, spin period of 6.67 h) in the supernova
remnant RCW 103 two times with XMM-Newton and one with the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The VLT observation
was performed on 2016 June 30, about a week after the detection of a large outburst from 1E 1613. We
found at the position of 1E 1613 a near infrared (IR) source with Ks = 20.68 +/- 0.12 mag that was not
detected (Ks > 21.2 mag) in data collected with the same instruments in 2006, during X-ray quiescence.
Its position and behaviour are consistent with a counterpart in literature that was discovered
with HST in the following weeks in adjacent near-IR bands. The XMM-Newton pointings were carried
out on 2016 August 19 and on 2018 February 14. While the spectra collected are similar in shape between
each other and to what is observed in quiescence (a blackbody with kT ~ 0.5 keV plus a second, harder
component--either another, hotter blackbody with kT ~ 1.2 keV or a power law with photon index ~3),
the two pointings caught 1E 1613 at different luminosity along its decay pattern: about 4.8e34 erg/s
in 2016 and 1.2e34 erg/s in 2018 (0.5-10 keV, for the double-blackbody model and for 3.3 kpc), still
almost ~10 times brighter than the quiescent level. The pulse profile displayed dramatic changes,
apparently evolving from the complex, multi-peak morphology observed in high-luminosity states
to the more sinusoidal form characteristic of latency. The inspection of the X-ray light curves
revealed in the 2016 observation two flares with unusual properties: they are long (~1 ks to be compared
with 0.1-1 s of typical magnetar bursts) and faint (~1e34 erg/s, with respect to 1e38 erg/s or more
in magnetars). Their spectra are comparatively soft and resemble the hotter thermal component
of the persistent emission.
