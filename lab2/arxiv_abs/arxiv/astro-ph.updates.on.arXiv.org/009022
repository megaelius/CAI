We report on the accretion properties of low-mass stars in the LH95 association within the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Using non-contemporaneous wide-band and narrow-band photometry obtained
with the HST, we identify 245 low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates showing H$\alpha$ excess
emission above the 4$\sigma$ level. We derive their physical parameters, i.e. effective temperatures,
luminosities, masses ($M_\star$), ages, accretion luminosities, and mass accretion rates ($\dot
M_{\rm acc}$). We identify two different stellar populations: younger than ~8Myr with median $\dot
M_{\rm acc}$~5.4x10$^{-8}M_\odot$/yr (and $M_\star$~0.15-1.8$M_\odot$) and older than ~8Myr
with median $\dot M_{\rm acc}$~4.8x10$^{-9}M_\odot$/yr (and $M_\star$~0.6-1.2$M_\odot$).
We find that the younger PMS candidates are assembled in groups around Be stars, while older PMS candidates
are uniformly distributed within the region without evidence of clustering. We find that $\dot
M_{\rm acc}$ in LH95 decreases with time more slowly than what is observed in Galactic star-forming
regions (SFRs). This agrees with the recent interpretation according to which higher metallicity
limits the accretion process both in rate and duration due to higher radiation pressure. The $\dot
M_{\rm acc}-M_\star$ relationship shows different behaviour at different ages, becoming progressively
steeper at older ages, indicating that the effects of mass and age on $\dot M_{\rm acc}$ cannot be
treated independently. With the aim to identify reliable correlations between mass, age, and $\dot
M_{\rm acc}$, we used for our PMS candidates a multivariate linear regression fit between these
parameters. The comparison between our results with those obtained in other SFRs of our Galaxy and
the MCs confirms the importance of the metallicity for the study of the $\dot M_{\rm acc}$ evolution
in clusters with different environmental conditions.
