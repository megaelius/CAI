We present homogeneous and accurate iron abundances for 42 Galactic Cepheids based on high-spectral
resolution (R~38,000) high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR>100) optical spectra collected with
UVES at VLT (128 spectra). The above abundances were complemented with high-quality iron abundances
provided either by our group (86) or available in the literature. We paid attention in deriving a
common metallicity scale and ended up with a sample of 450 Cepheids. We also estimated for the entire
sample accurate individual distances by using homogeneous near-infrared photometry and the reddening
free Period-Wesenheit relations. The new metallicity gradient is linear over a broad range of Galactocentric
distances (Rg~5-19 kpc) and agrees quite well with similar estimates available in the literature
(-0.060+/-0.002 dex/kpc). We also uncover evidence which suggests that the residuals of the metallicity
gradient are tightly correlated with candidate Cepheid Groups (CGs). The candidate CGs have been
identified as spatial overdensities of Cepheids located across the thin disk. They account for
a significant fraction of the residual fluctuations, and in turn for the large intrinsic dispersion
of the metallicity gradient. We performed a detailed comparison with metallicity gradients based
on different tracers: OB stars and open clusters. We found very similar metallicity gradients for
ages younger than 3 Gyrs, while for older ages we found a shallower slope and an increase in the intrinsic
spread. The above findings rely on homogeneous age, metallicity and distance scales. Finally we
found, by using a large sample of Galactic and Magellanic Cepheids for which are available accurate
iron abundances, that the dependence of the luminosity amplitude on metallicity is vanishing.
