Many protostellar disks show central cavities, rings, or spiral arms likely caused by low-mass
stellar or planetary companions, yet few such features are conclusively tied to bodies embedded
in the disks. We note that even small features on the disk's surface cast shadows, because the starlight
grazes the surface. We therefore focus on accurately computing the disk's thickness, which depends
on its temperature. We present models with temperatures set by the balance between starlight heating
and radiative cooling, that are also in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. The planet has 20, 100,
or 1000~M$_\oplus$, ranging from barely enough to perturb the disk significantly, to clearing
a deep tidal gap. The hydrostatic balance strikingly alters the model disk's appearance. The planet-carved
gap's outer wall puffs up under starlight heating, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond. The
shadow appears in scattered light as a dark ring that could be mistaken for a gap opened by another
more distant planet. The surface brightness contrast between outer wall and shadow for the 1000-M$_\oplus$
planet is an order of magnitude greater than a model neglecting the temperature disturbances. The
shadow is so deep it largely hides the planet-launched spiral wave's outer arm. Temperature gradients
are such that outer low-mass planets undergoing orbital migration will converge within the shadow.
Furthermore the temperature perturbations affect the shape, size, and contrast of features at
millimeter and centimeter wavelengths. Thus radiative heating and cooling are key to the appearance
of protostellar disks with embedded planets.
