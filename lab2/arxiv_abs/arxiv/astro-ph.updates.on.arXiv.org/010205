When two black holes merge in a dense star cluster, they form a new black hole with a well-defined mass
and spin. If that "second-generation" black hole remains in the cluster, it will continue to participate
in dynamical encounters, form binaries, and potentially merge again. Using a grid of 96 dynamical
models of dense star clusters and a cosmological model of cluster formation, we explore the production
of binary black hole mergers where at least one component of the binary was forged in a previous merger.
We create four hypothetical universes where every black hole born in the collapse of a massive star
has a dimensionless Kerr spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm birth}$, of 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5. We show that
if all stellar-born black holes are non-spinning ($\chi_{\rm birth} = 0.0$), then more than 10%
of merging binary black holes from clusters have components formed from previous mergers, accounting
for more than 20% of the mergers from globular clusters detectable by LIGO/Virgo. Furthermore,
nearly 7% of detectable mergers would have a component with a mass $\gtrsim 55M_{\odot}$, placing
them clearly in the mass "gap" region where black holes cannot form from isolated collapsing stars
due to the pulsational-pair instability mechanism. On the other hand, if black holes are born spinning,
then the contribution from these second-generation mergers decreases, making up as little as 1%
of all detections from globular clusters when $\chi_{\rm birth} = 0.5$. We make quantitative predictions
for the detected masses, mass ratios, and spin properties of first- and second-generation mergers
from dense star clusters, and show how these distributions are highly sensitive to the birth spins
of black holes.
