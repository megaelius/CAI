For a complete picture of galaxy cluster formation, it is important that we start probing the early
epoch of z~2-7 during which clusters and their galaxies first began to form. Because the study of
these so-called "proto-clusters" is currently limited by small number statistics, widely varying
selection techniques and assumptions, we have performed a systematic study of cluster formation
utilizing cosmological simulations. We use the Millennium Simulations to track the evolution
of dark matter and galaxies in ~3,000 clusters from the earliest times to z=0. We define an effective
radius R_e for proto-clusters and characterize their growth in size and mass. We show that the progenitor
regions of galaxy clusters (M>10^14 M_sun/h) can already be identified at least up to z~5, provided
that the galaxy overdensities, delta_gal, are measured on a sufficiently large scale (R_e~5-10
cMpc). We present the overdensities in matter, DM halos, and galaxies as functions of present-day
cluster mass, redshift, bias, and window size that can be used to interpret the structures found
in real surveys. We derive the probability that a structure having a delta_gal, defined by a set of
observational selection criteria, is indeed a proto-cluster, and show how their z=0 masses can
already be estimated long before virialization. Galaxy overdensity profiles as a function of radius
are presented. We further show how their projected surface overdensities decrease as the uncertainties
in redshift measurements increase. We provide a table of proto-cluster candidates selected from
the literature, and discuss their properties in the light of our simulations predictions. This
work provides the general framework that will allow us to extend the study of cluster formation out
to much higher redshifts using the large number of proto-clusters that are expected to be discovered
in, e.g., the upcoming HETDEX and HSC surveys.
