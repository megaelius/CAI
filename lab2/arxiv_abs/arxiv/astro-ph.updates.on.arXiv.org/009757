Context: The chromospheric anemone microflares (AMF) are an interesting kind of the transient
solar phenomena where the emission regions have a multi-ribbon configuration, as distinct from
the ordinary flares usually possessing only two ribbons. The previously reported AMFs had typically
three or, less frequently, four ribbons; and it was shown in our recent Letter [Yu.V. Dumin & B.V.
Somov, A&A, 623, L4 (2019)] that they can be reasonably described by the so-called GKSS model of magnetic
field, involving four magnetic sources with various polarity and arrangement. Aims: An interesting
question is if one can see more complex types of AMF (e.g., containing the greater number of the emission
ribbons), which might be produced by more elaborated magnetic configurations? Methods: To answer
this question, we performed inspection of the large set of the emission patterns in the chromospheric
line CaII H recorded by Hinode/SOT and confronted them with the respective magnetograms obtained
by SDO/HMI. Results: As follows from our analysis, it is really possible to identify the new types
of AMF, which have not been reported in the previous literature. Firstly, these are the flares occurring
in the regions with unbalanced magnetic flux. Secondly, and most interesting, it is possible to
identify the AMFs with much more complex spatial configurations as compared to the previously-known
ones, e.g., involving five luminous ribbons with a nontrivial arrangement. As follows from the
corresponding magnetograms, they are produced by the effective magnetic sources (sunspots) of
different polarity with intermittent arrangement, but their number is greater than in the standard
GKSS model.
