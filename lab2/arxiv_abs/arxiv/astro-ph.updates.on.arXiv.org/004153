How mass is accumulated from cloud-scale down to individual stars is a key open question in understanding
high-mass star formation. Here, we present the mass accumulation process in a hub-filament cloud
G22 which is composed of four supercritical filaments. Velocity gradients detected along three
filaments indicate that they are collapsing with a total mass infall rate of about 440 $M_\odot$
Myr$^{-1}$, suggesting the hub mass would be doubled in six free-fall times, adding up to $ \sim2
$ Myr. A fraction of the masses in the central clumps C1 and C2 can be accounted for through large-scale
filamentary collapse. Ubiquitous blue profiles in HCO$^+$ $ (3-2) $ and $^{13}$CO $ (3-2) $ spectra
suggest a clump-scale collapse scenario in the most massive and densest clump C1. The estimated
infall velocity and mass infall rate are 0.31 km s$^{-1}$ and $ 7.2 \times10^{-4} $ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,
respectively. In clump C1, a hot molecular core (SMA1) is revealed by the SMA observations and an
outflow-driving high-mass protostar is located at the center of SMA1. The mass of the protostar
is estimated to be $ 11-15 $ $M_\odot$ and it is still growing with an accretion rate of $ 7\times10^{-5}
$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The coexistent infall in filaments, clump C1, and the central hot core in
G22 suggests that pre-assembled mass reservoirs (i.e., high-mass starless cores) may not be required
to form high-mass stars. In the course of high-mass star formation, the central protostar, the core,
and the clump can simultaneously grow in mass via core-fed/disk accretion, clump-fed accretion,
and filamentary/cloud collapse.
