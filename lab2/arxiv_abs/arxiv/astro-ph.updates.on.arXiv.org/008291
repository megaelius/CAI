Context. Metal-poor massive stars are supposed to be progenitors of certain supernovae, gamma-ray
bursts and compact object mergers, potentially contributing to the early epochs of the Universe
with their strong ionizing radiation. However, they remain mainly theoretical as individual spectroscopic
observations of such objects have rarely been carried out below the metallicity of the SMC. Aims.
This work aims at exploring what our state-of-the-art theories of stellar evolution combined with
those of stellar atmospheres predict about a certain type of metal-poor (0.02 Z$_{\odot}$) hot
massive stars, the chemically homogeneously evolving ones, called TWUIN stars. Methods. Synthetic
spectra corresponding to a broad range in masses (20-130 M$_{\odot}$) and covering several evolutionary
phases from the zero-age main-sequence up to the core helium-burning stage were computed. Results.
We find that TWUIN stars show almost no emission lines during most of their {core hydrogen-burning}
lifetimes. Most metal lines are completely absent, including nitrogen. During their core helium-burning
stage, lines switch to emission and even some metal lines (oxygen and carbon, but still almost no
nitrogen) show up. Mass loss and clumping play a significant role in line-formation in later evolutionary
phases, particularly during core helium-burning. Most of our spectra are classified as an early
O type giant or supergiant, and we find Wolf-Rayet stars of type WO in the core helium-burning phase.
Conclusions. An extremely hot, early O type star observed in a low-metallicity galaxy could be the
outcome of chemically homogeneous evolution $-$ and therefore the progenitor of a long-duration
gamma-ray burst or a type Ic supernova. TWUIN stars may play an important role in reionizing the Universe
due to their being hot without showing prominent emission lines during the majority of their lifetimes.
