We construct a family of models for the evolution of energetic particles in the starburst galaxy
M82 and compare them to observations to test the calorimeter assumption that all cosmic ray energy
is radiated in the starburst region. Assuming constant cosmic ray acceleration efficiency with
Milky Way parameters, we calculate the cosmic-ray proton and primary and secondary electron/positron
populations as a function of energy. Cosmic rays are injected with Galactic energy distributions
and electron-to-proton ratio via type II supernovae at the observed rate of 0.07/yr. From the cosmic
ray spectra, we predict the radio synchrotron and \gamma-ray spectra. To more accurately model
the radio spectrum, we incorporate a multiphase interstellar medium in the starburst region of
M82. Our model interstellar medium is highly fragmented with compact dense molecular clouds and
dense photoionized gas, both embedded in a hot, low density medium in overall pressure equilibrium.
The spectra predicted by this one-zone model are compared to the observed radio and \gamma-ray spectra
of M82. Chi-squared tests are used with radio and \gamma-ray observations and a range of model predictions
to find the best-fit parameters. The best-fit model yields constraints on key parameters in the
starburst zone of M82, including a magnetic field strength of ~250 \mu G and a wind advection speed
in the range of 300-700 km/s. We find that M82 is a good electron calorimeter but not an ideal cosmic-ray
proton calorimeter and discuss the implications of our results for the astrophysics of the far infrared-radio
correlation in starburst galaxies.
