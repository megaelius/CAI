Repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) present excellent opportunities to identify FRB progenitors
and host environments, as well as decipher the underlying emission mechanism. Detailed studies
of repeating FRBs might also hold clues to the origin of FRBs as a population. We aim to detect the first
two repeating FRBs: FRB 121102 (R1) and FRB 180814.J0422+73 (R2), and characterise their repeat
statistics. We also want to significantly improve the sky localisation of R2. We use the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope to conduct extensive follow-up of these two repeating FRBs. The new phased-array
feed system, Apertif, allows covering the entire sky position uncertainty of R2 with fine spatial
resolution in one pointing. We characterise the energy distribution and the clustering of detected
R1 bursts. We detected 30 bursts from R1. When combined with previous reports, our measurements
indicate an increase of 2.7(2) pc cm$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ in the dispersion measure along the line of
sight. We place an upper limit of 8% on the linear polarisation fraction of the brightest burst. We
did not detect any bursts from R2. A single power-law might not fit the R1 burst energy distribution
across the full energy range or widely separated detections. Our observations provide improved
constraints on the clustering of R1 bursts. Our stringent upper limits on the linear polarisation
fraction imply a significant depolarisation, either intrinsic to the emission mechanism or caused
by the intervening medium, at 1400 MHz that is not observed at higher frequencies. The non-detection
of any bursts from R2 imply either a highly clustered nature of the bursts, a steep spectral index,
or a combination of both. Alternatively, R2 has turned off completely, either permanently or for
an extended period of time.
