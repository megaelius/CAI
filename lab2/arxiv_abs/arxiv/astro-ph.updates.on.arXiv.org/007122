It is not known whether the original carriers of Earth's nitrogen were molecular ices or refractory
dust. To investigate this question, we have used data and results of Herschel observations towards
two protostellar sources: the high-mass hot core of Orion KL, and the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422.
Towards Orion KL, our analysis of the molecular inventory of Crockett et al. (2014) indicates that
HCN is the organic molecule that contains by far the most nitrogen, carrying $74_{-9}^{+5}\%$ of
nitrogen-in-organics. Following this evidence, we explore HCN towards IRAS 16293-2422, which
we consider a solar analog. Towards IRAS 16293-2422, we have reduced and analyzed Herschel spectra
of HCN, and fit these observations against "jump" abundance models of IRAS 16293-2422's protostellar
envelope. We find an inner-envelope HCN abundance $X_{\textrm{in}} = 5.9\pm0.7 \times 10^{-8}$
and an outer-envelope HCN abundance $X_{\textrm{out}} = 1.3 \pm 0.1 \times 10^{-9}$. We also find
the sublimation temperature of HCN to be $T_{\textrm{jump}} = 71 \pm 3$~K; this measured $T_{\textrm{jump}}$
enables us to predict an HCN binding energy $E_{\textrm{B}}/k = 3840 \pm 140$~K. Based on a comparison
of the HCN/H2O ratio in these protostars to N/H2O ratios in comets, we find that HCN (and, by extension,
other organics) in these protostars is incapable of providing the total bulk N/H2O in comets. We
suggest that refractory dust, not molecular ices, was the bulk provider of nitrogen to comets. However,
interstellar dust is not known to have 15N enrichment, while high 15N enrichment is seen in both nitrogen-bearing
ices and in cometary nitrogen. This may indicate that these 15N-enriched ices were an important
contributor to the nitrogen in planetesimals and likely to the Earth.
