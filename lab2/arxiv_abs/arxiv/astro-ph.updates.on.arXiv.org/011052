We mapped the Galactic young massive star cluster Westerlund 2 (Wd2) with the integral field spectrograph
MUSE (spatial resolution: 0.2arcsec/px, spectral resolution: $\Delta \lambda$ = 1.25A, wavelength
range 4600-9350A) mounted on the VLT, as part of an on-going study to measure the stellar and gas kinematics
of the cluster region. In this paper we present the fully reduced dataset and introduce our new Python
package "MUSEpack", which we developed to measure stellar radial velocities with an absolute precision
of 1-2km/s without the necessity of a spectral template library. This novel method uses the two-dimensional
spectra and an atomic transition line library to create templates around strong absorption lines
for each individual star. The code runs fully automatically on multi-core machines, which makes
it possible to efficiently determine stellar radial velocities of a large number of stars with the
necessary precision to measure the velocity dispersion of young star clusters. MUSEpack also provides
an enhanced method for removing telluric lines in crowded fields without sky exposures and a Python
wrapper for ESO's data reduction pipeline. We observed Wd2 with a total of 11 short and 5 long exposures
to cover the bright nebular emission and OB stars, as well as the fainter pre-main sequence stars
down to ~1M$_\odot$. The survey covers an area of ~11arcmin$^2$ (15.8pc$^2$). In total, we extracted
1,725 stellar spectra with a mean S/N>5 per pixel. A typical radial velocity (RV) uncertainty of
4.78km/s, 2.92km/s, and 1.1km/s is reached for stars with a mean S/N>10, S/N>20, S/N>50 per pixel,
respectively. Depending on the number of spectral lines used to measure the RVs, it is possible to
reach RV accuracies of 0.9km/s, 1.3km/s, and 2.2km/s with $\geq5$, 3-4, and 1-2 spectral lines,
respectively. The combined statistical uncertainty on the radial velocity measurements is 1.10km/s.
