Aims.We study the dependence of the halo Abundance Function (AF) on different environments in a
whole-sky {\Lambda}CDM light-cone halo catalogue extending to z~0.65, using a simple and well
defined halo isolation criterion. Methods. The isolation status of each individual dark matter
halo is determined by its nearest neighbour distance, which defines the maximum spherical devoided
region around it (although the true size of the devoided region may be much larger since it is not necessarily
spherical). A versatile double power-law Schechter function is used to fit the dark matter halo
AF and its derived parameters are studied as a function of halo isolation status. Results. (a) Our
function fits extremely well the halo abundances for all halo isolation status, while the well established
theoretical mass functions, integrated over the volume of the light-cone, provide an adequate
but worse fit than our phenomenological model. (b) As expected, and in agreement with other studies
based on snap-shot simulations, we find significant differences of the halo abundance function
as a function of halo isolation, indicating different rates of halo formation. The slope of the power-law
and the characteristic mass of the Schechter-like fitting function decrease with isolation, a
result consistent with the formation of less massive halos in lower density regions. (c) We find
an unexpected upturn of the characteristic mass of the most isolated halos of our sample. This upturn
originates and characterises only the higher redshift regime (z > 0.45) which probably implies
a significant and recent evolution of the isolation status of the most isolated and most massive
halos.
