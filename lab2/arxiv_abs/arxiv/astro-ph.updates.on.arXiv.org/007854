We investigate a sample of 3412 {\it International Celestial Reference Frame} (ICRF3) extragalactic
radio-loud sources with accurate positions determined by VLBI in the S/X band, mostly active galactic
nuclei (AGN) and quasars, which are cross-matched with optical sources in the second Gaia data release
(Gaia DR2). The main goal of this study is to determine a core sample of astrometric objects that define
the mutual orientation of the two fundamental reference frames, the Gaia (optical) and the ICRF3
(radio) frames. The distribution of normalized offsets between the VLBI sources and their optical
counterparts is non-Rayleigh, with a deficit around the modal value and a tail extending beyond
the 3-sigma confidence level. A few filters are applied to the sample in order to discard double cross-matches,
confusion sources, and Gaia astrometric solutions of doubtful quality. {\it Panoramic Survey
Telescope and Rapid Response System} (Pan-STARRS) and {\it Dark Energy Survey} (DES) stacked multi-color
images are used to further deselect objects that are less suitable for precision astrometry, such
as extended galaxies, double and multiple sources, and obvious misidentifications. After this
cleaning, 2642 quasars remain, of which 20\% still have normalized offset magnitudes exceeding
3, or 99\% confidence level. We publish a list of 2118 radio-loud quasars of prime astrometric quality.
The observed dependence of binned median offset on redshift shows the expected decline at small
redshifts, but also an unexpected rise at $z\sim 1.6$, which may be attributed to the emergence of
the C IV emission line in the Gaia's $G$ band. The Gaia DR2 parallax zero-point is found to be color-dependent,
suggesting an uncorrected instrumental calibration effect.
