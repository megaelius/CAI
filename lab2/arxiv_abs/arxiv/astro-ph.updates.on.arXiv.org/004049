The low dust temperatures (<14 K) of Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) make them ideal targets
to probe the initial conditions and very early phase of star formation. TOP-SCOPE is a joint survey
program targeting ~2000 PGCCs in J=1-0 transitions of CO isotopologues and ~1000 PGCCs in 850 micron
continuum emisison. The objective of the TOP-SCOPE survey and the joint surveys (SMT 10-m, KVN 21-m
and NRO 45-m) is to statistically study the initial conditions occurring during star formation
and the evolution of molecular clouds, across a wide range of environments. The observations, data
analysis and example science cases for these surveys are introduced with an exemplar source, PGCC
G26.53+0.17 (G26), which is a filamentary infrared dark cloud (IRDC). The total mass, the length
and the mean line-mass (M/L) of the G26 filament are ~6200 Msun, ~12 pc and ~500 Msun/pc, respectively.
Ten massive clumps including eight starless ones are found along the filament. The fragmentation
in G26 filament seems to be governed by turbulence-dominated cylindrical fragmentation. A bimodal
behavior in dust emissivity spectral index (beta) distribution is found in G26, suggesting grain
growth along the filament. The G26 filament may be formed due to large-scale compression flows evidenced
by the temperature and velocity gradients across its natal cloud. Sub-filaments in G26 have different
velocities and may interact with each other. The most massive clump 6 may still accrete gas along
sub-filaments with a total accretion rate of 1*10E-3 Msun/yr. Clump 6 as a whole may be still in global
collapse while its denser part traced by HCO+ J=1-0 and H2CO 2(1,2)-1(1,1) lines seems to be undergoing
expansion due to outflow feedback. Clump 6 is more chemically evolved than other quiescent clumps
in IRDCs and seems to be in a more chemically evolved phase.
