Context. Magnetic reconnection during flares takes place in the corona but a substantial part of
flare energy is deposited in the chromosphere. However, high-resolution spectro-polarimetric
chromospheric observations of flares are very rare. The most used observables are Ca II 8542 {\AA}
and He I 10830 {\AA}. Aims. We aim to study the chromosphere during a C3.6 class flare via spectro-polarimetric
observations of the He I D3 line. Methods. We present the first SST/CRISP spectro-polarimetric
observations of He I D3. We analyze the data using the inversion code HAZEL, and estimate the LOS velocity
and the magnetic field vector. Results. Strong He I D3 emission at the flare footpoints, as well as
strong He I D3 absorption profiles tracing the flaring loops are observed during the flare. The He
I D3 traveling emission kernels at the flare footpoints exhibit strong chromospheric condensations
of up to $\sim$ 60 km/s at their leading edge. Our observations suggest that such condensations result
in shocking the deep chromosphere, causing broad and modestly blueshifted He I D3 profiles indicating
subsequent upflows. A strong and rather vertical magnetic field of up to $\sim$ 2500 G is measured
in the flare footpoints, confirming that the He I D3 line is likely formed in the deep chromosphere
at those locations. We provide chromospheric line-of-sight velocity and magnetic field maps obtained
via He I D3 inversions. We propose a fan-spine configuration as the flare magnetic field topology.
Conclusions. The He I D3 line is an excellent diagnostic to study the chromosphere during flares.
The impact of strong condensations on the deep chromosphere has been observed. Detailed maps of
the flare dynamics and the magnetic field are obtained.
