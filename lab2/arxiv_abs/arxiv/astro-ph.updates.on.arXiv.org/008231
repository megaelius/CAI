One of the key questions in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies is how starbursts
affect the assembly of stellar populations in galaxies over time. We define a burst indicator ($\eta$),
which compares a galaxy's star formation rates on short ($\sim10$ Myr) and long ($\sim100$ Myr)
timescales. To estimate $\eta$, we apply the detailed temporal luminosity response of H$\alpha$
and near-ultraviolet emission to simulated star formation histories (SFHs) from Semi-Analytic
Models and the Mufasa hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We find that the average value
of $\eta$ is not itself a good indicator of star formation stochasticity (burstiness); indeed we
show that this average should be close to zero unless the population being studied has an average
SFH which is rising or falling rapidly. Instead, analyzing the width of the distribution of $\eta$
for ensembles of galaxies allows us to characterize the level of burstiness in a galaxy population's
recent star formation history. We find this width to be robust to variations in stellar initial mass
function (IMF) and metallicity. We apply realistic noise and selection effects to the models to
generate mock HST and JWST galaxy catalogs and compare these catalogs with 3D-HST observations
of 956 galaxies at $0.65<z<1.5$ detected in H$\alpha$. Measurements of $\eta$ are unaffected by
dust measurement errors under the assumption that $E(B-V)_\mathrm{stars}=0.44\,E(B-V)_\mathrm{gas}$
(i.e., $Q_\mathrm{sg}=0.44$). However, setting $Q_\mathrm{sg}=0.8^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ removes
an unexpected dependence of the average value of $\eta$ upon dust attenuation and stellar mass in
the 3D-HST sample while also resolving disagreements in the distribution of star formation rates.
However, even varying the dust law cannot resolve all discrepancies between the simulated and the
observed galaxies.
