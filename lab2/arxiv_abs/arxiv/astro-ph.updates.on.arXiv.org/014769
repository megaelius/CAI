Calibrating photometric redshift errors in weak lensing surveys with external data is extremely
challenging. We show that both Gaussian and outlier photo-z parameters can be self-calibrated
from the data alone. This comes at no cost for the neutrino masses, curvature and dark energy equation
of state $w_0$, but with a 65% degradation when both $w_0$ and $w_a$ are varied. We perform a realistic
forecast for the Vera Rubin Observatory (VRO) Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) 3x2 analysis,
combining cosmic shear, projected galaxy clustering and galaxy - galaxy lensing. We confirm the
importance of marginalizing over photo-z outliers. We examine a subset of internal cross-correlations,
dubbed "null correlations", which are usually ignored in 3x2 analyses. Despite contributing only
$\sim$ 10% of the total signal-to-noise, these null correlations improve the constraints on photo-z
parameters by up to an order of magnitude. Using the same galaxy sample as sources and lenses dramatically
improves the photo-z uncertainties too. Together, these methods add robustness to any claim of
detected new Physics, and reduce the statistical errors on cosmology by 15% and 10% respectively.
Finally, including CMB lensing from an experiment like Simons Observatory or CMB-S4 improves the
cosmological and photo-z posterior constraints by about 10%, and further improves the robustness
to systematics. To give intuition on the Fisher forecasts, we examine in detail several toy models
that explain the origin of the photo-z self-calibration. Our Fisher code LaSSI (Large-Scale Structure
Information), which includes the effect of Gaussian and outlier photo-z, shear multiplicative
bias, linear galaxy bias, and extensions to $\Lambda$CDM, is publicly available at https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/LaSSI
