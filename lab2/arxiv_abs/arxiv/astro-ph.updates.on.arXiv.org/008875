The magnetic field is a key ingredient in the recipe of star formation. Over the past two decades,
millimeter and submillimeter interferometers have made major strides in unveiling the role of
the magnetic field in star formation at progressively smaller spatial scales. From the kiloparsec
scale of molecular clouds down to the inner few hundred au immediately surrounding forming stars,
the polarization at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths is dominated by polarized thermal
dust emission, where the dust grains are aligned relative to the magnetic field. Interferometric
studies have focused on this dust polarization and occasionally on the polarization of spectral-line
emission. We review the current state of the field of magnetized star formation in the context of
several questions that continue to motivate the studies of high- and low-mass star formation. By
aggregating and analyzing the results from individual studies, we come to several conclusions:
(1) Magnetic fields and outflows from low-mass protostellar cores are randomly aligned, suggesting
that the magnetic field at ~1000 au scales is not the dominant factor in setting the angular momentum
of embedded disks and outflows. (2) Recent measurements of the thermal and dynamic properties in
high-mass star-forming regions reveal small virial parameters, challenging the assumption of
equilibrium star formation. However, we estimate that a magnetic field strength of a fraction of
a mG to several mG in these objects could bring the dense gas close to a state of equilibrium. Finally,
(3) We find that the small number of sources with hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphologies
at 0.01 -- 0.1 pc scales cannot be explained purely by projection effects, suggesting that while
it does occur occasionally, magnetically dominated core collapse is not the predominant mode of
low- or high-mass star formation. [Abridged]
