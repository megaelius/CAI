We study the relativistic viscous accretion flows around the Kerr black holes. We present the governing
equations that describe the steady state flow motion in full general relativity and solve them in
1.5D to obtain the complete set of global transonic solutions in terms of the flow parameters, namely
specific energy (${\cal E}$), specific angular momentum (${\cal L}$) and viscosity ($\alpha$).
We obtain a new type of accretion solution which was not reported earlier. Further, we show for the
first time to the best of our knowledge that viscous accretion solutions may contain shock waves
particularly when flow simultaneously passes through both inner critical point ($r_{\rm in}$)
and outer critical point ($r_{\rm out}$) before entering into the Kerr black holes. We examine the
shock properties, namely shock location ($r_s$) and compression ratio ($R$, the measure of density
compression across the shock front) and show that shock can form for a large region of parameter space
in ${\cal L}-{\cal E}$ plane. We study the effect of viscous dissipation on the shock parameter space
and find that parameter space shrinks as $\alpha$ is increased. We also calculate the critical viscosity
parameter ($\alpha^{\rm cri}$) beyond which standing shock solutions disappear and examine the
correlation between the black hole spin ($a_k$) and $\alpha^{\rm cri}$. Finally, the relevance
of our work is conferred where, using $r_s$ and $R$, we empirically estimate the oscillation frequency
of the shock front ($\nu_{QPO}$) when it exhibits Quasi-periodic (QP) variations. The obtained
results indicate that the present formalism seems to be potentially viable to account for the QPO
frequency in the range starting from milli-Hz to kilo-Hz as $0.386~{\rm Hz}\le \nu_{QPO} \left(\frac{10M_\odot}{M_{BH}}
\right) \le 1312$ Hz for $a_k=0.99$, where $M_{BH}$ stands for the black hole mass.
