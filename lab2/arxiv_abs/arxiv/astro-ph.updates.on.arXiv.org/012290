General-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations have revolutionized our understanding
of black-hole accretion. Here, we present a GPU-accelerated GRMHD code H-AMR with multi-faceted
optimizations that, collectively, accelerate computation by 2-5 orders of magnitude for a wide
range of applications. Firstly, it involves a novel implementation of a spherical-polar grid with
3D adaptive mesh refinement that operates in each of the 3 dimensions independently. This allows
us to circumvent the Courant condition near the polar singularity, which otherwise cripples high-res
computational performance. Secondly, we demonstrate that local adaptive time-stepping (LAT)
on a logarithmic spherical-polar grid accelerates computation by a factor of $\lesssim10$ compared
to traditional hierarchical time-stepping approaches. Jointly, these unique features lead to
an effective speed of $\sim10^9$ zone-cycles-per-second-per-node on 5,400 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (i.e.,
900 nodes of the OLCF Summit supercomputer). We demonstrate its computational performance by presenting
the first GRMHD simulation of a tilted thin accretion disk threaded by a toroidal magnetic field
around a rapidly spinning black hole. With an effective resolution of $13$,$440\times4$,$608\times8$,$092$
cells, and a total of $\lesssim22$ billion cells and $\sim0.65\times10^8$ timesteps, it is among
the largest astrophysical simulations ever performed. We find that frame-dragging by the black
hole tears up the disk into two independently precessing sub-disks. The innermost sub-disk rotation
axis intermittently aligns with the black hole spin, demonstrating for the first time that such
long-sought alignment is possible in the absence of large-scale poloidal magnetic fields.
