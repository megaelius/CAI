Even though the main nucleosynthetic products of type Ia supernovae belong to the iron-group, intermediate-mass
alpha-nuclei (silicon, sulfur, argon, and calcium) stand out in their spectra up to several weeks
past maximum brightness. Recent measurements of the abundances of calcium, argon, and sulfur in
type Ia supernova remnants have been interpreted in terms of metallicity-dependent oxygen burning,
in accordance with previous theoretical predictions. It is known that $\alpha$-rich oxygen burning
results from $^{16}$O$\rightarrow^{12}$C followed by efficient $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reaction,
as compared to oxygen consumption by $^{16}$O fusion reactions, but the precise mechanism of dependence
on the progenitor metallicity has remained unidentified so far. I show that the chain $^{16}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{13}$N($\gamma$,p)$^{12}$C
boosts $\alpha$-rich oxygen burning when the proton abundance is large, increasing the synthesis
of argon and calcium with respect to sulfur and silicon. For high-metallicity progenitors, the
presence of free neutrons leads to a drop in the proton abundance and the above chain is not efficient.
Although the rate of $^{16}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{13}$N can be found in astrophysical reaction rate
libraries, its uncertainty is unconstrained. Assuming that all reaction rates other than $^{16}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{13}$N
retain their standard values, an increase by a factor of approximately seven of the $^{16}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{13}$N
rate at temperatures in the order $3-5\times10^9$ K is enough to explain the whole range of calcium-to-sulfur
mass ratios measured in Milky Way and LMC supernova remnants. These same measurements provide a
lower limit to the $^{16}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{13}$N rate in the mentioned temperature range, on the
order of a factor of 0.5 with respect to the rate reported in widely used literature tabulations.
