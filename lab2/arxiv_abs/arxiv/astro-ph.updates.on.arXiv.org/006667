Stellar spin-orbit misalignments (obliquities) in hot Jupiter systems have been extensively
probed. Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter dynamical histories. Common explanations
for generating obliquities include high-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment.
This paper investigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments in
systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined companion. Spin-orbit misalignment
may be excited due to a secular resonance, occurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin
axis (driven by the inner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner planet
(driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via magnetic braking, this resonance
may be achieved during the star's main-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital
architectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual inclination between
the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high inclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar
spin axis is strongly coupled to the orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion
requires a strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin and orbital
axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for distant giant planet perturbers
(at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters have a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions
with appropriate properties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm Jupiter
systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool stars that have undergone significant
spin-down.
