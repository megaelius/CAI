Context. 55 Cnc e is a transiting super-Earth orbiting a Solar-like star with an orbital period around
17.7 hours. Using the MOST space telescope, Winn et al. (2011) detected a quasi-sinusoidal modulation
in flux with the same period as the planetary orbit. The amplitude of this modulation was too large
to be explained as the change in light reflected or emitted by the planet. Aims. MOST continued to
observe 55 Cnc e for a few weeks per year over 5 years, covering 143 individual transits. This paper
presents the analysis of the observed phase modulation throughout these observations, and a search
for the secondary eclipse of the planet. Methods. The most important source of systematic noise
in MOST data is due to straylight reflected from the Earth, which is modulated with both the orbital
period of the satellite and the Earth's rotation period. We present a new technique to deal with this
source of noise, which we combine with standard detrending procedures for MOST data. We then perform
MCMC analyses of the detrended light curves, modelling both the planetary transit and the phase
modulation. Results. We find phase modulations similar to those seen in 2011 in most of the subsequent
years; however, the amplitude and the phase of maximum light are seen to vary from year to year (from
113 to 28 ppm and from 0.1 to 3.8 rad). The secondary eclipse is not detected, but we constrain the planet's
geometric albedo to less than 0.47 (2$\sigma$). Conclusions. While we cannot uniquely identify
the origin of the observed optical modulation, we propose a few possible scenarios. Those include
star-planet interaction or the presence of a transiting circumstellar torus of dust. However,
a detailed interpretation of these observations is limited by their photometric precision. Additional
observations at optical wavelengths could contribute to uncovering the underlying physical processes.
