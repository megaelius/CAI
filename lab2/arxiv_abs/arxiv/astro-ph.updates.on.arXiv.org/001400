Disc-winds originating from the inner parts of accretion discs are considered as the basic component
of magnetically collimated outflows. The only available analytical MHD solutions to describe
disc-driven jets are those characterized by the symmetry of radial self-similarity. However,
radially self-similar MHD jet models, in general, have three geometrical shortcomings, (i) a singularity
at the jet axis, (ii) the necessary assumption of axisymmetry, and (iii) the non-existence of an
intrinsic radial scale, i.e. the jets formally extend to radial infinity. Hence, numerical simulations
are necessary to extend the analytical solutions towards the axis, by solving the full three-dimensional
equations of MHD and impose a termination radius at finite radial distance. We focus here on studying
the effects of relaxing the (ii) assumption of axisymmetry, i.e. of performing full 3D numerical
simulations of a disc-wind crossing all magnetohydrodynamic critical surfaces. We compare the
results of these runs with previous axisymmetric 2.5D simulations. The structure of the flow in
all simulations shows strong similarities. The 3D runs reach a steady state and stay close to axisymmetry
for most of the physical quantities, except for the poloidal magnetic field and the toroidal velocity
which slightly deviate from axisymmetry. The latter quantities show signs of instabilities, which,
however, are confined to the region inside the fast magnetosonic separatrix surface. The forces
present in the flow, both of collimating and accelerating nature, are in good agreement in both the
2.5D and the 3D runs. We conclude that the analytical solution behaves well also after relaxing the
basic assumption of axisymmetry.
