Recent observations of binary stars in the Galactic field show that the binary fraction and the mean
orbital separation both decrease as a function of decreasing primary mass. We present $N$-body
simulations of the effects of dynamical evolution in star-forming regions on primordial binary
stars to determine whether these observed trends can be explained by the dynamical processing of
a common binary population. We find that dynamical processing of a binary population with an initial
binary fraction of unity and an initial excess of intermediate/wide separation (100 - 10$^4$ au)
binaries does not reproduce the observed properties in the field, even in initially dense ($\sim
10^3$M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$) star-forming regions. If instead we adopt a field-like population
as the initial conditions, most brown dwarf and M-dwarf binaries are dynamically hard and their
overall fractions and separation distributions are unaffected by dynamical evolution. G-dwarf
and A-star binaries in the field are dynamically intermediate in our simulated dense regions and
dynamical processing does destroy some systems with separations $>$100 au. However, the formation
of wide binaries through the dissolution of supervirial regions is a strong function of primary
mass, and the wide G-dwarf and A-star binaries that are destroyed by dynamical evolution in subvirial
regions are replenished by the formation of binaries in supervirial regions. We therefore suggest
that the binary population in the field is $indicative$ of the primordial binary population in star-forming
regions, at least for systems with primary masses in the range 0.02 - 3.0M$_\odot$.
