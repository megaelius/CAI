LS 5039 is a well-known $\gamma$-ray binary system which consists of an unknown compact object and
a massive companion O star. It shows rather stable emissions at high energies over years and hence
serves as an ideal laboratory for investigating the emission mechanism for such peculiar systems
which emit prominent $\gamma$-rays. To this end, we take the orbital phase resolved energy spectrum
as observed by $Fermi$-LAT over 10 years. We divide the orbit into four orbital phases, each with
an orbital phase range of 0.25, centered at 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 respectively, where the phase
0.0 is the periastron and phase 0.5 is the apastron. The phases around 0.25 and 0.75 are symmetric
and hence are supposed to have identical local acceleration environment. The spectral analysis
shows that, the $Fermi$-LAT spectra are largely different from these two symmetric orbital phases:
the emission from orbital phase 0.25 turns out to be significantly stronger than that from 0.75.
This result does not fit a scenario that $\gamma$-rays are Doppler boosted emission from bow shock
tails if LS 5039 has a shock configuration similar to PSR B1259-63, and indicates that the inverse
Compton scatterings between the shock accelerated plasma and the stellar particle environment
is the underline procedure. Also we find that the previous report for a disappearance of the orbital
modulation at 3--20 GeV is due to the similar spectral turn-over energies of the different orbital
phases. The spectral properties of periastron and apastron regions are addressed in the context
of the measurements in phase regions around 0.25 and 0.75.
