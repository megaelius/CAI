Dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (LG) represent a distinct as well as diverse family of tracers of
the earliest phases of galaxy assembly and the processing resulting from galactic harassment.
Their stellar populations can be resolved and used as probes of the evolution of their host galaxy.
In this regard, we present the first reconstruction of the star formation history (SFH) of them using
the most evolved AGB stars that are long period variable (LPV). For the nearby, relatively massive
and interacting gas-rich dwarf galaxies, the Magellanic Clouds, we found that the bulk of the stars
formed ~ 10 Gyr ago for the LMC, while the strongest episode of star formation in the SMC occurred a
few Gyr later. A peak in star formation around 0.7 Gyr ago in both Clouds is likely linked to their recent
interaction. The Andromeda satellite pair NGC147/185 show different histories; the main epoch
of star formation for NGC 185 occurred 8.3 Gyr ago, followed by a much lower, but relatively constant
star formation rate (SFR). In the case of NGC 147, the SFR peaked only 6.9 Gyr ago, staying intense
until ~ 3 Gyr ago. Star formation in the isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxy IC 1613 has proceeded at a steady
rate over the past 5 Gyr, without any particular dominant epoch. Due to lack of sufficient data, we
have conducted an optical monitoring survey at the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) of 55 dwarf galaxies
in the LG to reconstruct the SFH of them uniformly. The observations are made over ten epochs, spaced
approximately three months apart, as the luminosity of LPV stars varies on timescales of months
to years. The system of galactic satellites of the large Andromeda spiral galaxy (M31) forms one
of the key targets of our monitoring survey. We present the first results in the And I dwarf galaxy,
where we discovered 116 LPVs among over 10,000 stars.
