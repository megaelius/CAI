Protoplanetary disks are dust-rich structures around young stars. The crystalline and amorphous
materials contained within these disks are variably thermally processed and accreted to make bodies
of a wide range of sizes and compositions, depending on the heliocentric distance of formation.
The chondritic meteorites are fragments of relatively small and undifferentiated bodies, and
the minerals that they contain carry chemical signatures providing information about the early
environment available for planetesimal formation. A current hot topic of debate is the delivery
of volatiles to terrestrial planets, understanding that they were built from planetesimals formed
under far more reducing conditions than the primordial carbonaceous chondritic bodies. In this
review, we describe significant evidence for the accretion of ices and hydrated minerals in the
outer protoplanetary disk. In that distant region highly porous and fragile carbon and water-rich
transitional asteroids formed, being the parent bodies of the carbonaceous chondrites (CCs).
CCs are undifferentiated meteorites that never melted but experienced other physical processes
including thermal and aqueous alteration. Recent evidence indicates that few of them have escaped
significant alteration, retaining unique features that can be interpreted as evidence of wet accretion.
Some examples of carbonaceous chondrite parent body aqueous alteration will be presented. Finally,
atomistic interpretations of the first steps leading to water-mediated alteration during the
accretion of CCs are provided and discussed. From these new insights into the water retained in CCs
we can decipher the pathways of delivery of volatiles to the terrestrial planets.
