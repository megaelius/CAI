We aim at investigating the formation process of weak bars by measuring their properties in a sample
of 29 nearby SAB galaxies, spanning a wide range of morphological types and luminosities. The sample
galaxies were selected to have an intermediate inclination, a bar at an intermediate angle between
the disc minor and major axes, and an undisturbed morphology and kinematics to allow the direct measurement
of the bar pattern speed. Combining our analysis with previous studies, we compared the properties
of weak and strong bars. We measured the bar radius and strength from the r-band images available
in SDSS and bar pattern speed and corotation radius from the stellar kinematics obtained by CALIFA.
We derived the bar rotation rate as the ratio between the corotation and bar radii. Thirteen out of
29 galaxies, which were morphologically classified as SABs from a visual inspection, do not actually
host a bar component or their central elongated component is not in rigid rotation. We successfully
derived the bar pattern speed in 16 objects. Two of them host an ultrafast bar. Using the bar strength
to differentiate weak and strong bars, we found that the SABs host shorter bars with smaller corotation
radii than their strongly barred counterparts. Weak and strong bars have similar bar pattern speeds
and rotation rates, which are all consistent with being fast. We did not observe any difference between
the bulge prominence in SAB and SB galaxies, whereas nearly all the weak bars reside in the disc inner
parts, contrary to strong bars. We ruled out that the bar weakening is only related to the bulge prominence
and that the formation of weak bars is triggered by the tidal interaction with a companion. Our observational
results suggest that weak bars may be evolved systems exchanging less angular momentum with other
galactic components than strong bars.
