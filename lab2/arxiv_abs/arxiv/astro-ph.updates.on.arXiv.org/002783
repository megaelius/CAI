As a copious source of gamma-rays, a nearby Galactic Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) can be a threat to life.
Using recent determinations of the rate of GRBs, their luminosity function and properties of their
host galaxies, we estimate the probability that a life-threatening (lethal) GRB would take place.
Amongst the different kinds of GRBs, long ones are most dangerous. There is a very good chance (but
no certainty) that at least one lethal GRB took place during the past 5 Gyr close enough to Earth as
to significantly damage life. There is a 50% chance that such a lethal GRB took place during the last
500 Myr causing one of the major mass extinction events. Assuming that a similar level of radiation
would be lethal to life on other exoplanets hosting life, we explore the potential effects of GRBs
to life elsewhere in the Galaxy and the Universe. We find that the probability of a lethal GRB is much
larger in the inner Milky Way (95% within a radius of 4 kpc from the galactic center), making it inhospitable
to life. Only at the outskirts of the Milky Way, at more than 10 kpc from the galactic center, this probability
drops below 50%. When considering the Universe as a whole, the safest environments for life (similar
to the one on Earth) are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies and life can
exist in only ~ 10% of galaxies. Remarkably, a cosmological constant is essential for such systems
to exist. Furthermore, because of both the higher GRB rate and galaxies being smaller, life as it
exists on Earth could not take place at $z > 0.5$. Early life forms must have been much more resilient
to radiation.
