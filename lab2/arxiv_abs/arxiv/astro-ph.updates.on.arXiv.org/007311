Context: The Initial Mass Function (IMF) plays a crucial role on galaxy evolution and its implications
on star formation theory make it a milestone for the next decade. It is in the intermediate and high
mass ranges where the uncertainties of the IMF are larger. This is a major subject of debate and analysis
both for Galactic and extragalactic science. Aims: Our goal is to constrain the IMF of the Galactic
thin disc population using both Galactic Classical Cepheids and Tycho-2 data. Methods: For the
first time the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model (BGM) has been used to characterise the Galactic population
of the Classical Cepheids. We have modified the age configuration in the youngest populations of
the BGM thin disc model to avoid artificial discontinuities in the age distribution of the simulated
Cepheids. Three statistical methods, optimized for different mass ranges, have been developed
and applied to search for the best IMF that fits the observations. This strategy allows us to quantify
variations in the Star Formation History (SFH), the stellar density at Sun position and the thin
disc radial scale length. A rigorous treatment of unresolved multiple stellar systems has been
undertaken adopting a spatial resolution according to the catalogues used. Results: For intermediate
masses, our study favours a composite field-star IMF slope of $\alpha=3.2$ for the local thin disc,
excluding flatter values such as the Salpeter IMF ($\alpha=2.35$). Moreover, a constant Star Formation
History is definitively excluded, the three statistical methods considered here show that it is
inconsistent with the observational data. Conclusions: Using field stars and Galactic Classical
Cepheids, we have found, above $1M_\odot$, an IMF steeper than the canonical stellar IMF of associations
and young clusters. This result is consistent with the predictions of the Integrated Galactic IMF.
