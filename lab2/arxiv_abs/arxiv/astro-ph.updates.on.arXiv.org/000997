(Abridged) Super Earth exoplanets are being discovered with increasing frequency and some will
be able to retain stable H2-dominated atmospheres. We study biosignature gases on exoplanets with
thin H2 atmospheres and habitable surface temperatures, by using a model atmosphere with photochemistry,
and biomass estimate framework for evaluating the plausibilty of a range of biosignature gas candidates.
We find that photochemically produced H atoms are the most abundant reactive species in H2 atmospheres.
In atmospheres with high CO2 levels, atomic O is the major destructive species for some molecules.
In sun-Earth-like UV radiation environments, H (and in some cases O) will rapidly destroy nearly
all biosignature gases of interest. The lower UV fluxes from UV quiet M stars would produce a lower
concentration of H (or O) for the same scenario, enabling some biosignature gases to accumulate.
The favorability of low-UV radiation environments to in an H2 atmosphere is closely analogous to
the case of oxidized atmospheres, where photochemically produced OH is the major destructive species.
Most potential biosignature gases, such as DMS and CH3Cl are therefore more favorable in low UV,
as compared to solar-like UV, environments. A few promising biosignature gas candidates, including
NH3 and N2O, are favorable even in solar-like UV environments, as these gases are destroyed directly
by photolysis and not by H (or O). A more subtle finding is that most gases produced by life that are
fully hydrogenated forms of an element, such as CH4, H2S, are not effective signs of life in an H2-rich
atmosphere, because the dominant atmospheric chemistry will generate such gases abiologically,
through photochemistry or geochemistry. Suitable biosignature gases in H2-rich atmospheres
for super Earth exoplanets transiting M stars could potentially be detected in transmission spectra
with the JWST.
