The near-Earth object (NEO) population is a window into the original conditions of the protosolar
nebula, and has the potential to provide a key pathway for the delivery of water and organics to the
early Earth. In addition to delivering the crucial ingredients for life, NEOs can pose a serious
hazard to humanity since they can impact the Earth. To properly quantify the impact risk, physical
properties of the NEO population need to be studied. Unfortunately, NEOs have a great variation
in terms of mitigation-relevant quantities (size, albedo, composition, etc.) and less than 15%
of them have been characterized to date. There is an urgent need to undertake a comprehensive characterization
of smaller NEOs (D<300m) given that there are many more of them than larger objects. One of the main
aims of the NEOShield-2 project (2015--2017), financed by the European Community in the framework
of the Horizon 2020 program, is therefore to retrieve physical properties of a wide number of NEOs
in order to design impact mitigation missions and assess the consequences of an impact on Earth.
We carried out visible photometry of NEOs, making use of the DOLORES instrument at the Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain) in order to derive visible color indexes and the taxonomic
classification for each target in our sample. We attributed for the first time the taxonomical complex
of 67 objects obtained during the first year of the project. While the majority of our sample belong
to the S-complex, carbonaceous C-complex NEOs deserve particular attention. These NEOs can be
located in orbits that are challenging from a mitigation point of view, with high inclination and
low minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID). In addition, the lack of carbonaceous material
we see in the small NEO population might not be due to an observational bias alone.
