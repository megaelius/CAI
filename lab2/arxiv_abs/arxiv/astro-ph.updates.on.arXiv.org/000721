The tidal disruption event by a supermassive black hole in Swift J1644+57 can trigger limit-cycle
oscillations between a supercritically accreting X-ray bright state and a subcritically accreting
X-ray dim state. Time evolution of the debris gas around a black hole with mass $M=10^{6} {\MO}$ is
studied by performing axisymmetric, two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We
assumed the $\alpha$-prescription of viscosity, in which the viscous stress is proportional to
the total pressure. The mass supply rate from the outer boundary is assumed to be ${\dot M}_{\rm supply}=100L_{\rm
Edd}/c^2$, where $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity, and $c$ is the light speed. Since the
mass accretion rate decreases inward by outflows driven by radiation pressure, the state transition
from a supercritically accreting slim disk state to a subcritically accreting Shakura-Sunyaev
disk starts from the inner disk and propagates outward in a timescale of a day. The sudden drop of the
X-ray flux observed in Swift J1644+57 in August 2012 can be explained by this transition. As long
as ${\dot M}_{\rm supply}$ exceeds the threshold for the existence of a radiation pressure dominant
disk, accumulation of the accreting gas in the subcritically accreting region triggers the transition
from a gas pressure dominant Shakura-Sunyaev disk to a slim disk. This transition takes place at
$t {\sim}~50/({\alpha}/0.1)$ days after the X-ray darkening. We expect that if $\alpha > 0.01$,
X-ray emission with luminosity $\gtrsim 10^{44}$ ${\rm erg}{\cdot}{\rm s}^{-1}$ and jet ejection
will revive in Swift J1644+57 in 2013--2014.
