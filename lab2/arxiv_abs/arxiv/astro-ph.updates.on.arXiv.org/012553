We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the unusual Type Ia supernova ASASSN-18tb,
including a series of SALT spectra obtained over the course of nearly six months and the first observations
of a supernova by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We confirm a previous observation
by Kollmeier et al. (2019) showing that ASASSN-18tb is the first relatively normal Type Ia supernova
to exhibit clear broad ($\sim1000$ km s$^{-1}$) H$\alpha$ emission in its nebular phase spectra.
We find that this event is best explained as a sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosion with $M_{Ni} \approx
0.3\; \rm{M}_\odot$. Despite the strong H$\alpha$ signature at late times, we find that the early
rise of the supernova shows no evidence for deviations from a single-component power-law and is
best fit with a moderately shallow power-law of index $1.69\pm0.04$. We find that the H$\alpha$
luminosity remains approximately constant after its initial detection at phase +37 d, and that
the H$\alpha$ velocity evolution does not trace that of the Fe~III$~\lambda4660$ emission. These
suggest that the H$\alpha$ emission arises from circumstellar medium (CSM) rather than swept up
material from a non-degenerate companion. However, ASASSN-18tb is strikingly different from
other known CSM-interacting Type Ia supernovae in a number of significant ways. Those objects typically
show an H$\alpha$ luminosity two orders of magnitude higher than what is seen in ASASSN-18tb, pushing
them away from the empirical light-curve relations that define "normal" Type Ia supernovae. Conversely,
ASASSN-18tb exhibits a fairly typical light curve and luminosity for an underluminous or transitional
SN Ia, with $M_R \approx -18.1$ mag. Moreover, ASASSN-18tb is the only SN Ia showing H$\alpha$ from
CSM interaction to be discovered in an early-type galaxy.
