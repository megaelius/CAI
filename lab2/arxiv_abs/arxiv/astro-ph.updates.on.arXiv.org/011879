We present the first spatially resolved scattered-light images of four debris disks around members
of the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB Association with high-contrast imaging and polarimetry
using the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). All four disks are resolved for the first time in polarized
light and one disk is also detected in total intensity. The three disks imaged around HD 111161, HD
143675, and HD 145560 are symmetric in both morphology and brightness distribution. The three systems
span a range of inclinations and radial extents. The disk imaged around HD 98363 shows indications
of asymmetries in morphology and brightness distribution, with some structural similarities
to the HD 106906 planet-disk system. Uniquely, HD 98363 has a wide co-moving stellar companion Wray
15-788 with a recently resolved disk with very different morphological properties. HD 98363 A/B
is the first binary debris disk system with two spatially resolved disks. All four targets have been
observed with ALMA, and their continuum fluxes range from one non-detection to one of the brightest
disks in the region. With the new results, a total of 15 A/F-stars in Sco-Cen have resolved scattered
light debris disks, and approximately half of these systems exhibit some form of asymmetry. Combining
the GPI disk structure results with information from the literature on millimeter fluxes and imaged
planets reveals a diversity of disk properties in this young population. Overall, the four newly
resolved disks contribute to the census of disk structures measured around A/F-stars at this important
stage in the development of planetary systems.
