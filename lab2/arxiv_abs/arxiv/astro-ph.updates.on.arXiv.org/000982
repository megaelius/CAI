The statistics of arcs in galaxy clusters is a powerful probe of the inner parts of cluster structure
and may provide complementary cosmological constraints. Although progresses involving simulations
at the image level have improved the agreement among modelling and observations of arc abundance,
there are still discrepancies regarding the redshift distribution of strong lensing clusters.
Besides, fast "semi-analytic" methods still have to incorporate the success obtained with simulations.
In this paper we discuss the contribution of magnification in gravitational arc statistics. Although
lensing conserves surface brightness, the magnification (\mu) increases the signal-to-noise
ratio of the arcs in the images, enhancing their detectability. We present an approach to include
this and other observational effects in semi-analytic calculations for arc statistics. The cross
section for arc formation (\sigma) is computed through a semi-analytic method based on the eigenvalue
ratio of the magnification tensor. Using this approach we obtained the scaling of \sigma\ with respect
to \mu\ and other parameters, allowing for a fast computation of the cross section. We apply this
method to evaluate the expected number of arcs per cluster (f_{arcs}) using an elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White
matter distribution. We show that the magnification has a strong effect on the arc abundance, dramatically
enhancing the fraction of arcs, moving the peak of the arc fraction to higher redshifts and softening
the decrease of f_{arcs} at high redshifts. These features could help in clarifying the remaining
discrepancies in arcs statistics. In any case, we argue that the effect of magnification should
be included in arc statistics modelling.
