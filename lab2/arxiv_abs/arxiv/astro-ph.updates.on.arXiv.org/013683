Fossil groups (FGs) have been discovered twenty-five years ago, and are now defined as galaxy groups
with an X-ray luminosity higher than $10^{42}\ h_{50}^{-2}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a brightest group
galaxy brighter than the other group members by at least 2 magnitudes. However, the scenario of their
formation remains controversial. We propose here a probabilistic analysis of FGs, extracted from
the large catalogue of candidate groups and clusters detected by Sarron et al. (2018) in the CFHTLS
survey, based on photometric redshifts, to investigate their position in the cosmic web and probe
their environment. Based on spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, we estimate the probability
of galaxies to belong to a galaxy structure, and by imposing the condition that the brightest group
galaxy is at least brighter than the others by 2 magnitudes, we compute the probability for a given
galaxy structure to be a FG. We analyse the mass distribution of these candidate FGs, and estimate
their distance to the filaments and nodes of the cosmic web in which they are embedded. We find that
the structures with masses lower than $2.4\times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ have the highest probabilities
of being fossil groups (PFG). Overall, structures with PFG$\geq$50% are located close to the cosmic
web filaments (87% are located at less than 1 Mpc from their nearest filament). They are preferentially
four times more distant from their nearest node than from their nearest filament. We confirm that
FGs have small masses and are rare. They seem to reside closeby cosmic filaments and do not survive
in nodes. Being in a poor environment could therefore be the driver of FG formation, the number of
nearby galaxies not being sufficient to compensate for the cannibalism of the central group galaxy.
