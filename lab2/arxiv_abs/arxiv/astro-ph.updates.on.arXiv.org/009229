We describe a multi-messenger interpretation of GW170817, which yields a robust lower limit on
NS radii. This excludes NSs with radii smaller than about 10.7 km and thus rules out very soft nuclear
matter. We stress the potential of this type of constraints when future detections become available.
A very similar argumentation may yield an upper bound on the maximum mass of nonrotating NSs. We also
discuss simulations of NS mergers, which undergo a first-order phase transition to quark matter.
We point out a different dynamical behavior. Considering the gravitational-wave signal, we identify
an unambiguous signature of the QCD phase transition in NS mergers. The occurrence of quark matter
through a strong first-order phase transition during merging leads to a characteristic shift of
the dominant postmerger frequency. The frequency shift is indicative for a phase transition if
it is compared to the postmerger frequency which is expected for purely hadronic EoS models. A very
strong deviation of several 100 Hz is observed for hybrid EoSs in an otherwise tight relation between
the tidal deformability and the postmerger frequency. We address the potential impact of a first-order
phase transition on the electromagnetic counterpart of NS mergers. Our simulations suggest that
there would be no significant qualitative differences between a system undergoing a phase transition
to quark matter and purely hadronic mergers. The quantitative differences are within the spread
which is found between different hadronic EoS models. This implies on the one hand that GW170817
is compatible with a possible transition to quark matter. On the other hand these considerations
show that it may not be easy to identify quantitative differences between purely hadronic mergers
and events in which quark matter occurs considering solely their electromagnetic counterpart
or their nucleosynthesis products. (abridged)
