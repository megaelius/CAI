Bright ring-like structure emission of the CN molecule has been observed in protoplanetary disks.
We investigate if such structures are due to the morphology of the disk itself or if they are instead
an intrinsic feature of CN emission. We also address to which physical and chemical parameters CN
is most sensitive, in order to use it as a diagnostic. Using the 2D thermochemical code DALI, a set
of disk models are run for different stellar spectra, masses and physical structures. An updated
chemical network that accounts for the most relevant CN reactions is adopted. Ring-shaped emission
is found to be a common feature of all models: the highest abundance is found in the upper outer regions
of the disk, and the column density peaks at 50-70 AU for T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates.
The emission profile follows the column density suggesting that optical depth and non-LTE effects
are minimal up to the N=3-2 transition. Higher mass disks generally show brighter CN. Higher UV fields,
such as appropriate for T Tauri stars with high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher
disk flaring, generally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main formation
paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H2* molecules, produced through FUV pumping
of H2. The model results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and with the observed
location of the CN ring in TW Hya. CN rings are produced naturally in protoplanetary disks and do not
require a specific underlying disk structure (dust cavity or gap). The strong link between FUV flux
and CN emission can provide information on the vertical structure of the disk and on the distribution
of dust grains affecting UV penetration, and could help to break some degeneracies in the SED fitting.
In contrast with C2H or c-C3H2, the CN flux is not very sensitive to carbon and oxygen depletion.
