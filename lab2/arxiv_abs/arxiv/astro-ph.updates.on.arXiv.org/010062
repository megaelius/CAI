The streaming instability for solid particles in protoplanetary disks is re-examined assuming
the familiar alpha ($\alpha$) model for isotropic turbulence. Turbulence always reduces the growth
rates of the streaming instability relative to values calculated for globally laminar disks. While
for small values of the turbulence parameter, $\alpha < 10^{-5}$, the wavelengths of the fastest-growing
disturbances are small fractions of the local gas vertical scale height $H$, we find that for moderate
values of the turbulence parameter, i.e., $\alpha \sim 10^{-5}-10^{-3}$, the lengthscales of
maximally growing disturbances shift toward larger scales, approaching $H$. At these moderate
turbulent intensities and for particle to gas mass density ratios $\epsilon < 0.5$, the vertical
scales of the most unstable modes begin to exceed the corresponding radial scales so that the instability
appears in the form of vertically oriented sheets. We find that for hydrodynamical turbulent instability
models reported in the literature, leading to $\alpha = 4\times 10^{-5} - {10^{-4}}$, the streaming
instability is present in principle for a narrow range of Stokes numbers, $\sim 0.01<\tau_s< 0.05$
($\tau_s$ is the ratio of the particle gas drag stopping time to the local orbit time). However, with
these levels of $\alpha$ and canonical solids-to-gas abundances, we find that the streaming instability
stalls and saturates as growing modes approach $\epsilon = 1$ from smaller values, resulting in
only modest particle overdensities of factors of 4-20 at best. Our results are consistent with,
and place in context, published numerical studies of streaming instabilities.
