The Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) suite of instruments operated
throughout the over two years of the Rosetta mission operations in the vicinity of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
It measured gas densities and composition throughout the comet's atmosphere, or coma. Here we present
two-years' worth of measurements of the relative densities of the four major volatile species in
the coma of the comet, H2O. CO2, CO and O2, by one of the ROSINA sub-systems called the Double Focusing
Mass Spectrometer (DFMS). The absolute total gas densities were provided by the Comet Pressure
Sensor (COPS), another ROSINA sub-system. DFMS is a very high mass resolution and high sensitivity
mass spectrometer able to resolve at a tiny fraction of an atomic mass unit. We have analyzed the combined
DFMS and COPS measurements using an inversion scheme based on spherical harmonics that solves for
the distribution of potential surface activity of each species as the comet rotates, changing solar
illumination, over short intervals and as the comet changes distance from the sun and orientation
of its spin axis over long time intervals. We also use the surface boundary conditions derived from
the inversion scheme to simulate the whole coma with our fully kinetic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo
model and calculate the production rates of the four major species throughout the mission. We compare
the derived production rates with revised remote sensing observations by the Visible and Infrared
Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) as well as with published observations from the Microwave
Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO). Finally we use the variation of the surface production
of the major species to calculate the total mass loss over the mission and, for different estimates
of the dust/gas ratio, calculate the variation of surface loss over the nucleus.
