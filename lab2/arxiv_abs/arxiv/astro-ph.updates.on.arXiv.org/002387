To exploit the full potential of Kepler light curves, sophisticated and robust analysis tools are
now required more than ever. Characterizing single stars with an unprecedented level of accuracy
and subsequently analyzing stellar populations in detail are fundamental to further constrain
stellar structure and evolutionary models. We developed a new code, termed Diamonds, for Bayesian
parameter estimation and model comparison by means of the nested sampling Monte Carlo (NSMC) algorithm,
an efficient and powerful method very suitable for high-dimensional and multi-modal problems.
A detailed description of the features implemented in the code is given with a focus on the novelties
and differences with respect to other existing methods based on NSMC. Diamonds is then tested on
the bright F8 V star KIC~9139163, a challenging target for peak-bagging analysis due to its large
number of oscillation peaks observed, which are coupled to the blending that occurs between $\ell=2,0$
peaks, and the strong stellar background signal. We further strain the performance of the approach
by adopting a 1147.5 days-long Kepler light curve. The Diamonds code is able to provide robust results
for the peak-bagging analysis of KIC~9139163. We test the detection of different astrophysical
backgrounds in the star and provide a criterion based on the Bayesian evidence for assessing the
peak significance of the detected oscillations in detail. We present results for 59 individual
oscillation frequencies, amplitudes and linewidths and provide a detailed comparison to the existing
values in the literature. Lastly, we successfully demonstrate an innovative approach to peak bagging
that exploits the capability of Diamonds to sample multi-modal distributions, which is of great
potential for possible future automatization of the analysis technique.
