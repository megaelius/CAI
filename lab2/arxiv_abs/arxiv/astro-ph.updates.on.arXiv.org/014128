We observed $\lambda$3mm \cotw, \coth, \coei, \hcop, HCN and CS emission from diffuse molecular
gas along sightlines with \EBV\ $\approx$ 0.1 - 1 mag. Directions were mostly chosen for their proximity
to sightlines toward background mm-wave continuum sources studied in \hcop\ absorption, at positions
where maps of \cotw\ at 1\arcmin\ resolution showed surprisingly bright integrated CO J=1-0 emission
\WCO\ = 5-12 K-\kms\ but we also observed in L121 near \zoph. Coherence emerges when data are considered
over a broad range of \cotw\ and \coth\ brightness. \WCO/\Wth\ and N(\cotw)/N(\coth) are 20-40
for \WCO\ $\la 5$ K-\kms\ and N(CO) $\la 5\times 10^{15}\pcc$, increasing with much scatter for
larger \WCO\ or N(CO). N(\coth)/N(\coei) $> 20-40$ ($3\sigma$) vs. an intrinsic ratio $^{13}$C/$^{18}$O
= 8.4, from a combination of selective photodissociation and enhancement of \coth. The observations
are understandable if \cotw\ forms from the thermal recombination of \hcop\ with electrons, after
which the observed \coth\ forms via endothermic carbon isotope exchange with $^{13}$C\p. \WCS/\WCO\
increases abruptly for \WCO\ $\ga 10$ K-\kms\ and \WCS/\Whcop\ is bimodal, showing two branches
having N(CS)/N(\hcop) $\approx 5$ and 1.25. Because CO formation and \hcop\ excitation both involve
collisions between \hcop\ and ambient electrons, comparison of the CO and \hcop\ emission shows
that the CO hotspots are small regions of enhanced N(CO) occupying only a small fraction of the column
density of the medium in which they are embedded. \hcop/CO and HCN/CO brightness ratios are 1-2\%
with obvious implications for determinations of the true dense gas fraction.
