We investigate the inner regions of the Milky Way with a sample of unprecedented size and coverage
thanks to APOGEE DR16 and {\it Gaia} DR2 data. Our inner Galactic sample has more than 24,000 stars
within $|X_{\rm Gal}| <5$ kpc, $|Y_{\rm Gal}| <3.5$ kpc, $|Z_{\rm Gal}| <1$ kpc, and we also make
the analysis for a foreground-cleaned sub-sample of 7,000 stars more representative of the bulge-bar
populations. The inner Galaxy shows a clear chemical discontinuity in key abundance ratios [$\alpha$/Fe],
[C/N], and [Mn/O], probing different enrichment timescales, which suggests a star formation gap
(quenching) between the high- and low-$\alpha$ populations. For the first time we are able to fully
characterize the different populations co-existing in the innermost regions of the Galaxy via
a joint analysis of the distributions of rotational velocities, metallicities, orbital parameters
and chemical abundances. The chemo-kinematic analysis reveal presence of the bar; of an inner thin
disk; of a thick disk, and of a broad metallicity population, with a large velocity dispersion, indicative
of a pressure supported component. We find and characterize chemically and kinematically a group
of counter-rotating stars, which could be the result of gas-rich merger event or just the result
of clumpy star formation during the earliest phases of the early disk, which migrated into the bulge.
Finally, based on the 6D information we assign stars a probability value of being on a bar orbit and
find that most of the stars with large bar orbit probabilities come from the innermost 3 kpc. Even
stars with high probability of belonging to the bar show the chemical bimodality in the [$\alpha$/Fe]
vs. [Fe/H] diagram. This suggests bar trapping to be an efficient mechanism, explaining why stars
on bar orbits do not show a significant distinct chemical abundance ratio signature.
