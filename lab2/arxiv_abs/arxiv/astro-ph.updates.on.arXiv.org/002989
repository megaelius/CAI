The baryon-acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest is one of the key probes
of the cosmic expansion rate at redshifts z~2.5, well before dark energy is believed to have become
dynamically significant. A key advantage of the BAO as a standard ruler is that it is a sharp feature
and hence is more robust against broadband systematic effects than other cosmological probes.
However, if the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest transmission is sensitive to the initial streaming velocity
of the baryons relative to the dark matter, then the BAO peak position can be shifted. Here we investigate
this sensitivity using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of small regions of the intergalactic
medium with a range of box sizes and physics assumptions; each simulation starts from initial conditions
at the kinematic decoupling era (z~1059), undergoes a discrete change from neutral gas to ionized
gas thermal evolution at reionization (z~8), and is finally processed into a Lyman-$\alpha$ forest
transmitted flux cube. Streaming velocities suppress small-scale structure, leading to less
violent relaxation after reionization. The changes in the gas distribution and temperature-density
relation at low redshift are more subtle, due to the convergent temperature evolution in the ionized
phase. The change in the BAO scale is estimated to be of the order of 0.12% at z=2.5; some of the major
uncertainties and avenues for future improvement are discussed. The predicted streaming velocity
shift would be a subdominant but not negligible effect (of order $0.26\sigma$) for the upcoming
DESI Lyman-$\alpha$ forest survey, and exceeds the cosmic variance floor. It is hoped that this
study will motivate additional theoretical work on the magnitude of the BAO shift, both in the Lyman-$\alpha$
forest and in other tracers of large-scale structure.
