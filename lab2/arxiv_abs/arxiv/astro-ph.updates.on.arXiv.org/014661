We thoroughly explore the properties of (sub)-millimeter (mm) selected galaxies (SMGs) in the
Shark semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. Compared to observations, the predicted number
counts at wavelengths (lambda) 0.6-2mm and redshift distributions at 0.1-2mm, agree well. At the
bright end (>1mJy), Shark galaxies are a mix of mergers and disk instabilities. These galaxies display
a stacked FUV-to-FIR spectrum that agrees well with observations. We predict that current optical/NIR
surveys are deep enough to detect bright (>1mJy) lambda=0.85-2mm-selected galaxies at z<5, but
too shallow to detect counterparts at higher redshift. A JWST 10,000s survey should detect all counterparts
for galaxies with $S_{\rm 0.85mm}>0.01$mJy. We predict SMG's disks contribute significantly
(negligibly) to the rest-frame UV (IR). We investigate the 0<z<6 evolution of the intrinsic properties
of >1mJy lambda=0.85-2mm-selected galaxies finding their: (i) stellar masses are $>10^{10.2}M_{\odot}$,
with the 2mm ones tracing the most massive galaxies in Shark ($>10^{11}M_{\odot}$); (ii) average
specific star formation rates (SFR) are mildly (~3-10x) above the main sequence (MS); (iii) host
halo masses are $>10^{12.3}M_{\odot}$, with the 2mm galaxies tracing the most massive halos (proto-clusters);
(iv) SMGs have lower dust masses ($\sim 10^{8}M_{\odot}$), higher dust temperatures (~40-45K)
and higher rest-frame V-band attenuation (>1.5) than MS galaxies; (v) sizes decrease with redshift,
from 4kpc at z=1 to 1kpc at z=4; (vi) the Carbon Monoxide spectral line energy distributions of $S_{\rm
0.85mm}>1$mJy sources peak at 4->3. Finally, we study the contribution of SMGs to the molecular
gas and cosmic SFR density (CSFRD) at 0<z<10, finding that >1mJy sources make a negligible contribution
at z>3 and z>5, respectively, suggesting current observations have unveiled the majority of the
star formation at 0<z<10.
