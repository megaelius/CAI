Using the sample of 348 stars from the PennState-Torun Centre for Astronomy Planet Search, for which
uniformly determined atmospheric parameters are available, with chemical abundances and rotational
velocities presented here, we investigate various channels of Li enrichment in giants. Our work
is based on the HET/HRS spectra. The A(Li) was determined from the 670.8nm line, while we use a more
extended set of lines for alpha-elements abundances. In a series of K-S tests, we compare Li-rich
giants with other stars in the sample. We also use available IR photometric and kinematical data
in search for evidence of mass-loss. We investigate properties of the most Li-abundant giants in
more detail by using multi-epoch precise radial velocities. We present Li and alpha-elements abundances,
as well as vsini for 348 stars. We detected Li in 92 stars, of which 82 are giants. 11 of them show significant
Li abundance A(Li)>1.4 and 7 of them are Li-overabundant objects, according to criterion of
A(Li)>1.5 and their location on HR diagram, including two giants with Li abundances close to
meteoritic level. For another 271 stars, upper limits of A(Li) are presented. We show that Li-rich
giants are among the most massive stars from our sample and show larger than average effective temperatures.
They are indistinguishable from the complete sample in terms of their distribution of luminosity,
[Fe/H], vsini, and alpha-elements abundances. Our results do not point out to one specific Li enrichment
mechanism operating in our sample of giants. On the contrary, in some cases, we cannot identify fingerprints
of any of known scenarios. We show, however, that the 4 most Li-rich giant in our sample either have
low-mass companions or have RV variations at the level of ~100 m/s, which strongly suggests that
the presence of companions is an important factor in the Li-enrichment processes in giants.
