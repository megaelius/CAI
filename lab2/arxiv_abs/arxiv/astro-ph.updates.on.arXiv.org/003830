AGN feedback is regarded as an important non-gravitational process in galaxy clusters, providing
useful constraints on large-scale structure formation. It modifies the structure and energetics
of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) and hence its understanding is crucially needed in order to use
clusters as high precision cosmological probes. In this context, particularly keeping in mind
the upcoming high quality radio data expected from radio surveys like SKA with its higher sensitivity,
high spatial and spectral resolutions, we review our current understanding of AGN feedback, its
cosmological implications and the impact that SKA can have in revolutionizing our understanding
of AGN feedback in large-scale structures. Recent developments regarding the AGN outbursts and
its possible contribution to excess entropy in the hot atmospheres of groups and clusters, its correlation
with the feedback energy in ICM, quenching of cooling flows and the possible connection between
cool core clusters and radio mini-halos, are discussed. We describe current major issues regarding
modeling of AGN feedback and its impact on the surrounding medium. With regard to the future of AGN
feedback studies, we examine the possible breakthroughs that can be expected from SKA observations.
In the context of cluster cosmology, for example, we point out the importance of SKA observations
for cluster mass calibration by noting that most of $z>1$ clusters discovered by eROSITA X-ray mission
can be expected to be followed up through a 1000 hour SKA-1 mid programme. Moreover, approximately
$1000$ radio mini halos and $\sim 2500$ radio halos at $z<0.6$ can be potentially detected by SKA1
and SKA2 and used as tracers of galaxy clusters and determination of cluster selection function.
