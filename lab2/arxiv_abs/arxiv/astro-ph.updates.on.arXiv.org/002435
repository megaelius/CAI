We present the X-ray and optical properties of the galaxy groups selected in the Chandra X-Bo\"otes
survey. Our final sample comprises 32 systems at \textbf{$z<1.75$}, with 14 below $z = 0.35$.
For these 14 systems we estimate velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{gr}$) and perform a virial analysis
to obtain the radii ($R_{200}$ and $R_{500}$) and total masses ($M_{200}$ and $M_{500}$) for groups
with at least five galaxy members. We use the Chandra X-ray observations to derive the X-ray luminosity
($L_X$). We examine the performance of the group properties $\sigma_{gr}$, $L_{opt}$ and $L_X$,
as proxies for the group mass. Understanding how well these observables measure the total mass is
important to estimate how precisely the cluster/group mass function is determined. Exploring
the scaling relations built with the X-Bo\"otes sample and comparing these with samples from the
literature, we find a break in the $L_X$-$M_{500}$ relation at approximately $M_{500} = 5\times10^{13}$
M$_\odot$ (for $M_{500} > 5\times10^{13}$ M$_\odot$, $M_{500} \propto L_X^{0.61\pm0.02}$,
while for $M_{500} \leq 5\times10^{13}$ M$_\odot$, $M_{500} \propto L_X^{0.44\pm0.05}$). Thus,
the mass-luminosity relation for galaxy groups cannot be described by the same power law as galaxy
clusters. A possible explanation for this break is the dynamical friction, tidal interactions
and projection effects which reduce the velocity dispersion values of the galaxy groups. By extending
the cluster luminosity function to the group regime, we predict the number of groups that new X-ray
surveys, particularly eROSITA, will detect. Based on our cluster/group luminosity function estimates,
eROSITA will identify $\sim$1800 groups ($L_X = 10^{41}-10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) within a distance
of 200 Mpc. Since groups lie in large scale filaments, this group sample will map the large scale structure
of the local universe.
