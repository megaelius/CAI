Thanks to the advances in modern instrumentation we have learned about many exoplanets that span
a wide range of masses and composition. Studying their atmospheres provides insight into planetary
origin, evolution, dynamics, and habitability. Present and future observing facilities will
address these important topics in great detail by using more precise observations, high-resolution
spectroscopy, and improved analysis methods. We investigate the feasibility of retrieving the
vertical temperature distribution and molecular number densities from expected exoplanet spectra
in the near-infrared. We use the test case of the CRIRES+, instrument at the Very Large Telescope
which will operate in the near-infrared between 1 and 5 micron and resolving powers of R=100000 and
R=50000. We also determine the optimal wavelength coverage and observational strategies for increasing
accuracy in the retrievals. We used the optimal estimation approach to retrieve the atmospheric
parameters from the simulated emission observations of the hot Jupiter HD~189733b. The radiative
transfer forward model is calculated using a public version of the tauREx software package. Our
simulations show that we can retrieve accurate temperature distribution in a very wide range of
atmospheric pressures between 1 bar and $10^{-6}$ bar depending on the chosen spectral region.
Retrieving molecular mixing ratios is very challenging, but a simultaneous observations in two
separate infrared regions around 1.6 micron and 2.3 micron helps to obtain accurate estimates;
the exoplanetary spectra must be of relatively high signal-to-noise ratio S/N>10, while the temperature
can already be derived accurately with the lowest value that we considered in this study (S/N=5).
