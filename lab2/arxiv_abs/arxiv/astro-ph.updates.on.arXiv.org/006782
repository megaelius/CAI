EBEX was a long-duration balloon-borne experiment to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave
background. The experiment had three frequency bands centered at 150, 250, and 410 GHz and was the
first to use a kilo-pixel array of transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers aboard a balloon platform;
shortly after reaching float we operated 504, 342, and 109 TESs at each of the bands, respectively.
We describe the design and characterization of the array and the readout system. We give the distributions
of measured thermal conductances, normal resistances, and transition temperatures. With the
exception of the thermal conductance at 150 GHz. We measured median low-loop-gain time constants
$\tau_{0}=$ 88, 46, and 57 ms and compare them to predictions. Two measurements of bolometer absorption
efficiency show high ($\sim$0.9) efficiency at 150 GHz and medium ($\sim$0.35, and $\sim$0.25)
at the two higher bands, respectively. We measure a median total optical load of 3.6, 5.3 and 5.0 pW
absorbed at the three bands, respectively. EBEX pioneered the use of the digital version of the frequency
domain multiplexing (FDM) system which multiplexed the bias and readout of 16 bolometers onto two
wires. We present accounting of the measured noise equivalent power. The median per-detector noise
equivalent temperatures referred to a black body with a temperature of 2.725 K are 400, 920, and 14500
$\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$ for the three bands, respectively. We compare these values to our pre-flight
predictions and to a previous balloon payload, discuss the sources of excess noise, and the path
for a future payload to make full use of the balloon environment.
