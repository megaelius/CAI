Stars with initial masses between $\sim0.8$ and 8~$M_\odot$ present copious mass loss during the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) at the end of their lives. The accepted mass-loss mechanism requires
radiation pressure acting on dust grains that form in the extended AGB stellar atmospheres. The
details of this process are not yet well understood, however. Using the extreme-adaptive-optics
imager and polarimeter SPHERE/ZIMPOL, we observed light polarised by grains around W\,Hya, SW\,Vir,
and R\,Crt, which have mass-loss rates between 10$^{-7}$ and 10$^{-6}~M_\odot~{\rm yr^{-1}}$.
We find the distribution of dust to be asymmetric around the three targets. A biconical morphology
is seen for R Crt, with a position angle that is very similar to those inferred from interferometric
observations of maser emission and of mid-infrared continuum emission. The cause of the biconical
outflow cannot be directly inferred from the ZIMPOL data. The dust grains polarise light more efficiently
at 0.65~$\mu$m for R\,Crt and SW\,Vir and at 0.82~$\mu$m for W\,Hya. This indicates that at the time
of the observations, the grains around SW\,Vir and R\,Crt had sizes $< 0.1~\mu$m, while those around
W\,Hya were larger, with sizes $\gtrsim 0.1~\mu$m. The asymmetric distribution of dust around
R\,Crt makes the interpretation more uncertain for this star, however. We find that polarised light
is produced already from within the visible photosphere of W~Hya, which we reproduce using models
with an inner dust shell that is optically thick to scattering. The radial profile of the polarised
light observed around W\,Hya reveal a steep dust density profile. We find the wind-acceleration
region of W\,Hya to extend to at least $\sim 7~R_\star$, in agreement with theoretical predictions
of acceleration up to $\sim 12~R_\star$.
