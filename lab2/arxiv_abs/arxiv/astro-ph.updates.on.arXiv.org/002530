The scalar averaging approach to cosmology interprets dark energy as the growth of average, void-dominated,
negative spatial curvature during the virialisation epoch, leaving the metric a priori unspecified,
while models with a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric assume comoving spatial
rigidity of metrical properties. The former predicts that voids are hyperbolic and that superclusters
occupy positively curved space, and that a best-fit metric should be close to the void case modelled
as a constant-curvature metric on a given time slice. Thus, comoving separations near superclusters
should be compressed in comparison to the homogeneous case. We demonstrate this by measuring the
two-point auto-correlation function on comoving scales in order to detect shifts in the baryonic
acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak location for Large Red Galaxy (LRG) pairs of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Data Release 7. In tangential directions, subsets of pairs overlapping with superclusters
or voids show the BAO peak. The tangential BAO peak location for overlap with Nadathur & Hotchkiss
superclusters is 4.3\pm1.6 Mpc/h less than that for LRG pairs unselected for supercluster overlap,
and 6.6\pm2.8 Mpc/h less than that of the complementary pairs. Liivamagi et al. superclusters give
corresponding differences of 3.7\pm2.9 Mpc/h and 6.3\pm2.6 Mpc/h, respectively. We have found
moderately significant evidence (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests suggest very significant evidence)
that the BAO peak location for supercluster-overlapping pairs is compressed by about 6% compared
to that of the complementary sample, providing a potential challenge to FLRW models and a benchmark
for predictions from backreaction models.
