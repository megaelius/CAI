Supernova LSQ13abf was discovered soon after explosion by the La Silla-QUEST Survey and followed
by the CSP II at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Our analysis indicates LSQ13abf was discovered
within two days of explosion and its first 10 days of evolution reveal a B-band light curve with an
abrupt drop in luminosity. Contemporaneously, the V-band light curve exhibits a rise towards a
first peak and the r- and i-band light curves show no early peak. The early light-curve evolution
of LSQ13abf is reminiscent of the post explosion cooling phase observed in the Type Ib SN 2008D, and
the similarity between the two objects extends over weeks. Spectroscopically, LSQ13abf resembles
SN 2008D with P Cygni He I features that strengthen over time. Spectral energy distributions are
constructed from broad-band photometry, and by fitting black-body (BB) functions a UVOIR light
curve is constructed, and the underlying BB-temperature and BB-radius profiles are estimated.
Explosion parameters are estimated by simultaneously fitting an Arnett model to the UVOIR light
curve and the velocity evolution derived from spectral features, and a post-shock breakout cooling
model to the first two epochs of the bolometric evolution. This combined model suggests an explosion
energy of 1.3x10$^{51}$ ergs, a relatively high ejecta mass of 5.94 M$_{\odot}$, a Ni mass of 0.16
M$_{\odot}$, and a progenitor-star radius of 28.0 R$_{\odot}$. The ejecta mass suggests the origins
of LSQ13abf lie with a >25 M$_{\odot}$ ZAMS progenitor and its radius is three and nine times larger
than values estimated from the same analysis applied to observations of SNe 2008D and 1999ex, respectively.
Alternatively, comparison of hydrodynamical simulations of >20-25 M$_{\odot}$ ZAMS progenitors
that evolve to pre-SN envelope masses around 10 M$_{\odot}$ and extended (~100 R$_{\odot}$) envelopes
also match the observations of LSQ13abf.
