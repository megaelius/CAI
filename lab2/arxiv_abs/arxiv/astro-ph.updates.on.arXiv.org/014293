High-precision planetary densities are key to derive robust atmospheric properties for extrasolar
planets. Measuring precise masses is the most challenging part, especially in multi-planetary
systems. We measure the masses and densities of a four-planet near resonant chain system (K2-32),
and a young ($\sim400$ Myr old) planetary system consisting of three close-in small planets (K2-233).
We obtained 199 new HARPS observations for K2-32 and 124 for K2-233 covering a more than three year
baseline. We find that K2-32 is a compact scaled-down version of the Solar System's architecture,
with a small rocky inner planet (M$_e=2.1^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$~M$_{\oplus}$, P$_e\sim4.35$~days)
followed by an inflated Neptune-mass planet (M$_b=15.0^{+1.8}_{-1.7}$~M$_{\oplus}$, P$_b\sim8.99$~days)
and two external sub-Neptunes (M$_c=8.1\pm2.4$~M$_{\oplus}$, P$_c\sim20.66$~days; M$_d=6.7\pm2.5$~M$_{\oplus}$,
P$_d\sim31.72$~days). K2-32 becomes one of the few multi-planetary systems with four or more planets
known with measured masses and radii. Additionally, we constrain the masses of the three planets
in K2-233. For the two inner Earth-size planets we constrain their masses to be smaller than M$_b<11.3$
M$_{\oplus}$ (P$_b\sim2.47$~days), M$_c<12.8$ M$_{\oplus}$ (P$_c\sim7.06$~days). The outer
planet is a sub-Neptune size planet with an inferred mass of M$_d=8.3^{+5.2}_{-4.7}$ M$_{\oplus}$
(M$_d<21.1$ M$_{\oplus}$, P$_d\sim24.36$~days). Our observations of these two planetary systems
confirm for the first time the rocky nature of two planets orbiting a young star, with relatively
short orbital periods ($<7$ days). They provide key information for planet formation and evolution
models of telluric planets. Additionally, the Neptune-like derived masses of the three planets
K2-32 b, c, d puts them in a relatively unexplored regime of incident flux and planet mass, key for
transmission spectroscopy studies.
