Using a suite of isolated $L_\star$ galaxy simulations, we show that global depletion times and
star-forming gas mass fractions in simulated galaxies exhibit systematic and well-defined trends
as a function of the local star formation efficiency per freefall time, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, strength
of stellar feedback, and star formation threshold. We demonstrate that these trends can be reproduced
and explained by a simple physical model of global star formation in galaxies. Our model is based
on mass conservation and the idea of gas cycling between star-forming and non-star-forming states
on certain characteristic time scales under the influence of dynamical and feedback processes.
Both the simulation results and our model predictions exhibit two limiting regimes with rather
different dependencies of global galactic properties on the local parameters. When $\epsilon_{\rm
ff}$ is small and feedback is inefficient, the total star-forming mass fraction, $f_{\rm sf}$,
is independent of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ and the global depletion time, $\tau_{\rm dep}$, scales
inversely with $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$. When $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ is large or feedback is very efficient,
these trends are reversed: $f_{\rm sf} \propto \epsilon_{\rm ff}^{-1}$ and $\tau_{\rm dep}$ is
independent of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ but scales linearly with the feedback strength. We also compare
our results with the observed depletion times and mass fractions of star-forming and molecular
gas and show that they provide complementary constraints on $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ and the feedback
strength. We show that useful constraints on $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ can also be obtained using measurements
of the depletion time and its scatter on different spatial scales.
