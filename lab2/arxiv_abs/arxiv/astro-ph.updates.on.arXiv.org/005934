Using a sample of nearly half a million galaxies, intersected by over 8 million lines of sight from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12, we extend our previous study of the recombination radiation
emitted by the gaseous halos of nearby galaxies. We identify an inflection in the radial profile
of the H$\alpha$+N[{\small II}] radial emission profile at a projected radius of $\sim 50$ kpc and
suggest that beyond this radius the emission from ionized gas in spatially correlated halos dominates
the profile. We confirm that this is a viable hypothesis using results from a highly simplified theoretical
treatment in which the dark matter halo distribution from cosmological simulations is straightforwardly
populated with gas. Whether we fit the fraction of halo gas in a cooler (T $= 12,000$ K), smooth ($c
= 1$) component (0.26 for galaxies with M$_* = 10^{10.88}$ M$_\odot$ and 0.34 for those with M$_*
= 10^{10.18}$ M$_\odot$) or take independent values of this fraction from published hydrodynamical
simulations (0.19 and 0.38, respectively), this model successfully reproduces the radial location
and amplitude of the observed inflection. We also observe that the physical nature of the gaseous
halo connects to primary galaxy morphology beyond any relationship to the galaxy's stellar mass
and star formation rate. We explore whether the model reproduces behavior related to the central
galaxy's stellar mass, star formation rate, and morphology. We find that it is unsuccessful in reproducing
the observations at this level of detail and discuss various shortcomings of our simple model that
may be responsible.
