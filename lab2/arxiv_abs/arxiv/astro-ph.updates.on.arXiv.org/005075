The super-Neptune exoplanet WASP-107b is an exciting target for atmosphere characterization.
It has an unusually large atmospheric scale height and a small, bright host star, raising the possibility
of precise constraints on its current nature and formation history. We report the first atmospheric
study of WASP-107b, a Hubble Space Telescope measurement of its near-infrared transmission spectrum.
We determined the planet's composition with two techniques: atmospheric retrieval based on the
transmission spectrum and interior structure modeling based on the observed mass and radius. The
interior structure models set a $3\,\sigma$ upper limit on the atmospheric metallicity of $30\times$
solar. The transmission spectrum shows strong evidence for water absorption ($6.5\,\sigma$ confidence),
and the retrieved water abundance is consistent with expectations for a solar abundance pattern.
The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio is subsolar at $2.7\,\sigma$ confidence, which we attribute
to possible methane depletion in the atmosphere. The spectral features are smaller than predicted
for a cloud-free composition, crossing less than one scale height. A thick condensate layer at high
altitudes (0.1 - 3 mbar) is needed to match the observations. We find that physically motivated cloud
models with moderate sedimentation efficiency ($f_\mathrm{sed} = 0.3$) or hazes with a particle
size of 0.3 $\mu$m reproduce the observed spectral feature amplitude. Taken together, these findings
serve as an illustration of the diversity and complexity of exoplanet atmospheres. The community
can look forward to more such results with the high precision and wide spectral coverage afforded
by future observing facilities.
