Gravitational wave (GW) detections of binary black holes (BBHs) from the first two observing runs
of advanced LIGO and Virgo have shown evidence for a maximum component black hole mass of $\lesssim50
M_\odot$. This is consistent with expectations of a gap in the mass spectrum of black holes due to
the existence of pair-instability supernovae (PISN). This upper mass gap is expected to exist in
the range $\sim50M_\odot$-$120M_\odot$, beyond which a population of intermediate mass black
holes (IMBHs) may arise. We argue that ground-based GW detectors are expected to be sensitive to
BBHs with masses above the mass gap. In the absence of detections, two years at upgraded sensitivity
(A+) would constrain the local merger rate of these "far side of the PISN gap" black holes to be lower
than $0.01\,\text{yr}^{-1}\text{Gpc}^{-3}$. Alternatively, with a few tens of events it may
be possible to constrain the minimum IMBH mass to the percent level, if the edge of the distribution
is sufficiently sharp. These far side BBHs would also be observed by future third generation detectors
such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) as well as space-based GW interferometers such as LISA, and may
dominate the fraction of multi-band events. We show that by comparing the number of detections observed
from ground and space it is possible to constrain the merger rate history. Moreover, we find that
the location of the high end of the PISN mass gap leaves an imprint on the spectral shape of the stochastic
background of unresolved binaries, and that this may be accessible with A+ sensitivity. Finally,
we show that by exploiting the upper edge of the gap, these high-mass BBHs can be used as GW standard
sirens to constrain the cosmic expansion at redshifts of $\sim0.4$, $0.8$, and $1.5$ with LISA,
LIGO, and ET, respectively. These far-side black holes would be the most massive black holes LIGO
could detect.
