We carried out photometric and spectroscopic observations of the well-studied broad-line radio
galaxy 3C 120 with the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) global robotic telescope network from 2016
December to 2018 April as part of the LCO AGN Key Project on Reverberation Mapping of Accretion Flows.
Here, we present both spectroscopic and photometric reverberation mapping results. We used the
interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) to perform multiple-line lag measurements in
3C 120. We find the H$\gamma$, He II $\lambda 4686$, H$\beta$ and He I $\lambda 5876$ lags of $\tau_{\text{cen}}
= 18.8_{-1.0}^{+1.3}$, $2.7_{-0.8}^{+0.7}$, $21.2_{-1.0}^{+1.6}$, and $16.9_{-1.1}^{+0.9}$
days respectively, relative to the V-band continuum. Using the measured lag and rms velocity width
of the H$\beta$ emission line, we determine the mass of the black hole for 3C 120 to be $M=\left(6.3^{+0.5}_{-0.3}\right)\times10^7\,(f/5.5)$
M$_\odot$. Our black hole mass measurement is consistent with similar previous studies on 3C 120,
but with small uncertainties. In addition, velocity-resolved lags in 3C 120 show a symmetric pattern
across the H$\beta$ line, 25 days at line centre decreasing to 17 days in the line wings at $\pm4000$
km s$^{-1}$. We also investigate the inter-band continuum lags in 3C 120 and find that they are generally
consistent with $\tau\propto\lambda^{4/3}$ as predicted from a geometrically-thin, optically-thick
accretion disc. From the continuum lags, we measure the best fit value $\tau_{\rm 0} = 3.5\pm 0.2$
days at $\lambda_{\rm 0} = 5477$A. It implies a disc size a factor of $1.6$ times larger than prediction
from the standard disc model with $L/L_{\rm Edd} = 0.4$. This is consistent with previous studies
in which larger than expected disc sizes were measured.
