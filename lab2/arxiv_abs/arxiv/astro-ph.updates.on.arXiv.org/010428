Rapidly decaying slow magnetoacoustic waves are regularly observed in the solar coronal structures,
offering a promising tool for a seismological diagnostics of the coronal plasma, including its
thermodynamical properties. The effect of damping of standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations
in the solar coronal loops is investigated accounting for the field-aligned thermal conductivity
and a wave-induced misbalance between radiative cooling and some unspecified heating rates. The
non-adiabatic terms were allowed to be arbitrarily large, corresponding to the observed values.
The thermal conductivity was taken in its classical form, and a power-law dependence of the heating
function on the density and temperature was assumed. The analysis was conducted in the linear regime
and in the infinite magnetic field approximation. The wave dynamics is found to be highly sensitive
to the characteristic time scales of the thermal misbalance. Depending on certain values of the
misbalance time scales three regimes of the wave evolution were identified, namely the regime of
a suppressed damping, enhanced damping where the damping rate drops down to the observational values,
and acoustic over-stability. The specific regime is determined by the dependences of the radiative
cooling and heating functions on thermodynamical parameters of the plasma in the vicinity of the
perturbed thermal equilibrium. The comparison of the observed and theoretically derived decay
times and oscillation periods allows us to constrain the coronal heating function. For typical
coronal parameters, the observed properties of standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations could
be readily reproduced with a reasonable choice of the heating function.
