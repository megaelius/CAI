We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ibn (SN 2006jc-like)
supernova iPTF13beo. Detected by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory on 2013 May 19.39,
~3 hours after the estimated explosion time, iPTF13beo is the youngest and the most distant (430
Mpc) Type Ibn event ever observed. Type Ibn events are rare, and their early evolution, both photometric
and spectroscopic, has not been studied yet. The iPTF13beo light curve is consistent with light
curves of other Type Ibn SNe and with light curves of fast Type Ic events, but with a slightly faster
rise-time of two days. In addition, the iPTF13beo light curve exhibits a double-peak structure
separated by 9 days, not observed before in any Type Ibn SN. Low-resolution spectra were obtained
during the two peaks of the iPTF13beo light curve. The spectrum taken during the rising stage (2.4
days after the estimated explosion time) is featureless and similar to early spectra of SNe Ic-BL.
The spectrum obtained during the declining stage (15.0 days after the estimated explosion time)
is slightly bluer and exhibits some narrow and intermediate-width He I and Si II features with FWHM
= 2000-5000 km/sec. The late spectrum is remarkably similar to that of the prototypical SN Ibn 2006jc.
We suggest that our observations support a model of a massive star exploding in a dense He-rich circumstellar
medium (CSM). The primary peak is presumably powered by the SN shock breakout in dense CSM, while
during the second peak we observe the light produced by the regular SN radioactive decay slightly
modifi?ed by the interaction of the SN ejecta with the dense CSM. In the context of a shock breakout
in a CSM model, assuming a wind velocity of 3000 km/sec, we estimate a mass loss rate of ~0.002 M_sun/yr,
that lasted for about a year prior to the explosion.
