The cloud-scale physics of star formation and feedback represent the main uncertainty in galaxy
formation studies. Progress is hampered by the limited empirical constraints outside the restricted
environment of the Local Group. In particular, the poorly-quantified time evolution of the molecular
cloud lifecycle, star formation, and feedback obstructs robust predictions on the scales smaller
than the disc scale height that are resolved in modern galaxy formation simulations. We present
a new statistical method to derive the evolutionary timeline of molecular clouds and star-forming
regions. By quantifying the excess or deficit of the gas-to-stellar flux ratio around peaks of gas
or star formation tracer emission, we directly measure the relative rarity of these peaks, which
allows us to derive their lifetimes. We present a step-by-step, quantitative description of the
method and demonstrate its practical application. The method's accuracy is tested in nearly 300
experiments using simulated galaxy maps, showing that it is capable of constraining the molecular
cloud lifetime and feedback time-scale to $<0.1$ dex precision. Access to the evolutionary timeline
provides a variety of additional physical quantities, such as the cloud-scale star formation efficiency,
the feedback outflow velocity, the mass loading factor, and the feedback energy or momentum coupling
efficiencies to the ambient medium. We show that the results are robust for a wide variety of gas and
star formation tracers, spatial resolutions, galaxy inclinations, and galaxy sizes. Finally,
we demonstrate that our method can be applied out to high redshift ($z\lesssim4$) with a feasible
time investment on current large-scale observatories. This is a major shift from previous studies
that constrained the physics of star formation and feedback in the immediate vicinity of the Sun.
