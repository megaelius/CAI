Context. In the near- to mid-infrared wavelength domain, bright continuum sources in the central
parsec of the Galactic center (GC) are subject to foreground absorption. These sources therefore
represent ideal probes of the intervening material that is responsible for the absorption along
the line of sight. Aims. Our aim is to shed light on the location and physics of the absorbing clouds.
We try to find out which of the gaseous absorbing materials is intimately associated with the GC and
which one is associated with clouds at a much larger distance. Methods. We used the capabilities
of CRIRES spectrograph located at ESO Very Large Telescope in Chile to obtain absorption spectra
of individual lines at a high spectral resolution of R=65000, that is, 5 km/s. We observed the 12CO
R(0), P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), P(5), P(6), P(7) and P(9) transition lines, applied standard data
reduction, and compared the results with literature data. Results. We present the results of CRIRES
observations of 13 infrared sources located in the central parsec of the Galaxy. The data provide
direct evidence for a complex structure of the interstellar medium along the line of sight and in
the close environment of the central sources. In particular we find four cold foreground clouds
at radial velocities vLS R of the order of -145,-85, -60, and -40+-15 km/s that show absorption in
the lower transition lines from R(0) to P(2) and in all the observed spectra.We also find in all sources
an absorption in velocity range of 50-60 km/s, possibly associated with the so-called 50 km/s cloud
and suggesting an extension of this cloud in front of the GC. Finally, we detect individual absorption
lines that are probably associated with material much closer to the center and with the sources themselves,
suggesting the presence of cold gas in the local region.
