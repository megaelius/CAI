Out of the $\sim$ 3000 exoplanets detected so far, only fourteen planets are members of open clusters:
among them an exoplanet system around Pr 0211 in the cluster M44 which consists of at least two planets
with the outer planet moving on a highly eccentric orbit at 5.5 AU. One hypothesis is that a close fly-by
of a neighbouring star was responsible for the eccentric orbit. We test this hypothesis. First we
determine the type of fly-by that would lead to the observed parameters and then use this result to
determine the history of such fly-bys in simulations of the early dynamics in an M44-like environment.
We find that although very close fly-bys are required to obtain the observed properties of Pr 0211c,
such fly-bys are relatively common due to the high stellar density and longevity of the cluster.
Such close fly-bys are most frequent during the first 1-2 Myr after cluster formation, corresponding
to a cluster age $\leq$ 3 Myr. During the first 2 to 3 Myr about 6.5% of stars actually experience a fly-by
that would lead to such a small system-size as observed for Pr0211 or even smaller. It is unclear whether
planets generally form on such short timescales. However, afterwards the close fly-by rate is still
0.2-0.5 Myr$^{-1}$, which means extrapolating this to the age of M44 12%-20% of stars would experience
such close fly-bys over this timespan. Our simulations show that the fly-by scenario is a realistic
option for the formation of eccentricity orbits of the planets in M44. The occurrence of such events
is relatively high leading to the expectation that similar systems are likely common in open clusters
in general.
