Motivated by the recent discovery of rare Enormous Lyman-Alpha Nebulae (ELAN) around z~2 quasars,
we have initiated a long-term observational campaign with the MUSE instrument to directly uncover
the astrophysics of the gas around quasars. We present here the first 61 targets of our effort under
the acronym QSO MUSEUM (Quasar Snapshot Observations with MUse: Search for Extended Ultraviolet
eMission). These quasars have a median redshfit of z=3.17, absolute $i$ magnitude in the range $-29.67\leq
M_i(z=2)\leq-27.03$, and different levels of radio-loudness. This sample unveils diverse specimens
of Ly$\alpha$ nebulosities extending for tens of kiloparsecs around these quasars (on average
out to a maximum projected distance of 80 kpc) above a surface brightness SB$>8.8\times10^{-19}$
erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ ($2\sigma$). The bulk of the extended Ly$\alpha$ emission
is within R<50 kpc, and is characterized by relatively quiescent kinematics, with average velocity
dispersions of $\langle \sigma_{\rm Ly\alpha}\rangle < 400$~km~s$^{-1}$. Therefore, the motions
within all these Ly$\alpha$ nebulosities have amplitudes consistent with gravitational motions
expected in dark matter halos hosting quasars at these redshifts, possibly reflecting the complexity
in propagating a fast wind on large scales. Our current data suggest a combination of photoionization
and resonant scattering as powering mechanisms of the Ly$\alpha$ emission. We discover the first
$z\sim3$ ELAN, which confirms a very low probability ($\sim1\%$) of occurrence of such extreme
systems at these cosmic epochs. Finally, we discuss the redshift evolution currently seen in extended
Ly$\alpha$ emission around radio-quiet quasars from $z\sim3$ to $z\sim2$, concluding that it
is possibly linked to a decrease of cool gas mass within the quasars' CGM from $z\sim3$ to $z\sim2$,
and thus to the balance of cool vs hot media.
