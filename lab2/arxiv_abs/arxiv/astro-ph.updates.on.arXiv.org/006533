Most super AGB stars are expected to end their life as oxygen-neon white dwarfs rather than electron
capture supernovae (ECSN). The reason is ascribed to the ability of the second dredge-up to significantly
reduce the mass of the He core and of the efficient AGB winds[...]. In this study, we investigate the
formation of ECSN through case A and case B mass transfer. In these scenarios, when Roche lobe overflow
stops, the primary has become a helium star. With a small envelope left, the second dredge-up is prevented,
potentially opening new paths to ECSN. We compute binary models using our stellar evolution code
BINSTAR. We consider three different secondary masses of 8, 9, and 10 $M_\odot$ and explore the parameter
space, varying the companion mass, orbital period, and input physics. Assuming conservative mass
transfer, with our choice of secondary masses all case A systems enter contact either during the
main sequence or as a consequence of reversed mass transfer when the secondary overtakes its companion
during core helium burning. Case B systems are able to produce ECSN progenitors in a relatively small
range of periods ($3\le P(d)\le 30$) and primary masses ($10.9\le M/M_\odot\le 11.5$). Changing
the companion mass has little impact on the primary's fate as long as the mass ratio $M_1/M_2$ remains
less than 1.4-1.5, above which evolution to contact becomes unavoidable. We also find that allowing
for systemic mass loss substantially increases the period interval over which ECSN can occur. This
change in the binary physics does not however affect the primary mass range. We finally stress that
the formation of ECSN progenitors through case A and B mass transfer is very sensitive to adopted
binary and stellar physics. Close binaries provide additional channels for ECSN but the parameter
space is rather constrained likely making ECSN a rare event.
