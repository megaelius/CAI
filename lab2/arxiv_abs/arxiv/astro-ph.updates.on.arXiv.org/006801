It has recently become apparent that a large component of the nearby Galactic halo may be formed from
a single massive accretion event. Here, we study APOGEE DR14 element abundances and $\textit{Gaia}$
DR2 kinematics of stars associated with the accreted stellar halo. We show that the nearby halo has
many stars with high orbital eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.8$), whose abundances differ from that
of their low $e$ counterparts. High $e$ stars exhibit abundance patterns typical of massive Milky
Way dwarf galaxy satellites today, characterised by low [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe]. The [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H]
trend of high $e$ stars shows a change of slope at [Fe/H]$\sim-1.3$, also characteristic of chemical
evolution in relatively massive dwarf galaxies. Low $e$ stars do not show a significant break in
the same [Fe/H] range, and exhibit slightly higher abundances of Mg, Al and Ni. Other kinematical
properties of the high and low $e$ stars also differ, with the former exhibiting slightly retrograde
motion, higher vertical excursions, and larger apocentre radii. We use the EAGLE suite of cosmological
simulations to show that the high $e$ population likely results from the accretion of a satellite
with $10^{8}\lesssim M_*\lesssim 10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, at $z\lesssim1.5$. The simulations
further suggest that accretion events like this are a rare occurrence in the evolutionary history
of Milky Way-like galaxies. In addition, we examine how eccentricity changes over time in accreted
stellar debris, finding that median $e$ is largely unchanged since merger time. The exact nature
of the low $e$ population is unclear, but we hypothesise that it is likely a combination of $\textit{in
situ}$ star formation, high $|z|$ disc stars, lower mass accretion events, and contamination by
the low $e$ tail of the high $e$ population.
