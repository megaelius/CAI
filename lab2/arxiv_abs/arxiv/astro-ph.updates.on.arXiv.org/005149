The Streaming Instability (SI) is a mechanism to concentrate dust aerodynamically in protoplanetary
disks. Simulations have shown that nonlinear particle clumping from the SI can trigger gravitational
collapse into planetesimals. To better understand the numerical robustness of the SI, we perform
a suite of vertically-stratified 3D simulations with fixed physical parameters known to produce
strong clumping. We test the effect of numerical parameters by varying the computational domain
size and the vertical boundary conditions (vBCs), comparing a new implementation of outflow vBCs
to the previously-used periodic and reflecting vBCs. We find the main effect of the SI - strongly
nonlinear particle clumping - is mostly independent of the vBCs. However, the SI concentrates solids
to higher peak densities in larger simulation domains due to a larger particle mass reservoir. We
report that the SI triggers azimuthally-banded radial variations of gas pressure, known as zonal
flows. They are never strong enough to halt particle radial drift in our simulations, confirming
that particle trapping in gas pressure maxima is not the mechanism of the SI. We find that the outflow
vBCs produce artificially large gas outflow rates at vertical boundaries. However, the outflow
vBCs significantly reduce artificial reflections at vertical boundaries, thereby allowing particles
to sediment into a thinner and less corrugated midplane layer, which converges better with box size.
The radial spacing of dense particle filaments is ~0.15 of a gas scale height (H) for all vBCs, which
sets the feeding zone for planetesimal growth in self-gravitating simulations. Our results thus
validate the use of the outflow vBCs in SI simulations, despite the close proximity (<= 0.4H) of vertical
boundaries to the disk midplane. Overall, our study demonstrates the numerical robustness of nonlinear
particle clumping by the SI.
