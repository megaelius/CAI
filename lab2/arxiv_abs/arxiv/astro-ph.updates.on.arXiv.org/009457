The high rate of star formation and supernova explosions of starburst galaxies make them interesting
sources of high energy radiation. Depending upon the level of turbulence present in their interstellar
medium, the bulk of cosmic rays produced inside starburst galaxies may lose most of their energy
before escaping, thereby making these sources behave as calorimeters, at least up to some maximum
energy. Contrary to previous studies, here we investigate in detail the conditions under which
cosmic ray confinement may be effective for electrons and nuclei and we study the implications of
cosmic ray confinement in terms of multifrequency emission from starburst nuclei and production
of high energy neutrinos. The general predictions are then specialized to three cases of active
starbursts, namely M82, NGC253 and Arp220. Both primary and secondary electrons, as well as electron-positron
pairs produced by gamma ray absorption inside starburst galaxies are taken into account. Electrons
and positrons produced as secondary products of hadronic interactions are found to be responsible
for most of the emission of leptonic origin. In particular, synchrotron emission of very high energy
secondary electrons produces an extended emission of hard X-rays that represent a very interesting
signature of hadronic process in starburst galaxies, potentially accessible to current and future
observations in the X-ray band. A careful understanding of both the production and absorption of
gamma rays in starburst galaxies is instrumental to the assessment of the role of these astrophysical
sources as sources of high energy astrophysical neutrinos.
