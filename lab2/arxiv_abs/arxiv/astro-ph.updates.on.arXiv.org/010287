Exploiting the sample of 30 local star-forming, undisturbed late-type galaxies in different environments
drawn from the GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE (GASP), we investigate the spatially
resolved Star Formation Rate-Mass ({\Sigma}SFR-{\Sigma}_star) relation. Our analysis includes
also the galaxy outskirts (up to >4 effective radii, re), a regime poorly explored by other Integral
Field Spectrograph surveys. Our observational strategy allows us to detect H{\alpha} out to more
than 2.7re for 75% of the sample. Considering all galaxies together, the correlation between the
{\Sigma}SFR and {\Sigma}_star is quite broad, with a scatter of 0.3 dex. It gets steeper and shifts
to higher {\Sigma}_star values when external spaxels are excluded and moving from less to more massive
galaxies. The broadness of the overall relation suggests galaxy-by-galaxy variations. Indeed,
each object is characterized by a distinct {\Sigma}SFR-{\Sigma}_star relation and in some cases
the correlation is very loose. The scatter of the relation mainly arises from the existence of bright
off-center star-forming knots whose {\Sigma}SFR-{\Sigma}_star relation is systematically
broader than that of the diffuse component. The {\Sigma}SFR-{\Sigma}tot gas (total gas surface
density) relation is as broad as the {\Sigma}SFR-{\Sigma}_star relation, indicating that the
surface gas density is not a primary driver of the relation. Even though a large galaxy-by-galaxy
variation exists, mean {\Sigma}SFR and {\Sigma}_star values vary of at most 0.7 dex across galaxies.
We investigate the relationship between the local and global SFR-M_star relation, finding that
the latter is driven by the existence of the size-mass relation.
