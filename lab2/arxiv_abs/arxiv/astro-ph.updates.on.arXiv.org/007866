We report timing results for PSR J2234+0611, a 3.6-ms pulsar in a 32-day, eccentric (e = 0.13) orbit
with a helium white dwarf companion discovered as part of the Arecibo Observatory 327 MHz drift scan
survey. The precise timing and the eccentric nature of the orbit allow precise measurements of an
unusual number of parameters: a) a precise proper motion of 27.10(3) mas/yr and a parallax of 1.05(4)
mas resulting in a pulsar distance of 0.95(4) kpc; this allows a precise estimate of the transverse
velocity, 123(5) km/s. Together with previously published spectroscopic measurements of the
systemic radial velocity, this allows a full 3-D determination of the system's velocity; b) precise
measurements of the rate of advance of periastron, which after subtraction of the contribution
of the proper motion yields a total system mass of $1.6518^{+0.0033}_{-0.0035}$ solar masses;
c) a Shapiro delay measurement, h_3 = $82 \pm 14$ ns despite the orbital inclination not being near
90 deg; combined with the measurement of the total mass, this yields a pulsar mass of $1.353^{+0.014}_{-0.017}$
solar masses and a companion mass of $0.298^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$ solar masses; d) we measure precisely
the secular variation of the projected semi-major axis and detect significant annual orbital parallax;
together these allow a determination of the full 3-D orbital geometry, including an unambiguous
orbital inclination (i = $138.7^{+2.5}_{-2.2}$ deg) and a position angle for the line of nodes (Omega
= $44^{+5}_{-4}$ deg). We discuss the component masses to investigate hypotheses previously advanced
to explain the origin of eccentric MSPs. The unprecedented determination of the full 3-D position,
motion and orbital orientation of the system, plus the precisely measured pulsar and WD mass and
the latter's optical detection make this system an unique test of our understanding of white dwarfs
and their atmospheres.
