We present results from the KMOS lensing survey-KLENS which is exploiting gravitational lensing
to study the kinematics of 24 star forming galaxies at $1.4<z<3.5$ with a median mass of $\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot)=9.6$
and median star formation rate (SFR) of $\rm 7.5\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$. We find that 25% of these low-mass/low-SFR
galaxies are rotation dominated, while the majority of our sample shows no velocity gradient. When
combining our data with other surveys, we find that the fraction of rotation dominated galaxies
increases with the stellar mass, and decreases for galaxies with a positive offset from the main
sequence. We also investigate the evolution of the intrinsic velocity dispersion, $\sigma_0$,
as a function of the redshift, $z$, and stellar mass, $\rm M_\star$, assuming galaxies in quasi-equilibrium
(Toomre Q parameter equal to 1). From the $z-\sigma_0$ relation, we find that the redshift evolution
of the velocity dispersion is mostly expected for massive galaxies ($\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot)>10$).
We derive a $\rm M_\star-\sigma_0$ relation, using the Tully-Fisher relation, which highlights
that a different evolution of the velocity dispersion is expected depending on the stellar mass,
with lower velocity dispersions for lower masses, and an increase for higher masses, stronger at
higher redshift. The observed velocity dispersions from this work and from comparison samples
spanning $0<z<3.5$ appear to follow this relation, except at higher redshift ($z>2$), where we
observe higher velocity dispersions for low masses ($\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim 9.6$) and
lower velocity dispersions for high masses ($\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim 10.9$) than expected.
This discrepancy could, for instance, suggest that galaxies at high-$z$ do not satisfy the stability
criterion, or that the adopted parametrisation of the specific star formation rate and molecular
properties fail at high redshift.
