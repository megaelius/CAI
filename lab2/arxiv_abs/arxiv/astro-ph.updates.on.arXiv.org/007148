We explore the effects of incorporating redshift uncertainty into measurements of galaxy clustering
and cross-correlations of galaxy positions and CMB lensing maps. We use a simple Gaussian model
for a redshift distribution in a redshift bin with two parameters, the mean, $z_0$, and the width,
$\sigma_{\text{z}}$. We vary these parameters, as well as the galaxy bias, $b_{\text{g}}(z)$,
and cosmological parameters $\sigma_8(z)$ and $\Omega_{\text{m}}$ in a Fisher analysis across
12 redshift bins from $z=0-7$. We find that incorporating redshift uncertainties degrades constraints
on cosmological parameters in the LSST/CMB-S4 era by about a factor of 10 compared to the case of perfect
redshift knowledge. In our fiducial analysis of LSST/CMB-S4 including redshift uncertainties,
we project constraints on $\sigma_8(z)$ for $z<3$ of less than $5 \%$. Galaxy imaging surveys are
expected to have priors on redshift parameters from photometric redshift algorithms and other
methods. When adding priors with the expected precision for LSST redshift algorithms, the constraints
on $\sigma_8(z)$ can be improved by a factor of 2-3 compared to the case of no priors. We also find that
`self-calibrated' constraints on the redshift parameters from just the auto-correlation and
cross-correlation measurements (with no priors) are competitive with photometric redshift techniques.
In the LSST/CMB-S4 era, we find uncertainty on the redshift parameters ($z_0,\sigma_{\text{z}}$)
to be below 0.004(1+z) at $z<1$. For all parameters, constraints improve significantly if smaller
scales can be used. We also project constraints for nearer term survey combinations: DES/SPT-SZ,
DES/SPT-3G and LSST/SPT-3G.
