Chromospheric activity cycles are common in late-type stars; however, only a handful of coronal
activity cycles have been discovered. \ihor\ is the most active and youngest star with known coronal
cycles. It is also a young solar analog, and we are likely facing the earliest cycles in the evolution
of solar-like stars, at an age (~600 Myr) when life appeared on Earth. Our aim is to confirm the ~1.6
yr coronal cycle and characterize its stability over time. We use X-ray observations of iota Hor
to study the corona of a star representing the solar past through variability, thermal structure,
and coronal abundances. We analyzed multi-wavelength observations of iota Hor using XMM-Newton,
TESS, and HST data. We monitored iota Hor throughout almost seven years in X-rays and in two UV bands.
The summed RGS and STIS spectra were used for a detailed thermal structure model, and the determination
of coronal abundances. We studied rotation and flares in the TESS light curve. We find a stable coronal
cycle along four complete periods, more than covered in the Sun. There is no evidence for a second
longer X-ray cycle. Coronal abundances are consistent with photospheric values, discarding any
effects related to the first ionization potential. From the TESS light curve we derived the first
photometric measurement of the rotation period (8.2 d). No flares were detected in the TESS light
curve of iota Hor. We estimate the probability of having detected zero flares with TESS to be ~2%.
We corroborate the presence of an activity cycle of ~1.6 yr in iota Hor in X-rays, more regular than
its Ca II H&K counterpart. A decoupling of the activity between the northern and southern hemispheres
of the star might explain the disagreement. The inclination of the system would result in an irregular
behavior in the chromospheric indicators. The more extended coronal material would be less sensitive
to this effect.
