Non-Gaussianities of dynamical origin are disentangled from primordial ones using the formalism
of large deviation statistics with spherical collapse dynamics. This is achieved by relying on
accurate analytical predictions for the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) and
the two-point clustering of spherically-averaged cosmic densities (sphere bias). Sphere bias
extends the idea of halo bias to intermediate density environments and voids as underdense regions.
In the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity, sphere bias displays a strong scale dependence
relevant for both high and low density regions, which is predicted analytically. The statistics
of densities in spheres are built to model primordial non-Gaussianity via an initial skewness with
a scale-dependence that depends on the bispectrum of the underlying model. The analytical formulas
with the measured nonlinear dark matter variance as input are successfully tested against numerical
simulations. For local non-Gaussianity with a range from $f_{\rm NL}=-100$ to $+100$ they are found
to agree within 2\% or better for densities $\rho\in[0.5,3]$ in spheres of radius 15 Mpc$/h$ down
to $z=0.35$. The validity of the large deviation statistics formalism is thereby established for
all observationally relevant local-type departures from perfectly Gaussian initial conditions.
The corresponding estimators for the amplitude of the nonlinear variance $\sigma_8$ and primordial
skewness $f_{\rm NL}$ are validated using a fiducial joint maximum likelihood experiment. The
influence of observational effects and the prospects for a future detection of primordial non-Gaussianity
from joint one- and two-point densities-in-spheres statistics are discussed.
