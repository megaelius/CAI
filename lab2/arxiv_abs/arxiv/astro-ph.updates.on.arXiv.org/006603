M dwarf stars are exciting targets for exoplanet investigations; however, their fundamental stellar
properties are difficult to measure. Perhaps the most challenging property to measure is stellar
age. Once on the main sequence, M dwarfs change imperceptibly in their temperature and luminosity,
necessitating novel statistical techniques for estimating their ages. In this paper, we infer
ages for known eccentric-planet-hosting M dwarfs using a combination of kinematics and $\alpha$-element-enrichment,
both shown to correlate with age for Sun-like FGK stars. We calibrate our method on FGK stars in a Bayesian
context. To measure $\alpha$-enrichment, we use publicly-available spectra from the CARMENES
exoplanet survey and a recently developed [Ti/Fe] calibration utilizing individual Ti I and Fe
I absorption lines in $Y$ band. Tidal effects are expected to circularize the orbits of short-period
planets on short timescales; however, we find a number of mildly eccentric, close-in planets orbiting
old ($\sim$8 Gyr) stars. For these systems, we use our ages to constrain the tidal dissipation parameter
of the planets, $Q_\mathrm{p}$. For two mini-Neptune planets, GJ 176b and GJ 536b, we find they have
$Q_\mathrm{p}$ values more similar to the ice giants than the terrestrial planets in our Solar System.
For GJ 436b, we estimate an age of $8.9^{+2.3}_{-2.1}$ Gyr and constrain the $Q_\mathrm{p}$ to be
$>10^5$, in good agreement with constraints from its inferred tidal heating. We find that GJ 876d
has likely undergone significant orbital evolution over its $8.4^{+2.2}_{-2.0}$ Gyr lifetime,
potentially influenced by its three outer companions which orbit in a Laplace resonance.
