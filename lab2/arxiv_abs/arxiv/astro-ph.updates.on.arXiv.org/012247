We test the two-corona accretion scenario for active galactic nuclei in the case of the `bare' Seyfert
1 galaxy HE 1143-1810. We perform a detailed study of the broad-band UV--X-ray spectral properties
and of the short-term variability. We present results of a joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR monitoring
of the source, consisting of 5x20 ks observations, each separated by 2 days, performed in December
2017. The source is variable in flux among the different observations, and a correlation is observed
between the UV and X-ray emission. Moderate spectral variability is observed in the soft band. The
time-averaged X-ray spectrum exhibits a cut-off at $\sim 100$ keV consistent with thermal Comptonization.
We detect an iron K$\alpha$ line consistent with being constant during the campaign and originating
from a mildly ionized medium. The line is accompanied by a moderate, ionized reflection component.
A soft excess is clearly present below 2 keV and is well described by thermal Comptonization in a `warm'
corona with a temperature of $\sim 0.5$ keV and a Thomson optical depth of $\sim 17-18$. For the hot
hard X-ray emitting corona, we obtain a temperature of $\sim 20$ keV and an optical depth of $\sim
4$ assuming a spherical geometry. A fit assuming a jet-emitting disc (JED) for the hot corona also
provides a nice description of the broad-band spectrum. In this case, the data are consistent with
an accretion rate varying between $\sim 0.7$ and $\sim 0.9$ in Eddington units and a transition between
the outer standard disc and the inner JED at $\sim 20$ gravitational radii. The broad-band high-energy
data agree with an accretion flow model consisting of two phases: an outer standard accretion disc
with a warm upper layer, responsible for the optical--UV emission and the soft X-ray excess, and
an inner slim JED playing the role of a hard X-ray emitting hot corona.
