We study some aspects of cosmological evolution in a universe described by a viable curvature corrected
exponential $F(R)$ gravity model, in the presence of matter fluids consisting of collisional matter
and radiation. Particularly, we express the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker equations of motion
in terms of parameters that are appropriate for describing the dark energy oscillations and compare
the dark energy density and the dark energy equation of state parameter corresponding to collisional
and non-collisional matter. In addition to these, and owing to the fact that the cosmological evolution
of collisional and non-collisional matter universes, when quantified in terms of the Hubble parameter
and the effective equation of states parameters, is very much alike, we further scrutinize the cosmological
evolution study by extending the analysis to the study of matter perturbations in the matter domination
era. We quantify this analysis in terms of the growth factor of matter perturbations, in which case
the resulting picture of the cosmological evolution is clear, since collisional and non-collisional
universes can be clearly distinguished. Interestingly enough, since it is known that the oscillations
of the effective equation of state parameter around the phantom divide are undesirable and unwanted
in $F(R)$ gravities, when these are considered for redshifts near the matter domination era and
before, in the curvature corrected exponential model with collisional matter which we study here
there exist oscillations that never cross the phantom divide. Therefore, this rather unwanted
feature of the effective equation of state parameter is also absent in the collisional matter filled
universe.
