The progressive drying-out of Mars' surface was punctuated by a dramatic transient increase in
fluvial erosion around the Noachian-Hesperian boundary ($\sim$3.7 Ga). Standard explanations
of this climate optimum appeal to volcano- or impact-triggered climates and imply that individual
runoff episodes were brief, apparently inconsistent with evidence for persistent runoff. We examine
a scenario in which the duration, intensity and uniqueness of the Noachian-Hesperian climate optimum
result from degassing of CH$_4$-clathrate consequent to atmospheric collapse. Atmospheric collapse
causes low-latitude surface water ice to sublimate away, depressurizing and thus destabilizing
CH$_4$ clathrate in subglacial pore space. Subsequent atmospheric re-inflation leads to warming
that further destabilizes CH$_4$ clathrate. CH$_4$-induced warming is efficient, permitting
strong positive feedbacks, and possibly raising Mars into a climate optimum. The optimum is brought
to a close by photochemical destruction of CH$_4$ or by a new atmospheric collapse, and drawdown
of the CH$_4$-clathrate reservoir prevents recurrence. This scenario predicts a 10$^5$-10$^6$
yr climate optimum, transient connections between the deep hydrosphere and the surface, mud volcanism,
and strong surface weathering, all of which are consistent with recent observations. Crustal hydrothermal
circulation very early in Mars history could yield CH$_4$ that would be incorporated into clathrate
on approach to the cold surface. The scenario explains why regional watershed integration on Mars
occurred relatively late and apparently only once, and suggests that the contrasts between Noachian
versus Hesperian climate-sensitive deposits on Mars correspond to a transition from a never-collapsed
atmosphere to a collapse-prone climate, ultimately driven by slow loss of CO$_2$ to space.
