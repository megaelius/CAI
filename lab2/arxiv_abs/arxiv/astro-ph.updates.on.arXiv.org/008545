Context. The Sun is an active star and the source of the largest explosions in the solar system, such
as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Flares and CMEs are powerful particle accelerators
that can generate radio emission through various emission mechanisms. Aims. CMEs are often accompanied
by Type IV radio bursts that are observed as continuum emission in dynamic spectra at decimetric
and metric wavelengths, but their emission mechanism can vary from event to event. Here, we aim to
determine the emission mechanism of a complex Type IV burst that accompanied the flare and CME on
22 September 2011. Methods. We used radio imaging from the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph, spectroscopic
data from the e-Callisto network, ARTEMIS, Ondrejov, and Phoenix3 spectrometers combined with
extreme-ultraviolet observations from NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory to analyse the Type IV
radio burst and determine its emission mechanism. Results. We show that the emission mechanism
of the Type IV radio burst changes over time. We identified two components in the Type IV radio burst:
an earlier stationary Type IV showing gyro-synchrotron behaviour, and a later moving Type IV burst
covering the same frequency band. This second component has a coherent emission mechanism. Fundamental
plasma emission and the electroncyclotron maser emission are further investigated as possible
emission mechanisms for the generation of the moving Type IV burst. Conclusions. Type IV bursts
are therefore complex radio bursts, where multiple emission mechanisms can contribute to the generation
of the wide-band continuum observed in dynamic spectra. Imaging spectroscopy over a wide frequency
band is necessary to determine the emission mechanisms of Type IV bursts that are observed in dynamic
spectra.
