We present the 850 $\mu$m polarization observations toward the IC5146 filamentary cloud taken
using the SCUBA-2 POL-2, mounted on the JCMT, as part of the B-fields In STar forming Regions Observations
(BISTRO). This work is aimed at revealing the magnetic field morphology within a core-scale ($\lesssim
0.5$ pc) Hub-Filament Structure (HFS) located at the end of a parsec-scale filament which is perpendicular
to the large-scale magnetic field. To investigate whether or not the observed polarization traces
the magnetic field in the HFS, we analyze the dependence between the observed polarization fraction
and total intensity using a Bayesian approach with the polarization fraction described by the Rice
likelihood function, which can correctly describe the probability density function (PDF) of the
observed polarization fraction. We find that the observed polarization fraction shows a power-law
dependence on total intensity with an index of 0.56 in $A_V\sim$ 20--300 mag regions, suggesting
that the dust grains in these dense regions can still be aligned with magnetic fields in the IC5146
regions. Our polarization maps reveal organized but curved magnetic fields, which are different
from the nearly uniform large-scale magnetic fields. The curved magnetic fields seem to be dragged
along the parsec-scale filament, likely resulting from contraction along its major axis. We further
show that the clumps within the core-scale HFS are oriented either parallel or perpendicular to
the local magnetic fields. In addition, we obtain a magnetic field strength of 0.5$\pm$0.2 mG and
a mass-to-flux criticality of $1.3\pm0.4$ toward the central hub using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi
method. We estimate an Alfv\'{e}nic Mach number of $<$0.6 using the magnetic field angular dispersion.
These results suggest that gravity and magnetic fields are currently of comparable importance
in the HFS.
