Globular clusters in the Milky Way are thought to have either an {\it in situ} origin, or to have been
deposited in the Galaxy by past accretion events, like the spectacular Sagittarius dwarf galaxy
merger. We aim to probe the origin of the recently discovered globular cluster FSR 1758, often associated
with some past merger event, and which happens to be projected toward the Galactic bulge, by a detailed
study of its Galactic orbit, and to assign it to the most suitable Galactic component. We employ three
different analytical time-independent potential models to calculate the orbit of the cluster
by using the Gauss Radau spacings integration method. In addition, a time-dependent bar potential
model is added to account for the influence of the Galactic bar. We run a large suite of simulations
to account for the uncertainties in the initial conditions, in a Montecarlo fashion. We confirm
previous indications that the globular cluster FSR 1758 possesses a retrograde orbits with high
eccentricity. The comparative analysis of the orbital parameters of star clusters in the Milky
Way, in tandem with recent metallicity estimates, allows us to conclude that FSR1758 is indeed a
Galactic bulge intruder. The cluster can therefore be considered an old metal poor halo globular
cluster formed {\it in situ} and which is passing right now in the bulge region. Its properties, however,
can be roughly accounted for also assuming that the cluster is part of some stream of extra-Galactic
origin. We conclude that assessing the origin, either Galactic or extra-galactic, of globular
clusters is surely a tantalising task. In any case, by using an {\it Occam's razor} argument, we tend
to prefer an {\it in situ} origin for FSR 1758.
