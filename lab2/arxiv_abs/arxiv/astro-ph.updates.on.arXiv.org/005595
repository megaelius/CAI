We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial
velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter
than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample
of minor planets in the solar system. A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied
by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations
which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2
results. Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately
1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition
available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5
million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in
the form of the apparent brightness in the $G_\mathrm{BP}$ (330--680 nm) and $G_\mathrm{RP}$ (630--1050
nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources
are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective
temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of
14000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally,
Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical,
the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources.
There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to
Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.
