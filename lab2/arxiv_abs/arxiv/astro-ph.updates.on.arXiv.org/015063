Current solar wind prediction is based on the Wang & Sheeley empirical relationship between the
solar wind speed observed at 1 AU and the rate of magnetic flux tube expansion (FTE) between the photosphere
and the inner corona, where FTE is computed by coronal models that take the photospheric flux density
synoptic maps as their inner boundary conditions to extrapolate the photospheric magnetic fields
to deduce the coronal and the heliospheric magnetic field configuration. Since these synoptic
maps are among the most widely-used of all solar magnetic data products, the uncertainties in the
model predictions that are caused by the uncertainties in the synoptic maps are worthy of study.
However, such an estimate related to synoptic map construction was not available until Bertello
et al. (Solar Physics, 289, 2014) obtained the spatial standard deviation synoptic maps; 98 Monte-Carlo
realizations of the spatial standard deviation maps for each photospheric synoptic maps. In this
paper, we present an estimate of uncertainties in the solar wind speed predicted at 1 AU by the CSSS
model due to the uncertainties in the photospheric synoptic maps. We also present a comparison of
the coronal hole locations predicted by the models with the STEREO/SECCHI EUV synoptic maps. In
order to quantify the extent of the uncertainties involved, we compared the predicted speeds with
the OMNI solar wind data during the same period (taking the solar wind transit time into account)
and obtained the root mean square error between them. To illustrate the significance of the uncertainty
estimate in the solar wind prediction, we carried out the analysis for three Carrington rotations,
CR 2102, CR 2137 and CR 2160 at different phases of the solar cycle. The uncertainty estimate is critical
information necessary for the current and future efforts of improving the solar wind prediction
accuracies.
