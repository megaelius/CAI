We develop a new model for X-ray emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs), applying stationary
general relativistic ``slim disk'' accretion solutions to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and
then ray-tracing the photon trajectories from the image plane to the disk surface, including gravitational
redshift, Doppler, and lensing effects self-consistently. We simultaneously and successfully
fit the multi-epoch XMM-Newton X-ray spectra for two TDEs: ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-15oi. We test
explanations for the observed, unexpectedly slow X-ray brightening of ASASSN-15oi, including
delayed disk formation and variable obscuration by a reprocessing layer. We propose a new mechanism
that better fits the data: a ``Slimming Disk'' scenario in which accretion onto an edge-on disk slows,
reducing the disk height and exposing more X-rays from the inner disk to the sightline over time.For
ASASSN-15oi, we constrain the SMBH mass to $4.0^{+2.5}_{-3.1} \times 10^6M_\odot$. For ASASSN-14li,
the SMBH mass is $10^{+1}_{-7}\times 10^6M_\odot$ and the spin is $>0.3$. For both TDEs, our fitted
masses are consistent with independent estimates; for ASASSN-14li, application of the external
mass constraint narrows our spin constraint to $>0.85$. The mass accretion rate of ASASSN-14li
decays slowly, as $\propto t^{-1.1}$, perhaps due to inefficient debris circularization. Over
$\approx$1100 days, its SMBH has accreted $\Delta M \approx 0.17 M_\odot$, implying a progenitor
star mass of $> 0.34 M_\odot$, i.e., no ``missing energy problem.'' For both TDEs, the hydrogen column
density declines to the host galaxy plus Milky Way value after a few hundred days, suggesting a characteristic
timescale for the depletion or removal of obscuring gas.
