Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) instrument of India's Chandrayaan-2 lunar mission carries out broadband
spectroscopy of the Sun in soft X-rays. XSM, with its unique features such as low background, high
time cadence, and high spectral resolution, provides the opportunity to characterize transient
and quiescent X-ray emission from the Sun even during low activity periods. It records the X-ray
spectrum at one-second cadence, and the data recorded on-board are downloaded at regular intervals
along with that of other payloads. During ground pre-processing, the XSM data is segregated, and
the level-0 data is made available for higher levels of processing at the Payload Operations Center
(POC). XSM Data Analysis Software (XSMDAS) is developed to carry out the processing of the level-0
data to higher levels and to generate calibrated light curves and spectra for user-defined binning
parameters such that it is suitable for further scientific analysis. A front-end for the XSMDAS
named XSM Quick Look Display (XSMQLD) is also developed to facilitate a first look at the data without
applying calibration. XSM Data Management-Monitoring System (XSMDMS) is designed to carry out
automated data processing at the POC and to maintain an SQLite database with relevant information
on the data sets and an internal web application for monitoring data quality and instrument health.
All XSM raw and calibrated data products are in FITS format, organized into day-wise files, and the
data archive follows Planetary Data System-4 (PDS4) standards. The XSM data will be made available
after a lock-in period along with the XSM Data Analysis Software from ISRO Science Data Archive (ISDA)
at Indian Space Science Data Center(ISSDC). Here we discuss the design and implementation of all
components of the software for the XSM data processing and the contents of the XSM data archive.
