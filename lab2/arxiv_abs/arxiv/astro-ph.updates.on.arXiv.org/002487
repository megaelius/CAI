Aims. Two-dimensional MHD simulations are used to model the emission properties of TeV-bright
shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs) and to explore their nature. Methods. In the leptonic scenario
for the TeV emission, the $\gamma$-ray emission is produced via Inverse Compton scattering of background
soft photons by high-energy electrons accelerated by the shocks of the SNRs. The TeV emissivity
is proportional to the magnetic field energy density and MHD simulations can be used to model the
TeV structure of such remnants directly. 2D MHD simulations for SNRs are then performed under the
assumption that the ambient interstellar medium is turbulent with the magnetic field and density
fluctuations following a Kolmogorov-like power-law spectrum. Results. (1) As expected, these
simulations confirm early 1D and 2D modelings of these sources, namely the hydrodynamical evolution
of the shock waves and amplification of magnetic field by Rayleigh-Taylor convective flows and
by shocks propagating in a turbulent medium; (2) We reproduce rather complex morphological structure
for $\gamma$-rays, suggesting intrinsic variations of the source morphology not related to the
structure of the progenitor and environment; (3)The observed radial profile of several remnants
are well reproduced with an ambient medium density of $0.1-1$ cm$^{-3}$. An even lower ambient density
leads to a sharper drop of the TeV brightness with radius than what is observed near the outer edge
of these remnants. Conclusions. In a turbulent background medium, we can reproduce the observed
characteristics of several shell-type TeV SNRs with reasonable parameters except for a higher
ambient density than that inferred from X-ray observations.
