We report the likely identification of a substantial population of massive M~10^11M_Sun galaxies
at z~4 with suppressed star formation rates (SFRs), selected on rest-frame optical to near-IR colors
from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey. The observed spectral energy distributions show pronounced
breaks, sampled by a set of near-IR medium-bandwidth filters, resulting in tightly constrained
photometric redshifts. Fitting stellar population models suggests large Balmer/4000AA breaks,
relatively old stellar populations, large stellar masses and low SFRs, with a median specific SFR
of 2.9+/-1.8 x 10^-11/yr. Ultradeep Herschel/PACS 100micron, 160micron and Spitzer/MIPS 24micron
data reveal no dust-obscured SFR activity for 15/19 (79%) galaxies. Two far-IR detected galaxies
are obscured QSOs. Stacking the far-IR undetected galaxies yields no detection, consistent with
the SED fit, indicating independently that the average specific SFR is at least 10x smaller than
of typical star-forming galaxies at z~4. Assuming all far-IR undetected galaxies are indeed quiescent,
the volume density is 1.8+/-0.7 x 10^-5Mpc^-3 to a limit of log10M/M_Sun>10.6, which is 10x and
80x lower than at z = 2 and z = 0.1. They comprise a remarkably high fraction (~35%) of z~4 massive galaxies,
suggesting that suppression of star formation was efficient even at very high redshift. Given the
average stellar age of 0.8Gyr and stellar mass of 0.8x10^11M_Sun, the galaxies likely started forming
stars before z =5, with SFRs well in excess of 100M_Sun/yr, far exceeding that of similarly abundant
UV-bright galaxies at z>4. This suggests that most of the star-formation in the progenitors
of quiescent z~4 galaxies was obscured by dust.
