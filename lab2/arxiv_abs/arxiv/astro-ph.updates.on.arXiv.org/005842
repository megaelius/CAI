We consider the problem of determining the host galaxies of radio sources by cross-identification.
This has traditionally been done manually, which will be intractable for wide-area radio surveys
like the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU). Automated cross-identification will be critical
for these future surveys, and machine learning may provide the tools to develop such methods. We
apply a standard approach from computer vision to cross-identification, introducing one possible
way of automating this problem, and explore the pros and cons of this approach. We apply our method
to the 1.4 GHz Australian Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) observations of the Chandra Deep Field
South (CDFS) and the ESO Large Area ISO Survey South 1 (ELAIS-S1) fields by cross-identifying them
with the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic (SWIRE) survey. We train our method with two
sets of data: expert cross-identifications of CDFS from the initial ATLAS data release and crowdsourced
cross-identifications of CDFS from Radio Galaxy Zoo. We found that a simple strategy of cross-identifying
a radio component with the nearest galaxy performs comparably to our more complex methods, though
our estimated best-case performance is near 100 per cent. ATLAS contains 87 complex radio sources
that have been cross-identified by experts, so there are not enough complex examples to learn how
to cross-identify them accurately. Much larger datasets are therefore required for training methods
like ours. We also show that training our method on Radio Galaxy Zoo cross-identifications gives
comparable results to training on expert cross-identifications, demonstrating the value of crowdsourced
training data.
