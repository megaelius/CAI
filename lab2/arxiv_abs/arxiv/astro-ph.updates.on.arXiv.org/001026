Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are characterized by broad emission lines. The lines show similar
properties from the lowest luminosity (10^39 erg/s) to the highest luminosity (10^47 erg/s) AGN.
What produces this similarity over such a vast range of 10^8 in luminosity? Photoionization is inevitably
associated with momentum transfer to the photoionized gas. Yet, most of the photoionized gas in
the Broad Line Region (BLR) follows Keplerian orbits, which suggests that the BLR originates from
gas clouds with a large enough column for gravity to dominate. The photoionized surface layer of
these clouds must develop a pressure gradient which balances the incident radiation force. We present
solutions for the structure of such a hydrostatic photoionized gas layer in the BLR. The gas is stratified,
with a low-density highly-ionized surface layer, set by the ambient pressure, a density rise inwards,
and a uniform density cooler inner region, where the gas pressure, 2n_ekT, reaches the incident
radiation pressure n_gamma<hnu>, where n_e is the electron density, n_gamma is the photon
density, and <hnu> is the mean photon energy. This radiation pressure confinement (RPC)
of the photoionized layer leads to a universal ionization parameter U=n_gamma/n_e~0.1 in the inner
photoionized layer, independent of distance from the AGN, and of the AGN luminosity. Thus, RPC appears
to explain the universality of the BLR properties in AGN. We present predictions for the BLR emission
per unit covering factor, as a function of distance from the ionizing source, for a range of ionizing
continuum slopes and gas metallicity, which are the only free parameters. The predicted mean strength
of most lines, including O VI 1034 and He II 1640 (but excluding H beta), and their peak emissivity
radius, are consistent with observations.
