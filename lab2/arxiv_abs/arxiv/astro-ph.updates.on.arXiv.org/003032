Context. In 1998 the first accreting millisecond pulsar, SAX J1808.4-3658, was discovered and
to date 18 systems showing coherent, high frequency (> 100 Hz) pulsations in low mass X-ray binaries
are known. Since their discovery, this class of sources has shown interesting and sometimes puzzling
behaviours. In particular, apart from a few exceptions, they are all transient with very long X-ray
quiescent periods implying a quite low averaged mass accretion rate onto the neutron star. Among
these sources, XTE J0929-314 has been detected in outburst just once in about 15 years of continuous
monitoring of the X-ray sky. Aims. We aim to demonstrate that a conservative mass transfer in this
system will result in an X-ray luminosity that is higher than the observed, long-term averaged X-ray
luminosity. Methods. Under the hypothesis of a conservative mass transfer driven by gravitational
radiation, as expected for this system given the short orbital period of about 43.6 min and the low
mass of the companion implied by the mass function derived from timing techniques, we calculate
the expected mass transfer rate in this system and predict the long-term averaged X-ray luminosity.
This is compared with the averaged, over 15 years, X-ray flux observed from the system, and a lower
limit of the distance to the source is inferred. Results. This distance is shown to be > 7.4 kpc in the
direction of the Galactic anticentre, implying a large height, > 1.8 kpc, of the source with respect
to the Galactic plane, placing the source in an empty region of the Galaxy. We suggest that the inferred
value of the distance is unlikely. (abridged)
