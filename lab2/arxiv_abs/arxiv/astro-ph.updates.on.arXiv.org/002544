The fraction of binary systems in various stellar populations of the Galaxy and the distribution
of their orbital parameters are important but not well-determined factors in studies of star formation,
stellar evolution, and Galactic chemical evolution. While observational studies have been carried
out for a large sample of nearby stars, including some metal-poor, Population II stars, almost no
constraints on the binary nature for extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H] < -3.0) stars have yet
been obtained. Here we investigate the fraction of double-lined spectroscopic binaries and carbon-enhanced
metal-poor (CEMP) stars, many of which could have formed as pairs of low-mass and intermediate-mass
stars, to estimate the lower limit of the fraction of binary systems having short periods. The estimate
is based on a sample of very metal-poor stars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and observed
at high spectral resolution in a previous study by Aoki et al. That survey reported three double-lined
spectroscopic binaries and 11 CEMP stars, which we consider along with a sample of EMP stars from
the literature compiled in the SAGA database. We have conducted measurements of the velocity components
for stacked absorption features of different spectral lines for each double-lined spectroscopic
binary. Our estimate indicates that the fraction of binary stars having orbital periods shorter
than 1000 days is at least 10 %, and possibly as high as 20 %, if the majority of CEMP stars are formed
in such short-period binaries. This result suggests that the period distribution of EMP binary
systems is biased toward short periods, unless the binary fraction of low-mass EMP stars is significantly
higher than that of other nearby stars.
