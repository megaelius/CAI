We present the analysis of a full-orbit, spectroscopic phase curve of the ultra hot Jupiter WASP-18b,
obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We measure the planet's
normalized day-night contrast as >0.96 in luminosity: the disk-integrated dayside emission from
the planet is at 964+-25 ppm, corresponding to 2894+-30 K, and we place an upper limit on the nightside
emission of <32ppm or 1430K at the 3-sigma level. We also find that the peak of the phase curve exhibits
a small, but significant offset in brightness of 4.5+-0.5 degrees eastward. We compare the extracted
phase curve and phase resolved spectra to 3D Global Circulation Models and find that broadly the
data can be well reproduced by some of these models. We find from this comparison several constraints
on the atmospheric properties of the planet. Firstly we find that we need efficient drag to explain
the very inefficient day-night re-circulation observed. We demonstrate that this drag could be
due to Lorentz-force drag by a magnetic field as weak as 10 Gauss. Secondly, we show that a high metallicity
is not required to match the large day-night temperature contrast. In fact, the effect of metallicity
on the phase curve is different from cooler gas-giant counterparts, due to the high-temperature
chemistry in WASP-18b's atmosphere. Additionally, we compare the current UHJ spectroscopic phase
curves, WASP-18b and WASP-103b, and show that these two planets provide a consistent picture with
remarkable similarities in their measured and inferred properties. However, key differences
in these properties, such as their brightness offsets and radius anomalies, suggest that UHJ could
be used to separate between competing theories for the inflation of gas-giant planets.
