The adiabatic index of H$_2\,$ ($\gamma_{\mathrm{H_2}}$) is non-constant at temperatures between
$100-10^4\,\mathrm{K}$ due to the large energy spacing between its rotational and vibrational
modes. For the formation of the first stars at redshifts 20 and above, this variation can be significant
because primordial molecular clouds are in this temperature range due to the absence of efficient
cooling by dust and metals. We study the possible importance of variations in $\gamma_{\mathrm{H_2}}$
for the primordial initial mass function by carrying out 80 3D gravito-hydrodynamic simulations
of collapsing clouds with different random turbulent velocity fields, half using fixed $\gamma_{\rm
H_2} = 7/5$ in the limit of classical diatomic gas (used in earlier works) and half using an accurate
quantum mechanical treatment of $\gamma_{\mathrm{H_2}}$. We use the adaptive mesh refinement
code FLASH with the primordial chemistry network from KROME for this study. The simulation suite
produces almost 400 stars, with masses from $0.02 - 50$ M$_\odot$ (mean mass $\sim 10.5\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
and mean multiplicity fraction $\sim 0.4$). While the results of individual simulations do differ
when we change our treatment of $\gamma_{\mathrm{H_2}}$, we find no statistically significant
differences in the overall mass or multiplicity distributions of the stars formed in the two sets
of runs. We conclude that, at least prior to the onset of radiation feedback, approximating H$_2$
as a classical diatomic gas with $\gamma_{\rm H_2} = 7/5$ does not induce significant errors in simulations
of the fragmentation of primordial gas. Nonetheless, we recommend using the accurate formulation
of the H$_2\,$ adiabatic index in primordial star formation studies since it is not computationally
more expensive and provides a better treatment of the thermodynamics.
