We determine the Milky Way (MW) mass profile inferred from fitting physically motivated models
to the \textit{Gaia} DR2 Galactic rotation curve and other data. Using various hydrodynamical
simulations of MW-mass haloes, we show that the presence of baryons induces a contraction of the
dark matter (DM) distribution in the inner regions, $r\lesssim 20$ kpc. We provide an analytic expression
that relates the baryonic distribution to the change in the DM halo profile. For our galaxy, the contraction
increases the enclosed DM halo mass by factors of roughly 1.3, 2 and 4 at radial distances of 20, 8 and
1 kpc, respectively compared to an uncontracted halo. Ignoring this contraction results in systematic
biases in the inferred halo mass and concentration. We provide a best-fitting contracted NFW halo
model to the MW rotation curve that matches the data very well. The best-fit has a DM halo mass, $M_{200}^{\rm
DM}=0.99_{-0.20}^{+0.18}\times10^{12} M_\odot$, and concentration before baryon contraction
of $8.2_{-1.5}^{+1.7}$, which lie close to the median halo mass--concentration relation predicted
in $\Lambda$CDM. The inferred total mass, $M_{200}^{\rm total}=1.12_{-0.22}^{+0.20} \times
10^{12} M_\odot$, is in good agreement with recent measurements. The model gives a MW stellar mass
of $4.99_{-0.50}^{+0.34}\times10^{10} M_\odot$, of which $60\%$ is contained in the thin stellar
disc, with a bulge-to-total ratio of 0.2. We infer that the DM density at the Solar position is $\rho_{\odot}^{\rm
DM} = 9.0_{-0.4}^{+0.5}\times10^{-3} M_\odot \rm{pc}^{-3} \equiv 0.34_{-0.02}^{+0.02}~\rm{GeV}~\rm{cm}^{-3}$.
The rotation curve data can also be fitted with an uncontracted NFW halo model, but with very different
DM and stellar parameters. The observations prefer the physically motivated contracted NFW halo,
but the measurement uncertainties are too large to rule out the uncontracted NFW halo.
