Blazars, a type of Active Galactic Nuclei, present a particular orientation of their jets close
to the line ofsight. Their radiation is thus relativistically beamed, giving rise to extreme behaviors,
specially strong variability on very short time-scales (i.e., microvariability). Here we present
simultaneous photometric and polarimetric observations of two relatively nearby blazars, 1ES
1959+650 and HB89 2201+044, that were obtained using the Calar Alto Faint Object Spectrograph mounted
at the 2.2 m telescope in Calar Alto, Spain. An outstanding characteristic of these two blazars is
the presence of well resolved host galaxies. This particular feature allows us to produce a study
of their intrinsic polarization, a measurement of the polarization state of the galactic nucleus
unaffected by the host galaxy. To carry out this work, we computed photometric fluxes from which
we calculated the degree and orientation of the blazars polarization. Then, we analyzed the depolarizing
effect introduced by the host galaxy with the main goal to recover the intrinsic polarization of
the galactic nucleus, carefully taking into consideration the spurious polarimetric variability
introduced by changes in seeing along the observing nights. We find that the two blazars do not present
intra-night photo-polarimetric variability, although we do detect a significant inter-night
variability. Comparing polarimetric values before and after accounting for the host galaxies,
we observe a significant difference in the polarization degree of about 1 % in the case of 1ES 1959+650,
and 0.3 % in the case of HB89 2201+044, thus evidencing the non-negligible impact introduced by the
host galaxies. We note that this host galaxy effect depends on the weaveband, and varies with changing
seeing conditions, so it should be particularly considered when studying frequency-dependent
polarization in blazars.
