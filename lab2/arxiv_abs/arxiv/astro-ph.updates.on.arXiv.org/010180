We present the discovery and the photometric and spectroscopic study of H-rich Type II supernova
(SN) KSP-SN-2016kf (SN2017it) observed in the KMTNet Supernova Program in the outskirts of a small
irregular galaxy at $z\simeq0.043$ within a day from the explosion. Our high-cadence, multi-color
($BVI$) light curves of the SN show that it has a very long rise time ($t_\text{rise}\simeq 20$ days
in $V$ band), a moderately luminous peak ($M_V\simeq -$17.6 mag), a notably luminous and flat plateau
($M_V\simeq -$17.4 mag and decay slope $s\simeq0.53$ mag per 100 days), and an exceptionally bright
radioactive tail. Using the color-dependent bolometric correction to the light curves, we estimate
the $^{56}$Ni mass powering the observed radioactive tail to be $0.10\pm0.01$ M$_\odot$, making
it a H-rich Type II SN with one of the largest $^{56}$Ni masses observed to date. The results of our
hydrodynamic simulations of the light curves constrain the mass and radius of the progenitor at
the explosion to be $\sim$15 M$_\odot$ (evolved from a star with an initial mass of $\sim$ 18.8 M$_\odot$)
and $\sim1040$ R$_\odot$, respectively, with the SN explosion energy of $\sim 1.3\times 10^{51}$
erg s$^{-1}$. The above-average mass of the KSP-SN-2016kf progenitor, together with its low metallicity
$ Z/Z_\odot \simeq0.1-0.4$ obtained from spectroscopic analysis, is indicative of a link between
the explosion of high-mass red supergiants and their low-metallicity environment. The early part
of the observed light curves shows the presence of excess emission above what is predicted in model
calculations, suggesting there is interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar material.
We further discuss the implications of the high progenitor initial mass and low-metallicity environment
of KSP-SN-2016kf on our understanding of the origin of Type II SNe.
