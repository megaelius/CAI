The debate over the early Martian climate is among the most intriguing in planetary science. Although
the geologic evidence generally supports a warmer and wetter climate, climate models have had difficulty
simulating such a scenario, leading some to suggest that the observed fluvial geology (e.g. valley
networks, modified landscapes) on the Martian surface, could have formed in a cold climate instead.
However, as we have originally predicted using a single-column radiative-convective climate
model [Ramirez et al. 2014a], warming from CO2-H2 collision-induced absorption (CIA) on a volcanically
active early Mars could have raised mean surface temperatures above the freezing point, with later
calculations showing that this is achievable with hydrogen concentrations as low as ~1%. Nevertheless,
these predictions should be tested against more complex models. Here, we use an advanced energy
balance model that includes a northern lowlands ocean to show that mean surface temperatures near
or slightly above the freezing point of water were necessary to carve the valley networks. Our scenario
is consistent with a relatively large ocean as has been suggested. Valley network distributions
would have been global prior to subsequent removal processes. At lower mean surface temperatures
and smaller ocean sizes, precipitation and surface erosion efficiency diminish. The warm period
may have been ~< 10 million years, perhaps suggesting that episodic warming mechanisms were not
needed. Atmospheric collapse and permanently glaciated conditions occur once surface ice coverage
exceeds a threshold depending on CIA assumptions. Our results support an early warm and semi-arid
climate consistent with many geologic observations.
