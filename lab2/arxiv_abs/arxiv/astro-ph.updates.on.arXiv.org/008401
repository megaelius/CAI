Despite the existence of co-orbital bodies in the solar system, and the prediction of the formation
of co-orbital planets by planetary system formation models, no co-orbital exoplanets (also called
trojans) have been detected thus far. Here we study the signature of co-orbital exoplanets in transit
surveys when two planet candidates in the system orbit the star with similar periods. Such pair of
candidates could be discarded as false positives because they are not Hill-stable. However, horseshoe
or long libration period tadpole co-orbital configurations can explain such period similarity.
This degeneracy can be solved by considering the Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) of each planet.
We then focus on the three planet candidates system TOI-178: the two outer candidates of that system
have similar orbital period and had an angular separation near $\pi/3$ during the TESS observation
of sector 2. Based on the announced orbits, the long-term stability of the system requires the two
close-period planets to be co-orbitals. Our independent detrending and transit search recover
and slightly favour the three orbits close to a 3:2:2 resonant chain found by the TESS pipeline, although
we cannot exclude an alias that would put the system close to a 4:3:2 configuration. We then analyse
in more detail the co-orbital scenario. We show that despite the influence of an inner planet just
outside the 2:3 mean-motion resonance, this potential co-orbital system can be stable on the Giga-year
time-scale for a variety of planetary masses, either on a trojan or a horseshoe orbit. We predict
that large TTVs should arise in such configuration with a period of several hundred days. We then
show how the mass of each planet can be retrieved from these TTVs.
