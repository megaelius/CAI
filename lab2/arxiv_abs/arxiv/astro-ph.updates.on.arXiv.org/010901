A scalar field model for explaining the anomalous acceleration and light deflection at galactic
and cluster scales, without further dark matter, is presented. It is formulated in a scale covariant
scalar tensor theory of gravity in the framework of integrable Weyl geometry and presupposes two
different phases for the scalar field, like the superfluid approach of Berezhiani/Khoury. In low
acceleration regimes of static gravitational fields the scalar field Lagrangian combines a cubic
kinetic term similar to the ``a-quadratic'' Lagrangian used in the first covariant generalization
of MOND (RAQUAL) \citep{Bekenstein/Milgrom:1984} and a second order derivative term introduced
by Novello et al. in the context of a Weyl geometric approach to cosmology \citep{Novello/Oliveira_ea:1993,Oliveira/Salim/Sautu:1997}.
In varying with regard to $\phi$ the latter is variationally equivalent to a first order expression.
The scalar field equation thus remains of order two. In the Einstein frame it assumes the form of a
covariant generalization of the Milgrom equation known from the classical MOND approach in the
deep MOND regime. It implies a corresponding ``non-metrical'' contribution to the acceleration
of free fall trajectories. In contrast to pure RAQUAL, the Brazilian term leads to a non-negligible
contribution to the energy momentum tensor and an {\em add-on to the light deflection potential}
in beautiful agreement with the dynamics of low velocity trajectories. Although the model takes
up important ingredients from the usual RAQUAL approach, it differs essentially from the latter.
-- In higher sectional curvature regions, respectively for higher accelerations in static fields,
the scalar field Lagrangian consists of a Jordan-Brans-Dicke term with sufficiently high value
of the JBD-constant to satisfy empirical constraints.
