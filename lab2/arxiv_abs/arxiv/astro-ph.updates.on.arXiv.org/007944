We have exploited Gaia Data Release 2 to study white dwarf members of the Praesepe star cluster. We
recovered eleven known white dwarf members (all DA spectral type) plus a new cluster WD never identified
before. Two of the eleven known DA objects did not satisfy all quality indicators available in the
data release. The remaining nine objects of known spectral type have then been employed to determine
their masses (average error of 3-5%) and cooling times (average uncertainty of 5-7\%), by fitting
cooling tracks to their colour-magnitude diagram. Assuming the recent Gaia Data Release 2 reddening
and main sequence turn off age estimates derived from isochrone fitting, we have derived progenitor
masses and established the cluster initial-final mass relation. We found consistency with the
initial-final mass relation we established for eight Hyades white dwarfs, also employing Gaia
data. We have investigated also the effect on the derived initial masses of using self-consistently
different sets of stellar models and isochrones for determining cluster age and white dwarf progenitor
lifetimes. According to our established Hyades+Praesepe initial-final mass relation, recent
sets of stellar evolution calculation that model the full asymptotic giant branch phase do on average
underpredict the final white dwarf masses, in the initial mass range covered by the Praesepe and
Hyades observed cooling sequence. These results depend crucially on the assumed reddening for
the cluster. To this purpose, we have also discussed the case of considering the traditional zero
reddening for Praesepe, instead of E(B-V)=0.027 derived from isochrone fitting to the Gaia colour
magnitude diagram.
