To date, WASP-33 is the only delta Scuti star known to be orbited by a hot Jupiter. The pronounced stellar
pulsations, showing periods comparable to the primary transit duration, interfere with the transit
modeling. Therefore our main goal is to study the pulsation spectrum of the host star to redetermine
the orbital parameters of the system by means of pulsation-cleaned primary transit light curves.
Between August 2010 and October 2012 we obtained 457 hours of photometry of WASP-33 using small and
middle-class telescopes located mostly in Spain and in Germany. Our observations comprise the
wavelength range between the blue and the red, and provide full phase coverage of the planetary orbit.
After a careful detrend, we focus our pulsation studies in the high frequency regime, where the pulsations
that mostly deform the primary transit exist. The data allow us to identify, for the first time in
the system, eight significant pulsation frequencies. The pulsations are likely associated with
low-order p-modes. Furthermore, we find that pulsation phases evolve in time. We use our knowledge
of the pulsations to clean the primary transit light curves and carry out an improved transit modeling.
Surprisingly, taking into account the pulsations in the modeling has little influence on the derived
orbital parameters. However, the uncertainties in the best-fit parameters decrease. Additionally,
we find indications for a possible dependence between wavelength and transit depth, but only with
marginal significance. A clear pulsation solution, in combination with an accurate orbital period,
allows us to extend our studies and search for star-planet interactions (SPI). Although we find
no conclusive evidence of SPI, we believe that the pulsation nature of the host star and the proximity
between members make WASP-33 a promising system for further SPI studies.
