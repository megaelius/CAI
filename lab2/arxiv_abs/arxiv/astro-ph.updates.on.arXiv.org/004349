We present a detailed analysis of the stellar content of the current version of the XMM-Newton slew
survey (XMMSL2). Since stars emit only a small fraction of their total luminosity in the X-ray band,
the stellar XMMSL2 sources ought to have relatively bright optical counterparts. Therefore the
stellar identifications are obtained by an automatic crossmatch of the XMMSL2 catalog with the
first Gaia data release (Gaia DR1), the 2MASS and the Tycho2 catalogs. The reliability of this procedure
is verified by a comparison with the individually classified Einstein Observatory medium sensitivity
survey X-ray sources and by a crossmatch with the Chandra Source Catalog. We identify 6815 of the
23252 unique XMMSL2 sources to be stellar sources, while 893 sources are flagged as unreliable.
For every counterpart a matching probability is estimated based upon the distance between the XMMSL2
source and the counterpart. Given this matching probability the sample is expected to be reliable
to 96.7 % and complete to 96.3 %. The sample contains stars of all spectral types and luminosity classes,
with late-type dwarfs having the largest share. For many stellar sources the fractional contribution
of the X-ray band to the total energy output is found above the saturation limit of previous studies
($L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}=10^{-3}$), because the XMMSL2 sources are more affected by flares
due to their short exposure times of typically 6 s. A comparison with the "Second ROSAT all-sky survey
(2RXS) source catalog" shows that about 25 % of the stellar XMMSL2 sources are previously unknown
X-ray sources. The results of our identification procedure can be accessed via VizieR.
