We investigate the nature of the dynamo bifurcation in a configuration applicable to the Earth's
liquid outer core. Numerical studies on the stability domain of dipolar magnetic fields found a
dichotomy between non-reversing dipole-dominated dynamos and the reversing non-dipole-dominated
multipolar solutions. We show that, by considering weak initial fields, the above transition disappears
and is replaced by a region of bistability. Such a result was also observed in models with free-slip
boundaries in which the geostrophic zonal flow can develop and participate to the dynamo mechanism
for non-dipolar fields. We show that a similar process develops in no-slip models when viscous effects
are reduced sufficiently. The following three regimes are distinguished: (i) Close to the onset
of convection ($Ra_c$) with only the most critical convective mode (wave number) being present,
dynamos set in supercritically and are dipole-dominated. (ii) in the range $3<Ra/Ra_c<Ra_c$,
the bifurcations are subcritical and only dipole-dominated dynamos exist. (iii) $(Ra/Ra_c>10)$,
the relative importance of zonal flows increases with $Ra$ in non-magnetic models. The field topology
depends on the magnitude of the initial magnetic field. The dipolar branch has a subcritical behavior
whereas the multipolar branch has a supercritical behavior. By approaching more realistic parameters,
the extension of this bistable regime increases. A hysteretic behavior questions the common interpretation
for geomagnetic reversals. Far above the dynamo threshold (by increasing the magnetic Prandtl
number), Lorentz forces contribute to the first order force balance, as predicted for planetary
dynamos. When $Ra$ is sufficiently high, dipolar fields affect significantly the flow speed, the
flow structure and heat transfer which is reduced by the Lorentz force regardless of the field strength.
