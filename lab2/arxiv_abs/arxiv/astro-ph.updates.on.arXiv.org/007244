The cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature bispectrum is currently the most precise tool
for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). The Planck temperature data tightly constrain
the amplitude of local-type NG: $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} = 2.5 \pm 5.7$. Here, we compute previously-neglected
foreground biases in temperature-based $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ measurements, due to the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, gravitational lensing, the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effects, and the cosmic infrared background. While standard analyses already subtract a significant
bias on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ due to the ISW-lensing bispectrum, many other secondary anisotropy
terms are present in the temperature bispectrum. We compute the dominant biases on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm
loc}$ arising from these signals. Most of the biases are non-blackbody, and are thus reduced by multifrequency
component separation methods; however, recent analyses have found that extragalactic foregrounds
are present at non-negligible levels in the Planck component-separated maps. Moreover, the Planck
FFP8 simulations do not include the foreground correlations that generate these biases. We compute
the biases for individual frequencies; some are comparable to the statistical error bar on $f_{\rm
NL}^{\rm loc}$, even for the main CMB channels (100, 143, and 217 GHz). For future experiments, they
greatly exceed the statistical error (considering temperature only). Alternatively, the foreground
contributions can be marginalized over, but this leads to a non-negligible increase in the error
bar on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. A full assessment will require calculations in tandem with component
separation, ideally using simulations. We also compute these biases for equilateral and orthogonal
NG, finding large effects for the latter. We conclude that the search for primordial NG using Planck
data may not yet be over.
