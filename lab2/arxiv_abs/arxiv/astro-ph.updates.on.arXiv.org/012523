Transiting planets in nearby young clusters offer the opportunity to study the atmospheres and
dynamics of planets during their formative years. To this end, we focused on K2-25b -- a close-in
($P$=3.48 days), Neptune-sized exoplanet orbiting a M4.5 dwarf in the 650Myr Hyades cluster. We
combined photometric observations of K2-25 covering a total of 44 transits and spanning >2 yr, drawn
from a mix of space-based telescopes (Spitzer Space Telescope and K2) and ground-based facilities
(Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope network and MEarth). The transit photometry spanned
0.6--4.5$\mu$m, which enabled our study of K2-25b's transmission spectrum. We combined and fit
each dataset at a common wavelength within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework, yielding consistent
planet parameters. The resulting transit depths ruled out a solar-composition atmosphere for
K2-25b for the range of expected planetary masses and equilibrium temperature at a $>4\sigma$ confidence
level, and are consistent with a flat transmission spectrum. Mass constraints and transit observations
at a finer grid of wavelengths (e.g., from the Hubble Space Telescope) are needed to make more definitive
statements about the presence of clouds or an atmosphere of high mean molecular weight. Our precise
measurements of K2-25b's transit duration also enabled new constraints on the eccentricity of
K2-25's orbit. We find K2-25b's orbit to be eccentric ($e>0.20$) for all reasonable stellar densities
and independent of the observation wavelength or instrument. The high eccentricity is suggestive
of a complex dynamical history and motivates future searches for additional planets or stellar
companions.
