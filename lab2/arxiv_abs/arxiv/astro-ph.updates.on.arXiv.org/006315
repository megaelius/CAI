Stellar spin-orbit misalignments (obliquities) in hot Jupiter systems have been extensively
probed. Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter dynamical and migration histories.
Common explanations for generating obliquities include high-eccentricity migration and primordial
disk misalignment. This paper investigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit
misalignments in systems hosting a close-in giant planet with an external, modestly inclined companion.
Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance, occurring when the precession
rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the inner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession
rate of the inner planet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via magnetic
braking, this resonance may be achieved at some point during the star's main-sequence lifetime
for a wide range of planet masses and orbital architectures. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis
is strongly coupled to the orbital axis, and obliquity excitation requires a strong perturber,
usually located within 1-2 AU for a giant planet companion. For warm Jupiters, the spin and orbital
axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for distant giant planet perturbers
(at several to tens of AU). Resonant obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual
inclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high mutual inclinations.
Since warm Jupiters have a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate
properties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm Jupiter systems may
be common. This is particularly the case for warm Jupiters orbiting cool stars that have undergone
significant spin-down.
