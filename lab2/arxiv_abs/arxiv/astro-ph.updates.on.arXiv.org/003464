We present a new method for photometering objects in galaxy clusters. We introduce a mode-filtering
technique for removing spatially variable backgrounds, improving both detection and photometric
accuracy (roughly halving the scatter in the red sequence compared to previous catalogs of the same
clusters). This method is based on robustly determining the distribution of background pixel values
and should provide comparable improvement in photometric analysis of any crowded fields. We produce
new multiwavelength catalogs for the 25 CLASH cluster fields in all 16 bandpasses from the UV through
the near IR, as well as rest-frame magnitudes. A comparison with spectroscopic values from the literature
finds a ~30% decrease in the redshift deviation from previously-released CLASH photometry. This
improvement in redshift precision, in combination with a detection scheme designed to maximize
purity, yields a substantial upgrade in cluster member identification over the previous CLASH
galaxy catalog. We construct luminosity functions for each cluster, reliably reaching depths
of at least 4.5 mag below M* in every case, and deeper still in several clusters. We measure M* , $\alpha$,
and their redshift evolution, assuming the cluster populations are coeval, and find little to no
evolution of $\alpha$, $-0.9\lesssim\langle\alpha\rangle\lesssim -0.8$, and M* values consistent
with passive evolution. We present a catalog of galaxy photometry, photometric and spectroscopic
redshifts, and rest-frame photometry for the full fields of view of all 25 CLASH clusters. Not only
will our new photometric catalogs enable new studies of the properties of CLASH clusters, but mode-filtering
techniques, such as those presented here, should greatly enhance the data quality of future photometric
surveys of crowded fields.
