We explore the feasibility of using current generation, off-the-shelf, indium gallium arsenide
(InGaAs) near-infrared (NIR) detectors for astronomical observations. Light-weight InGaAs
cameras, developed for the night vision industry and operated at or near room temperature, enable
cost-effective new paths for observing the NIR sky, particularly when paired with small telescopes.
We have tested an InGaAs camera in the laboratory and on the sky using 12 and 18-inch telescopes. The
camera is a small-format, 320x240 pixels of 40$\mu$m pitch, Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) device
from Sensors Unlimited. Although the device exhibits a room-temperature dark current of $5.7 \times
10^4$ $e^-s^{-1}$ per pixel, we find observations of bright sources and low-positional-resolution
observations of faint sources remain feasible. We can record unsaturated images of bright ($J=3.9$)
sources due to the large pixel well-depth and resulting high dynamic range. When mounted on an 18-inch
telescope, the sensor is capable of achieving milli-magnitude precision for sources brighter
than $J=8$. Faint sources can be sky-background-limited with modest thermoelectric cooling.
We can detect faint sources ($J=16.4$ at $10\sigma$) in a one-minute exposure when mounted to an
18-inch telescope. From laboratory testing, we characterize the noise properties, sensitivity,
and stability of the camera in a variety of different operational modes and at different operating
temperatures. Through sky testing, we show that the (unfiltered) camera can enable precise and
accurate photometry, operating like a filtered $J$-band detector, with small color corrections.
In the course of our sky testing, we successfully measured sub-percent flux variations in an exoplanet
transit. We have demonstrated an ability to detect transient sources in dense fields using image
subtraction of existing reference catalogs.
