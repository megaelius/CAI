The metal abundance of the hot plasma that permeates galaxy clusters represents the accumulation
of heavy elements produced by billions of supernovae. Therefore, X-ray spectroscopy of the intracluster
medium provides an opportunity to investigate the nature of supernova explosions integrated over
cosmic time. In particular, the abundance of the iron-peak elements (chromium, manganese, iron
and nickel) is key to understanding how the progenitors of typical type Ia supernovae evolve and
explode. Recent X-ray studies of the intracluster medium found that the abundance ratios of these
elements differ substantially from those seen in the Sun, suggesting differences between the nature
of type Ia supernovae in the clusters and in the Milky Way. However, because the K-shell transition
lines of chromium and manganese are weak and those of iron and nickel are very close in photon energy,
high-resolution spectroscopy is required for an accurate determination of the abundances of these
elements. Here we report observations of the Perseus cluster, with statistically significant
detections of the resonance emission from chromium, manganese and nickel. Our measurements, combined
with the latest atomic models, reveal that these elements have near-solar abundance ratios with
respect to iron, in contrast to previous claims. Comparison between our results and modern nucleosynthesis
calculations disfavours the hypothesis that type Ia supernova progenitors are exclusively white
dwarfs with masses well below the Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun). The observed
abundance pattern of the iron-peak elements can be explained by taking into account a combination
of near- and sub-Chandrasekhar-mass type Ia supernova systems, adding to the mounting evidence
that both progenitor types make a substantial contribution to cosmic chemical enrichment.
