Observations of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in Neptune's 5:2 resonance present two puzzles: this
third order resonance hosts a surprisingly large population, comparable to the prominent populations
of Plutinos and Twotinos in the first order 3:2 and 2:1 resonances, respectively; secondly, their
eccentricities are concentrated near 0.4. To shed light on these puzzles, we investigate the phase
space near this resonance with use of Poincar\'e sections of the circular planar restricted three
body model. We find several transitions in the phase space structure with increasing eccentricity,
which we explain with the properties of the resonant orbit relative to Neptune's. The resonance
width is narrow for very small eccentricities, but widens dramatically for $e\gtrsim0.2$, reaching
a maximum near $e\approx0.4$, where it is similar to the maximum widths of the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances.
We confirm these results with N-body numerical simulations, including the effects of all four giant
planets and a wide range of orbital inclinations of the KBOs. We find that the long term stability
of KBOs in this resonance is not strongly sensitive to inclination and that the boundaries of the
stable resonant zone are very similar to those found with the simplified three body model, with the
caveat that orbits of eccentricity above $\sim0.55$ are unstable; such orbits are phase-protected
from close encounters with Neptune but not from destabilizing encounters with Uranus. We conclude
that the 5:2 resonant KBOs can be understood fairly naturally in light of the phase space structure
and basic considerations of long term stability in this resonance.
