M stars are powerful emitters of far-ultraviolet light. Over long timescales, a significant, possibly
dominant, fraction of this emission is produced by stellar flares. Characterizing this emission
is critical to understanding the atmospheres of the stars producing it and the atmospheric evolution
of the orbiting planets subjected to it. Ultraviolet emission is known to be elevated for several
hundred million years after M stars form. Whether the same is true of ultraviolet flare activity
is a key concern for the evolution of exoplanet atmospheres. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations
by the HAZMAT program (HAbitable Zones and M dwarf Activity across Time) detected 18 flares on young
(40 Myr) early M stars in the Tucana-Horologium association over 10 h of observations, ten having
energy $>10^{30}$ erg. These imply flares on young M stars are 100--1000$\times$ more energetic
than those occurring at the same rate on "inactive," field-age M dwarfs. However, when energies
are are normalized by quiescent emission there is no statistical difference between the young and
field-age samples. The most energetic flare observed, dubbed the "Hazflare," emitted an energy
of $10^{32.1}$ erg in the FUV, 30$\times$ more energetic than any stellar flare previously observed
in the FUV with HST's COS or STIS spectrographs. It was accompanied by $15,500\pm400$ K blackbody
emission bright enough to designate it a superflare ($E>10^{33}$ erg), with an estimated bolometric
energy of $10^{33.6_{-0.2}^{+0.1}}$ erg. This blackbody emitted 18$^{+2}_{-1}$% of its flux
in the FUV (912--1700 \AA) where molecules are generally most sensitive to photolysis. Such hot
superflares in young, early M stars could play an important role in the evolution of nascent planetary
atmospheres.
