Titan's atmosphere is optically thick and hides the surface and the lower layers from the view at
almost all wavelengths. However, because gaseous absorptions are spectrally selective, some
narrow spectral intervals are relatively transparent and allow to probe the surface. To use these
intervals (called windows) a good knowledge of atmospheric absorption is necessary. Once gas spectroscopic
linelists are well established, the absorption inside windows depends on the way the far wings of
the methane absorption lines are cut-off. We know that the intensity in all the windows can be explained
with the same cut-off parameters, except for the window at 2 {\mu}m. This discrepancy is generally
treated with a workaround which consists in using a different cut-off description for this specific
window. This window is relatively transparent and surface may have specific spectral signatures
that could be detected. Thus, a good knowledge of atmosphere opacities is essential and our scope
is to better understand what causes the difference between the 2 {\mu}m window and the other windows.
In this work, we used scattered light at the limb and transmissions in occultation observed with
VIMS (Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) onboard Cassini, around the 2 {\mu}m window. Data
shows an absorption feature that participates to the shape of this window. Our atmospheric model
fits well the VIMS data at 2 {\mu}m with the same cut-off than for the other windows, provided an additional
absorption is introduced in the middle of the window around ~2.065 {\mu}m. It explains well the discrepancy
between the cut-off used at 2 {\mu}m, and we show that a gas with a fairly constant mixing ratio, possibly
ethane, may be the cause of this absorption. Finally, we studied the impact of this absorption on
the retrieval of the surface reflectivity and found that it is significant.
