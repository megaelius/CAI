Previous studies have analyzed the energy injection into the interstellar matter due to molecular
bubbles. They found that the total kinetic energies of bubbles are comparable to, or even larger
than, those of outflows but still less than the gravitational potential and turbulence energies
of the hosting clouds. We examined the possibility that previous studies underestimated the energy
injection due to being unable to detect dim or incomplete bubbles. We simulated typical molecular
bubbles and inserted them into the $^{13}$CO Five College Radio Astronomical Observatory maps
of the Taurus and Perseus Molecular Clouds. We determined bubble identification completeness
by applying the same procedures to both simulated and real data sets. We proposed a detectability
function for both the Taurus and Perseus molecular clouds based on a multivariate approach. In Taurus,
bubbles with kinetic energy less than ~$1 \times 10^{44}$ erg are likely to be missed. We found that
the total missing kinetic energy in Taurus is less than a couple of $10^{44}$ erg, which only accounts
for around 0.2% of the total kinetic energy of identified bubbles. In Perseus, bubbles with kinetic
energy less than ~$2 \times 10^{44}$ erg are likely to be missed. We found that the total missing kinetic
energy in Perseus is less than $10^{45}$ erg, which only accounts for around 1% of the total kinetic
energy of identified bubbles. We thus conclude that previous manual bubble identification routines
used in Taurus and Perseus can be considered to be energetically complete. Therefore, we confirm
that energy injection from dynamic structures, namely outflows and bubbles, produced by star formation
feedback are sufficient to sustain turbulence at a spatial scale from ~0.1 to ~2.8 pc.
