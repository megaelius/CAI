Nearby stellar streams carry unique information on the dynamical evolution and disruption of stellar
systems in the Galaxy, the mass distribution in the disk, and provide unique targets for planet formation
and evolution studies. We revisit the stream discovered in Meingast et al (2019) to search for new
members, using Gaia DR2 data and a machine learning approach. We use a bagging classifier of one-class
Support Vector Machines to perform a search in positions and proper motions for new stream members.
We use the variable prediction frequency resulting from the multitude of classifiers to estimate
a stream membership criterion which we use to select high fidelity sources. We use the HR diagram
and the Cartesian velocity distribution as test and validation tools. We find about 2000 stream
members with high-fidelity, or about an order of magnitude more than previously known, unveiling
the stream's population across the entire stellar mass spectrum, from B-stars to M-stars, including
white dwarfs. We find that, apart from being slightly more metal-poor, the HRD of the stream is indistinguishable
from that of the Pleiades cluster. For the mass range at which we are mostly complete, $\sim$0.2 M$_\odot$
$ < $ M $ < $ $\sim$4 M$_\odot$, we find a normal IMF, allowing us to estimate the total mass of stream
to be about 2000 M$_\odot$, making this relatively young stream by far the most massive known. In
addition, we identify several white dwarfs as potential stream members. The nearby Meingast 1 stream,
due to its richness, age, and distance, is a new fundamental laboratory for star and planet formation
and evolution studies for the poorly studied gravitationally unbound star-formation mode. We
also demonstrate that One-Class Support Vector Machines can be effectively used to unveil the full
stellar populations of nearby stellar systems with Gaia data.
