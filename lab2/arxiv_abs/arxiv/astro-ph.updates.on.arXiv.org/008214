(abridged) Context: Turbulent diffusion of large-scale flows and magnetic fields play major roles
in many astrophysical systems. Aims: Our goal is to compute turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity,
relevant for diffusing large-scale flows and magnetic fields, respectively, and their ratio,
the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, ${\rm Pm}_{\rm t}$, for isotropically forced homogeneous
turbulence. Methods: We use simulations of forced turbulence in fully periodic cubes composed
of isothermal gas with an imposed large-scale sinusoidal shear flow. Turbulent viscosity is computed
either from the resulting Reynolds stress or from the decay rate of the large-scale flow. Turbulent
magnetic diffusivity is computed using the test-field method. The scale dependence of the coefficients
is studied by varying the wavenumber of the imposed sinusoidal shear and test fields. Results: We
find that turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are in general of the same order of magnitude.
Furthermore, the turbulent viscosity depends on the fluid Reynolds number (${\rm Re}$) and scale
separation ratio of turbulence. The scale dependence of the turbulent viscosity is found to be well
approximated by a Lorentzian. The results for the turbulent transport coefficients appear to converge
at sufficiently high values of ${\rm Re}$ and the scale separation ratio. However, a weak decreasing
trend is found even at the largest values of ${\rm Re}$. The turbulent magnetic Prandtl number converges
to a value that is slightly below unity for large ${\rm Re}$ whereas for small ${\rm Re}$, we find values
between 0.5 and 0.6. Conclusions: The turbulent magnetic diffusivity is in general consistently
higher than the turbulent viscosity. The actual value of ${\rm Pm}_{\rm t}$ found from the simulations
($\approx0.9\ldots0.95$) at large ${\rm Re}$ and scale separation ratio is higher than any of the
analytic predictions.
