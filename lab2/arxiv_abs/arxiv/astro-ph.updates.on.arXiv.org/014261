Having a short orbital period and being tidally locked makes WASP-43b an ideal candidate for JWST
observations. Phase curve observations of an entire orbit will enable the mapping of the atmospheric
structure across the planet, with different wavelengths of observation allowing different atmospheric
depths to be seen. We provide insight into the details of the clouds that may form on WASP-43b in order
to prepare the forthcoming interpretation of the JWST and follow-up data. We utilize 3D GCM results
as input for a kinetic, non-equilibrium model for mineral cloud particles, and for a kinetic model
to study a photochemicaly-driven hydrocarbon haze component. Mineral condensation seeds form
throughout the atmosphere of WASP-43b. This is in stark contrast to the ultra-hot Jupiters, like
WASP-18b and HAT-P-7b. The dayside is loaded with few but large mineral cloud particles in addition
to hydrocarbon haze particles of comparable abundance. Photochemically driven hydrocarbon haze
appears on the dayside, but does not contribute to the cloud formation on the nightside. The geometrical
cloud extension differs across the globe due to the changing thermodynamic conditions. Day and
night differ by 6000km in pressure scale height. As reported for other planets, the C/O is not constant
throughout the atmosphere. The mean molecular weight is approximately constant in a H2-dominated
WASP-43b. WASP-43b is expected to be fully covered in clouds which are not homogeneously distributed
throughout the atmosphere. The dayside and the terminator clouds will be a combination of mineral
particles of locally varying size and composition, and of hydrocarbon hazes. The optical depth
of hydrocarbon hazes is considerably lower than that of mineral cloud particles such that a wavelength-dependent
radius measurement of WASP-43b would be determined by the mineral cloud particles but not by hazes.
