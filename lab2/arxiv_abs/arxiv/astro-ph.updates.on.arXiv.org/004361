$\textit{Swift}$'s rapid slewing, flexible planning, and multi-wavelength instruments make
it the most capable space-based follow-up engine for finding poorly localized sources. During
O1 and O2 $\textit{Swift}$ successfully tiled hundreds of square-degrees of sky in the LVC localization
regions, searching for, and identifying, possible X-ray and UV/O transients in the field. $\textit{Swift}$
made important contributions to the discovery and characterization of the kilonova AT 2017gfo,
discovering the UV emission and providing the deepest X-ray upper limits in the first 24 hours after
the trigger, strongly constraining the dynamics and geometry of the counterpart. $\textit{Swift}$
tiled 92% of the galaxy convolved error region down to average X-ray flux sensitivities of $10^{-12}$
erg $\mbox{cm}^{-2}$ $\mbox{s}^{-1}$, significantly increasing our confidence that AT 2017gfo
is indeed the counterpart to GW 170817 and sGRB 170817. However, there remains significant room
for improvement of $\textit{Swift}$'s follow-up in preparation for O3. This will take the form
of both revised observation strategy based on detailed analysis of the results from O2, and significant
changes to $\textit{Swift}$'s operational capabilities. These improvements are necessary both
for maximizing the likelihood that $\textit{Swift}$ finds a counterpart, and minimizing the impact
that follow-up activities have on other $\textit{Swift}$ science priorities. We outline areas
of improvement to the observing strategy itself for optimal tiling of the LVC localization regions.
We also discuss ongoing work on operational upgrades that will decrease latency in our response
time, and minimize impact on pre-planned observations, while maintaining spacecraft health and
safety.
