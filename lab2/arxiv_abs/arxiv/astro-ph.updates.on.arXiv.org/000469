It is well established that stellar effective temperatures determined from photometry and spectroscopy
yield systematically different results. We describe a new, simple method to correct spectroscopically
derived temperatures ("excitation temperatures") of metal-poor stars based on a literature sample
with -3.3<[Fe/H]<-2.5. Excitation temperatures were determined from FeI line abundances
in high-resolution optical spectra in the wavelength range of ~3700 to ~7000A, although shorter
wavelength ranges, up to 4750 to 6800A, can also be employed, and compared with photometric literature
temperatures. Our adjustment scheme increases the temperatures up to several hundred degrees
for cool red giants, while leaving the near-main-sequence stars mostly unchanged. Hence, it brings
the excitation temperatures in good agreement with photometrically derived values. The modified
temperature also influences other stellar parameters, as the FeI-FeII ionization balance is simultaneously
used to determine the surface gravity, while also forcing no abundance trend on the absorption line
strengths to obtain the microturbulent velocity. As a result of increasing the temperature, the
often too low gravities and too high microturbulent velocities in red giants become higher and lower,
respectively. Our adjustment scheme thus continues to build on the advantage of deriving temperatures
from spectroscopy alone, independent of reddening, while at the same time producing stellar chemical
abundances that are more straightforwardly comparable to studies based on photometrically derived
temperatures. Hence, our method may prove beneficial for comparing different studies in the literature
as well as the many high-resolution stellar spectroscopic surveys that are or will be carried out
in the next few years.
