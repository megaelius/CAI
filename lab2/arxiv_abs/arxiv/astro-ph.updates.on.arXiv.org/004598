An understanding of pulsar timing noise offers the potential to improve the timing precision of
a large number of pulsars as well as facilitating our understanding of pulsar magnetospheres. For
some sources, timing noise is attributable to a pulsar switching between two different spin-down
rates $(\dot{\nu})$. Such transitions may be common but difficult to resolve using current techniques.
In this work, we use simulations of $\dot{\nu}$-variable pulsars to investigate the likelihood
of resolving individual $\dot{\nu}$ transitions. We inject step-changes in the value of $\dot{\nu}$
with a wide range of amplitudes and switching timescales. We then attempt to redetect these transitions
using standard pulsar timing techniques. The pulse arrival-time precision and the observing cadence
are varied. Limits on $\dot{\nu}$ detectability based on the effects such transitions have on the
timing residuals are derived. With the typical cadences and timing precision of current timing
programs, we find we are insensitive to a large region of $\Delta \dot{\nu}$ parameter space which
encompasses small, short timescale switches. We find, where the rotation and emission states are
correlated, that using changes to the pulse shape to estimate $\dot{\nu}$ transition epochs, can
improve detectability in certain scenarios. The effects of cadence on $\Delta \dot{\nu}$ detectability
are discussed and we make comparisons with a known population of intermittent and mode-switching
pulsars. We conclude that for short timescale, small switches, cadence should not be compromised
when new generations of ultra-sensitive radio telescopes are online.
