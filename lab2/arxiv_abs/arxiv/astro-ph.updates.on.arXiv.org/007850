We examine the possible acceleration mechanisms of the relativistic particles responsible for
the extended radio emission in Abell 520. We used new LOFAR 145 MHz, archival GMRT 323 MHz and VLA 1.5
GHz data to study the morphological and spectral properties of extended cluster emission. The observational
properties are discussed in the framework of particle acceleration models associated with cluster
merger turbulence and shocks. In Abell 520, we confirm the presence of extended synchrotron radio
emission that has been classified as a radio halo. The comparison between the radio and X-ray brightness
suggests that the halo might originate in a cocoon rather than from the central X-ray bright regions
of the cluster. The halo spectrum is roughly uniform on the scale of 66 kpc. There is a hint of spectral
steepening from the SW edge towards the cluster centre. Assuming DSA, the radio data are suggestive
of a shock of $\mathcal{M}_{SW}=2.6_{-0.2}^{+0.3}$ that is consistent with the X-ray derived
estimates. This is in line with the scenario in which relativistic electrons in the SW radio edge
gain their energies at the shock front via acceleration of either thermal or fossil electrons. We
do not detect extended radio emission ahead of the SW shock that is predicted if the emission is the
result of adiabatic compression. An X-ray surface brightness discontinuity is detected towards
the NE region that may be a counter shock of $\mathcal{M}_{NE}^{X}=1.52\pm0.05$. This is lower
than the value predicted from the radio emission ($\mathcal{M}_{NE}=2.1\pm0.2$). Our observations
indicate that the SW radio emission in Abell 520 is likely effected by the prominent X-ray detected
shock in which radio emitting particles are (re-)accelerated through the Fermi-I mechanism. The
NE X-ray discontinuity that is approximately collocated with an edge in the radio emission hints
at the presence of a counter shock.
