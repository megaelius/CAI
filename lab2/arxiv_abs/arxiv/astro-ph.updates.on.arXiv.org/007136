Dwarf novae (DNe) are accreting white dwarfs that show eruptions due to a thermal-viscous instability
in the accretion disk. The outburst timescales constrain $\alpha$, the ratio of the viscous stress
to the thermal pressure, and so the mechanism of angular momentum transport. The eruptive state
has $\alpha\approx0.1$ while the quiescent state has $\alpha\approx0.03$. Turbulent transport
due to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is generally considered to be the source of angular
momentum transport in DNe. Here, we perform 3D local magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shearing box simulations
including vertical stratification, radiative transfer and a net constant vertical magnetic flux
to investigate how transport changes between the outburst and quiescent states of DNe. We find that
a constant $B_z$ provides a higher $\alpha$ in quiescence than in outburst, in opposition to what
is expected. Including resistivity quenches MRI turbulence in quiescence, suppressing transport,
unless the magnetic field is high enough, which again leads to $\alpha\approx0.1$. A major difference
between simulations with a net poloidal flux and simulations without is that angular momentum transport
in the former is shared between turbulent and wind-driven transport. We find that wind-driven transport
dominates in quiescence even for low magnetic fields $\sim 1$ G. This can have a major impact on observational
signatures since wind-driven transport does not heat the disk. Furthermore, wind transport cannot
be reduced to an $\alpha$ prescription. We provide fits for $\alpha$ and the wind torque with $\beta$,
ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure. We conclude that the evolution of the thermal-viscous instability,
and its consequences on the outburst cycles of CVs, needs to be seriously revised to take into account
that most of the accretion energy may be carried away by a wind instead of being locally dissipated.
