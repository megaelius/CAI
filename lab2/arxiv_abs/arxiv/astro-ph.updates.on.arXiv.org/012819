With radii ranging between those of the Earth (1 Rearth) and Neptune (~3.9 Rearth), small planets
constitute more than half of the inventory of the 4000-plus exoplanets discovered so far. This population
follows a bimodal distribution peaking at ~1.3 Rearth (super-Earths) and 2.4 Rearth (sub-Neptunes),
with few planets in between. Smaller planets are sufficiently dense to be rocky, but those with radii
larger than ~1.6 Rearth are thought to display large amounts of volatiles, including in many cases
hydrogen/helium gaseous envelopes up to ~30% of the planetary mass. With orbital periods less than
100 days, these low-mass planets are highly irradiated and their origin, evolution, and possible
links are still debated. Here we show that close-in ocean planets affected by greenhouse effect
display hydrospheres in supercritical state, which generate inflated atmospheres without invoking
the presence of large H/He gaseous envelopes. We derive a new set of mass-radius relationships for
ocean planets with different compositions and different equilibrium temperatures, well adapted
to low-density sub-Neptune planets. Our model suggests that super-Earths and sub-Neptunes could
belong to the same family of planets. The differences between their interiors could simply result
from the variation of the water content in those planets. Close-in sub-Neptunes would have grown
from water-rich building blocks compared to super-Earths, and not concurrently from gas coming
from the protoplanetary disk. This implies that small planets should present similar formation
conditions, which resemble those known for the terrestrial and dwarf planets in the solar system.
