Understanding the dynamics of the solar chromosphere is crucial to understanding energy transport
across the solar atmosphere. The chromosphere is optically thick at many wavelengths and described
by non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE), making it difficult to interpret observations.
Furthermore, there is considerable evidence that the atmosphere is filamented, and that current
instruments do not sufficiently resolve small scale features. In flares, it is likely that multithreaded
models are required to describe the heating. The combination of NLTE effects and multithreaded
modeling requires computationally demanding calculations, which has motivated the development
of a model that can efficiently treat both. We describe the implementation of a solver in a hydrodynamic
code for the hydrogen level populations that approximates the NLTE solutions. We derive an accurate
electron density across the atmosphere, that includes the effects of non-equilibrium ionization
for helium and metals. We show the effects on hydrodynamic simulations, which are used to synthesize
light curves using a post-processing radiative transfer code. We demonstrate the utility of this
model on IRIS observations of a small flare. We show that the Doppler shifts in Mg II, C II, and O I can
be explained with a multithreaded model of loops subjected to electron beam heating, so long as NLTE
effects are treated. The intensities, however, do not match observed values very well, which is
due to assumptions about the initial atmosphere. We briefly show how altering the initial atmosphere
can drastically alter line profiles, and therefore derived quantities, and suggest that it should
be tuned to pre-flare observations.
