We investigate the rapid growth phase of supermassive black holes (BHs) within the hydrodynamical
cosmological \eagle simulation. This non-linear phase of BH growth occurs within $\sim$$L_{*}$
galaxies, embedded between two regulatory states of the galaxy host: in sub $L_{*}$ galaxies efficient
stellar feedback regulates the gas inflow onto the galaxy and significantly reduces the growth
of the central BH, while in galaxies more massive than $L_{*}$ efficient AGN feedback regulates
the gas inflow onto the galaxy and curbs further non-linear BH growth. We find evolving critical
galaxy and halo mass scales at which rapid BH growth begins. Galaxies in the low-redshift Universe
transition into the rapid BH growth phase in haloes that are approximately an order of magnitude
more massive than their high-redshift counterparts (\M{200} $\approx 10^{12.4}$~\Msol at $z
\approx 0$ decreasing to \M{200} $\approx 10^{11.2}$~\Msol at $z \approx 6$). Instead, BHs enter
the rapid growth phase at a fixed critical halo virial temperature ($T_{\mathrm{vir}} \approx
10^{5.6}$~K). We additionally show that major galaxy--galaxy interactions ($\mu \geq \frac{1}{4}$,
where $\mu$ is the stellar mass ratio) play a substantial role in triggering the rapid growth phase
of BHs in the low-redshift Universe, whilst potentially having a lower influence at high redshift.
Approximately 40\% of BHs that initiate the rapid BH growth phase at $z \approx 0$ do so within $\pm
0.5$ dynamical times of a major galaxy--galaxy merger, a fourfold increase above what is expected
from the background merger rate. We find that minor mergers ($\frac{1}{10} \leq \mu < \frac{1}{4}$)
have a substantially lower influence in triggering the rapid growth phase at all epochs.
