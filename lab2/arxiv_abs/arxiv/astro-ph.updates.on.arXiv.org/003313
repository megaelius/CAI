Recent reports claiming association of the massive star binary system $\gamma^2 $Velorum (WR 11)
with a high-energy $\gamma$-ray source observed by \textit{Fermi}-LAT contrast the so-far exclusive
role of $\eta$ Carinae as the hitherto only detected $\gamma$-ray emitter in the source class of
particle-accelerating colliding-wind binary (CWB) systems. We offer support to this claim of
association by providing dedicated model predictions for the nonthermal photon emission spectrum
of $\gamma^2$ Velorum. We use three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic modeling (MHD) to investigate
the structure and conditions of the wind-collision region (WCR) of $\gamma^2$ Velorum including
the important effect of radiative braking in the stellar winds. A transport equation is then solved
throughout the computational domain to study the propagation of relativistic electrons and protons.
The resulting distributions of particles are subsequently used to compute nonthermal photon emission
components. In agreement with observation in X-ray spectroscopy, our simulations yield a large
shock-cone opening angle. We find the nonthermal $\gamma$-ray emission of $\gamma^2$ Velorum
to be of hadronic origin owing to the strong radiation fields in the binary system which inhibit the
acceleration of electrons to energies sufficiently high for efficient inverse Compton radiation.
We also discuss the strong dependence of a hadronic $\gamma$-ray component on the energy-dependent
diffusion used in the simulations. Of two mass-loss rates for the WR star found in literature, only
the higher one is able to accommodate the observed $\gamma$-ray spectrum with reasonable values
for important simulation parameters such as the injection ratio of high-energy particles within
the WCR.
