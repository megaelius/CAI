We explore synergies between the space-based Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and
the ground-based Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In particular, we consider
a scenario where the currently envisioned survey strategy for WFIRST's High Latitude Survey (HLS),
i.e., 2000 square degrees in four narrow photometric bands is altered in favor of a strategy that
combines rapid coverage of the LSST area (to full LSST depth) in one band. We find that a 5-month WFIRST
survey in the W-band can cover the full LSST survey area providing high-resolution imaging for >95%
of the LSST Year 10 gold galaxy sample. We explore a second, more ambitious scenario where WFIRST
spends 1.5 years covering the LSST area. For this second scenario we quantify the constraining power
on dark energy equation of state parameters from a joint weak lensing and galaxy clustering analysis,
and compare it to an LSST-only survey and to the Reference WFIRST HLS survey. Our survey simulations
are based on the WFIRST exposure time calculator and redshift distributions from the CANDELS catalog.
Our statistical uncertainties account for higher-order correlations of the density field, and
we include a wide range of systematic effects, such as uncertainties in shape and redshift measurements,
and modeling uncertainties of astrophysical systematics, such as galaxy bias, intrinsic galaxy
alignment, and baryonic physics. Assuming the 5-month WFIRST wide scenario, we find a significant
increase in constraining power for the joint LSST+WFIRST wide survey compared to LSST Y10 (FoM(Wwide)=
2.4 FoM(LSST)) and compared to LSST+WFIRST HLS (FoM(Wwide})= 5.5 FoM(HLS)).
