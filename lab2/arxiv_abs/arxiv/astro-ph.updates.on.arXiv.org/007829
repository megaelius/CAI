The cosmological missing baryons at z<1 most likely hide in the hot (T$\gtrsim10^{5.5}$ K) phase
of the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). While the hot WHIM is hard to detect due to its high ionisation
level, the warm (T$\lesssim10^{5.5}$ K) phase of the WHIM has been very robustly detected in the
FUV band. We adopted the assumption that the hot and warm WHIM phases are co-located and thus used
the FUV-detected warm WHIM as a tracer for the cosmologically interesting hot WHIM. We utilised
the assumption by performing an X-ray follow-up in the sight line of a blazar PKS 2155-304 at the redshifts
where previous FUV measurements of OVI, SiIV and BLA absorption have indicated the existence of
the warm WHIM. We looked for the OVII He$\alpha$ and OVIII Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines, the most
likely hot WHIM tracers. Despite of the very large exposure time ($\approx$ 1 Ms), the XMM-Newton/RGS1
data yielded no significant detection which corresponds to upper limits of $\log{N({\rm OVII})({\rm
cm}^{-2}))} \le 14.5-15.2$ and $\log{N({\rm OVIII})({\rm cm}^{-2}))} \le 14.9-15.2$. An analysis
of LETG/HRC data yielded consistent results. However, the LETG/ACIS data yielded a detection of
an absorption line - like feature at $\lambda \approx$ 20 \AA\ at simple one parameter uncertainty
- based confidence level of 3.7 $\sigma$, consistently with several earlier LETG/ACIS reports.
Given the high statistical quality of the RGS1 data, the possibility of RGS1 accidentally missing
the true line at $\lambda \sim$ 20 \AA\ is very low, 0.006%. Neglecting this, the LETG/ACIS detection
can be interpreted as Ly$\alpha$ transition of OVIII at one of the redshifts (z$\approx$ 0.054)
of FUV-detected warm WHIM. Given the very convincing X-ray spectral evidence for and against the
existence of the $\lambda \sim$ 20 \AA\ feature, we cannot conclude whether or not it is a true astrophysical
absorption line.
