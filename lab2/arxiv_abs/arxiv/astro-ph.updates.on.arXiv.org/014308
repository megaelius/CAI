We explore the cosmological multi-tracer synergies between a DESI-like Emission Line Galaxy (ELG)
distribution and a Tianlai-like 21cm intensity map. We use simulated maps generated from a particle
simulation in the light-cone volume (Horizon Run 4), sky-trimmed and including the effects of foreground
contamination, its removal, and instrument noise. We first validate how the foreground residual
affects the recovered 21cm signal by putting different levels of foreground contamination into
the 21cm maps. We find that the contamination cannot be ignored in the angular auto-power spectra
of HI even when it is small, but has no influence on the accuracy of the angular cross-power spectra
between HI and galaxies. In the foreground-cleaned map case, as information is lost in the cleaning
procedure, there is also a bias in the cross-power spectrum. However, we found that the bias from
the cross-power spectrum is scale-independent, which is easily parameterised as part of the model,
while the offset in the HI auto-power spectrum is non-linear. In particular, we tested that the cross
power also benefits from the cancellation of the bias in the power spectrum measurement that is induced
by the instrument noise, which changes the shape of the auto-power spectra but leaves the cross-power
unaffected. We then modelled the angular cross-power spectra to fit the BAO feature in broadband
shape of the angular cross power spectrum, including contamination from the residual foreground
and the effect of instrument noise. We forecast a constraint on the angular diameter distance $D_\mathrm{A}$
for the Tianlai Pathfinder redshift $0.775<z<1.03$, giving a distance measurement with a precision
of 3.3% at that redshift.
