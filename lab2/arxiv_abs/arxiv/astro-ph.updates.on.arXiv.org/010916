Earth is constantly being bombarded with material from space. Most of the natural material end up
being dust grains that litter the surface of Earth, but larger bodies are known to impact every few
decades. The most recent large impact was Chelyabinsk which set off a 500-kiloton explosion which
was 40 times that of the Hiroshima nuclear explosion. Apart from meteors, there is a growing threat
of space assets deorbiting. With these impending space threats, it is critical to have a constellation
of satellites to autonomously lookout for meteors and reentering space debris. By using multiple
spacecraft, it is possible to perform multipoint observation of the event. Through multipoint
observation, it is possible to triangulate the location of the observed event. The detection, tracking,
and analysis of these objects all need to be performed autonomously. Our previous work focused on
developing several vision algorithms including blob-detection, feature detection, and neural
network-based image segment classification. For this multipoint observation to occur, it requires
multiple spacecraft to coordinate their actions particularly fixating on the space observation
target. Furthermore, communication and coordination are needed for bringing new satellites into
observation view and removing other satellites that have lost their view. In this paper, we analyze
state-of-the-art observation technology for small satellites and perform detailed design of
its implementation. Through this study, we estimate the error estimates on position, velocity,
and acceleration. We presume use of low to mid-tier cameras for the spacecraft.
