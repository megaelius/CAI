We present a characterization of the protostar embedded within the BHR7 dark cloud, based on both
photometric measurements from the near-infrared to millimeter and interferometric continuum
and molecular line observations at millimeter wavelengths. We find that this protostar is a Class
0 system, the youngest class of protostars, measuring its bolometric temperature to be 50.5~K,
with a bolometric luminosity of 9.3~L$_{\odot}$. The near-infrared and \textit{Spitzer} imaging
show a prominent dark lane from dust extinction separating clear bipolar outflow cavities. Observations
of $^{13}$CO ($J=2\rightarrow1$), C$^{18}$O ($J=2\rightarrow1$), and other molecular lines
with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) exhibit a clear rotation signature on scales $<$1300~AU. The
rotation can be traced to an inner radius of $\sim$170~AU and the rotation curve is consistent with
an R$^{-1}$ profile, implying that angular momentum is being conserved. Observations of the 1.3~mm
dust continuum with the SMA reveal a resolved continuum source, extended in the direction of the
dark lane, orthogonal to the outflow. The deconvolved size of the continuum indicates a radius of
$\sim$100~AU for the continuum source at the assumed distance of 400~pc. The visibility amplitude
profile of the continuum emission cannot be reproduced by an envelope alone and needs a compact component.
Thus, we posit that the resolved continuum source could be tracing a Keplerian disk in this very young
system. If we assume that the continuum radius traces a Keplerian disk (R$\sim$120~AU) the observed
rotation profile is consistent with a protostar mass of 1.0~$M_{\odot}$.
