The three-point correlation function (3PCF) of the 21cm brightness temperature from the Epoch
of Reionization (EoR) probes complementary information to the commonly studied two-point correlation
function (2PCF) about the morphology of ionized regions. We investigate the 21cm 2PCF and 3PCF in
configuration space using semi-numerical simulations and test whether they can be described by
the local quadratic bias model. We find that fits of bias model predictions for the 2PCF and 3PCF deviate
from our measurements by $\sim 20\%$ at scales above the typical size of ionized regions ($\simeq
30$ Mpc) and at early times with global neutral fractions of $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle \gtrsim
0.7$. At later times and smaller scales these deviations increase strongly, indicating a break
down of the bias model. In the regime in which the model performs well, the 2PCF and 3PCF fits of the
linear bias parameter agree at the $10\%$ level for different EoR model configurations. This agreement
holds, when adding redshift space distortions to the simulations. The relation between spatial
fluctuations in the matter density and the 21cm signal, as predicted by the bias model, is consistent
with direct measurements of this relation in simulations for large smoothing scales ($\gtrsim
30$ Mpc). From this latter test we conclude that negative amplitudes of the 21cm 3PCF result mainly
from negative bias parameters, which describe the anti-correlation between the matter over-densities
and the 21cm signal during the EoR. However, a more detailed interpretation of the bias parameters
may require a description of non-local contributions to the bias model.
