Aims. Comparing theoretical models of exoplanet formation with observations allows one to make
key step forward towards an understanding of planetary systems. It however requires a model able
to (i) predict all the necessary observable quantities (not only masses and orbits, but also radii,
luminosities, magnitudes, or evaporation rates) and (ii) address the large range in relevant planetary
masses (from Mars mass to super-Jupiters) and distances (from stellar-grazing to wide orbits).
Methods. We have developed a combined global planetary formation and evolution model that solves
as directly as possible the underlying differential equations for the structure and evolution
of the gas disc, the dynamical state of the planetesimals, the internal structure of the planets
yielding their gas accretion rate and internal structure, the accretion rate of planetesimals,
disc-driven orbital migration, and the gravitational interaction of concurrently forming planets
via a full N-body calculation. Importantly, the model now also follows the long-term evolution
of the planets on Gigayear timescales after formation including the effects of cooling and contraction,
atmospheric escape, bloating, and stellar tides. Results. To test the model, we compared it with
classical scenarios of Solar System formation. For the terrestrial planets, we find that we obtain
a giant impact phase provided enough embryos (~100) are initially emplaced in the disc. For the giant
planets, we find that Jupiter-mass planets must accrete their core shortly before the dispersal
of the gas disc to prevent strong inward migration that would bring them to the inner edge of the disc.
Conclusions. he model can form planetary systems with a wide range of properties. We find that giant-planet
bearing systems are more diverse than the ones with only terrestrial planets.
