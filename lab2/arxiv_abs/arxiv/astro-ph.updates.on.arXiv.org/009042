Aims: This paper presents 2.5D numerical experiments of Alfv\'en wave phase mixing and aims to assess
the effects of nonlinearities on wave behaviour and dissipation. In addition, this paper aims to
quantify how effective the model presented in this work is at providing energy to the coronal volume.
Methods: The model is presented and explored through the use of several numerical experiments which
were carried out using the Lare2D code. The experiments study footpoint driven Alfv\'en waves in
the neighbourhood of a two-dimensional x-type null point with initially uniform density and plasma
pressure. A continuous sinusoidal driver with a constant frequency is used. Each experiment uses
different driver amplitudes to compare weakly nonlinear experiments with linear experiments.
Results: We find that the wave trains phase-mix owing to variations in the length of each field line
and variations in the field strength. The nonlinearities reduce the amount of energy entering the
domain, as they reduce the effectiveness of the driver, but they have relatively little effect on
the damping rate (for the range of amplitudes studied). The nonlinearities produce density structures
which change the natural frequencies of the field lines and hence cause the resonant locations to
move. The shifting of the resonant location causes the Poynting flux associated with the driver
to decrease. Reducing the magnetic diffusivity increases the energy build-up on the resonant field
lines, however, it has little effect on the total amount of energy entering the system. From an order
of magnitude estimate, we show that the Poynting flux in our experiments is comparable to the energy
requirements of the quiet Sun corona. However a (possibly unphysically) large amount of magnetic
diffusion was used however and it remains unclear if the model is able to provide enough energy under
actual coronal conditions.
