Efficient expansions of the gravitational field of (dark) haloes have two main uses in the modelling
of galaxies: first, they provide a compact representation of numerically-constructed (or real)
cosmological haloes, incorporating the effects of triaxiality, lopsidedness or other distortion.
Secondly, they provide the basis functions for self-consistent field expansion algorithms used
in the evolution of $N$-body systems. We present a new family of biorthogonal potential-density
pairs constructed using the Hankel transform of the Laguerre polynomials. The lowest-order density
basis functions are double-power-law profiles cusped like $\rho \sim r^{-2 + 1/\alpha}$ at small
radii with asymptotic density fall-off like $\rho \sim r^{-3 -1/(2\alpha)}$. Here, $\alpha$ is
a parameter satisfying $\alpha \ge 1/2$. The family therefore spans the range of inner density cusps
found in numerical simulations, but has much shallower -- and hence more realistic -- outer slopes
than the corresponding members of the only previously-known family deduced by Zhao (1996) and exemplified
by Hernquist & Ostriker (1992). When $\alpha =1$, the lowest-order density profile has an inner
density cusp of $\rho \sim r^{-1}$ and an outer density slope of $\rho \sim r^{-3.5}$, similar to
the famous Navarro, Frenk & White (1997) model. For this reason, we demonstrate that our new expansion
provides a more accurate representation of flattened NFW haloes than the competing Hernquist-Ostriker
expansion. We utilize our new expansion by analysing a suite of numerically-constructed haloes
and providing the distributions of the expansion coefficients.
