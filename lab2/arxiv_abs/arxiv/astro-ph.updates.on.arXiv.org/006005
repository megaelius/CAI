We have used many decades of visual observations from the AAVSO International Database, and the
AAVSO time-series analysis package VSTAR, to study the long-term changes in period, amplitude,
and mean magnitude in about 30 normal pulsating red giants (PRGs) i.e. those without large secular
changes in period, as well as a few of the rare PRGs which do have such secular period changes. The periods
of the typical PRGs "wander" on time scales of about 40 pulsation periods -- significantly longer
than the time scales of amplitude variation which are 20-35 with a mean of 27 pulsation periods. We
have also studied the range and time scale of the long-term changes in pulsation amplitude and mean
magnitude, as well as period, and looked for correlations between these. Changes in mean magnitude
are larger in stars in stars with larger mean amplitude, but correlate negatively with changes in
amplitude. There is a weak positive correlation between the long-term period changes and amplitude
changes. The causes of these three kinds of long-term changes are still not clear. We note, from the
presence of harmonics in the Fourier spectra, that the longest-period PRGs have distinctly non-sinusoidal
phase curves. For studying PRGs, we demonstrate the advantage of studying stars with minimal seasonal
gaps in the observations, such as those near the celestial poles. We studied Z UMi, misclassified
as a possible Mira star, but actually an R CrB star. We determined times of onset of 16 fadings. We were
not able to determine a coherent pulsation period for this star at maximum, with an amplitude greater
than 0.05. We did, however, find that the times of onset of fadings were "locked" to a 41.98-day period
-- a typical pulsation period for an R CrB star.
