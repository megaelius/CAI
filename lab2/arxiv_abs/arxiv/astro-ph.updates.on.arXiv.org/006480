Carbon-enriched rocky exoplanets have been proposed around dwarf stars as well as around binary
stars, white dwarfs and pulsars. However, the mineralogical make up of such planets is poorly constrained.
We performed high-pressure high-temperature laboratory experiments on chemical mixtures representative
of C-enriched rocky exoplanets according to protoplanetary disk modeling. Our results show that
these exoplanets, when fully-differentiated, comprise a metallic core, a silicate mantle and
a graphite layer on top of the silicate mantle. Graphite is the dominant carbon-bearing phase at
the conditions of our experiments with no traces of silicon carbide or carbonates. Silicate mineralogy
is similar to the mineralogy of the mantles of carbon-poor planets such as the Earth, and largely
unaffected by the amount of carbon. Metals are either two immiscible iron-rich alloys (S-rich and
S-poor) or a single iron-rich alloy in the Fe-C-S system with immiscibility depending on the S/Fe
ratio and core pressure. We show that for our C-enriched compositions the minimum carbon abundance
needed for C-saturation is 0.05-0.7 wt% (molar C/O~0.002-0.03). Fully differentiated rocky exoplanets
with C/O ratios more than needed for C-saturation would contain graphite as an additional layer
on top of the silicate mantle. For a thick enough graphite layer, diamonds would form at the bottom
of this layer due to high pressures. We model the interior structure of Kepler-37b and show that a
mere 10 wt% graphite layer would decrease its derived mass by 7%, suggesting future telescopes could
provide quantitative limits on their carbon content. Future observations of rocky exoplanets
with graphite-rich surfaces would show low albedos due to the low reflectance of graphite. The absence
of life-bearing elements other than carbon on the surface likely makes them inhabitable.
