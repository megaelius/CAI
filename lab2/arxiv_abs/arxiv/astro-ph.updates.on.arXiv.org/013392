We use two hydrodynamical simulations of the self-consistent evolution of molecular clouds undergoing
global hierarchical collapse, one with and the other without feedback from the photoionising radiation
from massive stars, to study the effect of this feedback on the structural and kinematic properties
of the gas and the stellar clusters formed in the clouds. Before the formation of massive stars, the
evolution of the two simulations is very similar (implying that the feedback from low mass stars
does not affect the cloud-scale evolution significantly) and the star-forming region accretes
faster than it can convert gas to stars, thus keeping the instantaneous measured star formation
efficiency low even in the absence of significant feedback. Afterwards, the ionising feedback
first destroys the filamentary supply to star-forming hubs and ultimately removes the gas from
it. The ionising feedback also affects the initial kinematics and spatial distribution of the forming
stars, because the gas being dispersed continues to form stars for some time and the stars it forms
inherit its motion. In the non-feedback simulation, the groups remain highly compact while, in
the feedback run, the dispersal of the gas causes each group to expand, and the cluster expansion
thus consists of the combined expansion of the groups, rather than a coherent radial expansion away
from the main hub. We do find one example of a peripheral star-forming site that appears only in the
feedback run, indicating it was triggered by the expanding shell through the collect-and-collapse
mechanism. However, this appears to be the exception rather than the rule. The net effect of the photoionising
feedback in our simulation is to globally reduce and ultimately terminate star formation, while
simultaneously smoothing the spatial distribution of the cluster stars.
