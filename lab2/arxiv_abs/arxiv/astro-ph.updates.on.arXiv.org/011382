Context: Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are rapidly-evolving and luminous (M$_\text{R,peak}$ $\sim-19$)
transients interacting with He-rich circumstellar material (CSM). SN 2018bcc, detected by the
ZTF shortly after explosion, provides the best constraints on the shape of the rising lightcurve
of a fast Type Ibn. Aims: We use the high-quality data set of SN 2018bcc to study observational signatures
of the class. Additionally, the powering mechanism of SN 2018bcc offers insights into the debated
progenitor connection of Type Ibn SNe. Methods: Well-constrained lightcurve properties obtained
from empirical models are compared with the literature. We fit the pseudo-bolometric lightcurve
with semi-analytical models powered by radioactive decay and CSM interaction. The line profiles
and emissivity of the prominent He I lines are modeled to study the formation of P-Cygni profiles
and to estimate CSM properties. Results: SN 2018bcc has a risetime to peak of $5.6^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$
days in the rest frame with a rising shape powerlaw index near 2, and seems to be a typical rapidly-evolving
Type Ibn SN. The spectrum lacks signatures of SN-like ejecta and is dominated by over 15 He emission
features at 20 days past peak, alongside Ca and Mg, all with V$_{\text{FWHM}} \sim 2000~\text{km}~\text{s}^{-1}$.
The luminous and rapidly-evolving lightcurve can be powered by CSM interaction but not by the decay
of radioactive $^{56}$Ni. Modeling of the He I lines indicates a dense and optically thick CSM that
can explain the P-Cygni profiles. Conclusions: Like other rapidly-evolving Type Ibn SNe, SN 2018bcc
is a luminous transient with a rapid rise to peak powered by shock-interaction inside a dense and
He-rich CSM. Its spectra do not support the existence of two Type Ibn spectral classes. We also note
the remarkable observational match to pulsational pair instability (PPI) SN models.
