The forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will probe the population of coalescing
massive black hole (MBH) binaries up to the onset of structure formation. Here we simulate the galactic-scale
pairing of $\sim10^6 M_\odot$ MBHs in a typical, non-clumpy main-sequence galaxy embedded in a
cosmological environment at $z = 7-6$. In order to increase our statistical sample, we adopt a strategy
that allows us to follow the evolution of six secondary MBHs concomitantly. We find that the magnitude
of the dynamical-friction induced torques is significantly smaller than that of the large-scale,
stochastic gravitational torques arising from the perturbed and morphologically evolving galactic
disc, suggesting that the standard dynamical friction treatment is inadequate for realistic galaxies
at high redshift. The dynamical evolution of MBHs is very stochastic, and a variation in the initial
orbital phase can lead to a drastically different time-scale for the inspiral. Most remarkably,
the development of a galactic bar in the host system either significantly accelerates the inspiral
by dragging a secondary MBH into the centre, or ultimately hinders the orbital decay by scattering
the MBH in the galaxy outskirts. The latter occurs more rarely, suggesting that galactic bars overall
promote MBH inspiral and binary coalescence. The orbital decay time can be an order of magnitude
shorter than what would be predicted relying on dynamical friction alone. The stochasticity, and
the important role of global torques, have crucial implications for the rates of MBH coalescences
in the early Universe: both have to be accounted for when making predictions for the upcoming LISA
observatory.
