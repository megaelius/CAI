The near-Earth asteroid (25143) Itokawa was characterised in great detail by the Japanese Hayabusa
mission. We revisited the available thermal observations in the light of the true asteroid properties
with the goal to evaluate the possibilities and limitations of thermal model techniques. In total,
we used 25 published ground-based mid-infrared photometric observations and 5 so far unpublished
measurements from the Japanese infrared astronomical satellite AKARI in combination with improved
H-G values. Our thermophysical model (TPM) approach allowed us to determine correctly the sense
of rotation, to estimate the thermal inertia and to derive robust effective size and albedo values
by only using a simple spherical shape model. A more complex shape model, derived from light-curve
inversion techniques, improved the quality of the predictions considerably and made the interpretation
of thermal light-curve possible. The radiometrically derived effective diameter value agrees
within 2% of the true Itokawa size value. The combination of our TPM and the final Itokawa in-situ
shape model was then used as a benchmark for deriving and testing radiometric solutions. The consolidated
value for the surface-averaged thermal inertia is 700 $\pm$ 200 Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$K$^{-1}$.
We found that even the high resolution shape models still require additional small-scale roughness
in order to explain the disk-integrated infrared measurements. Our description of the thermal
effects as a function of wavelengths, phase angle, and rotational phase facilitates the planning
of crucial thermal observations for sophisticated characterization of small bodies, including
other potentially hazardous asteroids. Our analysis shows the power of radiometric techniques
to derive the size, albedo, thermal inertia, and also spin-axis orientation from small sets of measurements
at thermal infrared wavelengths.
