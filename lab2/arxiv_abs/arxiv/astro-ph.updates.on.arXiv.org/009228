We used deep MUSE observations to perform a stellar-kinematic and population analysis of FCC 153
and FCC 177, two edge-on S0 galaxies in the Fornax cluster. The geometrical definition of the different
structural components of these two galaxies allows us to describe the nature of their thick disks.
These are both old, relatively metal poor and [Mg/Fe]-enhanced, and their star formation history
(SFH) reveals a minor younger component whose chemical properties suggest its later accretion.
Moreover, the outer regions of these geometrically defined thick disks show higher values of metallicity
and lower values of [Mg/Fe]. These stars probably formed in the thin-disk region and they were dynamically
heated to form the flares present in these two galaxies. We propose different formation scenarios
for the three populations of these thick disks: in-situ formation, accretion and disk heating.
A clear distinction in age is found between the metal poor and [Mg/Fe]-enhanced thick disks (old,
$\sim 12-13$ Gyr), and the metal rich and less [Mg/Fe]-enhanced thin disks (young, $\sim 4-5$ Gyr).
These two galaxies show signs of relatively recent star formation in their thin disks and nuclear
regions. While the thin disks show more continuous SFHs, the nuclei display a rather bursty SFH.
These two galaxies are located outside of the densest region of the Fornax cluster where FCC 170 resides.
This other edge-on S0 galaxy was studied by \citet{Pinna2019}. We compare and discuss our results
with this previous study. The differences between these three galaxies, at different distances
from the cluster center, suggest that the environment can have a strong effect on the galaxy evolutionary
path.
