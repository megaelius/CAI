The soft X-ray band of many active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is affected by obscuration due to partially
ionised matter crossing our line of sight. In this context, two past XMM-Newton observations (6
months apart) and a simultaneous NuSTAR-Swift ($\sim$8 years later) exposure of the Narrow Line
Seyfert 1 galaxy 1E 0754.6+392.8 revealed an intense and variable WA and hints of additional absorbers
in the Fe K$\alpha$ band. We present the first X-ray characterisation of this AGN discussing its
broadband (0.3-79 keV) spectrum and temporal properties. We conduct a temporal and spectroscopic
analysis on two $\sim$10 ks (net exposure) XMM-Newton snapshots performed in April and October
2006. We also study the high energy behaviour of 1E 0754.6+392.8 modelling its broadband spectrum
using simultaneous Swift-NuSTAR data. Both phenomenological and physically motivated models
are tested. We find the presence of flux variability ($\sim$150% and 30% for 0.3-2 and 2-10 keV bands,
respectively) and spectral changes at months timescales ($\Delta\Gamma\sim$0.4). A reflection
component that is consistent with being constant over years and arising from relatively cold material
far from the central super massive black hole is detected. The main spectral feature shaping the
1E 0754.6+392.8 spectrum is a warm absorber. Such a component is persistent over the years and variability
of its ionisation and column density is observed down on months in the ranges 3$\times10^{22} \rm
cm^{-2}\lesssim$ N$_{\rm{H}}\lesssim7.2\times10^{22} \rm cm^{-2}$ and 1.5 $\lesssim\log(\xi/{\rm
erg~s^{-1}~cm})\lesssim$2.1. Despite the short exposures, we find possible evidence of two additional
highly ionised and high-velocity outflow components in absorption. Longer exposures are mandatory
in order to characterise the complex outflow in this AGN.
