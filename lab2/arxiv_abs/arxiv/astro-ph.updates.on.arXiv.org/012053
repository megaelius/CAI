The interior of a neutron star (NS) is usually assumed to be made of cold catalyzed matter. However,
the outer layers are unlikely to remain in full equilibrium during the formation of the star and its
cooling, especially after crystallization. We study the cooling and equilibrium composition
of the outer layers of a NS down to crystallization. Here the impurity parameter, usually a free parameter
in cooling simulations, is calculated self-consistently using a microscopic model for which a
unified equation of state has recently been determined. We follow the evolution of the nuclear distributions
of the multi-component Coulomb liquid plasma (MCP) fully self-consistently, adapting a general
formalism originally developed for the description of supernova cores. We calculate the impurity
parameter at the crystallization as determined in the one-component plasma (OCP) approximation.
Our analysis shows that the sharp changes in composition obtained in the OCP approximation are smoothed
out when a full nuclear distribution is allowed. The Coulomb coupling parameter at melting is found
to be reasonably close to the canonical value of 175, except for specific pressures for which supercooling
occurs in the OCP approximation. Our MCP treatment leads to non-monotonic variations of the impurity
parameter with pressure. Its values can change by several orders of magnitude reaching about 50,
suggesting that the crust may be composed of an alternation of pure (highly conductive) and impure
(highly resistive) layers. The results presented here complement the recent unified equation
of state obtained with the same model. Our self-consistent approach to hot MCP shows that the presence
of impurities in the outer crust of a NS is non-negligible and may have a sizeable impact on transport
properties. In turn, this may have important implications for the cooling of NS and their magneto-rotational
evolution.
