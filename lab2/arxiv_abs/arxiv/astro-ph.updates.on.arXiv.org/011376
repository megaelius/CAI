The energy balance and climate of planets can be affected by the reflective properties of their land,
ocean, and frozen surfaces. Here we investigate the effect of host star spectral energy distribution
(SED) on the albedo of these surfaces using a one-dimensional (1-D) energy balance model (EBM).
Incorporating spectra of M-, K-, G- and F-dwarf stars, we determined the effect of varying fractional
and latitudinal distribution of land and ocean surfaces as a function of host star SED on the overall
planetary albedo, climate, and ice-albedo feedback response. While noting that the spatial distribution
of land masses on a given planet will have an effect on the overall planetary energy balance, we find
that terrestrial planets with higher average land/ocean fractions are relatively cooler and have
higher albedo regardless of star type. For Earth-like planets orbiting M-dwarf stars the increased
absorption of water ice in the near-infrared (NIR), where M-dwarf stars emit much of their energy,
resulted in warmer global mean surface temperatures, ice lines at higher latitudes, and increased
climate stability as the ice-albedo feedback became negative at high land fractions. Conversely,
planets covered largely by ocean, and especially those orbiting bright stars, had a considerably
different energy balance due to the contrast between the reflective land and the absorptive ocean
surface, which in turn resulted in warmer average surface temperatures than land-covered planets
and a stronger potential ice-albedo feedback. While dependent on the properties of individual
planetary systems, our results place so constraints on a range of climate states of terrestrial
exoplanets based on albedo and incident flux.
