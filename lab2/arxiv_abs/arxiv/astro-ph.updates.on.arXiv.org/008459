An important result in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory is that spherically-symmetric,
one-dimensional simulations routinely fail to explode, yet multi-dimensional simulations often
explode. Numerical investigations suggest that turbulence eases the condition for explosion,
but how is not fully understood. We develop a turbulence model for neutrino-driven convection,
and show that this turbulence model reduces the condition for explosions by about 30%, in concordance
with multi-dimensional simulations. In addition, we identify which turbulent terms enable explosions.
Contrary to prior suggestions, turbulent ram pressure is not the dominant factor in reducing the
condition for explosion. Instead, there are many contributing factors, ram pressure being only
one of them, but the dominant factor is turbulent dissipation (TD). Primarily, TD provides extra
heating, adding significant thermal pressure, and reducing the condition for explosion. The source
of this TD power is turbulent kinetic energy, which ultimately derives its energy from the higher
potential of an unstable convective profile. Investigating a turbulence model in conjunction
with an explosion condition enables insight that is difficult to glean from merely analyzing complex
multi-dimensional simulations. An explosion condition presents a clear diagnostic to explain
why stars explode, and the turbulence model allows us to explore how turbulence enables explosion.
Though we find that turbulent dissipation is a significant contributor to successful supernova
explosions, it is important to note that this work is to some extent qualitative. Therefore, we suggest
ways to further verify and validate our predictions with multi-dimensional simulations.
