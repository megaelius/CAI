We present a new set of high-resolution hydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations that apply
the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) physics to both Local Group (LG)-like and isolated
Milky Way (MW)-like volumes (ten host systems in total with baryonic particle mass $\simeq 3,500-7,000\,M_\odot$).
We study the stellar mass functions, circular velocity or mass profiles, and velocity dispersions
of the dwarf galaxy populations. The simulations reproduce the stellar mass function and central
densities of MW satellite dwarfs for $M_\ast \geq10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ and predict the existence
of $\sim3$ unidentified galaxies with $M_\ast\sim10^5\,M_\odot$ within $300$ kpc of the MW. Overall,
we find no evidence for the classical missing satellites or too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problems for
satellite galaxies in our sample. Among the satellites, TBTF is resolved primarily by subhalo disruption
and overall mass loss; central density profiles of subhalos are of secondary importance. For non-satellite
galaxies, our LG-like simulations predict as many as $\sim10$ as-of-yet unseen galaxies at distances
$0.3-1$ Mpc from both hosts, with $M_\ast\simeq10^{5-6}\,M_\odot$ (in halos with $V_\mathrm{max}\sim
20~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$), albeit with large halo-to-halo variance. None of our simulations
produces a compact, baryon-dominated, high-density dwarf elliptical-type galaxy (with $V_\mathrm{circ}
\gtrsim 35~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $r<1\,$kpc), of which six may appear in the LG (but none in the
MW). It may therefore remain a challenge to reproduce the full diversity of the dwarf population,
including both the highest and lowest density systems.
