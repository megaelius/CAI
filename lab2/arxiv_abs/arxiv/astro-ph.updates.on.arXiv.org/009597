We study the properties of photochemical hazes in super-Earths/mini-Neptunes atmospheres with
particular focus on GJ1214b. We evaluate photochemical haze properties at different metallicities
between solar and 10000$\times$solar. Within the four orders of magnitude change in metallicity,
we find that the haze precursor mass fluxes change only by a factor of $\sim$3. This small diversity
occurs with a non-monotonic manner among the different metallicity cases, reflecting the interaction
of the main atmospheric gases with the radiation field. Comparison with relative haze yields at
different metallicities from laboratory experiments reveals a qualitative similarity with our
theoretical calculations and highlights the contributions of different gas precursors. Our haze
simulations demonstrate that higher metallicity results into smaller average particle sizes.
Metallicities at and above 100$\times$solar with haze formation yields of $\sim$10$\%$ provide
enough haze opacity to satisfy transit observation at visible wavelengths and obscure sufficiently
the H$_2$O molecular absorption features between 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.7 $\mu$m. However, only the highest
metallicity case considered (10000$\times$solar) brings the simulated spectra into closer agreement
with transit depths at 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m indicating a high contribution of CO/CO$_2$ in GJ1214b's
atmosphere. We also evaluate the impact of aggregate growth in our simulations, in contrast to spherical
growth, and find that the two growth modes provide similar transit signatures (for D$_f$=2), but
with different particle size distributions. Finally, we conclude that the simulated haze particles
should have major implications for the atmospheric thermal structure and for the properties of
condensation clouds.
