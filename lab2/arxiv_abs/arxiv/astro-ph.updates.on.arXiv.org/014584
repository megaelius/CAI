We present a $\sim$130 ks observation of the prototypical wind-accreting, high-mass X-ray binary
Vela X-1 collected with XMM-Newton at orbital phases between 0.12 and 0.28. A strong flare took place
during the observation that allows us to investigate the reaction of the clumpy stellar wind to the
increased X-ray irradiation. To examine the wind's reaction to the flare, we performed both time-averaged
and time-resolved analyses of the RGS spectrum and examined potential spectral changes. We focused
on the high-resolution XMM-Newton RGS spectra and divided the observation into pre-flare, flare,
and post-flare phases. We modeled the time-averaged and time-resolved spectra with phenomenological
components and with the self-consistent photoionization models calculated via CLOUDY and XSTAR
in the pre-flare phase, where strong emission lines due to resonant transitions of highly ionized
ions are seen. In the spectra, we find emission lines corresponding to K-shell transitions in highly
charged ions of oxygen, neon, magnesium, and silicon as well as radiative recombination continua
(RRC) of oxygen. Additionally, we observe potential absorption lines of magnesium at a lower ionization
stage and features identified as iron L lines. The CLOUDY and XSTAR photoionization models provide
contradictory results, either pointing towards uncertainties in theory or possibly a more complex
multi-phase plasma, or both. We are able to demonstrate the existence of a plethora of variable narrow
features, including the firm detection of oxygen lines and RRC that RGS enables to observe in this
source for the first time. We show that Vela X-1 is an ideal source for future high-resolution missions,
such as XRISM and Athena.
