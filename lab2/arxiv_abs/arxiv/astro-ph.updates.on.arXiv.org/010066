Determination of the specific angular momentum radial profile, $j(r)$, in the early stages of star
formation is crucial to constrain star and circumstellar disk formation theories. The specific
angular momentum is directly related to the largest Keplerian disk radius possible, and it can be
used to constrain the mechanism for angular momentum removal. We present the determination of the
specific angular momentum radial profile towards 2 Class 0 objects and a first hydrostatic core
candidate in the Perseus molecular cloud. We find $j(r)$ is consistent across all three sources
and well fit with a single power-law relation between 800 and 10,000au: $j_{fit}(r)=10^{-3.60\pm0.15}\left(r/\textrm{1,000au}\right)^{1.80\pm0.04}$
km s$^{-1}$ pc. This power-law relation is between solid body rotation ($\propto r^2$) and pure
turbulence ($\propto r^{1.5}$). This strongly suggests that even at scales of 1,000au, the influence
of the dense core's initial level of turbulence or the connection between core and the molecular
cloud is still present. The specific angular momentum at 10,000au is approximately three times
higher than previously estimated; at 1,000au it is lower by a factor of 2. We do not find a region of
conserved specific angular momentum, but it could still be present at a smaller radius. We use the
power-law best fit to the data at 1,000au to estimate an upper limit to the largest Keplerian disk
radius of 60au, which is small but consistent with published limits. Finally, these results suggest
that more realistic initial conditions for numerical simulations of disk formation are needed.
Possible solutions to achieve this goal include: a) use a larger simulation box to include some level
of driven turbulence or connection to the parental molecular cloud, or b) incorporate the observed
specific angular momentum profile to setup the initial conditions of the dense core kinematics.
