The abundances derived from planetary nebula emission show the presence of a metallicity gradient
within the disk of the Milky Way up to Galactocentric distances of ~10 kpc, which are consistent with
findings from studies of different types of sources, including H II regions and young B-type stars.
The radial dependence of these abundances further from the Galactic centre is in dispute. We aim
to derive the abundances of neon, sulphur and argon from a sample of planetary nebulae towards the
Galactic anti-centre, which represent the abundances of the clouds from which they were formed,
as they remain unchanged throughout the course of stellar evolution. We then aim to compare these
values with similarly analysed data from elsewhere in the Milky Way in order to observe whether the
abundance gradient continues in the outskirts of our Galaxy. We have observed 23 planetary nebulae
at Galactocentric distances of 8-21 kpc with Spitzer IRS. The abundances were calculated from infrared
emission lines, for which we observed the main ionisation states of neon, sulphur, and argon, which
are little affected by extinction and uncertainties in temperature measurements or fluctuations
within the planetary nebula. We have complemented these observations with others from optical
studies in the literature, in order to reduce or avoid the need for ionisation correction factors
in abundance calculations. The overall abundances of our sample of planetary nebulae in the Galactic
anti-centre are lower than those in the solar neighbourhood. The abundances of neon, sulphur, and
argon from these stars are consistent with a metallicity gradient from the solar neighbourhood
up to Galactocentric distances of ~20 kpc, albeit with varying degrees of dispersion within the
data.
