We present new GALEX images and optical spectroscopy of J1229+02, a dwarf post-starburst galaxy
located 81 kpc from the 1585 km/s absorber in the 3C 273 sight line. The absence of H\alpha\ emission
and the faint GALEX UV fluxes confirm that the galaxy's recent star formation rate is $<10^{-3}
M_{\odot}$/yr. Absorption-line strengths and the UV-optical SED give similar estimates of the
acceptable model parameters for its youngest stellar population where $f_m$ < 60% of its total
stars (by mass) formed in a burst $t_sb$ = 0.7-3.4 Gyr ago with a stellar metallicity of -1.7 < [Fe/H]
< +0.2; we also estimate the stellar mass of J1229+02 to be 7.3 < log($M_*/M_{\odot}$) <
7.8. Our previous study of J1229+02 found that a supernova-driven wind was capable of expelling
all of the gas from the galaxy (none is observed today) and could by itself plausibly create the nearby
absorber. But, using new data, we find a significantly higher galaxy/absorber velocity difference,
a younger starburst age, and a smaller starburst mass than previously reported. Simple energy-conserving
wind models for J1229+02 using fiducial values of $f_m$ ~ 0.1, $t_sb$ ~ 2 Gyr, and log(M$_*/M_{\odot}$)
~ 7.5 allow us to conclude that the galaxy alone cannot produce the observed QSO absorber; i.e., any
putative ejecta must interact with ambient gas from outside J1229+02. Because J1229+02 is located
in the southern extension of the Virgo cluster ample potential sources of this ambient gas exist.
Based on the two nearest examples of strong metal-line absorbers discovered serendipitously (the
current one and the 1700 km/s metal-line absorber in the nearby Q1230+0115 sight line), we conclude
that absorbers with $10^{14} < N_{HI} < 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ at impact parameters >1$R_{vir}$
are likely intergalactic systems and cannot be identified unambiguously as the circumgalactic
material of any one individual galaxy.
