The stellar disk of the Milky Way shows complex spatial and abundance structure that is central to
understanding the key physical mechanisms responsible for shaping our Galaxy. In this study, we
use six very high resolution cosmological zoom simulations of Milky Way-sized haloes - the Auriga
simulations - to study the prevalence and formation of chemically distinct disc components. We
find that our simulations develop a clearly bimodal distribution in the $[\rm \alpha/Fe]$ -- $[\rm
Fe/H]$ plane. We find two main pathways to creating this dichotomy which operate in different regions
of the galaxies: a) an early ($z>1$) and intense high-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ star formation phase in
the inner region ($R\lesssim 5$ kpc) induced by gas-rich mergers, followed by more quiescent low-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$
star formation; and b) an early phase of high-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ star formation in the outer disc
followed by a contraction and re-expansion of the gas disc owing to a temporary decrease in gas accretion
rate. In process b), a double-peaked star formation history around the time and radius of disc contraction
accentuates the dichotomy. Simulations in which the early phase of star formation is prolonged
rather than short and intense follow the same sequence as process a) in the inner region, but the dichotomy
becomes less clear. In the outer region, the abundance bimodality is only evident if the first intense
burst of star formation covers a large enough radial range before disc contraction occurs; otherwise,
the outer disc consists of only low-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ sequence stars. We discuss the implication
that both processes occurred in the Milky Way.
