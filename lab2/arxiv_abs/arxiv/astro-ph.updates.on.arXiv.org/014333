Investigating the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets is key to performing comparative planetology
between these worlds and the terrestrial planets that reside in the inner solar system. Terrestrial
exoplanet atmospheres exhibit weak signals, and attempting to detect them pushes at the boundaries
of what is possible for current instrumentation. We focus on the habitable-zone terrestrial exoplanet
LHS 1140b. Given its 25-day orbital period and 2 hr transit duration, capturing transits of LHS 1140b
is challenging. We observed two transits of this object, approximately 1 yr apart, which yielded
four data sets thanks to our simultaneous use of the IMACS and LDSS3C multiobject spectrographs
mounted on the twin Magellan telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory. We present a jointly fit white
light curve, as well as jointly fit 20 nm wavelength-binned light curves from which we construct
a transmission spectrum. Binning the joint white light-curve residuals to 3-minute time bins gives
an rms of 145 ppm; binning down to 10-minute time bins gives an rms of 77 ppm. Our median uncertainty
in Rp^2/Rs^2 in the 20 nm wavelength bins is 260 ppm, and we achieve an average precision of 1.3x the
photon noise when fitting the wavelength-binned light curves with a Gaussian process regression.
Our precision on Rp^2/Rs^2 is a factor of four larger than the feature amplitudes of a clear, hydrogen-dominated
atmosphere, meaning that we are not able to test realistic models of LHS 1140b's atmosphere. The
techniques and caveats presented here are applicable to the growing sample of terrestrial worlds
in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite era, as well as to the upcoming generation of ground-based
giant segmented mirror telescopes.
