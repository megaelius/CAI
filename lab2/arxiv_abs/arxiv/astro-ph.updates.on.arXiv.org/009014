To correctly model the abundances of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in different
environments, both formation and destruction routes should be appropriately accounted for. While
several scenarios have been explored for the formation of iCOMs via grain and gas-phase processes,
much less work has been devoted to understanding the relevant destruction pathways, with special
reference to (dissociative) charge exchange or proton transfer reactions with abundant atomic
and molecular ions such as He$^+$, H$_3^+$ and HCO$^+$. By using a combined experimental and theoretical
methodology we provide new values for the rate coefficients and branching ratios (BRs) of the reactions
of He$^+$ ions with two important iCOMs, namely dimethyl ether (DME) and methyl formate (MF). We
also review the destruction routes of DME and MF by other two abundant ions, namely H$_3^+$ and HCO$^+$.
Based on our recent laboratory measurements of cross sections and BRs for the DME/MF + He$^+$ reactions
over a wide collision energy range, we extend our theoretical insights on the selectivity of the
microscopic dynamics to calculate the rate coefficients $k(T)$ in the temperature range from 10
to 298 K. We implement these new and revised kinetic data in a general model of cold and warm gas, simulating
environments where DME and MF have been detected. Due to stereodynamical effects present at low
collision energies, the rate coefficients, BRs and temperature dependences here proposed differ
substantially from those reported in KIDA and UDfA, two of the most widely used astrochemical databases.
These revised rates impact the predicted abundances of DME and MF, with variations up to 40% in cold
gases and physical conditions similar to those present in prestellar cores
