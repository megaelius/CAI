The Flora family resides in the densely populated inner main belt, bounded in semimajor axis by the
$\nu_6$ secular resonance and the Jupiter 3:1 mean motion resonance. The presence of several large
families that overlap dynamically with the Floras (e.g., the Vesta, Baptistina, and Nysa-Polana
families), and the removal of a significant fraction of Floras via the nearby $\nu_6$ resonance
complicates the Flora family's distinction in both proper orbital elements and reflectance properties.
Here we use orbital information from the Asteroids Dynamic Site, color information from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, and albedo information from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to obtain
the median orbital and reflectance properties of the Floras by sampling the core of the family in
multidimensional phase space. We find the median Flora SDSS colors to be $a^*$ = 0.126 $\pm$ 0.007
and $i-z = -0.037 \pm 0.007$; the median Flora albedo is $p_V$ = 0.291 $\pm$ 0.012. These properties
allow us to define ranges for the Flora family in orbital and reflectance properties, as required
for a detailed dynamical study. We use the young Karin family, for which we have an age determined
via direct backward integration of members' orbits, to calibrate the Yarkovsky drift rates for
the Flora family without having to estimate the Floras' material properties. The size-dependent
dispersion of the Flora members in semimajor axis (the "V" plot) then yields an age for the family
of $910^{+160}_{-120}$ My, with the uncertainty dominated by the uncertainty in the material properties
of the family members (e.g., density and surface thermal properties). We discuss the effects on
our age estimate of two independent processes that both introduce obliquity variations among the
family members on short (My) timescales: 1) the capture of Flora members in spin-orbit resonance,
and 2) YORP-driven obliquity variation.
