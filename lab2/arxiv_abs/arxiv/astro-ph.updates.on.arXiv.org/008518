All magnetized planets are known to produce intense non thermal radio emissions through a mechanism
known as Cyclotron Maser Instability (CMI), requiring the presence of accelerated electrons generally
arising from magnetospheric current systems. In return, radio emissions are a good probe of these
current systems and acceleration processes. The CMI generates highly anisotropic emissions and
leads to important visibility effects, which have to be taken into account when interpreting the
data. Several studies showed that modeling the radio source anisotropic beaming pattern can reveal
a wealth of physical information about the planetary or exoplanetary magnetospheres that produce
these emissions. We present a numerical tool, called ExPRES (Exoplanetary and Planetary Radio
Emission Simulator), which is able to reproduce the occurrence in time-frequency plane of CMI-generated
radio emissions from planetary magnetospheres, exoplanets or star-planet interacting systems.
Special attention is given to the computation of the radio emission beaming at and near its source.
We explain what physical information about the system can be drawn from such radio observations,
and how it is obtained. These information may include the location and dynamics of the radio sources,
the type of current system leading to electron acceleration and their energy and, for exoplanetary
systems, the magnetic field strength, the orbital period of the emitting body and the rotation period,
tilt and offset of the planetary magnetic field. Most of these parameters can be remotely measured
only via radio observations. The ExPRES code provides the proper framework of analysis and interpretation
for past (Cassini, Voyager, Galileo), current (Juno, groundbased radiotelescopes) and future
(BepiColombo, Juice) observations of planetary radio emissions, as well as for future detection
of radio emissions from exoplanetary systems.
