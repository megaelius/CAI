Resonant lines are powerful probes of the interstellar and circumgalactic medium of galaxies.
Their transfer in gas being a complex process, the interpretation of their observational signatures,
either in absorption or in emission, is often not straightforward. Numerical radiative transfer
simulations are needed to accurately describe the travel of resonant line photons in real and in
frequency space, and to produce realistic mock observations. This paper introduces RASCAS, a new
public 3D radiative transfer code developed to perform the propagation of any resonant line in numerical
simulations of astrophysical objects. RASCAS was designed to be easily customisable and to process
simulations of arbitrarily large sizes on large supercomputers. RASCAS performs radiative transfer
on an adaptive mesh with an octree structure using the Monte Carlo technique. RASCAS features full
MPI parallelisation, domain decomposition, adaptive load-balancing, and a standard peeling
algorithm to construct mock observations. The radiative transport of resonant line photons through
different mixes of species (e.g. \ion{H}{i}, \ion{Si}{ii}, \ion{Mg}{ii}, \ion{Fe}{ii}), including
their interaction with dust, is implemented in a modular fashion to allow new transitions to be easily
added to the code. RASCAS is very accurate and efficient. It shows perfect scaling up to a minimum
of a thousand cores. It has been fully tested against radiative transfer problems with analytic
solutions and against various test cases proposed in the literature. Although it was designed to
describe accurately the many scatterings of line photons, RASCAS may also be used to propagate photons
at any wavelength (e.g. stellar continuum or fluorescent lines), or to cast millions of rays to integrate
the optical depths of ionising photons, making it highly versatile.
