We present Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation, or BAGPIPES,
a new Python tool which can be used to rapidly generate complex model galaxy spectra and to fit these
to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric data using the MultiNest nested sampling
algorithm. We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star-formation histories (SFHs)
by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We then perform
a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9289 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar
masses, $M_* > 10^{10}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ and redshifts $0.25 < z < 3.75$. The majority of our sample
exhibit SFHs which rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly, over $1{-}2$ Gyr. This behaviour
is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback
in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. At $z > 1$ we also find a class
of objects with SFHs which rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching timescales of $< 1$ Gyr, consistent
with quasar-mode AGN feedback. Finally, at $z < 1$ we find a population with SFHs which quench more
slowly than they rise, over $>3$ Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of diminishing overall cosmic
gas supply. We confirm the mass-accelerated evolution (downsizing) trend, and a trend towards
more rapid quenching at higher stellar masses. However, our results suggest that the latter is a
natural consequence of mass-accelerated evolution, rather than a change in quenching physics
with stellar mass. We find $61\pm8$ per cent of $z > 1.5$ massive quenched galaxies undergo significant
further evolution by $z = 0.5$. BAGPIPES is available at https://bagpipes.readthedocs.io
