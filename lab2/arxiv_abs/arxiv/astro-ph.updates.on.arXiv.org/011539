The second observational campaign of gravitational waves organized by the LIGO/Virgo Collaborations
has led to several breakthroughs such as the detection of gravitational wave signals from merger
systems involving black holes or neutrons stars. During O2,14 gravitational wave alerts were sent
to the astronomical community with sky regions covering mostly over hundreds of square degrees.
Among them, 6 have been finally confirmed as real astrophysical events. Since 2013, a new set of ground-based
robotic telescopes called GWAC and its pathfinder mini-GWAC have been developed to contribute
to the various challenges of themulti-messenger and time domain astronomy. The GWAC system is built
up in the framework of the ground-segment system of the SVOM mission that will be devoted to the study
of the multi-wavelength transient sky in the next decade. During O2, only the mini-GWAC telescopenetwork
was fully operational. Due to the wide field of view and fast automatic follow-up capabilities of
the mini-GWAC telescopes, they were well adapted to efficiently cover the sky localization areas
of the gravitational wave event candidates. In this paper, we present the mini-GWAC pipeline we
have set up to respond to the GW alerts and we report our optical follow-up observations of 8 GW alerts
detected during the O2 run. Our observations provided the largest coverage of the GW localization
areas in a short latency made by any optical facility. We found tens of optical transient candidates
in our images, but none of those could be securely associated with any confirmed black hole-black
hole merger event. Based on this first experience and the near future technical improvements of
our network system, we will be more competitive to detect the optical counterparts from some gravitational
wave events that will be detected during the upcoming O3 run, especially those emerging from binary
neutron star mergers.
