We provide a systematic description of the steps necessary -- and of the potential pitfalls to be
encountered -- when implementing a two-moment scheme within an Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) scheme
to include radiative-transfer contributions in numerical simulations of general-relativistic
(magneto-)hydrodynamics. We make use of the M1 closure, which provides an exact solution for the
optically thin and thick limit, and an interpolation between these limits for the intermediate
region. Special attention is paid to the efficient solution of the emerging set of implicit conservation
equations. In particular, we present an efficient method for solving these equations via the inversion
of a $4\times 4$-matrix within an IMEX scheme. While this method relies on a few approximations,
it offers a very good compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. After a large number
of tests in special relativity, we couple our new radiation code, \texttt{FRAC}, with the general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics code \texttt{BHAC} to investigate the radiative Michel solution, namely,
the problem of spherical accretion onto a black hole in the presence of a radiative field. By performing
the most extensive exploration of the parameter space for this problem, we find that the accretion's
efficiency can be expressed in terms of physical quantities such as temperature, $T$, luminosity,
$L$, and black-hole mass, $M$, via the expression $\varepsilon=(L/L_{\rm Edd})/(\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm
Edd})= 7.41\times 10^{-7}\left( T/10^6\,\mathrm{K} \right)^{0.22} \left( L/L_\odot \right)^{0.48}
\left( M/M_\odot \right)^{0.48}$, where $L_{\rm Edd}$ and $\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ are the Eddington
luminosity and accretion rate, respectively. Finally, we also consider the accretion problem
away from spherical symmetry, finding that the solution is stable under perturbations in the radiation
field.
