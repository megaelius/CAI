Scalar field models play an essential role in describing various phases of the universe evolution.
A survey of literature reports that various potentials have been studied in the past couple of years.
Now, with successive developments in the observational cosmology, it becomes essential to test
their viabilities with the universe evolution. Thus, being motivated, here we consider a varieties
of quintessence scalar field models in a homogeneous and isotropic geometry of the universe with
zero spatial curvature aiming to provide stringent constraints using a series of astronomical
data sets, namely, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO), redshift space distortions (RSD), joint light curve analysis (JLA) from Supernovae Type
Ia and the Hubble parameter measurements from the cosmic chronometers (CC). From the qualitative
evolution of the models, we find all of them are able to execute a fine transition from the past decelerating
phase to the presently accelerating expansion where in addition, the equation of state of the scalar
field (also the effective equation of state) might be close to that of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
depending on its free parameters. From the statistical analysis, we find that within 68\% CL, the
observational data always allow a constant potential. We also find that for all the models a strong
negative correlation between the parameters ($H_0$, $\Omega_{m0}$) exists, while the parameters
($H_0$, $\sigma_8$) are not correlated. We also comment that the present models are unable to reconcile
the tension on $H_0$. Finally, we conclude our work with the Bayesian analyses which report that
the non-interacting $\Lambda$CDM model is preferred over all the quintessence scalar field models.
