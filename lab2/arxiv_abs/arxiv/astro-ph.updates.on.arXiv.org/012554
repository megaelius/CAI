We explore the burst energy distribution of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in the low-twist magnetar model
of Wadiasingh and Timokhin (2019). Motivated by the power-law fluence distributions of FRB 121102,
we propose an elementary model for the FRB luminosity function of individual repeaters with an inversion
protocol which directly relates the power-law distribution index of magnetar short burst fluences
to that for FRBs. The protocol indicates the FRB energy scales virtually linearly with crust/field
dislocation amplitude, if magnetar short bursts prevail in the magnetoelastic regime. Charge
starvation in the magnetosphere during bursts (required in WT19) for individual repeaters implies
the predicted burst fluence distribution is narrow, $\lesssim 3$ decades for yielding strains
and oscillation frequencies feasible in magnetar crusts. Requiring magnetic confinement and
charge starvation, we obtain a death line for FRBs which segregates magnetars from the normal pulsar
population, suggesting only the former will host recurrent FRBs. We convolve the burst energy distribution
for individual magnetars to define the distribution of luminosities in evolved magnetar populations.
The broken power-law luminosity function's low energy character depends on the population model,
while the high energy index traces that of individual repeaters. Independent of the evolved population,
the broken power-law isotropic-equivalent energy/luminosity function peaks at $\sim10^{37}-10^{40}$
erg with a low-energy cutoff at $\sim 10^{37}$ erg. Lastly, we consider the local fluence distribution
of FRBs, and find that it can constrain the subset of FRB-producing magnetar progenitors. Our model
suggests that improvements in sensitivity may reveal flattening of the global FRB fluence distribution
and saturation in FRB rates.
