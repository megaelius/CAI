We propose a new machine learning approach to Stokes inversion based on a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and the Milne-Eddington (ME) method. The Stokes measurements used in this study were taken
by the Near InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) on the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope (GST)
at the Big Bear Solar Observatory. By learning the latent patterns in the training data prepared
by the physics-based ME tool, the proposed CNN method is able to infer vector magnetic fields from
the Stokes profiles of GST/NIRIS. Experimental results show that our CNN method produces smoother
and cleaner magnetic maps than the widely used ME method. Furthermore, the CNN method is 4~6 times
faster than the ME method, and is able to produce vector magnetic fields in near real-time, which
is essential to space weather forecasting. Specifically, it takes ~50 seconds for the CNN method
to process an image of 720 x 720 pixels comprising Stokes profiles of GST/NIRIS. Finally, the CNN-inferred
results are highly correlated to the ME-calculated results and are closer to the ME's results with
the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) being closer to 1 on average than those
from other machine learning algorithms such as multiple support vector regression and multilayer
perceptrons (MLP). In particular, the CNN method outperforms the current best machine learning
method (MLP) by 2.6% on average in PPMCC according to our experimental study. Thus, the proposed
physics-assisted deep learning-based CNN tool can be considered as an alternative, efficient
method for Stokes inversion for high resolution polarimetric observations obtained by GST/NIRIS.
