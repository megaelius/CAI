The nature and physical properties of asteroids, in particular those orbiting in the near-Earth
space, are of scientific interest and practical importance. Exoplanet surveys can be excellent
resources to detect asteroids, both already known and new objects. This is due their similar observing
requirements: large fields of view, long sequences, and short cadence. If the targeted fields are
not located far from the ecliptic, many asteroids will cross occasionally the field of view. We present
two complementary methodologies to identify asteroids serendipitously observed in large-area
astronomical surveys. One methodology focuses on detecting already known asteroids using the
Virtual Observatory tool SkyBoT, which predicts their positions and motions in the sky at a specific
epoch. The other methodology applies the ssos pipeline, which is able to identify known and new asteroids
based on their apparent motion. The application of these methods to the 6.4 deg 2 of the sky covered
by the Wide-Field CAMera Transit Survey in the J-band is described. We identified 15 661 positions
of 1 821 different asteroids. Of them, 182 are potential new discoveries. A publicly accessible
online, Virtual Observatory compliant catalogue was created. We obtained the shapes and periods
for five of our asteroids from their light-curves built with additional photometry taken from external
archives. We demonstrated that our methodologies are robust and reliable approaches to find, at
zero cost of observing time, asteroids observed by chance in astronomical surveys. Our future goal
is to apply them to other surveys with adequate temporal coverage.
