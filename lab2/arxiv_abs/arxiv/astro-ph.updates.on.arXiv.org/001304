Main sequence stars, like the Sun, are often found to be orbited by circumstellar material that can
be categorized into two groups, planets and debris. The latter is made up of asteroids and comets,
as well as the dust and gas derived from them, which makes debris disks observable in thermal emission
or scattered light. These disks may persist over Gyrs through steady-state evolution and/or may
also experience sporadic stirring and major collisional breakups, rendering them atypically
bright for brief periods of time. Most interestingly, they provide direct evidence that the physical
processes (whatever they may be) that act to build large oligarchs from micron-sized dust grains
in protoplanetary disks have been successful in a given system, at least to the extent of building
up a significant planetesimal population comparable to that seen in the Solar System's asteroid
and Kuiper belts. Such systems are prime candidates to host even larger planetary bodies as well.
The recent growth in interest in debris disks has been driven by observational work that has provided
statistics, resolved images, detection of gas in debris disks, and discoveries of new classes of
objects. The interpretation of this vast and expanding dataset has necessitated significant advances
in debris disk theory, notably in the physics of dust produced in collisional cascades and in the
interaction of debris with planets. Application of this theory has led to the realization that such
observations provide a powerful diagnostic that can be used not only to refine our understanding
of debris disk physics, but also to challenge our understanding of how planetary systems form and
evolve.
