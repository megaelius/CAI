Soar filament eruptions are often associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
which are the major impacts on space weather. However, the fine structures and the trigger mechanisms
of solar filaments are still unclear. To address these issues, we studied a failed solar active-region
filament eruption associated with a C-class flare by using high-resolution H$\alpha$ images from
the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), supplemented by EUV observations of the Solar Dynamical
Observatory (SDO). Before the filament eruption, a small bi-pole magnetic field emerged below
the filament. And then magnetic reconnection between the filament and the emerging bi-pole magnetic
field triggered the filament eruption. During the filament eruption, the untwisting motion of
the filament can be clearly traced by the eruptive threads. Moreover, the foot-points of the eruptive
threads are determined by tracing the descending filament materials. Note that the filament twisted
structure and the right part of the eruptive filament threads cannot be seen before the filament
eruption. These eruptive threads at the right part of the filament are found to be rooting in the weak
negative polarities near the main negative sunspot. Moreover, a new filament formed in the filament
channel due to material injection from the eruptive filament. The above observations and the potential
field extrapolations are inclined to support that the filament materials were transferred into
the overlying magnetic loops and the nearby filament channel by magnetic reconnection. These observations
shed light on better understanding on the complexity of filament eruptions.
