The alignment of dust grains with the ambient magnetic field produces polarization of starlight
as well as thermal dust emission. Using the archival SOFIA/HAWC+ polarimetric data observed toward
$\rho$ Ophiuchus (Oph) A cloud hosted by a B association at 89 $\mu$m and 154 $\mu$m, we find that the
fractional polarization of thermal dust emission first increases with the grain temperature and
then decreases once the grain temperature exceeds $\simeq$ 32-34 K. The latter trend differs from
the prediction of the popular RAdiative Torques (RATs) alignment theory which implies a monotonic
increase of the polarization fraction with the grain temperature. We perform numerical modeling
of polarized dust emission for the $\rho$ Oph-A cloud and calculate the degree of dust polarization
by simultaneously considering the dust grain alignment and rotational disruption by RATs. Our
modeling results could successfully reproduce both the rising and declining trends of the observational
data. Moreover, we show that the alignment of only silicate grains or a mixture of silicate-carbon
grains within a composite structure can reproduce observations, assuming that all dust grains
follow a power-law size distribution. Our results suggest grains in molecular clouds to have a composite
structure. The grain size distribution has slope $\beta<-3.5$, which is steeper than the standard
size distribution for the interstellar medium. This could arise from the disruption effect of large
grains that enhances the amount of smaller grains. Combination of SOFIA/HAWC+ data with observations
at longer wavelengths at 450 $\mu$m and 850 $\mu$m with the JCMT facility would be useful to test the
proposed scenario based on grain alignment and disruption by RATs.
