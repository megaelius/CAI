The upcoming radio interferometer Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is expected to directly detect
the redshifted 21-cm signal from the neutral hydrogen present during the Cosmic Dawn. Temperature
fluctuations from X-ray heating of the neutral intergalactic medium can dominate the fluctuations
in the 21-cm signal from this time. This heating depends on the abundance, clustering, and properties
of the X-ray sources present, which remain highly uncertain. We present a suite of three new large-volume,
349\,Mpc a side, fully numerical radiative transfer simulations including QSO-like sources,
extending the work previously presented in Ross et al. (2017). The results show that our QSOs have
a modest contribution to the heating budget, yet significantly impact the 21-cm signal. Initially,
the power spectrum is boosted on large scales by heating from the biased QSO-like sources, before
decreasing on all scales. Fluctuations from images of the 21-cm signal with resolutions corresponding
to SKA1-Low at the appropriate redshifts are well above the expected noise for deep integrations,
indicating that imaging could be feasible for all the X-ray source models considered. The most notable
contribution of the QSOs is a dramatic increase in non-Gaussianity of the signal, as measured by
the skewness and kurtosis of the 21-cm probability distribution functions. However, in the case
of late Lyman-$\alpha$ saturation, this non-Gaussianity could be dramatically decreased particularly
when heating occurs earlier. We conclude that increased non-Gaussianity is a promising signature
of rare X-ray sources at this time, provided that Lyman-$\alpha$ saturation occurs before heating
dominates the 21-cm signal.
