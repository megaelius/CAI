Strong [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007+H$\beta$ emission appears to be typical in star-forming
galaxies at z > 6.5. As likely contributors to cosmic reionization, these galaxies and the physical
conditions within them are of great interest. At z > 6.5, where Ly$\alpha$ is greatly attenuated
by the intergalactic medium, rest-UV metal emission lines provide an alternative measure of redshift
and also constraints on the physical properties of star-forming regions and massive stars. We present
the first statistical sample of rest-UV line measurements in z $\sim$ 2 galaxies selected as analogs
of those in the reionization era based on [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 EW or rest-frame U-B
color. Our sample is drawn from the 3D-HST Survey and spans the redshift range 1.36 $\leqslant$ z
$\leqslant$ 2.49. We find that the median Ly$\alpha$ and CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,1909 EWs
of our sample are significantly greater than those of z $\sim$ 2 UV-continuum-selected star-forming
galaxies. Measurements from both individual and composite spectra indicate a monotonic, positive
correlation between CIII] and [OIII], while a lack of trend is observed between Ly$\alpha$ and [OIII]
at [OIII] EW < 1000$\unicode{x212B}$. At higher [OIII] EW, extreme Ly$\alpha$ emission starts
to emerge. Using stacked spectra, we find that Ly$\alpha$ and CIII] are significantly enhanced
in galaxies with lower metallicity. Two objects in our sample appear comparable to z > 6.5 galaxies
with exceptionally strong rest-UV metal line emission. These objects have significant CIV$\lambda\lambda$1548,1550,
HeII$\lambda$1640, and OIII]$\lambda\lambda$1661,1665 emission in addition to intense Ly$\alpha$
or CIII]. Detailed characterization of these lower-redshift analogs provides unique insights
into the physical conditions in z > 6.5 star-forming regions, motivating future observations of
reionization-era analogs at lower redshifts.
