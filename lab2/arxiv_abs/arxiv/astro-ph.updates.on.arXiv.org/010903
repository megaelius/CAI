Within $\Lambda$CDM, dwarf galaxies like the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are expected to host
numerous dark matter subhalos, several of which should host faint dwarf companions. Recent Gaia
proper motions confirm new members of the LMC-system in addition to the previously known SMC, including
two classical dwarf galaxies ($M_\ast$ > $10^5$ M$_{\odot}$; Carina and Fornax) as well as several
ultra-faint dwarfs (Car2, Car3, Hor1, and Hyd1). We use the Feedback In Realistic Environments
(FIRE) simulations to study the dark and luminous (down to ultrafaint masses, $M_\ast$ ~ $6\times10^3$
M$_{\odot}$) substructure population of isolated LMC-mass hosts ($M_\text{200}$ = $1-3\times10^{11}$
M$_{\odot}$) and place the Gaia + DES results in a cosmological context. By comparing number counts
of subhalos in simulations with and without baryons, we find that, within 0.2 $r_\text{200}$, LMC-mass
hosts deplete ~30% of their substructure, significantly lower than the ~70% of substructure depleted
by Milky Way (MW) mass hosts. For our highest resolution runs ($m_\text{bary}$ = 880 M$_{\odot}$),
~5-10 subhalos form galaxies with $M_\ast$ > $10^4$ M$_{\odot}$, in agreement with the 7 observationally
inferred pre-infall LMC companions. However, we find steeper simulated luminosity functions
than observed, hinting at observation incompleteness at the faint end. The predicted DM content
for classical satellites in FIRE agrees with observed estimates for Carina and Fornax, supporting
the case for an LMC association. We predict that tidal stripping within the LMC potential lowers
the inner dark matter density of ultra faint companions of the LMC. Thus, in addition to their orbital
consistency, the low densities of dwarfs Car2, Hyd1, and Hyd2 reinforce their likelihood of Magellanic
association.
