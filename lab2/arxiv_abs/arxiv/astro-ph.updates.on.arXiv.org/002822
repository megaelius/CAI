Intermediate-mass, magnetic chemically peculiar (Ap) stars provide a unique opportunity to study
the topology of stellar magnetic fields in detail and to investigate magnetically driven processes
of spot formation. Here we aim to derive the surface magnetic field geometry and chemical abundance
distributions for the extraordinary Ap star HD 75049. This object hosts a surface field of ~30 kG,
one of the strongest known for any non-degenerate star. We used time-series of high-resolution
HARPS intensity and circular polarisation observations. These data were interpreted with the
help of magnetic Doppler imaging and model atmospheres incorporating effects of a non-solar chemical
composition and a strong magnetic field. We refined the rotational period of HD 75049 to Prot=4.048267+/-0.000036
d. We also derived basic stellar parameters, Teff=10250+/-250 K and logg=4.3+/-0.1. Magnetic
Doppler imaging revealed that the field topology of HD 75049 is poloidal and dominated by a dipolar
contribution with a peak surface field strength of 39 kG. At the same time, deviations from the classical
axisymmetric oblique dipolar configuration are significant. Chemical surface maps of Si, Cr,
Fe, and Nd show abundance contrasts of 0.5-1.4 dex, which is low compared with many other Ap stars.
Nd is found to be enhanced close to the magnetic pole, whereas Si and Cr are concentrated predominantly
at the magnetic equator. The iron distribution shows low-contrast features both at the magnetic
equator and the pole. The morphology of the magnetic field and the properties of chemical spots in
HD 75049 are qualitatively similar to those of Ap stars with weaker fields. Consequently, whatever
mechanism forms and sustains global magnetic fields in intermediate-mass main-sequence stars,
it operates in the same way over the entire observed range of magnetic field strengths.
