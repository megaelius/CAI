Galaxy interactions are often accompanied by an enhanced star formation rate (SFR). Since molecular
gas is essential for star formation, it is vital to establish whether, and by how much, galaxy interactions
affect the molecular gas properties. We investigate the effect of interactions on global molecular
gas properties by studying a sample of 58 galaxies in pairs and 154 control galaxies. Molecular gas
properties are determined from observations with the JCMT, PMO, CSO telescopes, and supplemented
with data from the xCOLD GASS and JINGLE surveys at $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(2-1). The SFR,
gas mass ($M_\mathrm{H_{2}}$), and gas fraction ($f_{gas}$) are all enhanced in galaxies in pairs
by $\sim$ 2.5 times compared to the controls matched in redshift, mass, and effective radius, while
the enhancement of star formation efficiency (SFE $\equiv$ SFR/$M_{H_{2}}$) is less than a factor
of 2. We also find that the enhancements in SFR, $M_{H_{2}}$ and $f_{gas}$ increase with decreasing
pair separation and are larger in systems with smaller stellar mass ratio. Conversely, the SFE is
only enhanced in close pairs (separation $<$ 20 kpc) and equal-mass systems; therefore most galaxies
in pairs lie in the same parameter space on the SFR-$M_{H_{2}}$ plane as controls. This is the first
time that the dependence of molecular gas properties on merger configurations is probed statistically
with a relatively large sample and with a carefully-selected control sample for individual galaxies.
We conclude that galaxy interactions do modify the molecular gas properties, although the strength
of the effect is merger configuration dependent.
