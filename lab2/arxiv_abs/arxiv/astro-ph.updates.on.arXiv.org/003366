Internal dissipation in a tidally perturbed librating body differs from the tidal dissipation
in a steadily spinning rotator. First, libration changes the spectral distribution of tidal damping
across the tidal modes, as compared to the case of steady spin. This changes both the tidal heating
rate and the tidal torque. Second, while a non-librating rotator experiences alternating deformation
only due to the potential force exerted on it by the perturber, a librating body is also subject to
a toroidal force proportional to the angular acceleration. Third, while the centrifugal force
in a steadily spinning body renders only a permanent deformation, in a librating body this force
contains two alternating components $-$ one radial, another a degree-2 potential force. Both contribute
to heating, as well as to the tidal torque and potential. We build a formalism to describe dissipation
in a homogeneous terrestrial body performing small-amplitude libration in longitude. This formalism
incorporates a linear rheological law defining the response of the material to forcing. While the
formalism can work with an arbitrary linear rheology, we consider a simple example of a Maxwell material.
We show that, independent of rheology, the forced libration in longitude can provide a considerable
and even leading input in the tidal heating. Based on the observed parameters, this input amounts
to 52% in Phobos, 33% in Mimas, 23% in Enceladus, and 96% in Epimetheus. This supports the hypothesis
by Makarov & Efroimsky (2014) that the additional damping due to forced libration may have participated
in the early heating up of some moons. As one possibility, a moon could have been chipped by collisions
$-$ whereby it acquired a higher triaxiality and a higher forced-libration magnitude and, consequently,
a higher heating rate. After the moon warms up, its triaxiality reduces, and so does the tidal heating.
