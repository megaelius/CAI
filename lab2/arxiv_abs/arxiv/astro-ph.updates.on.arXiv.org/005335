The H2O abundance of a planetary atmosphere is a powerful indicator of formation conditions. Inferring
H2O in the solar system giant planets is challenging, due to condensation depleting the upper atmosphere
of water vapour. Substantially warmer hot Jupiter exoplanets readily allow detections of H2O via
transmission spectroscopy, but such signatures are often diminished by the presence of clouds
made of other species. In contrast, highly scattering H2O clouds can brighten planets in reflected
light, enhancing molecular signatures. Here, we present an extensive parameter space survey of
the prominence of H2O absorption features in reflection spectra of cool (Teff<400K) giant exoplanetary
atmospheres. The impact of effective temperature, gravity, metallicity, and sedimentation efficiency
is explored. We find prominent H2O features around 0.94um, 0.83um, and across a wide spectral region
from 0.4-0.73um. The 0.94um feature is only detectable where high-altitude water clouds brighten
the planet: T~150K, g>~20m/s^2, fsed>~3, m<~10xsolar. In contrast, planets with g<~20m/s^2 and
T>~180K display prominent H2O features embedded in the Rayleigh slope from 0.4-0.73um. High fsed
enhances H2O features around 0.94um, and enables them to be detected at lower temperatures. High
m results in dampened H2O absorption features, due to H2O vapour condensing to form bright optically
thick clouds that dominate the continuum. We verify these trends via self-consistent modelling
of the low gravity exoplanet HD 192310c, revealing that its reflection spectrum is expected to be
dominated by H2O absorption from 0.4-0.73um for m<~10xsolar. Our results demonstrate that H2O
is manifestly detectable in reflected light spectra of cool giant planets only marginally warmer
than Jupiter, providing an avenue to directly constrain the C/O and O/H ratios of a hitherto unexplored
population of exoplanetary atmospheres.
