Explaining the observed diversity of supernovae (SNe) and the physics of explosion requires knowledge
of their progenitor stars, which can be obtained by constraining the circumstellar medium (CSM).
Models of the SN ejecta colliding with CSM are necessary to infer the structure of the CSM and tie it
back to a progenitor model. Recent SNe I revealed CSM concentrated at a distance $r\sim10^16$ cm,
for which models of SN interaction are extremely limited. In this paper, we assume the concentrated
region is a "wall" representing swept-up material, and unswept material lies outside the wall.
We simulate one-dimensional hydrodynamics of SNe Ia & Ib impacting 300 unique CSM configurations
using RT1D, which captures the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We find that the density ratio between
the wall and ejecta -- denoted $A_0$ or "wall height" -- is key, and higher walls deviate more from
self-similar evolution. Functional fits accounting for $A_0$ are presented for the forward shock
radius evolution. We show that higher walls have more degeneracy between CSM properties in the deceleration
parameter, slower shocks, deeper-probing reverse shocks, slower shocked ejecta, less ejecta
mass than CSM in the shock, and more mixing of ejecta into the CSM at early times. We analyze observations
of SN 2014C (Type Ib) and suggest that it had a moderately high wall ($10 < A_0 < 200$) and wind-like
outer CSM. We also postulate an alternate interpretation for the radio data of SN 2014C, that the
radio rise occurs in the wind rather than the wall. Finally, we find that hydrodynamic measurements
at very late times cannot distinguish the presence of a wall, except perhaps as an anomalously wide
shock region.
