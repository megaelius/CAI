We explore the impacts of ultraviolet (UV) radiation feedback on galaxies during the epoch of reionisation
by cosmological simulations in which hydrodynamics and the transfer of the H and He ionising photons
are consistently coupled. Moreover we take into account H_2 non-equilibrium chemistry, including
photo-dissociation. The most striking feature of the simulations is a high spatial resolution
for the radiative transfer (RT) calculation which enables us to start considering not only external
UV feedback processes but also internal UV feedback processes in each galaxy. We find that the star
formation is significantly suppressed due to the internal UV and supernova (SN) feedback. In low
mass galaxies with M<10^9Msun, a large amount of gas is evacuated by photo-evaporation as previous
studies have shown, which results in the suppression of star formation. Surprisingly, star formation
in massive halos is also strongly suppressed despite the fact that these halos hardly lose any gas
by photo-evaporation. The suppression of star formation in massive halos is mainly caused by following
two factors; (i) small scale clumpy structures in the galaxies are smoothened by the internal feedback,
(ii) although the dense gas in the galaxies is mostly neutral, the H_2 formation and cooling processes
are disturbed by mild photo-heating. Photo-dissociating radiations actually suppress star formation,
but the magnitude of the effect is not so large in massive galaxies. Even though our simulation volume
is too small to be a representative patch of the Universe during reionisation, we find that our simulated
star formation rate densities and HI fractions at z=6-7 are consistent with those found in observations.
