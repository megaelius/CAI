We constrain the mass--richness scaling relation of redMaPPer galaxy clusters identified in the
Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data using weak gravitational lensing. We split clusters into $4\times3$
bins of richness $\lambda$ and redshift $z$ for $\lambda\geq20$ and $0.2 \leq z \leq 0.65$ and measure
the mean masses of these bins using their stacked weak lensing signal. By modeling the scaling relation
as $\langle M_{\rm 200m}|\lambda,z\rangle = M_0 (\lambda/40)^F ((1+z)/1.35)^G$, we constrain
the normalization of the scaling relation at the 5.0 per cent level as $M_0 = [3.081 \pm 0.075 ({\rm
stat}) \pm 0.133 ({\rm sys})] \cdot 10^{14}\ {\rm M}_\odot$ at $\lambda=40$ and $z=0.35$. The richness
scaling index is constrained to be $F=1.356 \pm 0.051\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.008\ ({\rm sys})$ and the
redshift scaling index $G=-0.30\pm 0.30\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.06\ ({\rm sys})$. These are the tightest
measurements of the normalization and richness scaling index made to date. We use a semi-analytic
covariance matrix to characterize the statistical errors in the recovered weak lensing profiles.
Our analysis accounts for the following sources of systematic error: shear and photometric redshift
errors, cluster miscentering, cluster member dilution of the source sample, systematic uncertainties
in the modeling of the halo--mass correlation function, halo triaxiality, and projection effects.
We discuss prospects for reducing this systematic error budget, which dominates the uncertainty
on $M_0$. Our result is in excellent agreement with, but has significantly smaller uncertainties
than, previous measurements in the literature, and augurs well for the power of the DES cluster survey
as a tool for precision cosmology and upcoming galaxy surveys such as LSST, Euclid and WFIRST.
