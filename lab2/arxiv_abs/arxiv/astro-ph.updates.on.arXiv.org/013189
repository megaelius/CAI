The standard explanation for galaxy spin starts with the tidal-torque theory (TTT), in which an
ellipsoidal dark-matter protohalo, which comes to host the galaxy, is torqued up by the tidal gravitational
field around it. We discuss a complementary picture, using the relatively familiar velocity field,
instead of the tidal field, whose intuitive connection to the surrounding, possibly faraway matter
arrangement is more obscure. In this 'spin from primordial inner motions' (SPIM) concept, implicit
in TTT derivations but not previously emphasized, the angular momentum from the gravity-sourced
velocity field inside a protohalo largely cancels out, but has some excess from the aspherical outskirts.
At first, the net spin scales according to linear theory, a sort of comoving conservation of familiar
angular momentum. Then, at collapse, it is conserved in physical coordinates. Small haloes are
then typically subject to secondary exchanges of angular momentum. The TTT is useful for analytic
estimates. But a literal interpretation of the TTT is inaccurate in detail, without some implicit
concepts about smoothing of the velocity and tidal fields. This could lead to misconceptions, for
those first learning about how galaxies come to spin. Protohaloes are not perfectly ellipsoidal
and do not uniformly torque up, as in a naive interpretation of the TTT; their inner velocity fields
retain substantial dispersion. Furthermore, quantitatively, given initial conditions and protohalo
boundaries, SPIM is more direct and accurate than the TTT to predict halo spins. We also discuss how
SPIM applies to rotating filaments, and the relation between halo mass and spin, in which the total
spin of a halo can be thought of as a sum of random contributions.
