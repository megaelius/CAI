The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched almost 19 years ago and has been delivering spectacular
science over the course of its mission. The Advanced CCD Imager Spectrometer is the prime instrument
on the satellite, conducting over 90% of the observations. The CCDs operate at a temperature of -120
C and the optical blocking filter in front of the CCDs is at a temperature of approximately -60C. The
surface of the OBF has accumulated a layer of contamination over the course of the mission. We have
been characterizing the thickness, chemical composition, and spatial distribution of the contamination
layer as a function of time over the mission. All three have exhibited significant changes with time.
There has been a dramatic decrease in the accumulation rate of the contaminant starting in 2017.
The lower accumulation rate may be due to a decrease in the deposition rate or an increase in the vaporization
rate or a combination of the two. We show that the current calibration file which models the additional
absorption of the contamination layer is significantly overestimating that additional absorption
by using the standard model spectrum for the supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219 developed by the International
Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration. In addition, spectral data from the cluster
of galaxies known as Abell 1795 and the Blazar Markarian 421 are used to generate a model of the absorption
produced by the contamination layer. The Chandra X-ray Center calibration team is preparing a revised
calibration file that more accurately represents the complex time dependence of the accumulation
rate, the spatial dependence, and the chemical composition of the contaminant. Given the rapid
changes in the contamination layer over the past year, future calibration observations at a higher
cadence will be necessary to more accurately monitor such changes.
