Understanding the relation between underlying matter distribution and biased tracers such as
galaxy or dark matter halo is essential to extract cosmological information from ongoing or future
galaxy redshift surveys. At sufficiently large scales such as the BAO scale, a standard approach
for the bias problem on the basis of the perturbation theory (PT) is to assume the `local bias' model
in which the density field of biased tracers is deterministically expanded in terms of matter density
field at the same position. The higher-order bias parameters are then determined by combining the
power spectrum with higher-order statistics such as the bispectrum. As is pointed out by recent
studies, however, nonlinear gravitational evolution naturally induces nonlocal bias terms even
if initially starting only with purely local bias. As a matter of fact, previous works showed that
the second-order nonlocal bias term, which corresponds to the gravitational tidal field, is important
to explain the characteristic scale-dependence of the bispectrum. In this paper we extend the nonlocal
bias term up to third order, and investigate whether the PT-based model including nonlocal bias
terms can simultaneously explain the power spectrum and the bispectrum of simulated halos in $N$-body
simulations. We show that the power spectrum, including density and momentum, and the bispectrum
between halo and matter in $N$-body simulations can be simultaneously well explained by the model
including up to third-order nonlocal bias terms up to k~0.1h/Mpc. Also, the results seem in a good
agreement with theoretical predictions of a simple coevolution picture, although the agreement
is not perfect. These demonstration clearly shows a failure of the local bias model even at such large
scales, and we conclude that nonlocal bias terms should be consistently included in order to model
statistics of halos. [abridged]
