We present the stellar velocity maps of 25 massive galaxies located in dense environments observed
with MUSE. Galaxies are selected to be brighter than M_K=-25.7 magnitude, reside in the core of the
Shapley Super Cluster or be the brightest galaxy in clusters richer than the Virgo Cluster. We thus
targeted galaxies more massive than 10^12 Msun and larger than 10 kpc (half-light radius). The velocity
maps show a large variety of kinematic features: oblate-like regular rotation, kinematically
distinct cores and various types of non-regular rotation. The kinematic misalignment angles show
that massive galaxies can be divided into two categories: those with small or negligible misalignment,
and those with misalignment consistent with being 90 degrees. Galaxies in this latter group, comprising
just under half of our galaxies, have prolate-like rotation (rotation around the major axis). Among
the brightest cluster galaxies the incidence of prolate-like rotation is 57 per cent, while for
a magnitude limited sub-sample of objects within the Shapley Super Cluster (mostly satellites),
35 per cent of galaxies show prolate-like rotation. Placing our galaxies on the mass - size diagram,
we show that they all fall on a branch extending almost an order of magnitude in mass and a factor of
5 in size from the massive end early-type galaxies, previously recognised as associated with major
dissipation-less mergers. The presence of galaxies with complex kinematics and, particularly,
prolate-like rotators suggests, according to current numerical simulations, that the most massive
galaxies grow predominantly through dissipation-less equal-mass mergers.
