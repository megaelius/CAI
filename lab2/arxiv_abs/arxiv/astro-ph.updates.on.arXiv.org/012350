Planets form in protoplanetary discs. Their masses, distribution, and orbits sensitively depend
on the structure of the protoplanetary discs. However, what sets the initial structure of the discs
in terms of mass, radius and accretion rate is still unknown. We perform non-ideal MHD numerical
simulations using the adaptive mesh refinement code Ramses, of a collapsing, one solar mass, molecular
core to study the disc formation and early, up to 100 kyr, evolution, paying great attention to the
impact of numerical resolution and accretion scheme. We found that while the mass of the central
object is almost independent of the numerical parameters such as the resolution and the accretion
scheme onto the sink particle, the disc mass, and to a lower extent its size, heavily depend on the
accretion scheme, which we found, is itself resolution dependent. This implies that the accretion
onto the star and through the disc are largely decoupled. For a relatively large domain of initial
conditions (except at low magnetisation), we found that the properties of the disc do not change
too significantly. In particular both the level of initial rotation and turbulence do not influence
the disc properties provide the core is sufficiently magnetized. After a short relaxation phase,
the disc settles in a stationary state. It then slowly grows in size but not in mass. The disc itself
is weakly magnetized but its immediate surrounding is on the contrary highly magnetized. Our results
show that the disc properties directly depend on the inner boundary condition, i.e. the accretion
scheme onto the central object, suggesting that the disc mass is eventually controlled by the small
scale accretion process, possibly the star-disc interaction. Because of ambipolar diffusion
and its significant resistivity, the disc diversity remains limited and except for low magnetisation,
their properties are (abridged).
