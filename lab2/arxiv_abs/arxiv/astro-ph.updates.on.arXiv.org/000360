We present a study of the luminosity density distribution of the Galactic bar using number counts
of red clump giants (RCGs) from the OGLE-III survey. The data were recently released by \citet{Nat12}
for 9019 fields towards the bulge and have $2.94\times 10^6$ RC stars over a viewing area of $90.25
\,\textrm{deg}^2$. The data include the number counts, mean distance modulus ($\mu$), dispersion
in $\mu$ and full error matrix. We fit the data with several tri-axial parametric models, after excluding
the bad sightlines, $2.65\times 10^6$ RC stars are remaining with the sky coverage of $81.47 \,\textrm{deg}^2$.
We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to explore the parameter space and find that the
best-fit model is close to exponential ($E_2$ model), with the distance to the GC is 8.17 kpc, the
ratio of semi-major and semi-minor bar axis scale lengths in the Galactic plane $x_{0},y_{0}$,
and vertical bar scale length $z_0$, is $x_0:y_0:z_0 \approx 1.00:0.41:0.38$ (close to being prolate).
The bar major axis is $\sim$ 0.68 kpc and has an angle of between $29^\circ$ and $32^\circ$, slightly
larger than the value obtained from a similar study based on OGLE-II data. The number of estimated
RC stars is $2.51 \times 10^6$, which is systematically lower than the observed value. We subtract
the smooth parametric model from the observed counts and find that the residuals are consistent
with the presence of an X-shaped structure in the Galactic centre, the excess to the estimated mass
content is $\sim 5.3%$. The results can be used as a key ingredient to construct new density models
of the Milky Way and will have implications on the predictions of the optical depth to gravitational
microlensing and the patterns of hydrodynamical gas flow in the Milky Way.
