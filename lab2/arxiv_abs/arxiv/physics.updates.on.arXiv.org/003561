One of the acceptable methods for modelling the seismic source characteristics is through point-source
simplification. Although this simplification causes a substantial disparity from the real convoluted
nature of an earthquake source process, it can lead to a framework for retrieval of the rupture geometry
and source time function. In this study, we exploited point-source approximation compatible with
the rupture process for modelling the predominant faulting geometry caused by the initiation of
Khaki seismic sequence. First, all recorded earthquakes over six months after the main shock, 2013
April 9th, in vicinity of khaki anticline, near to city of Shonbeh, were relocated implementing
the probabilistic nonlinear method based on Bayesian inference. The synthetic test was done having
on hand the exact distribution of real stations. Thus the proper value for the parameter that can
explicitly affect the error results was modeled to be 0.01. After performing relocation task, 98
relocated events with horizontal errors of less than 5 km from all 373 recorded events were taken
into account for further analysis of the spatial characteristics of the sequence. In advance, point
source inversion was implemented for 21 events greater than 4.5 Mn. Then, supplementary investigations
and stability test were performed for the results of the main shock. Thus, we were convinced that
the gathered results are reliable enough to be used for the seismotectonic analysis of the region
resulted by the sequence. Eventually the reverse slip vector with substantial left-lateral strike
slip component (in some cases) was modeled exploiting the distribution of inverted centroids and
resulted faulting geometry for the chosen events. A southward dip of the probable causative fault
was seen, furthermore depth range of the rupture was localized ranging from 8 to 12 Km in the lowermost
part of the sedimentary cover.
