Can we hear the sound of our brain? Is there any technique which can enable us to hear the neuro-electrical
impulses originating from the different lobes of brain? The answer to all these questions is YES.
In this paper we present a novel method with which we can sonify the Electroencephalogram (EEG) data
recorded in rest state as well as under the influence of a simplest acoustical stimuli - a tanpura
drone. The tanpura drone has a very simple yet very complex acoustic features, which is generally
used for creation of an ambiance during a musical performance. Hence, for this pilot project we chose
to study the correlation between a simple acoustic stimuli (tanpura drone) and sonified EEG data.
Till date, there have been no study which deals with the direct correlation between a bio-signal
and its acoustic counterpart and how that correlation varies under the influence of different types
of stimuli. This is the first of its kind study which bridges this gap and looks for a direct correlation
between music signal and EEG data using a robust mathematical microscope called Multifractal Detrended
Cross Correlation Analysis (MFDXA). For this, we took EEG data of 10 participants in 2 min 'rest state'
(i.e. with white noise) and in 2 min 'tanpura drone' (musical stimulus) listening condition. Next,
the EEG signals from different electrodes were sonified and MFDXA technique was used to assess the
degree of correlation (or the cross correlation coefficient) between tanpura signal and EEG signals.
The variation of {\gamma}x for different lobes during the course of the experiment also provides
major interesting new information. Only music stimuli has the ability to engage several areas of
the brain significantly unlike other stimuli (which engages specific domains only).
