Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) technology is being considered for the forward muon upgrade of the
CMS experiment in Phase 2 of the CERN LHC. Its first implementation is planned for the GE1/1 system
in the $1.5 < \mid\eta\mid < 2.2$ region of the muon endcap mainly to control muon level-1 trigger
rates after the second long LHC shutdown. A GE1/1 triple-GEM detector is read out by 3,072 radial
strips with 455 $\mu$rad pitch arranged in eight $\eta$-sectors. We assembled a full-size GE1/1
prototype of 1m length at Florida Tech and tested it in 20-120 GeV hadron beams at Fermilab using Ar/CO$_{2}$
70:30 and the RD51 scalable readout system. Four small GEM detectors with 2-D readout and an average
measured azimuthal resolution of 36 $\mu$rad provided precise reference tracks. Construction
of this largest GEM detector built to-date is described. Strip cluster parameters, detection efficiency,
and spatial resolution are studied with position and high voltage scans. The plateau detection
efficiency is [97.1 $\pm$ 0.2 (stat)]\%. The azimuthal resolution is found to be [123.5 $\pm$ 1.6
(stat)] $\mu$rad when operating in the center of the efficiency plateau and using full pulse height
information. The resolution can be slightly improved by $\sim$ 10 $\mu$rad when correcting for
the bias due to discrete readout strips. The CMS upgrade design calls for readout electronics with
binary hit output. When strip clusters are formed correspondingly without charge-weighting and
with fixed hit thresholds, a position resolution of [136.8 $\pm$ 2.5 stat] $\mu$rad is measured,
consistent with the expected resolution of strip-pitch/$\sqrt{12}$ = 131.3 $\mu$rad. Other $\eta$-sectors
of the detector show similar response and performance.
