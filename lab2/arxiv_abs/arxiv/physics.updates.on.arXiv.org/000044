In this paper, a novel approach for resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski debate is proposed, in which
the principle of special relativity is used to uniquely determine the light momentum formulation
for plane waves in a moving ideal uniform medium. Invariant forms of refractive index, phase velocity,
and group velocity are defined; an unconventional analysis of the relation between the group velocity
and Poynting vector is given. Fizeau running water experiment is re-analyzed as a support to the
Minkowski's momentum. It is shown by analysis of the plane-wave solutions that, (1) there may be
a pseudo-power flow when a medium moves, and the Poynting vector does not necessarily denote the
direction of real power flowing, (2) Minkowski's light momentum and energy constitute a Lorentz
four-vector in a form of single photon or single EM-field cell, and Planck constant is a Lorentz invariant,
(3) form-invariant Minkowski's stress tensor may have a simplest form of symmetry, and there is
no momentum transfer taking place between the plane wave and the medium, and (4) the moving medium
behaves as a so-called "negative index medium" when it moves opposite to the wave vector at a faster-than-dielectric
light speed. It is also shown by analysis of EM-field Lorentz transformations that, when a static
electric (magnetic) field moves in free space, neither Abraham's nor Minkowski's formulation
can correctly describe a real electromagnetic momentum; as an application of this principle, the
classical electron mass-energy paradox is analyzed and resolved. Finally, a general EM momentum
definition is proposed, and according to this new definition, the traditional "Abraham-type"
and "Minkowski-type" momentums in the dispersion wave-guiding systems, such as regular dielectric-filled
metallic waveguides, are found to be included in the same momentum formulation, but they appear
at different frequencies.
