Low power photon upconversion (UC) based on sensitized triplet-triplet annihilation (sTTA) is
considered as the most promising upwards wavelength-shifting technique to enhance the light harvesting
capability of solar devices by recovering the low-energy tail of the solar spectrum. Semiconductor
nanocrystals (NCs) with conjugated organic ligands have been proposed as broadband sensitizers
for extending the light-harvesting capability of sTTA-UC molecular absorbers. Key to their functioning
is efficient energy transfer (ET) from the NC to the triplet state of the ligands that sensitizes
the triplet state of free emitters, whose annihilation generates the upconverted emission. To
date, the triplet sensitization efficiency in such systems is limited by parasitic processes,
such as charge transfer (typically of the photohole) to the organic ligand due to the disadvantageous
band alignment of typical NCs and organic moieties. Available strategies only partially mitigate
such losses and intrinsically limit the ET yield. Here we demonstrate a new exciton-manipulation
approach that enables loss-free ET without detrimental side-effects. Specifically, we use CdSe
NCs doped with gold atoms featuring a hole-accepting state in the NC bandgap at a higher energy than
the HOMO level of the ligand 9-anthracene acid. Upon photoexcitation, the NC photoholes are routed
to the Au-state faster than their transfer to the ligand, producing a long-lived bound exciton in
perfect resonance with its triplet state. This hinders hole-transfer losses and results in ~100%
efficient ET, over 50-fold higher than in standard NCs. By combining our hybrid sensitizers with
an annihilator moiety, we achieved an sTTA-UC efficiency of ~12% (~24% in the normalized definition),
which is the highest value for hybrid upconverters based on sTTA reported to date and approaches
optimized organic systems.
