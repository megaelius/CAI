In the theory of inflation, vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton phi are assumed to be seeds for the
structures observed in our universe. Here the observation is made that vacuum fluctuations and
pairs of virtual particles that reach the size of the Hubble horizon during inflation and are not
allowed by causality to vanish back into the vacuum, should densely populate the universe, especially
during the last e-folds of the inflationary epoch. In that case reheating may not be necessary and
there would be a smooth transition between inflation and the rest of the Big Bang. The fluctuation
and particle production from the vacuum diminishes V(phi) slowly with each e-fold, while at the
same time there are always more fluctuations and particles in the universe. Eventually radiation
dominates and inflation ends. Some of the inflaton potential V(phi) is left and exists even today.
After inflation, fluctuations and particles form a plasma, and the former appear as dark matter.
The smallness of energy density fluctuations in today's universe simply reflects the smallness
of energy density fluctuations during the last e-folds of inflation, and not the value of a single
inflaton fluctuation. Fluctuations that exited the horizon during inflation eventually reenter
it, in which case they are again causally connected and have a probability of undergoing the inverse
of the quantum process they underwent before and return to the vacuum, their energy going back to
the potential V(phi). This is the same as dark matter turning into dark energy and eventually the
universe begins to accelerate. The inflaton rules the expansion of the world: in the form of fluctuations
of phi it is dark matter, in the form of a condensate V(phi) with (pressure equals minus density) it
is dark energy.
