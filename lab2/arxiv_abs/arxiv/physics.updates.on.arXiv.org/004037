Suspension flows are ubiquitous in nature (hemodynamics, subsurface fluid mechanics, etc.) and
industrial applications (hydraulic fracturing, CO$_2$ storage, etc.). However, such flows are
notoriously difficult to model due to the variety of fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions
that can occur. In this work, we focus on non-Brownian shear-dominated suspensions, where kinetic
collisions are negligible and frictional effects play a dominant role. Under these circumstances,
irreversible phenomena such as particle diffusion and migration arise, requiring anisotropic
stress models to describe the suspension rheology. On a continuum level, reduced-order models
such as the suspension balance model (SBM) or the diffusive flux model are commonly used to predict
particle migration phenomena. We propose a new method based on a two-fluid model (TFM), where both
the phases are considered as interpenetrating continua with their own conservation of mass and
momentum equations. Without employing the nowadays customary simplifications in applying the
SBM, we close the ``full'' TFM instead. Specifically, we show that when an anisotropic stress analogous
to that used in the SBM is added to the equilibrium equations for the particle phase, the TFM is able
to accurately predict particle migration. Thus, the TFM does not require the assumptions of a steady
suspension velocity and a Stokesian (inertialess) fluid, and the TFM can be easily extended to include
buoyancy and even kinetic collisional models. We present several benchmark simulations of our
TFM implementation in OpenFOAM{\textsuperscript\textregistered}, including in curvilinear
coordinates and three-dimensional flow. Good agreement between the TFM solutions and previous
experimental and numerical results is found.
