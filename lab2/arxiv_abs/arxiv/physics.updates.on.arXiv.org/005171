Maunakea, the proposed site of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), is a lightning-rod topic for Native
Hawaiians, Hawaii residents, and the international astronomy community. In this paper we, Native
Hawaiian natural scientists and allies, identify historical decisions that impact current circumstances
on Maunakea and provide approaches to acknowledging their presence. Our aim is to provide an Indigenous
viewpoint centered in Native Hawaiian perspectives on the impacts of the TMT project on the Hawaiian
community. We summarize the current Maunakea context from the perspective of the authors who are
trained in the natural sciences (inclusive of and beyond astronomy and physics), the majority of
whom are Native Hawaiian or Indigenous. We highlight three major themes in the conflict surrounding
TMT: 1) physical demonstrations and the use of law enforcement against the protectors of Maunakea;
2) an assessment of the benefit of Maunakea astronomy to Native Hawaiians; and 3) the disconnect
between astronomers and Native Hawaiians. We close with general short- and long- term recommendations
for the astronomy community, which represent steps that can be taken to re-establish trust and engage
in meaningful reciprocity and collaboration with Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous communities.
Our recommendations are based on established best principles of free, prior, and informed consent
and researcher-community interactions that extend beyond transactional exchanges. We emphasize
that development of large-scale astronomical instrumentation must be predicated on consensus
from the local Indigenous community about whether development is allowed on their homelands. Proactive
steps must be taken to center Indigenous voices in the earliest stages of project design.
