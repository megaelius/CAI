Intersubband optoelectronic devices rely on transitions between quantum-confined electron
levels in semiconductor heterostructures, which enables infrared (IR) photodetection in the
1-30 $\mu$m wavelength window with picosecond response times. Incorporating nanowires as active
media could enable an independent control over the electrical cross-section of the device and the
optical absorption cross-section. Furthermore, the three-dimensional carrier confinement
in nanowire heterostructures opens new possibilities to tune the carrier relaxation time. However,
the generation of structural defects and the surface sensitivity of GaAs nanowires have so far hindered
the fabrication of nanowire intersubband devices. Here, we report the first demonstration of intersubband
photodetection in a nanowire, using GaN nanowires containing a GaN/AlN superlattice absorbing
at 1.55 $\mu$m. The combination of spectral photocurrent measurements with 8-band k$\cdot$p calculations
of the electronic structure supports the interpretation of the result as intersubband photodetection
in these extremely short-period superlattices. We observe a linear dependence of the photocurrent
with the incident illumination power, which confirms the insensitivity of the intersubband process
to surface states and highlights how architectures featuring large surface-to-volume ratios
are suitable as intersubband photodetectors. Our analysis of the photocurrent characteristics
points out routes for an improvement of the device performance. This first nanowire based intersubband
photodetector represents a technological breakthrough that paves the way to a powerful device
platform with potential for ultrafast, ultrasensitive photodetectors and highly-efficient
quantum cascade emitters with improved thermal stability.
