Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of a recently proposed method for characterizing tear film dynamics
using non-invasive high speed videokeratoscopy in assessing the loss of homeostasis of tear film.
Methods: Thirty subjects, from a retrospective study, of which 11 were classified as dry eye and
19 as normal, were included. High speed videokeratoscopy measurements were performed using E300
videokeratoscope (Medmont Pty., Ltd, Melbourne, Australia). Raw data was analyzed using a recently
proposed method to estimate the dynamics of the tear film, based on a fractal dimension approach.
This method provides three time-varying indicators related to the regularity of the reflected
rings: Tear Film Surface Quality (TFSQ) indicator, Breaks Feature Indicator (BFI) and Distortions
Feature Indicator (DFI). From each indicator five parameters were extracted and analyzed, including
non-invasive break up time, mean value of the indicator in the stability phase, mean value of the
indicator in the whole inter blink interval, mean value of the indicator in the levelling phase and
the general trend of the time series. Receiver Operating Characteristic were used to determine
the sensitivity and specificity of each parameter in dry eye detection. Results: The best discrimination
performance between dry eye and normal subjects was achieved with the BFI non-invasive break up
time parameter, with an area under the curve of 0.85. For a cut off value of 10 s the sensitivity was
100% and the specificity 84%. Conclusions: The analyzed method improves the assessment of tear
film homeostasis in comparison to previous high speed videokeratoscopy methods showing higher
potential in assisting dry eye diagnosis.
