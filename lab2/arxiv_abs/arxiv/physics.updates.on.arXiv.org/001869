We review the basic concepts of magnetic reconnection and propose a general framework for the astrophysical
reconnection at large scales. Magnetic reconnection is the rearrangement of magnetic field topology.
The conventional Sweet-Parker scheme and some of its extensions presume a non-turbulent medium
and generally produce very slow reconnection or an unstable configuration. However, the assumption
of laminar flow is unrealistic in astrophysics since, even in an initially quiet environment, magnetic
reconnection by itself can drive turbulence. The resulting turbulence has the potential to enhance
the reconnection rate. This can lead to an unstable feedback loop as reconnection drives turbulence
and turbulence drives reconnection. Stochastic reconnection was proposed, and subsequently
tested by numerical simulations, for high $\beta$ plasmas with a magnetic Prandtl number of order
unity, $Pr_m\sim 1$. This model predicts reconnection speeds comparable to the large scale turbulent
eddy velocity. A recent study of stochastic reconnection for $Pr_m>1$ has shown that the width of
the outflow layer and the ejection velocity of matter from the reconnection region seem to be unaffected
by viscosity in typical astrophysical systems. However if $Pr_m>1$ viscosity can suppress small
scale reconnection events near and below the Kolmogorov or viscous damping scale. This will produce
a threshold for the suppression of large scale reconnection by viscosity when $Pr_m$ is larger than
the root of the Reynolds number, $Pr_m>\sqrt{Re}$. For $Pr_m>1$ this leads to the spectral index
$\sim-4/3$ for length scales between the viscous dissipation scale and eddies larger by roughly
$Pr_m^{3/2}$.
