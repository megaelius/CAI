In this study we focus on the control of the dynamics of 3D turbulent wake downstream a square-back
Ahmed body ($Re_H=3.9\times10^5$). The peculiar dynamics of such a wake is first characterized
through the trajectories of the pressure barycenter over the rear part of the model as well as the
recirculation barycenter in the wake. In particular it is shown that these dynamics allow the definition
of three different states: the two so-called reflectional symmetry-breaking (RSB) modes and the
transient symmetric (TS) mode. It was shown recently that the time-fluctuations of the pressure
barycenter could be characterized as a weak chaotic system with two well-defined attractors (the
two RSB modes). We show that the dynamics of the bimodal wake can then be forced into a stable asymmetric
or symmetric state in open loop control, using tangential continuous or pulsed blowing in three
different regions along the upper edge of the rear part of the model. Finally, a simple closed-loop
opposition control, based on real-time identification of the wake barycenter in the PIV fields,
is used to force the chaotic dynamics of the wake into a regular oscillatory motion at a well-controlled
frequency. Depending on the actuation parameters, the wake dynamics can also be switched from bimodal
to a new multimodal behavior. We show that this new mode also exhibits a peculiar dynamics with an
up-down instead of left-right chaotic oscillations. Interestingly, the recirculation area (size
of the recirculation bubble) is much more reduced for the closed-loop experiments when the jets
are pulsed rather than continuous. For the pulsed jets, the reduction is also increased when the
proper frequency is chosen.
