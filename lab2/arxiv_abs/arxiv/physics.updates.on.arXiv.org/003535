Rational large Reynolds number matched asymptotic expansions of three-dimensional nonlinear
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) states are concerned. The nonlinear MHD states, assumed to be predominantly
driven by a unidirectional shear, can be sustained without any linear instability of the base flow
and hence are responsible for subcritical transition to turbulence. Two classes of nonlinear MHD
states are found. The first class of nonlinear states emerged out of a nice combination of the purely
hydrodynamic vortex/wave interaction theory by Hall \& Smith (1991) and the resonant absorption
theories on Alfv\'en waves, developed in the solar physics community (e.g. Sakurai et al. 1991;
Goossens et al. 1995). Similar to the hydrodynamic theory, the mechanism of the MHD states can be
explained by the successive interaction of the roll, streak, and wave fields, which are now defined
both for the hydrodynamic and magnetic fields. The derivation of this `vortex/Alfv\'en wave interaction'
state is rather straightforward as the scalings for both of the hydrodynamic and magnetic fields
are identical. It turns out that the leading order magnetic field of the asymptotic states appears
only when a small external magnetic field is present. However, it does not mean that purely shear-driven
dynamos are not possible. In fact, the second class of `self-sustained shear driven dynamo theory'
shows the magnetic generation that is slightly smaller size in the absence of any external field.
Despite small size, the magnetic field causes the novel feedback mechanism in the velocity field
through resonant absorption, wherein the magnetic wave becomes more strongly amplified than the
hydrodynamic counterpart.
