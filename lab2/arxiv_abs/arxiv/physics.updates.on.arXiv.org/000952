Context. The structure and heating of coronal loops are investigated since decades. Established
scaling laws relate fundamental quantities like the loop apex temperature, pressure, length,
and the coronal heating. Aims. We test such scaling laws against a large-scale 3D MHD model of the
Solar corona, which became feasible with nowadays high-performance computing. Methods. We drive
an active region simulation a with photospheric observations and found strong similarities to
the observed coronal loops in X-rays and EUV wavelength. A 3D reconstruction of stereoscopic observations
showed that our model loops have a realistic spatial structure. We compare scaling laws to our model
data extracted along an ensemble of field lines. Finally, we fit a new scaling law that represents
well hot loops and also cooler structures, which was not possible before only based on observations.
Results. Our model data gives some support for scaling laws that were established for hot and EUV-emissive
coronal loops. For the RTV scaling law we find an offset to our model data, which can be explained by
1D considerations of a static loop with a constant heat input and conduction. With a fit to our model
data we set up a new scaling law for the coronal heat input along magnetic field lines. Conclusions.
RTV-like scaling laws were fitted to hot loops and therefore do not predict well the coronal heat
input for cooler structures that are hardly observable. The basic differences between 1D and self-consistent
3D modeling account for deviations between our and earlier scaling laws. We also conclude that a
heating mechanism by MHD-turbulent dissipation within a braided flux tube would heat the corona
stronger than consistent with our model corona.
