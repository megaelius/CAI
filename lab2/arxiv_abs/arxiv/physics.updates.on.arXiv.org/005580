Bertrand theorem permits closed orbits in 3d Euclidean space only for 2 types of central potentials.
These are of Kepler-Coulomb and harmonic oscillator type. Volker Perlick recently designed new
static spherically symmetric (Bertrand) spacetimes obeying Einstein's equations and supporting
closed orbits. In this work we demonstrate that the topology and geometry of these spacetimes permits
us to solve quantum many-body problem for any atom of periodic system exactly. The computations
of spectrum for any atom are analogous to that for hydrogen atom. Initially, the exact solution of
the Schr\"odinger equation for any multielectron atom (without reference to Bertrand theorem)
was obtained by Tietz in 1956. We recalculated Tietz results by applying the methodology consistent
with new (different from that developed by Fock in 1936) way of solving Schr\"odinger's equation
for hydrogen atom. By using this new methodology it had become possible to demonstrate that the Tietz-type
Schr\"odinger's equation is in fact describing the quantum motion in Bertrand spacetimes. As a
bonus, we solved analytically the L\"owdin's challenge problem. Obtained solution is not universal
though since there are exceptions of the Madelung rule in transition metals and among lanthanides
and actinides. Quantum mechanically these exceptions as well as the rule itself are treated thus
far with help of relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations. The obtained results do not describe
the exceptions in detail yet. However, studies outlined in this paper indicate that developed methods
are capable of describing exceptions as well. The paper ends with some remarks about usefulness
of problems of atomic physics for development of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory and (teleparallel)
gravity.
