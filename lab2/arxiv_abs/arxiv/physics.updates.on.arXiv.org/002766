The SFA (Strong-Field Approximation) is routinely cited as the standard analytical approximation
method for treatment of strong-field laser-induced processes. The difficulty with SFA is that
it is not well-defined. Some authors equate it with an alternative terminology -- KFR (Keldysh,
Faisal, Reiss) -- which is ambiguous, since the three source papers employ inequivalent approximations.
A rational system for naming strong-field approximation methods is developed here, beginning
with the Maxwell equations. When the dipole approximation is employed ab initio, the four source-free
Maxwell equations that apply to laser fields (i.e. propagating fields) are replaced by a single
Maxwell equation for an oscillatory electric field dependent on a virtual source current. The sole
approximation based on propagating fields is labeled "SPFA" (Strong Propagating-Field Approximation).
Dipole-approximation methods are labeled "SEFA" (Strong Electric-Field Approximation). Numerical
solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) is in the SEFA category. The SPFA
is found to have remarkably broad applicability. This is because it connects continuously into
relativistic results at both high and low frequencies, and because effects of a laser field are distinct
from those of an oscillatory electric field of the same frequency and amplitude even when the dipole
approximation is nominally valid. SPFA and SEFA methods approach equivalency at high frequencies
as long as conditions are nonrelativistic, but the SEFA becomes increasingly deficient as frequencies
decline into the mid-infrared and beyond. The major differences between SPFA and SEFA methods at
low frequencies are explained in physical terms. This elucidates why the failure of the dipole approximation
at low frequencies is so much more consequential than at high frequencies.
