We aim to monitor and characterize signals in the subsurface by combining these passive signals
with recorded reflection data at the surface of the Earth. To achieve this, we propose a method to
create virtual receivers from reflection data using the Marchenko method. By applying homogeneous
Green's function retrieval, these virtual receivers are then used to monitor the responses from
subsurface sources. We consider monopole point sources with a symmetric source signal, where the
full wavefield without artefacts in the subsurface can be obtained. Responses from more complex
source mechanisms, such as double-couple sources, can also be used and provide results with comparable
quality as the monopole responses. If the source signal is not symmetric in time, our technique that
is based on homogeneous Green's function retrieval provides an incomplete signal, with additional
artefacts. The duration of these artefacts is limited and they are only present when the source of
the signal is located above the virtual receiver. For sources along a fault rupture, this limitation
is also present and more severe due to the source activating over a longer period of time. Part of the
correct signal is still retrieved, as well as the source location of the signal. These artefacts
do not occur in another method which creates virtual sources as well as receivers from reflection
data at the surface. This second method can be used to forecast responses to possible future induced
seismicity sources (monopoles, double-couple sources and fault ruptures). This method is applied
to field data, where similar results to synthetic data are achieved, which shows the potential for
the application on real data signals.
