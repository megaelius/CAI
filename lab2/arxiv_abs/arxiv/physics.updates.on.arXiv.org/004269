Above a critical field strength, the free surface of an electrified, perfectly conducting viscous
liquid, such as a liquid metal, is known to develop an accelerating protrusion resembling a cusp
with a conic tip. Field self-enhancement from tip sharpening is reported to generate divergent
power law growth in finite time of the forces acting in that region. Previous studies have established
that tip sharpening proceeds via a self-similar process in two distinct limits - the Stokes regime
at $\textsf{Re}=0$ and the inviscid regime $\textsf{Re} \to \infty$. Using finite element simulations
to track the acceleration of an electrified protrusion in a perfectly conducting Newtonian liquid
in vacuum held at constant capillary number, we demonstrate that the conic tip \textit{always}
undergoes self-similar growth irrespective of Reynolds number. The computed blow up exponents
at the tip for the terms in the Navier-Stokes equation and interface normal stress condition reveal
the different forces at play as $\textsf{Re}$ increases. Rescaling of the tip shape by the capillary
stress exponent yields excellent collapse onto a universal conic tip shape with interior half-angle
dependent on the magnitude of the Maxwell stress. The rapid acceleration of the liquid interface
also generates a thin surface boundary layer with very high local strain rate. Additional details
of the modeled flow, applicable to cone growth in systems such as liquid metal ion sources, help dispel
prevailing misconceptions that dynamic cones resemble conventional Taylor cones or that viscous
stresses at finite $\textsf{Re}$ can be neglected.
