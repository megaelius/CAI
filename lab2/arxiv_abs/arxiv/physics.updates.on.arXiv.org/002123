A reliable inference of networks from data is of key interest in the Neurosciences. Several methods
have been suggested in the literature to reliably determine links in a network. To decide about the
presence of links, these techniques rely on statistical inference, typically controlling the
number of false positives, paying little attention to false negatives. In this paper, by means of
a comprehensive simulation study, we analyse the influence of false positive and false negative
conclusions about the presence or absence of links in a network on the network topology. We show that
different values to balance false positive and false negative conclusions about links should be
used in order to reliably estimate network characteristics. We propose to run careful simulation
studies prior to making potentially erroneous conclusion about the network topology. Our analysis
shows that optimal values to balance false positive and false negative conclusions about links
depend on the network topology and characteristic of interest. Existing methods rely on a choice
of the rate for false positive conclusions. They aim to be sure about individual links rather than
the entire network. The rate of false negative conclusions is typically not investigated. Our investigation
shows that the balance of false positive and false negative conclusions about links in a network
has to be tuned for any network topology that is to be estimated. Moreover, within the same network
topology, the results are qualitatively the same for each network characteristic, but the actual
values leading to reliable estimates of the characteristics are different.
