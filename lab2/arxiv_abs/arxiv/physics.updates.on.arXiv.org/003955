The strong light-matter coupling of a microcavity mode to tightly bound Frenkel excitons in organic
materials emerged as a versatile, room-temperature compatible platform to study nonlinear many-particle
physics and bosonic condensation. However, various aspects of the optical response of Frenkel
excitons in this regime remained largely unexplored. Here, we utilize a hemispheric optical cavity
filled with the fluorescent protein mCherry to address two important questions in the field of room-temperature
polariton condensates. First, combining the high quality factor of the microcavity with a well-defined
mode structure allows us to provide a definite answer whether temporal coherence in such systems
can become competitive with their low-temperature counterparts. We observe highly monochromatic
and coherent light beams emitted from the condensate, characterized by a coherence time greater
than 150$\,$ps, which exceeds the polariton lifetime by two orders of magnitude. Second, the high
quality of our device allows to sensibly trace the emission energy of the condensate, and thus to
establish a fundamental picture which quantitatively explains the core nonlinear processes yielding
the characteristic density-dependent blueshift. We find that the energy shift of Frenkel exciton-polaritons
is largely dominated by the reduction of the Rabi-splitting due to phase space filling effects,
which is influenced by the redistribution of polaritons in the system. While our finding of highly
coherent condensation at ambient conditions addresses the suitability of organic polaritonics
regarding their utilization as highly coherent room temperature polariton lasers, shedding light
on the non-linearity is of great benefit towards implementing non-linear devices, optical switches,
and lattices based on exciton-polaritons at room temperature.
