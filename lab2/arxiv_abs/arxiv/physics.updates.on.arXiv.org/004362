Kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) simulations are a well-established numerical tool to investigate the
time-dependent surface morphology in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) experiments. In parallel,
simplified approaches such as limited mobility (LM) models characterized by a fixed diffusion
length have been studied. Here, we investigate an extended LM model to gain deeper insight into the
role of diffusional processes concerning the growth morphology. Our model is based on the stochastic
transition rules of the Das Sarma-Tamborena (DT) model, but differs from the latter via a variable
diffusion length. A first guess for this length can be extracted from the saturation value of the
mean-squared displacement calculated from short KMC simulations. Comparing the resulting surface
morphologies in the sub- and multilayer growth regime to those obtained from KMC simulations, we
find deviations which can be cured by adding fluctuations to the diffusion length. This mimics the
stochastic nature of particle diffusion on a substrate, an aspect which is usually neglected in
LM models. We propose to add fluctuations to the diffusion length by choosing this quantity for each
adsorbed particle from a Gaussian distribution, where the variance of the distribution serves
as a fitting parameter. We show that the diffusional fluctuations have a huge impact on cluster properties
during submonolayer growth as well as on the surface profile in the high coverage regime. The analysis
of the surface morphologies on one- and two-dimensional substrates during sub- and multilayer
growth shows that the LM model can produce structures that are indistinguishable to the ones from
KMC simulations at arbitrary growth conditions.
