As long-baseline neutrino experiments enter the precision era, the difficulties associated with
understanding neutrino interaction cross sections on atomic nuclei are expected to limit experimental
sensitivities to oscillation parameters. In particular, the ability to relate experimental observables
to neutrino energy in previous experiments has relied solely on theoretical models of neutrino-nucleus
interactions, which currently suffer from very large theoretical uncertainties. By observing
charged current $\nu_\mu$ interactions over a continuous range of off-axis angles from 1 to 4 degrees,
the nuPRISM water Cherenkov detector can provide a direct measurement of the far detector lepton
kinematics for any given set of oscillation parameters, which largely removes neutrino interaction
modeling uncertainties from T2K oscillation measurements. This naturally provides a direct constraint
on the relationship between lepton kinematics and neutrino energy. In addition, nuPRISM is a sensitive
probe of sterile neutrino oscillations with multiple energy spectra, which provides unique constraints
on possible background-related explanations of the MiniBooNE anomaly. Finally, high-precision
measurements of neutrino cross sections on water are possible, including $\nu_e$ measurements
and the first ever measurements of neutral current interactions as a function of neutrino energy.
The nuPRISM detector also benefits the proposed Hyper-Kamiokande project. A demonstration that
neutrino interaction uncertainties can be controlled will be important to understanding the physics
reach of Hyper-K. In addition, nuPRISM will provide an easily accessible prototype detector for
many of the new hardware components currently under consideration for Hyper-K. The following document
presents the configuration, physics impact, and preliminary cost estimates for a nuPRISM detector
in the J-PARC neutrino beamline.
