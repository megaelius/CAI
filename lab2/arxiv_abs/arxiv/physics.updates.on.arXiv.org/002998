Experimental studies of protein pattern formation (both in vivo and in vitro) have stimulated new
interest in the dynamics of reaction--diffusion systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical
understanding of the dynamics of such highly nonlinear, spatially extended systems is still missing.
Here we show how a description in phase space, which has proven invaluable in shaping our intuition
about the dynamics of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, can be generalized to mass-conserving
reaction--diffusion (McRD) systems. We present a comprehensive theory for two-component McRD
systems, which serve as paradigmatic minimal systems that encapsulate the core principles and
concepts of our framework. The key insight is that shifting local chemical equilibria --- controlled
by the local total density --- give rise to concentration gradients that drive diffusive redistribution
of total density. This dynamic interplay can be embedded in the phase plane of the reaction kinetics
in terms of simple geometric objects: the reactive nullcline (line of chemical equilibria) and
the diffusive flux-balance subspace. On this phase-space level, physical insight can be gained
from geometric criteria and graphical constructions --- the effects of nonlinearities on the global
dynamics are simply encoded in the curved shape of the reactive nullcline. In particular, we show
that the pattern-forming 'Turing instability' in McRD systems is a mass-redistribution instability,
and that the features and bifurcations of patterns can be graphically determined by a flux-balance
construction on the reactive nullcline. The fundamental elements of the theory presented suggest
ways of experimentally characterizing pattern-forming systems on a mesoscopic level and are generalizable
to a broad class of spatially extended non-equilibrium systems, and thereby pave the way toward
an overarching theoretical framework.
