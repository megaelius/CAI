We fill a void in merging empirical and phenomenological characterisation of the dynamical phase
transitions in complex systems by identifying three, essentially different, dynamical phase
transitions on real-life financial markets driven by 'macrodynamics' of a superstar-like superhub.
We collect and interpret the empirical, numerical, and semi-analytical evidences for the existence
of these phase transtions, by considering the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE), as a typical example
of a financial market of a medium size. Using the canonical object for the graph theory, i.e. the Minimal
Spanning Tree (MST) network, we observe: (i) The initial phase transition from the equilibrium
to non-equilibrium MST network in its nucleation phase, occuring at some critical time 2005-08-11.
Coalescence of edges on the FSE's transient leader SALZGITTER (SZG) AG-Stahl und Technologie company,
is observed within the nucleation and is approximately characterised by the Lifsthiz-Slyozov
growth exponent; (ii) The nucleation accelerates and transforms to the condensation process,
in the second phase transition, forming a logarithmically diverging lambda-peak of short-range
order parameters at the subsequent critical time 2007-01-25; (iii) In the third phase transition,
the peak logarithmically decreases over three quarters of the year, resulting in a few loosly connected
sub-graphs. This peak, is reminiscent of a non-equilibrium superstar-like superhub or a `dragon
king' effect, abruptly accelerating the evolution of the SZG company. All these phase transitions
are caused by the few richest vertices, which drift towards the SZG centre, providing most of the
edges. Thus, we capture an amazing phenomenon, likely of a more universal character, where a periferial
vertex becomes the one which is overdominating the complex network during an exceptionally long
period of time.
