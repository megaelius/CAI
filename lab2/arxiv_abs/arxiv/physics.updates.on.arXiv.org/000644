In the nanophotonics community, there is an active discussion regarding the origin of the selective
absorption/scattering of light by the resonances with nanorod arrays. Here we report a study of
the resonances in ordered indium-tin-oxide (ITO) nanorod arrays from the perspective of waveguides.
We discover that with only 2.4% geometrical coverage, the micron-length nanorod arrays strongly
interact with light across an extra-wide band from visible to mid-infrared resulting in less than
10% transmission at the first order destructive interference. Simulations show excellent agreement
with our experimental observation. Near-field profile obtained from simulation reveals the electric
field is mainly localized on the surfaces of the nanorods at all the resonances. Theoretical analysis
is then applied to explain the resonances and it was found that the resonances in the visible are different
from those in the infrared. The former resonances are the result of the interference between guided
wave and wave propagated in the free space, while the latter ones are standing wave formation determined
by the length of nanorods and the propagating constant of the guided wave (antenna modes). These
differences observed in the wavelength range studied are attributed to the unique permittivity
dispersion of ITO, which monotonically decreases from positive to negative right at the near infrared.
The simple analytical formulae developed can be used to predict and design the resonances, which
can be subsequently applied to devices like wavelength-selective photodetector, modulators,
and nanorod-based solar cells. The discussion in this report should apply equally well to other
semiconductor nanorod/nanowire arrays and help to clarify experimental interpretations in those
published systems.
