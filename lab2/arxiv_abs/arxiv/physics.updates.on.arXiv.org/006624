The unshielded nature of gravity means that stellar systems are inherently inhomogeneous. As a
result, stars do not move in straight lines. This obvious fact severely complicates the kinetic
theory of stellar systems because position and velocity turn out to be poor coordinates with which
to describe stellar orbits - instead, one must use angle-action variables. Moreover, the slow relaxation
of star clusters and galaxies can be enhanced or suppressed by collective interactions ('polarisation'
effects) involving many stars simultaneously. These collective effects are also present in plasmas;
in that case, they are accounted for by the Balescu-Lenard (BL) equation, which is a kinetic equation
in velocity space. Recently several authors have shown how to account for both inhomogeneity and
collective effects in the kinetic theory of stellar systems by deriving an angle-action generalisation
of the BL equation. Unfortunately their derivations are long and complicated, involving multiple
coordinate transforms, contour integrals in the complex plane, and so on. On the other hand, Rostoker's
superposition principle allows one to pretend that a long-range interacting $N$-body system,
such as a plasma or star cluster, consists merely of uncorrelated particles that are 'dressed' by
polarisation clouds. In this paper we use Rostoker's principle to provide a simple, intuitive derivation
of the BL equation for stellar systems which is much shorter than others in the literature. It also
allows us to straightforwardly connect the BL picture of self-gravitating kinetics to the classical
'two-body relaxation' theory of uncorrelated flybys pioneered by Chandrasekhar.
