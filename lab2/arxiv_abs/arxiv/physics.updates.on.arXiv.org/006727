Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been recently adopted for super-resolution, an application
closely related to what is referred to as "downscaling" in the atmospheric sciences: improving
the spatial resolution of low-resolution images. The ability of conditional GANs to generate an
ensemble of solutions for a given input lends itself naturally to stochastic downscaling, but the
stochastic nature of GANs is not usually considered in super-resolution applications. Here, we
introduce a recurrent, stochastic super-resolution GAN that can generate ensembles of time-evolving
high-resolution atmospheric fields for an input consisting of a low-resolution sequence of images
of the same field. We test the GAN using two datasets, one consisting of radar-measured precipitation
from Switzerland, the other of cloud optical thickness derived from the Geostationary Earth Observing
Satellite 16 (GOES-16). We find that the GAN can generate realistic, temporally consistent super-resolution
sequences for both datasets. The statistical properties of the generated ensemble are analyzed
using rank statistics, a method adapted from ensemble weather forecasting; these analyses indicate
that the GAN produces close to the correct amount of variability in its outputs. As the GAN generator
is fully convolutional, it can be applied after training to input images larger than the images used
to train it. It is also able to generate time series much longer than the training sequences, as demonstrated
by applying the generator to a three-month dataset of the precipitation radar data. The source code
to our GAN is available at https://github.com/jleinonen/downscaling-rnn-gan.
