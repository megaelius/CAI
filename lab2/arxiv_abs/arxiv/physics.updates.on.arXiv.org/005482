Numerous real-world systems, for instance, the communication platforms and transportation systems,
can be abstracted into complex networks. Containing spreading dynamics (e.g., epidemic transmission
and misinformation propagation) in networked systems is a hot topic in multiple fronts. Most of
the previous strategies are based on the immunization of nodes. However, sometimes, these node--based
strategies can be impractical. For instance, in the train transportation networks, it is dramatic
to isolating train stations for flu prevention. On the contrary, temporarily suspending some connections
between stations is more acceptable. Thus, we pay attention to the edge-based containing strategy.
In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to find the optimal edge for containing the spreading
of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model on complex networks. In specific, by performing
a perturbation method to the discrete-Markovian-chain equations of the SIS model, we derive a formula
that approximately provides the decremental outbreak size after the deactivation of a certain
edge in the network. Then, we determine the optimal edge by simply choosing the one with the largest
decremental outbreak size. Note that our proposed theoretical framework incorporates the information
of both network structure and spreading dynamics. Finally, we test the performance of our method
by extensive numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that our strategy always outperforms
other strategies based only on structural properties (degree or edge betweenness centrality).
The theoretical framework in this study can be extended to other spreading models and offers inspirations
for further investigations on edge-based immunization strategies.
