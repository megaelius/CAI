The present study aims to investigate utilizing field-effect for inducing heterogeneous surface
charge and consequently changing the fluid flow in a solid-state nanochannel with converging-diverging
periodicity. It is shown that the combination of geometry and applied gate voltage (V_{G}) would
generate heterogeneous surface charge at the channel walls which can be modulated by V_{G}, i.e.
a moderate V_{G} (0.7-0.9 V) causes charge inversion in diverging sections of the channel while
V_{G} > 0.9 enables charge inversion in the entire channel but it is still non-uniform in each section.
The results show that zeta ({\zeta}) potential is a function of V_{G} which shows a linear to non-linear
transition due to dilution of electrolyte in agreement with density functional theory and Monte
Carlo simulations. In contrast, electrolyte symmetry has a minor effect on the variation of {\zeta}
potential. It is also shown that the difference in {\zeta} potential across the channel ({\Delta}{\zeta})
increases by dilution of electrolyte and utilizing a more symmetric electrolyte with lower valances.
For the first time, it is shown that {\Delta}{\zeta} presents a maximum with the V_{G}. The V_{G}
corresponding to the maximum {\Delta}{\zeta} decreases with both dilution of electrolyte and
higher anion valance. This is of practical importance to overcome leakage current problem of field-effect
fluidic devices. It is also shown that the velocity field can be altered by changing both electrolyte
concentration and symmetry. However, applying VG was found to be a more efficient way than electrolyte
modifications. This includes generating circulation inside the channel which is of prime importance
for applications such as mixing or separation/trapping.
