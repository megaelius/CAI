The hydrodynamics of liquid flowing past gas sectors of unidirectional superhydrophobic surfaces
(aligned with the $x$-axis) is revisited. Attention is focussed on the local slip boundary condition
at the liquid-gas interface, which is equivalent to effect of a gas cavity on liquid flow. The system
is characterized by $\mu/\mu_g$ (viscosity contrast between liquid and gas), and the texture parameters
$\delta$ (width of the groove), and $e(y, \alpha)$ (local depth of the groove, which varies in the
direction $y$, orthogonal to $x$, and depends on the bevel angle of groove's edges, $\pi/2 - \alpha$,
at the point, where three phases meet). We interpret earlier results, namely dependence of the local
slip length on the flow direction, in terms of a tensorial local slip boundary condition and relate
the eigenvalues of the local slip length tensor to the system parameters. Our theory demonstrates
that when grooves are sufficiently deep their eigenvalues of the local slip length tensor depend
only on $\mu/\mu_g$, $\delta$, and $\alpha$, but not on the depth. The eigenvalues of the local slip
length of shallow grooves are defined by the viscosity contrast, $\mu/\mu_g$, and local thickness
of a thin gas films, $e(y, \alpha)$, although the contribution of the bevel angle is moderate. In
order to assess the validity of our theory we propose a novel approach to solve the two-phase hydrodynamic
problem, which significantly facilitates and accelerates calculations compared to conventional
numerical schemes. The numerical results show that our simple analytical description obtained
for limiting cases of deep and shallow grooves remains valid for various 1D textures.
