The largely dominant meritocratic paradigm of highly competitive Western cultures is rooted on
the belief that success is due mainly, if not exclusively, to personal qualities such as talent,
intelligence, skills, efforts or risk taking. Sometimes, we are willing to admit that a certain
degree of luck could also play a role in achieving significant material success. But, as a matter
of fact, it is rather common to underestimate the importance of external forces in individual successful
stories. It is very well known that intelligence or talent exhibit a Gaussian distribution among
the population, whereas the distribution of wealth - considered a proxy of success - follows typically
a power law (Pareto law). Such a discrepancy between a Normal distribution of inputs, with a typical
scale, and the scale invariant distribution of outputs, suggests that some hidden ingredient is
at work behind the scenes. In this paper, with the help of a very simple agent-based model, we suggest
that such an ingredient is just randomness. In particular, we show that, if it is true that some degree
of talent is necessary to be successful in life, almost never the most talented people reach the highest
peaks of success, being overtaken by mediocre but sensibly luckier individuals. As to our knowledge,
this counterintuitive result - although implicitly suggested between the lines in a vast literature
- is quantified here for the first time. It sheds new light on the effectiveness of assessing merit
on the basis of the reached level of success and underlines the risks of distributing excessive honors
or resources to people who, at the end of the day, could have been simply luckier than others. With
the help of this model, several policy hypotheses are also addressed and compared to show the most
efficient strategies for public funding of research in order to improve meritocracy, diversity
and innovation.
