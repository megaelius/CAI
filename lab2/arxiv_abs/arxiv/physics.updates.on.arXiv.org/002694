We have been developing event-driven SOI Pixel Detectors, named `XRPIX' (X-Ray soiPIXel) based
on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pixel technology, for the future X-ray astronomical satellite
with wide band coverage from 0.5 keV to 40 keV. XRPIX has event trigger output function at each pixel
to acquire a good time resolution of a few $\mu \rm s$ and has Correlated Double Sampling function
to reduce electric noises. The good time resolution enables the XRPIX to reduce Non X-ray Background
in the high energy band above 10\,keV drastically by using anti-coincidence technique with active
shield counters surrounding XRPIX. In order to increase the soft X-ray sensitivity, it is necessary
to make the dead layer on the X-ray incident surface as thin as possible. Since XRPIX1b, which is a
device at the initial stage of development, is a front-illuminated (FI) type of XRPIX, low energy
X-ray photons are absorbed in the 8 $\rm \mu$m thick circuit layer, lowering the sensitivity in the
soft X-ray band. Therefore, we developed a back-illuminated (BI) device XRPIX2b, and confirmed
high detection efficiency down to 2.6 keV, below which the efficiency is affected by the readout
noise. In order to further improve the detection efficiency in the soft X-ray band, we developed
a back-illuminated device XRPIX3b with lower readout noise. In this work, we irradiated 2--5 keV
X-ray beam collimated to 4 $\rm \mu m \phi$ to the sensor layer side of the XRPIX3b at 6 $\rm \mu m$ pitch.
In this paper, we reported the uniformity of the relative detection efficiency, gain and energy
resolution in the subpixel level for the first time. We also confirmed that the variation in the relative
detection efficiency at the subpixel level reported by Matsumura et al. has improved.
