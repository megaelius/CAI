Rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection is investigated numerically with the use of an asymptotic
model that captures the rapidly rotating, small Ekman number limit, $Ek \rightarrow 0$. The Prandtl
number ($Pr$) and the asymptotically scaled Rayleigh number ($\widetilde{Ra} = Ra Ek^{4/3}$,
where $Ra$ is the typical Rayleigh number) are varied systematically. For sufficiently vigorous
convection, an inverse kinetic energy cascade leads to the formation of a depth-invariant large-scale
vortex (LSV). With respect to the kinetic energy, we find a transition from convection dominated
states to LSV dominated states at an asymptotically reduced (small-scale) Reynolds number of $\widetilde{Re}
\approx 6$ for all investigated values of $Pr$. The ratio of the depth-averaged kinetic energy to
the kinetic energy of the convection reaches a maximum at $\widetilde{Re} \approx 24$, then decreases
as $\widetilde{Ra}$ is increased. This decrease in the relative kinetic energy of the LSV is associated
with a decrease in the convective correlations with increasing Rayleigh number. The scaling behavior
of the convective flow speeds is studied; although a linear scaling of the form $\widetilde{Re}
\sim \widetilde{Ra}/Pr$ is observed over a limited range in Rayleigh number and Prandtl number,
a clear departure from this scaling is observed at the highest accessible values of $\widetilde{Ra}$.
Calculation of the forces present in the governing equations shows that the ratio of the viscous
force to the buoyancy force is an increasing function of $\widetilde{Ra}$, that approaches unity
over the investigated range of parameters.
