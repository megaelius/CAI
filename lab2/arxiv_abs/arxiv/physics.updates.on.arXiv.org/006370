Deep Learning research is advancing at a fantastic rate, and there is much to gain from transferring
this knowledge to older fields like Computational Fluid Dynamics in practical engineering contexts.
This work compares state-of-the-art methods that address uncertainty quantification in Deep
Neural Networks, pushing forward the reduced-order modeling approach of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Neural
Networks (POD-NN) with Deep Ensembles and Variational Inference-based Bayesian Neural Networks,
on two-dimensional problems in space. These are first tested on benchmark problems, and then applied
to a real-life application: flooding predictions in the Mille \^Iles river in the Montreal, Canada
metropolitan area. Our setup involves a set of input parameters, with a potentially noisy distribution,
and accumulates the simulation data resulting from these parameters. The goal is to build a non-intrusive
surrogate model that is able to know when it doesn't know, which is still an open research area in Neural
Networks (and in AI in general). With the help of this model, probabilistic flooding maps are generated,
aware of the model uncertainty. These insights on the unknown are also used for an uncertainty propagation
task, allowing for broader and safer flooded areas predictions than with a regular uncertainty-uninformed
surrogate model. Our study of the time-dependent and highly nonlinear case of a dam break is also
presented. Both the ensembles and the Bayesian approach lead to reliable results for multiple smooth
physical solutions, providing the correct warning when going out-of-distribution. However,
the first, referred to as POD-EnsNN, proved much easier to implement and showed greater flexibility
than the latter in the case of discontinuities, where standard algorithms may oscillate or fail
to converge.
