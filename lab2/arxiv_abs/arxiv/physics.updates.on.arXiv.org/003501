Current trends suggest that significant gender disparities exist within Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education at university, with female students being underrepresented
in physics, but more equally represented in life sciences (e.g., biology, medicine). To understand
these trends, it is important to consider the context in which students make decisions about which
university courses to enrol in. The current study seeks to investigate gender differences in STEM
through a unique approach that combines network analysis of student enrolment data with an interpretive
lens based on the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu. We generate a network of courses taken
by around 9000 undergraduate physics students (from 2009 to 2014) to quantify Bourdieu's concept
of field. We explore the properties of this network to investigate gender differences in transverse
movements (between different academic fields) and vertical movements (changes in students' achievement
rankings within a field). Our findings indicate that female students are more likely to make transverse
movements into life science fields. We also find that university physics does a poor job in attracting
high achieving students, and especially high achieving female students. Of the students who do
choose to study physics, low achieving female students are less likely to continue than their male
counterparts. The results and implications are discussed in the context of Bourdieu's theory,
and previous research. We argue that in order to remove constraints on female student's study choices,
the field of physics needs to provide a culture in which all students feel like they belong.
