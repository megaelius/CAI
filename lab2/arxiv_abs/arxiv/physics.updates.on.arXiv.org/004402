Earth/s lowermost mantle displays complex geological structures that likely result from heterogeneous
thermal and electromagnetic interaction with the core. Geophysical models of the core-mantle
boundary (CMB) region rely on the thermal and electrical conductivities of appropriate geomaterials
which, however, have never been probed at representative pressure and temperature (P-T) conditions.
Here we report on the opacity of single crystalline bridgmanite and ferropericlase, which is linked
to both their radiative and electrical conductivity, measured in dynamically- and statically-heated
diamond anvil cells as well as computed from first-principles at CMB conditions. Our results show
that light absorption in the visible spectral range is enhanced upon heating in both minerals but
the rate of change in opacity with temperature is a factor of six higher in ferropericlase. As a result,
bridgmanite in the lowermost mantle is moderately transparent while ferropericlase is highly
opaque. Our measurements suggest a very low (< 1 W/m/K) and largely temperature-independent radiative
conductivity in the lowermost mantle, at odds with previous studies. This implies that the radiative
mechanism has not contributed significantly to cooling the Earth/s core throughout the geologic
time and points to a present-day CMB heat flow of 9-11 TW. Opaque ferropericlase is electrically
conducting and mediates strong core-mantle electromagnetic coupling, explaining the intradecadal
oscillations in the length of day, low secular geomagnetic variations in Central Pacific, and the
preferred paths of geomagnetic pole reversals.
