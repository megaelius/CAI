This study used eye-tracking to capture the students' visual attention while taking the test of
understanding graphs in kinematics (TUG-K). A total of N = 115 upper-secondary-level students
from Germany and Switzerland took the 26-item multiple-choice instrument after learning about
kinematics graphs in the regular classroom. Besides choosing the correct alternative among research-based
distractors, the students were required to judge their response confidence for each question.
The items were presented sequentially on a computer screen equipped with a remote eye tracker, resulting
in a set of approx. 3000 paired responses (accuracy and confidence) and about 40 hours of eye movementdata
(approx. 500.000 fixations). The analysis of students' visual attention related to the item stems
(questions) and the item options reveal that high response confidence is correlated with shorter
visit duration on both elements of the items. While the students' response accuracy and their response
confidence are highly correlated on the score level, r(115) = 0.63, p < 0.001, the eye-tracking measures
do not sufficiently discriminate between correct and incorrect responses. However, a more fine-grained
analysis of visual attention based on different answer options reveals a significant discrimination
between correct and incorrect answers in terms of an interaction effect: Incorrect responses are
associated with longer visit durations on strong distractors and less time spent on correct options
while correct responses show the opposite trend. Outcomes of this study provide new insights into
the validation of concept inventories based on students' behavioural level.
