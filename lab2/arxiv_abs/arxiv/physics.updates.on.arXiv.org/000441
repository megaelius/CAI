What is meant by continuum lowering and ionization potential depression (IPD) in a Coulomb system
depends upon precisely what question is being asked. It is shown that equilibrium (equation-of-state)
phenomena and non-equilibrium dynamical processes like photoionization are characterised by
different values of the IPD. In the former, the ionization potential of an atom embedded in matter
is the difference in the free energy of the many-body system between states of thermodynamic equilibrium
differing by the ionization state of just one atom. Typically, this energy is less than that required
to ionize the same atom in vacuo. Probably, the best known example of such an IPD is that of Stewart
and Pyatt (SP). However, it is a common misconception that this formula should apply directly to
the energy of a photon causing photoionization, since this is a local adiabatic process that occurs
in the absence of a response from the surrounding plasma. To achieve the prescribed final equilibrium
state, additional energy, in the form of heat and work, is transferred between the atom and its surroundings.
This additional relaxation energy is sufficient to explain the discrepancy between recent spectroscopic
measurements of IPD in dense plasmas and the predictions of the SP formula. This paper provides a
detailed account of an analytical approach to calculating thermodynamic and spectroscopic (adiabatic)
IPDs in multicomponent Coulomb systems of arbitrary coupling strength. The ramifications are
carefully examined in order to elucidate the roles of the various IPD forms. A formulation in terms
of free energy leads to an analytical equation of state (EoS) that is thermodynamically self-consistent,
provided that the bound and free electrons are dynamically separable. Of the various proposed formulae,
the Spectroscopic (adiabatic) IPD gives the most consistent agreement with spectroscopic measurements.
