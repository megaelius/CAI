We consider the so-called unfolding problem in experimental high energy physics, where the goal
is to estimate the true spectrum of elementary particles given observations distorted by measurement
error due to the limited resolution of a particle detector. This an important statistical inverse
problem arising in the analysis of data at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Mathematically, the
problem is formalized as one of estimating the intensity function of an indirectly observed Poisson
point process. Particle physicists are particularly keen on unfolding methods that feature a principled
way of choosing the regularization strength and allow for the quantification of the uncertainty
inherent in the solution. Though there are many approaches that have been considered by experimental
physicists, it can be argued that few -- if any -- of these deal with these two key issues in a satisfactory
manner. In this paper, we propose to attack the unfolding problem within the framework of empirical
Bayes estimation: we consider Bayes estimators of the coefficients of a basis expansion of the unknown
intensity, using a regularizing prior; and employ a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm
to find the marginal maximum likelihood estimate of the hyperparameter controlling the strength
of the regularization. Due to the data-driven choice of the hyperparameter, credible intervals
derived using the empirical Bayes posterior lose their subjective Bayesian interpretation. Since
the properties and meaning of such intervals are poorly understood, we explore instead the use of
bootstrap resampling for constructing purely frequentist confidence bands for the true intensity.
The performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using both simulations and real data
from the Large Hadron Collider.
