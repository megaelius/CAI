Super-large-scale particle image velocimetry (SLPIV) using natural snowfall is used to investigate
the influence of nacelle and tower generated flow structures on the near-wake of a 2.5 MW wind turbine
at the EOLOS field station. The analysis is based on the data collected in a field campaign on March
12th, 2017, with a sample area of 125 m (vertical) x 70 m (streamwise) centred on the plane behind the
turbine support tower. The SLPIV measurement provides the velocity field over the entire rotor
span, revealing a region of accelerated flow around the hub caused by the reduction in axial induction
at the blade roots. The in-plane turbulent kinetic energy field shows an increase in turbulence
in the regions of large shear behind the blade tips and the hub, and a reduction in turbulence behind
the tower where the large-scale turbulent structures in the boundary layer are broken up. Snow voids
reveal coherent structures shed from the blades, nacelle, and tower. The hub wake meandering frequency
is quantified and found to correspond to the vortex shedding frequency of an Ahmed body (St=0.06).
Persistent hub wake deflection is observed and shown to be connected with the turbine yaw error.
In the region below the hub, strong interaction between the tower- and blade-generated structures
is observed. The temporal characteristics of this interaction are quantified by the co-presence
of two dominant frequencies, one corresponding to the blade vortex shedding at the blade pass frequency
and the other corresponding to tower vortex shedding at St=0.2. This study highlights the influence
of the tower and nacelle on the behaviour of the near-wake, informing model development and elucidating
the mechanisms that influence wake evolution.
