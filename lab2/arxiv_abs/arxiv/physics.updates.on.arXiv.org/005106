In weakly collisional astrophysical plasmas, such as the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters,
the amplification of cosmic magnetic fields by chaotic fluid motions is hampered by the adiabatic
production of magnetic-field-aligned pressure anisotropy. This anisotropy drives a viscous
stress parallel to the field that inhibits the plasma's ability to stretch magnetic-field lines.
I demonstrate through the use of kinetic simulations that in high-$\beta$ plasmas, kinetic ion-Larmor
scale instabilities sever the adiabatic link between the thermal and magnetic pressures, reducing
this viscous stress and thereby allowing the dynamo to operate. Two distinct regimes of the fluctuation
dynamo in a magnetized plasma are identified: one in which these instabilities efficiently regulate
the pressure anisotropy and one in which this regulation is imperfect. I elucidate the role of these
kinetic instabilities on the plasma viscosity and determine how the fields and flows self-organize
to allow the dynamo to operate in the face of parallel viscous stresses. In the case of efficient pressure-anisotropy
regulation, the plasma dynamo closely resembles its more traditional Pm ~ 1 MHD counterpart. When
the regulation is imperfect, the dynamo exhibits characteristics remarkably similar to those
found in the saturated state of the MHD dynamo. A novel set of microphysical closures for fluid simulations
that bridges these two regimes are constructed, exhibiting explosive magnetic-field growth caused
by a field-strength-dependent viscosity. The dynamos in both collisionless and weakly collisional
plasmas are then closely compared to each other, revealing substantial differences in how sub-parallel
viscous motions behave. The former (collisionless) scenario experiences a cascade of stretching
motions to sub-Larmor scales that lead to increasingly fast dynamo as the magnetic Reynolds number
is increased.
