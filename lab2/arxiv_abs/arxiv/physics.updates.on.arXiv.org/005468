This work employs for the first time invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to study
the interaction between finite-size particles and near-wall coherent structures. We consider
horizontal plane Couette flow and focus on Nagata's upper-branch equilibrium solution (Nagata,
1990) at low Reynolds numbers where this solution is linearly stable. When adding a single heavy
particle with a diameter equivalent to 2.5 wall units, we observe that the solution remains stable
and is essentially unchanged away from the particle. This result demonstrates that it is technically
feasible to utilize exact coherent structures in conjunction with particle-resolved DNS. While
translating in the streamwise direction, the particle migrates laterally under the action of the
quasi-streamwise vortices until it reaches the region occupied by the low-speed streak, where
it attains a periodic state of motion. As a result of the ensuing preferential particle location,
the time-average streamwise particle velocity differs from the plane-average fluid-phase velocity
at the same wall-distance as the particle center, as previously observed in experiments and in numerical
data for fully turbulent wall-bounded flows. Additional constrained simulations where the particle
is maintained at a fixed spanwise position while freely translating in the other two directions
reveal the existence of two equilibria located in the low-speed and in the high-speed streak, respectively,
the former being an unstable point. A parametric study with different particle to fluid density
ratios is conducted which shows how inertia affects the spanwise fluctuations of the periodic particle
motion. Finally, we discuss a number of potential future investigations of solid particle dynamics
which can be conducted with the aid of invariant solutions (exact coherent structures) of the Navier-Stokes
equations.
