The science of thermodynamics was put together in the Nineteenth Century to describe large systems
in equilibrium. One part of thermodynamics defines entropy for equilibrium systems and demands
an ever-increasing entropy for non-equilibrium ones. However, starting with the work of Ludwig
Boltzmann in 1872, and continuing to the present day, various models of non-equilibrium behavior
have been put together with the specific aim of generalizing the concept of entropy to non-equilibrium
situations. This kind of entropy has been termed {\em kinetic entropy} to distinguish it from the
thermodynamic variety. Knowledge of kinetic entropy started from Boltzmann's insight about his
equation for the time dependence of gaseous systems. In this paper, his result is stated as a definition
of kinetic entropy in terms of a local equation for the entropy density. This definition is then applied
to Landau's theory of the Fermi liquid thereby giving the kinetic entropy within that theory. Entropy
has been defined and used for a wide variety of situations in which a condensed matter system has been
allowed to relax for a sufficient period so that the very most rapid fluctuations have been ironed
out. One of the broadest applications of non-equilibrium analysis considers quantum degenerate
systems using Martin-Schwinger Green's functions\cite{MS} as generalized of Wigner functions,
$g^<$ and $g^>$. This paper describes once again these how the quantum kinetic equations
for these functions give locally defined conservation laws for mass momentum and energy. In local
thermodynamic equilibrium, this kinetic theory enables a reasonable local definition of entropy
density. However, when the system is outside of local equilibrium, this definition fails. It is
speculated that quantum entanglement is the source of this failure.
