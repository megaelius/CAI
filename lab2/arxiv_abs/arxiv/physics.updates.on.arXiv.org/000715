The current view about the mixing of heat and salt in the ocean is that it should be parameterised by
means of a rotated diffusion tensor based on mixing directions parallel and perpendicular to the
local neutral vector. However, the impossibility to construct a density variable in the ocean that
is exactly neutral because of the coupling between thermobaricity and density-compensated temperature/salinity
anomalies implies that the effective diapycnal diffusivity experienced by any possible density
variable is partly controlled by isoneutral diffusion when using neutral rotated diffusion. Here,
this effect is quantified by evaluating the effective diapycnal diffusion coefficient for five
widely used density variables: Jackett and McDougall (1997) $\gamma^n$, Lorenz reference state
density $\rho_{ref}$ of Winters et al. (1996), Saenz et al. (2015), and three potential density
variables $\sigma_0$, $\sigma_2$ and $\sigma_4$.Computations use the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment climatology, assuming either a uniform value for isoneutral mixing or spatially varying
values inferred from an inverse calculation. Isopycnal mixing contributions to the effective
diapycnal mixing yields values systematically larger than $10^{-3}$ $\text{m}^2/\text{s}$
in the deep ocean for all density variables, with $\gamma^n$ suffering the least from the isoneutral
control of effective diapycnal mixing, and $\sigma_0$ the most. These high values are due to spatially
localised large values of non-neutrality, mostly in the deep Southern Ocean. Removing only 5\%
of these high values on each density surface reduces the effective diapycnal diffusivities to less
than $10^{-4}$ $\text{m}^2/\text{s}$. This work highlights the potential pitfalls of estimating
diapycnal diffusivities by means of Walin-like water masses analysis or in using Lorenz reference
state for diagnosing spurious numerical diapycnal mixing.
