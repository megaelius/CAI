We investigate the effect of the surface electronic structure and composition of LiMn$_2$O$_4$
nanoparticles on the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) studies combined with density
functional theory (DFT) based simulations of the EEL spectra reveal in pristine nanoparticles
a 4 nm thick surface layer with reduced average Mn oxidation state and increased Mn concentration.
This is attributed to Mn$^{2+}$ partially replacing Li$^+$ at the tetrahedral sites of the spinel
lattice accompanied by Mn 3d-state filling of octahedrally coordinated Mn. During electrocatalytic
OER cycling, this near-surface tetrahedral Mn is leached out, thereby increasing the oxidation
state of octahedrally coordinated Mn. Using rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) based detection
of O and Mn during the OER, we show that the oxygen evolution remains constant while the Mn$^{2+}$
is removed, revealing that near-surface tetrahedrally coordinated Mn has no effect on the OER activity
of LiMn$_2$O$_4$. This is surprising since the e$_g$ occupancy of Mn in octahedral sites, which
is widely used as a descriptor of OER activity, changes significantly in the surface layer during
cycling. The fact that e$_g$ emptying fails to correlate with OER activity here indicates that octahedral
cation valence is not a fundamental measure of activity, either because the active surface state
is not affected by tetrahedral Mn or because other details of the band structure or metal-oxygen
bonding character, more strongly regulate the rate-limiting steps for OER.
