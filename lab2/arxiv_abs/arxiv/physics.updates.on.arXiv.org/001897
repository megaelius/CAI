Analysis of the highest temperature in the machining processes, namely the flash temperature,
helps to understand the physics of the process, to improve cutting tool geometry, and to achieve
high performance machining. In the present work, the interaction between cutting grain and workpiece
material in grinding process is analyzed. Single diamonds are considered for machining, which
operates in comparison to other measurements in the range of grinding speed. The highest temperature
in the grain-material interaction and cutting forces are measured. In order to measure the flash
temperature, an innovative method to measure and analyze the temperature through the diamond grain
in the cutting zone by a two-color pyrometer is proposed. Furthermore, cutting forces are measured
simultaneously. In order to measure the temperature in the cutting zone, an accurate connection
between diamond and pyrometer fiber is required. Thus, the diamond tool holders are manufactured
by electrical discharge machining (EDM) milling in deionized water. A 0.5-mm-diameter hole is
drilled in each holder to connect the diamond precisely to the pyrometer fiber. Machining processes
are performed with 30 {\mu}m depth of cut, cutting length of 20 mm, and cutting speed of 65 m/s on Ti6Al4V.
The cutting tool is fixed, and the shape of the rotating workpiece is optimized. The diamond holder
with the specific shape is designed and manufactured. Quasi-static, dynamic, modal, and harmonic
response analyses are performed in order to reduce vibrations and chattering. The measured flash
temperature is 1380 {\deg}C and cutting normal, tangential, and axial forces are measured.
