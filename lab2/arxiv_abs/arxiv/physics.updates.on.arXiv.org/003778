Constructing physical models of living cells and tissues is an extremely challenging task because
of the high complexities of both intra- and intercellular processes. In addition, the force that
a single cell generates vanishes in total due to the law of action and reaction. The typical mechanics
of cell crawling involve periodic changes in the cell shape and in the adhesion characteristics
of the cell to the substrate. However, the basic physical mechanisms by which a single cell coordinates
these processes cooperatively to achieve autonomous migration are not yet well understood. To
obtain a clearer grasp of how the intracellular force is converted to directional motion, we develop
a basic mechanochemical model of a crawling cell based on subcellular elements with the focus on
the dependence of the protrusion and contraction as well as the adhesion and deadhesion processes
on intracellular biochemical signals. By introducing reaction-diffusion equations that reproduce
traveling waves of local chemical concentrations, we clarify that the chemical dependence of the
cell-substrate adhesion dynamics determines the crawling direction and distance with one chemical
wave. Finally, we also perform multipole analysis of the traction force to compare it with the experimental
results. To our knowledge, our present work is the first study that accomplishes fully force-free
migration utilizing intracellular chemical reactions. Although the detailed mechanisms of actual
cells are far more complicated than our simple model, we believe that this mechanochemical model
is a good prototype for more realistic models.
