The fundamental properties of macroscopic gene-mating dynamic evolutionary systems are investigated.
A model is proposed to describe a large class of systems within population genetics. We focus on a
single locus, arbitrary number alleles in a two-gender dioecious population. Our governing equations
are time-dependent continuous differential equations labeled by a set of genotype frequencies.
The full parameter space consists of all allowed parameters of these genotype frequencies. Our
equations are uniquely derived from four fundamental assumptions within a population: (1) a closed
system; (2) average-and-random mating process (mean-field behavior); (3) Mendelian inheritance;
(4) exponential growth and exponential death. Even though our equations are non-linear with time
evolutionary dynamics, we have an exactly solvable model. Our findings are summarized from two
viewpoints. First, from the phenomenological viewpoint, any initial genotype frequency of a closed
system will eventually approach a stable fixed point. Under time evolution, we show (1) the monotonic
behavior of genotype frequencies, (2) a genotype or an allele that ever presents in the population
will never become extinct, (3) the Hardy-Weinberg law, and (4) the global stability without chaos
in the parameter space. To demonstrate the experimental evidence, as an example, we show an mapping
from the blood type genotype frequencies of world ethnic groups to our stable fixed-point solutions.
Second, from the mathematical viewpoint, the equilibrium solutions consist of a base manifold
as a global stable attractor, attracting any initial point in a Euclidean fiber to the fixed point
where this fiber is attached. We can define the genetic distance of two populations as their geodesic
distance on the equilibrium manifold. In addition, the modification of our theory under the process
of natural selection and mutation are addressed.
