Propulsion by growing actin networks is a universal mechanism used in many different biological
systems. Although the core molecular machinery for actin network growth is well preserved in most
cases, the geometry of the propelled obstacle can vary considerably. In recent years, filament
orientation distribution has emerged as an important observable characterizing the structure
and dynamical state of the growing network. Here we derive several continuum equations for the orientation
distribution of filaments growing behind stiff obstacles of various shapes and validate the predicted
steady state orientation patterns by stochastic computer simulations based on discrete filaments.
We use an ordinary differential equation approach to demonstrate that for flat obstacles of finite
size, two fundamentally different orientation patterns peaked at either +35/-35 or +70/0/-70
degrees exhibit mutually exclusive stability, in agreement with earlier results for flat obstacles
of very large lateral extension. We calculate and validate phase diagrams as a function of model
parameters and show how this approach can be extended to obstacles with piecewise straight contours.
For curved obstacles, we arrive at a partial differential equation in the continuum limit, which
again is in good agreement with the computer simulations. In all cases, we can identify the same two
fundamentally different orientation patterns, but only within an appropriate reference frame,
which is adjusted to the local orientation of the obstacle contour. Our results suggest that two
fundamentally different network architectures compete with each other in growing actin networks,
irrespective of obstacle geometry, and clarify how simulated and electron tomography data have
to be analyzed for non-flat obstacle geometries.
