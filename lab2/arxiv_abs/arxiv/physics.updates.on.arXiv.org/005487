Most commercial microfluidic droplet generators rely on the planar flow-focusing configuration
implemented in polymer or glass chips. The planar geometry, however, suffers from many limitations
and drawbacks, such as the need of specific coatings or the use of dedicated surfactants, depending
on the fluids in play. On the contrary, and thanks to their axisymmetric geometry, glass capillary-based
droplet generators are a priori not fluid-dependent. Nevertheless, they have never reached the
market because their assembly requires art-dependent and not scalable fabrication techniques.
Here we present a new device, called Raydrop, based on the alignment of two capillaries immersed
in a pressurized chamber containing the continuous phase. The dispersed phase exits one of the capillaries
through a 3D-printed nozzle, placed in front of the extraction capillary for collecting the droplets.
This non-embedded implementation of an axisymmetric flow-focusing is referred to {\it co-flow-focusing}.
Experimental results demonstrate the universality of the device in terms of the variety of fluids
that can be emulsified, as well as the range of droplet radii that can be obtained, without neither
the need of surfactant nor coating. Additionally, numerical computations of the Navier-Stokes
equations based on the quasi-steadiness assumption are shown to correctly predict the droplet
radius in the dripping regime and the dripping-jetting transition when varying the geometrical
and fluid parameters. The monodispersity ensured by the dripping regime, the robustness of the
fabrication technique, the optimization capabilities from the numerical modeling and the universality
of the configuration confer to the Raydrop technology a very high potential in the race towards high-throughput
droplet generation processes.
