This paper presents the development of a vascularized breast tumor and healthy or tumorigenic liver
microenvironments-on-a-chip connected in series. This is the first description of a vascularized
multi tissue-on-a-chip microenvironment for modeling cancerous breast and cancerous/healthy
liver microenvironments, to allow for the study of dynamic and spatial transport of particles.
This device enables the dynamic determination of vessel permeability, the measurement of drug
and nanoparticle transport, and the assessment of the associated efficacy and toxicity to the liver.
The platform is utilized to determine the effect of particle size on the spatiotemporal diffusion
of particles through each microenvironment, both independently and in response to the circulation
of particles in varying sequences of microenvironments. The results show that when breast cancer
cells were cultured in the microenvironments they had a 2.62-fold higher vessel porosity relative
to vessels within healthy liver microenvironments. Hence, the permeability of the tumor microenvironment
increased by 2.35- and 2.77-fold compared to a healthy liver for small and large particles, respectively.
The ECM accumulation rate of larger particles was 2.57-fold lower than smaller particles in a healthy
liver. However, the accumulation rate was 5.57-fold greater in the breast tumor microenvironment.
These results are in agreement with comparable in vivo studies. Ultimately, the platform could
be utilized to determine the impact of the tissue or tumor microenvironment, or drug and nanoparticle
properties, on transport, efficacy, selectivity, and toxicity in a dynamic, and high throughput
manner for use in treatment optimization.
