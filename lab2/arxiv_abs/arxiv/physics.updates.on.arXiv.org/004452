Purpose: Endovascular aortic repair procedures are currently conducted with 2D fluoroscopy imaging.
Tracking systems based on fiber Bragg gratings are an emerging technology for the navigation of
minimal-invasive instruments which can reduce the x-ray exposure and the used contrast agent.
Shape sensing of flexible structures is challenging and includes many calculations steps which
are prone to different errors. To reduce this errors, we present an optimized shape sensing model.
Methods: We analyzed for every step of the shape sensing process, which errors can occur, how the
error affects the shape and how it can be compensated or minimized. Experiments were done with a multicore
fiber system with 38 cm sensing length and the effects of different methods and parameters were analyzed.
Furthermore we compared 3D shape reconstructions with the segmented shape of the corresponding
CT scans of the fiber to evaluate the accuracy of our optimized shape sensing model. Finally we tested
our model in a realistic endovascular scenario by using a 3D printed vessel system created from patient
data. Results: Depending on the complexity of the shape we reached an average error of 0.35 to 1.15
mm and maximal error of 0.75 to 7.53 mm over the whole 38 cm sensing length. In the endovascular scenario
we obtained an average and maximal error of 1.13 mm and 2.11 mm, respectively. Conclusions: The accuracies
of the 3D shape sensing model are promising and we plan to combine the shape sensing based on fiber
Bragg gratings with the position and orientation of an electromagnetic sensor system to obtain
the located shape of the catheter.
