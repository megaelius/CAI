We study the error scaling properties of implicitly-filtered large-eddy simulation (LES) in the
outer region of wall-bounded turbulence at moderately high Reynolds numbers and for different
subgrid-scale (SGS) models. In order to avoid the additional complexity of wall-modeling, we perform
LES of turbulent channel flows where the wall boundary condition is replaced by a Neumann condition
supplying the exact mean wall stress. The statistics under consideration are the mean velocity
profile, turbulence intensities, and kinetic energy spectra. The errors for these quantities
follow $(\Delta/L)^{\alpha}Re_\tau^{\gamma}$, where $\Delta$ is the characteristic grid resolution,
$Re_\tau$ is the friction Reynolds number, and $L$ is the meaningful length-scale to normalize
$\Delta$ in order to collapse the errors across the wall-normal distance. It is shown that $\Delta$
can be expressed as the $L_2$-norm of the grid vector, and $L$ is well represented by the ratio of the
friction velocity and mean shear. The exponent $\alpha$ is estimated from theoretical arguments
for each statistical quantity of interest and is shown to roughly match the values computed by numerical
simulations. For the mean profile and kinetic energy spectra, $\alpha\approx1$, whereas the turbulence
intensities converge at a slower rate $\alpha<1$. The exponent $\gamma$ is approximately $0$,
and the LES solution is independent of the Reynolds number. The expected behavior of the turbulence
intensities at high Reynolds numbers is also derived and shown to agree with the classic log-layer
profiles for grid resolutions lying within the inertial range.
