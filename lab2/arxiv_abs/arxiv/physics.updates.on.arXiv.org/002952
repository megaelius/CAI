We study experimentally the spatial distribution, settling, and interaction of sub-Kolmogorov
inertial particles with homogeneous turbulence. Utilizing a zero-mean-flow air turbulence chamber,
we drop size-selected solid particles and study their dynamics with particle imaging and tracking
velocimetry at multiple resolutions. The carrier flow is simultaneously measured by particle
image velocimetry of suspended tracers, allowing the characterization of the interplay between
both the dispersed and continuous phases. The turbulence Reynolds number based on the Taylor microscale
ranges from $Re_{\lambda}\approx 200$ - $500$, while the particle Stokes number based on the Kolmogorov
scale varies between $St_{\eta} = O(1)$ and $O(10)$. Clustering is confirmed to be most intense
for $St_{\eta} \approx 1$, but it extends over larger scales for heavier particles. Individual
clusters form a hierarchy of self-similar, fractal-like objects, preferentially aligned with
gravity and sizes that can reach the integral scale of the turbulence. Remarkably, the settling
velocity of $St_{\eta} \approx 1$ particles can be several times larger than the still-air terminal
velocity, and the clusters can fall even faster. This is caused by downward fluid fluctuations preferentially
sweeping the particles, and we propose that this mechanism is influenced by both large and small
scales of the turbulence. The particle-fluid slip velocities show large variance, and both the
instantaneous particle Reynolds number and drag coefficient can greatly differ from their nominal
values. Finally, for sufficient loadings, the particles generally augment the small-scale fluid
velocity fluctuations, which however may account for a limited fraction of the turbulent kinetic
energy.
