We present a new uncertainty estimation method for Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), that uses
the correlation plane as a model for the probability density function (PDF) of displacements and
calculates the second order moment of the correlation (MC). The cross-correlation between particle
image patterns is the summation of all particle matches convolved with the apparent particle image
diameter. MC uses this property to estimate the PIV uncertainty from the shape of the cross-correlation
plane. In this new approach, the Generalized Cross-Correlation (GCC) plane corresponding to a
PIV measurement is obtained by removing the particle diameter contribution. The GCC primary peak
represents a discretization of the displacement PDF, from which the standard uncertainty is obtained
by convolving the GCC plane with a Gaussian function. Then a Gaussian least-squares-fit is applied
to the peak region, accounting for the stretching and rotation of the peak, due to the local velocity
gradients and the effect of the convolved Gaussian. The MC method was tested with simulated image
sets and the predicted uncertainties show good sensitivity to the error sources and agreement with
the expected RMS error. Subsequently, the method was demonstrated in three PIV challenge cases
and two experimental datasets and was compared with the published image matching (IM) and correlation
statistics (CS) techniques. Results show that the MC method has a better response to spatial variation
in RMS error and the predicted uncertainty is in good agreement with the expected standard uncertainty.
The uncertainty prediction was also explored as a function PIV interrogation window size, and the
MC method outperforms the other uncertainty methods.
