The effects of a vertical static magnetic field on the flow structure and global transport properties
of momentum and heat in liquid metal Rayleigh-B\'enard convection are investigated. Experiments
are conducted in a cylindrical convection cell of unity aspect ratio, filled with the alloy GaInSn
at a low Prandtl number of $\mathit{Pr}=0.029$. Changes of the large-scale velocity structure
with increasing magnetic field strength are probed systematically using multiple ultrasound
Doppler velocimetry sensors and thermocouples for a parameter range that is spanned by Rayleigh
numbers of $10^6 \le \mathit{Ra} \le 6\times 10^7$ and Hartmann numbers of $\mathit{Ha} \le 1000$.
Our simultaneous multi-probe temperature and velocity measurements demonstrate how the large-scale
circulation is affected by an increasing magnetic field strength (or Hartmann number). Lorentz
forces induced in the liquid metal first suppress the oscillations of the large-scale circulation
at low $\mathit{Ha}$, then transform the one-roll structure into a cellular large-scale pattern
consisting of multiple up- and downwellings for intermediate $\mathit{Ha}$, before finally expelling
any fluid motion out of the bulk at the highest accessible $\mathit{Ha}$ leaving only a near-wall
convective flow that persists even below Chandrasekhar's linear instability threshold. Our study
thus proves experimentally the existence of wall modes in confined magnetoconvection. The magnitude
of the transferred heat remains nearly unaffected by the steady decrease of the fluid momentum over
a large range of Hartmann numbers. We extend the experimental global transport analysis to momentum
transfer and include the dependence of the Reynolds number on the Hartmann number.
