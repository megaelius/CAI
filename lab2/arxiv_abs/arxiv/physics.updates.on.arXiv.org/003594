We study the statistics of fluid (gas) density and concentration of passive tracer particles (dust)
in compressible turbulence. We raise the question of whether the fluid density which is an active
field that reacts back on the transporting flow and the passive concentration of tracers must coincide
in the steady state, which we demonstrate to be crucial both theoretically and experimentally.
The fields' coincidence is provable at small Mach numbers, however at finite Mach numbers the assumption
of mixing is needed, not evident due to the possibility of self-organization. Irrespective of whether
the fields coincide we obtain a number of rigorous conclusions on both fields. As Ma increases the
fields in the inertial range go through a phase transition from a finite continuous smooth to a singular
multifractal distribution. We propose a way to calculate fractal dimensions from numerical or
experimental data. We derive a simple expression for the spectrum of fractal dimensions of isothermal
turbulence and describe limitations of lognormality. The expression depends on a single parameter:
the scaling exponent of the density spectrum. We propose a mechanism for the phase transition of
concentration to multifractality. We demonstrate that the pair-correlation function is invariant
under the action of the probability density function of the inter-pair distance that has the Markov
property implying applicability of the Kraichnan turbulence model. We use the model to derive an
explicit expression for the tracers pair correlation that demonstrates their smooth transition
to multifractality and confirms the transition's mechanism. Our results are of potentially important
implications on astrophysical problems such as star formation as well as on technological applications
such as supersonic combustion. As an example we demonstrate strong increase of planetesimals formation
rate at the transition.
