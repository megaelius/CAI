High resolution electron and ion velocity distributions, f(v), which consist of N effectively
disjoint beams, have been measured by NASA's Magnetospheric Multi-Scale Mission (MMS) observatories
and in reconnection simulations. Commonly used standard velocity moments generally assume a single
mean-flow-velocity for the entire distribution, which can lead to counterintuitive results for
a multibeam f(v). An example is the (false) standard thermal energy moment of a pair of equal and opposite
cold particle beams, which is nonzero even though each beam has zero thermal energy. By contrast,
a multibeam moment of two or more beams has no false thermal energy. A multibeam moment is obtained
by taking a standard moment of each beam and then summing over beams. In this paper we will generalize
these notions, explore their consequences and apply them to an f(v) which is sum of tri-Maxwellians.
Both standard and multibeam energy moments have coherent and incoherent forms. Examples of incoherent
moments are the thermal energy density, the pressure and the thermal energy flux (enthalpy flux
plus heat flux). Corresponding coherent moments are the bulk kinetic energy density, the RAM pressure
and the bulk kinetic energy flux. The false part of an incoherent moment is defined as the difference
between the standard incoherent moment and the corresponding multibeam moment. The sum of a pair
of corresponding coherent and incoherent moments will be called the undecomposed moment. Undecomposed
moments are independent of whether the sum is standard or multibeam and therefore have advantages
when studying moments of measured f(v).
