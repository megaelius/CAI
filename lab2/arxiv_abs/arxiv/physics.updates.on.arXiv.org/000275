We investigate the possibility of generating and studying turbulence in plasma by means of high-energy
density laser-driven experiments. Our focus is to create supersonic, self-magnetized turbulence
with characteristics that resemble those found in the interstellar medium (ISM). We consider a
target made of a spherical core surrounded by a shell made of denser material. The shell is irradiated
by a sequence of laser pulses sending inward-propagating shocks that convert the inner core into
plasma and create turbulence. In the context of the evolution of the ISM, the shocks play the role
of supernova remnant shocks and the core represents the ionized interstellar medium. We consider
the effects of both pre-existing and self-generating magnetic fields and study the evolution of
the system by means of two-dimensional numerical simulations. We find that the evolution of the
turbulent core is generally, subsonic with rms-Mach number $M_t\approx 0.2$. We observe an isotropic,
turbulent velocity field with an inertial range power spectra of $P(k)\propto k^{-2.3}$. We account
for the effects of self-magnetization and find that the resulting magnetic field has characteristic
strength $\approx 3\times 10^{4}$ G. The corresponding plasma beta is $\approx 1\times 10^{4}$--$1\times
10^{5}$, indicating that the magnetic field does not play an important role in the dynamical evolution
of the system. The natural extension of this work is to study the system evolution in three-dimensions,
with various laser drive configurations, and targets with shells and cores of different masses.
The latter modification may help to increase the turbulent intensity and possibly create transonic
turbulence. One of the key challenges is to obtain transonic turbulent conditions in a quasi-steady
state environment.
