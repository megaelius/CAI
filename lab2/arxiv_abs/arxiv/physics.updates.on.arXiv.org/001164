Finding the correct encoding for a generic dynamical system's trajectory is a complicated task:
the symbolic sequence needs to preserve the invariant properties from the system's trajectory.
In theory, the solution to this problem is found when a Generating Markov Partition (GMP) is obtained,
which is only defined once the unstable and stable manifolds are known with infinite precision and
for all times. However, these manifolds usually form highly convoluted Euclidean sets, are \emph{a
priori} unknown, and, as it happens in any real-world experiment, measurements are made with finite
resolution and over a finite time-span. The task gets even more complicated if the system is a network
composed of interacting dynamical units, namely, a high-dimensional complex system. Here, we
tackle this task and solve it by defining a method to approximately construct GMPs for any complex
system's finite-resolution and finite-time trajectory. We critically test our method on networks
of coupled maps, encoding their trajectories into symbolic sequences. We show that these sequences
are optimal because they minimise the information loss and also any spurious information added.
Consequently, our method allows us to approximately calculate the invariant probability measures
of complex systems from observed data. Thus, we can efficiently define complexity measures that
are applicable to a wide range of complex phenomena, such as the characterisation of brain activity
from EEG signals measured at different brain regions or the characterisation of climate variability
from temperature anomalies measured at different Earth regions.
