A transportation system with fully autonomous vehicles can be modeled as a multi-agent system,
where autonomous vehicles interact with one another through coupled optimal driving strategies.
However, the existing literature on autonomous vehicle longitudinal control suffers from scalability
issues. In other words, it is challenging to deploy these control algorithms to a large number of
autonomous vehicles. This paper aims to tackle such a challenge by employing mean field approximation
and deriving a macroscopic game-theoretic framework for autonomous vehicles traffic flow from
microscopic velocity control. The developed game is "mean field game (MFG)", which is essentially
the limiting differential game with an infinite number of agents. It is a micro-macro model which
allows one to define individuals on a microscopic level as rational utility-optimizing agents
while translating rich microscopic behaviors to macroscopic models. Despite a few studies on the
application of MFG to traffic flow models, this paper offers a systematic framework to apply MFG
to autonomous vehicle control from four aspects: (i) We first derive the mean field game as a continuum
version of discrete differential game; (ii) We develop a solution algorithm based on multigrid
preconditioned Newton's method to solve a mean field equilibrium; (iii) We construct a tuple of
discrete controls from the continuous mean field equilibrium and demonstrates its accuracy as
an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium to the original discrete differential game, so that those controls
can be deployed to individual autonomous vehicles in the context of discrete games. (iv) The derived
mean field game can also be treated as a macroscopic traffic flow model. We show its connections to
traditional LWR model and present some examples to illustrate traffic flow characteristics of
mean field game.
