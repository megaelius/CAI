This work introduces a compartment-based model for apparent soma and neurite density imaging (SANDI)
using non-invasive diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI). The existing conjecture in brain microstructure
imaging trough DW-MRI presents water diffusion in white (WM) and grey (GM) matter as restricted
diffusion in neurites, modelled by infinite cylinders of null radius embedded in the hindered extra-neurite
water. The extra-neurite pool in WM corresponds to water in the extra-axonal space, but in GM it combines
water in the extra-cellular space with water in soma. While several studies showed that this microstructure
model successfully describe DW-MRI data in WM and GM at b<3 ms/{\mum^2}, it has been also shown to
fail in GM at high b values (b>>3 ms/{\mum^2}). Here we hypothesize that the unmodelled soma compartment
may be responsible for this failure and propose SANDI as a new model of brain microstructure where
soma is explicitly included. We assess the effects of size and density of soma on the direction-averaged
DW-MRI signal at high b values and the regime of validity of the model using numerical simulations
and comparison with experimental data from mouse (bmax = 40 ms/{/mum^2}) and human (bmax = 10 ms/{\mum^2})
brain. We show that SANDI defines new contrasts representing new complementary information on
the brain cyto- and myelo-architecture. Indeed, we show for the first-time maps from 25 healthy
human subjects of MR soma and neurite signal fractions, that remarkably mirror contrasts of histological
images of brain cyto- and myelo-architecture. Although still under validation, SANDI might provide
new insight into tissue architecture by introducing a new set of biomarkers of potential great value
for biomedical applications and pure neuroscience.
