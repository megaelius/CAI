During the last ten years advances in open-source digital technology, used especially by data science,
led to very accessible ways how to obtain, store, process, analyze or share data in almost every human
activity. Data science tools bring not only transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility
in open science, but also give benefits in open education as learning tools for improving effectiveness
of instruction. Together with our pedagogical introduction and review of Jupyter as an interactive
multimedia learning tool, we present our three-years long research in the framework of a complex
mixed-methods approach which examines physics teachers' perception of Jupyter technology in
three groups: Ph.D. candidates in physics education research (PER) ($N = 9$), pre-service physics
teachers ($N = 33$) and in-service physics teachers ($N = 40$). Despite the fact that open-source
Jupyter notebooks are natural and easy as email or web, the results suggest that in-service teachers
are not prepared for Jupyter technology and open analysis, but positively accept open education
data presented via another open-source data science tool, R Shiny interactive web application,
as an important form of immediate feedback and learning about the quality of their instruction.
Simultaneously our instruction results in the frame of the Flipped Learning also indicate that
young beginning PER researchers and pre-service physics teachers can master key digital skills
to work with Jupyter technology appreciating its big impact on their learning, data and statistical
literacy or professional development. All results support the ongoing worldwide effort to implement
Jupyter in traditional education as a promising free open-source interactive learning tool to
foster learning process, especially for the upcoming young generation.
