Homeostasis refers to a phenomenon whereby the output $x_o$ of a system is approximately constant
on variation of an input $\mathcal{I}$. Homeostasis occurs frequently in biochemical networks
and in other networks of interacting elements where mathematical models are based on differential
equations associated to the network. These networks can be abstracted as digraphs $\mathcal{G}$
with a distinguished input node $\iota$, a different distinguished output node $o$, and a number
of regulatory nodes $\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_n$. In these models the input-output map $x_o(\mathcal{I})$
is defined by a stable equilibrium $X_0$ at $\mathcal{I}_0$. Stability implies that there is a stable
equilibrium $X(\mathcal{I})$ for each $\mathcal{I}$ near $\mathcal{I}_0$ and infinitesimal
homeostasis occurs at $\mathcal{I}_0$ when $(dx_o/d\mathcal{I})(\mathcal{I}_0) = 0$. We show
that there is an $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ homeostasis matrix $H(\mathcal{I})$ for which $dx_o/d\mathcal{I}
= 0$ if and only if $\det(H) = 0$. We use combinatorial matrix theory to factor the polynomial $\det(H)$
and thereby determine a menu of different types of possible homeostasis associated with each digraph
$\mathcal{G}$. Specifically, we prove that each factor corresponds to a subnetwork of $\mathcal{G}$.
The factors divide into two combinatorially defined classes: structural and appendage. Structural
factors correspond to feedforward motifs and appendage factors correspond to feedback motifs.
Finally, we discover an algorithm for determining the homeostatic subnetwork motif corresponding
to each factor of $\det(H)$ without performing numerical simulations on model equations. The algorithm
allows us to classify low degree factors. There are two types of degree 1 homeostasis (negative feedback
loops and kinetic or Haldane motifs) and there are two types of degree 2 homeostasis (feedforward
loops and a degree two appendage motif).
