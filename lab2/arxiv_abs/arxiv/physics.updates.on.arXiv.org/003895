Attosecond pulses in the soft-X-ray (SXR) to water-window energy region offer the tools for creating
and studying target specific localized inner-shell electrons or holes in materials, enable monitoring
or controlling charge and energy flows in a dynamic system on attosecond timescales. Recently,
a number of laboratories have reported generation of continuum harmonics in the hundred-electron-volt
to kilovolt region with few-cycle long-wavelength mid-infrared lasers. These harmonics have
the bandwidth to support pulses with duration of few- to few-ten attoseconds. But harmonics generated
in a gas medium have attochirps that cannot be fully compensated by materials over a broad spectral
range; thus, realistically what are the typical shortest attosecond pulses that one can generate?
To answer this question, it is essential that the temporal attosecond pulses be accurately characterized.
By re-analyzing the soft X-ray harmonics reported in three recent experiments \cite{chang_natcom2017,Thomas_OE2017,Bieger_2017PRX}
using a newly developed broadband phase retrieval algorithm, we show that their generated attosecond
pulses are all longer than about 60 as. Since broadband pulses tend to have high-order chirps away
from the spectral center of the pulse, the algorithm has to be able to retrieve accurately the phase
over the whole bandwidth. Our re-evaluated pulse durations are found to be longer than those previously
reported. We also introduce the autocorrelation (AC) of the streaking spectrogram. By comparing
the ACs from the experiments and from the retrieved SXR pulses, the accuracy of the retrieved results
can be directly visualized to ensure that correct phases have been obtained. Our retrieval method
is fast and accurate, and it shall provide a powerful tool for the metrology of few-ten-attosecond
pulses in the future.
