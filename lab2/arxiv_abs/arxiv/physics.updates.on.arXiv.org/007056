Standard dual-energy computed tomography (CT) uses two different X-ray energies to obtain energy-dependent
tissue attenuation information to allow quantitative material decomposition. The combined use
of dual-energy CT and positron emission tomography (PET) may provide a more comprehensive characterization
of disease states in cancer and many other diseases. However, the integration of dual-energy CT
with PET is not trivial, either requiring costly hardware upgrade or increasing radiation dose.
This paper proposes a novel dual-energy CT imaging method that is enabled by the already-available
PET data on PET/CT. Instead of using a second X-ray CT scan with a different energy, this method exploits
time-of-flight PET image reconstruction via the maximum likelihood attenuation and activity
(MLAA) algorithm to obtain a 511 keV gamma-ray attenuation image from PET emission data. The high-energy
gamma-ray CT image is then combined with the low-energy X-ray CT of PET/CT to provide a pair of dual-energy
CT images. A major challenge with the standard MLAA reconstruction is the high noise present in the
reconstructed 511 keV attenuation map, which does not compromise the PET activity reconstruction
too much but significantly affects the performance of the gamma-ray CT for material decomposition.
To overcome the problem, we further propose a kernel MLAA algorithm to exploit the prior information
from the available X-ray CT image. We conducted a computer simulation to test the concept and algorithm
for the task of material decomposition. The simulation results indicate that this PET-enabled
dual-energy CT method is promising for quantitative material decomposition. The proposed method
can be readily implemented on time-of-flight PET/CT scanners to enable simultaneous PET and dual-energy
CT imaging.
