Non-equilibrium wall turbulence with mean-flow three-dimensionality is ubiquitous in geophysical
and engineering flows. Under these conditions, turbulence may experience a counter-intuitive
depletion of the turbulent stresses, which has important implications for modelling and control.
Yet, current turbulence theories have been established mainly for statistically two-dimensional
equilibrium flows and are unable to predict the reduction in the Reynolds stress magnitude. In the
present work, we propose a multiscale model which explains the response of non-equilibrium wall-bounded
turbulence under the imposition of three-dimensional strain. The analysis is performed via direct
numerical simulation of transient three-dimensional turbulent channels subjected to a sudden
lateral pressure gradient at friction Reynolds numbers up to 1,000. We show that the flow regimes
and scaling properties of the Reynolds stress are consistent with a model comprising momentum-carrying
eddies with sizes and time scales proportional to their distance to the wall. We further demonstrate
that the reduction in Reynolds stress follows a spatially and temporally self-similar evolution
caused by the relative horizontal displacement between the core of the momentum-carrying eddies
and the flow layer underneath. Inspection of the flow energetics reveals that this mechanism is
associated with lower levels of pressure-strain correlation which ultimately inhibits the generation
of Reynolds stress. Finally, we assess the ability of the state-of-the-art wall-modelled large-eddy
simulation to predict non-equilibrium, three-dimensional flows.
