A coarse-graining framework is implemented to analyze nonlinear processes, measure energy transfer
rates and map out the energy pathways from simulated global ocean data. Traditional tools to measure
the energy cascade from turbulence theory, such as spectral flux or spectral transfer rely on the
assumption of statistical homogeneity, or at least a large separation between the scales of motion
and the scales of statistical inhomogeneity. The coarse-graining framework allows for probing
the fully nonlinear dynamics simultaneously in scale and in space, and is not restricted by those
assumptions. This paper describes how the framework can be applied to ocean flows. Energy transfer
between scales is not unique due to a gauge freedom. Here, it is argued that a Galilean invariant subfilter
scale (SFS) flux is a suitable quantity to properly measure energy scale-transfer in the Ocean.
It is shown that the SFS definition can yield answers that are qualitatively different from traditional
measures that conflate spatial transport with the scale-transfer of energy. The paper presents
geographic maps of the energy scale-transfer that are both local in space and allow quasi-spectral,
or scale-by-scale, dynamics to be diagnosed. Utilizing a strongly eddying simulation of flow in
the North Atlantic Ocean, it is found that an upscale energy transfer does not hold everywhere. Indeed
certain regions, near the Gulf Stream and in the Equatorial Counter Current have a marked downscale
transfer. Nevertheless, on average an upscale transfer is a reasonable mean description of the
extra-tropical energy scale-transfer over regions of O(10^3) kilometers in size.
