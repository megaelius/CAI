Interconnection of alternative equations of conservation of the momentum related with different
interpretations of equations of the electromagnetic field is an essential aspect of the Abraham-Minkowski
controversy, which is associated in the first place with rivalry of alternative definitions of
optical momentum of the electromagnetic wave in a medium. Assuming significance of alternative
equations of momentum conservation in accord with their interconnection, potential functional
equivalence of alternative descriptions of optical momentum is examined in the context of the radiation
pressure. In accordance with conducted examination, the material derivative of the momentum of
a closed medium-field system is preserved in transformations linking alternative equations of
momentum conservation, whereas the optical momentum is changed in compliance with alternative
approaches. It is found that Abraham's, Minkowski's, and the total momenta are inherently linked
with specific ponderomotive forces, which are not interchangeable in spite of interconnection
of involved forms of field equations and equations of conservation of the momentum. Interconnection
of alternative macroscopic approaches is clarified using microscopic interpretation of the energy
and the momentum of the electromagnetic wave in a host medium. Contradictory references to microscopic
aspects associated with alternative approaches, including assumptions in regard to manifestation
of the Lorentz force on the level of macroscopic description and nature of inertial properties of
electromagnetic wave in a host medium, are evaluated in this context. It leads to clarification
of properties of ponderomotive forces as well as concepts of momentum and pseudomomentum of the
electromagnetic wave in a host medium, which are essential for explanation of interconnection
of alternative macroscopic approaches.
