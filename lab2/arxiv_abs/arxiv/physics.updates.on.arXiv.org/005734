Industrial symbiosis involves creating integrated cycles of by-products and waste between networks
of industrial actors in order to maximize economic value, while at the same time minimizing environmental
strain. In such a network, the global environmental strain is no longer equal to the sum of the environmental
strain of the individual actors, but it is dependent on how well the network performs as a whole. The
development of methods to understand, manage or optimize such networks remains an open issue. In
this paper we put forward a simulation model of by-product flow between industrial actors. The goal
is to introduce a method for modelling symbiotic exchanges from a macro perspective. The model takes
into account the effect of two main mechanisms on a multi-objective optimization of symbiotic processes.
First it allows us to study the effect of geographical properties of the economic system, said differently,
where actors are divided in space. Second, it allows us to study the effect of clustering complementary
actors together as a function of distance, by means of a spatial correlation between the actors'
by-products. Our simulations unveil patterns that are relevant for macro-level policy. First,
our results show that the geographical properties are an important factor for the macro performance
of symbiotic processes. Second, spatial correlations, which can be interpreted as planned clusters
such as Eco-industrial parks, can lead to a very effective macro performance, but only if these are
strictly implemented. Finally, we provide a proof of concept by comparing the model to real world
data from the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register database using georeferencing
of the companies in the dataset. This work opens up research opportunities in interactive data-driven
models and platforms to support real-world implementation of industrial symbiosis.
