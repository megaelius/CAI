The determination of the electron neutrino mass by electron capture in $^{163}$Ho relies on a precise
understanding of the deexcitation of a core hole after an electron capture event. We here present
an \textit{ab intio} calculation of the electron capture spectrum in $^{163}$Ho, including all
intra-atomic decay channels into bound-states. We use theoretical methods developed for the calculation
of core level spectroscopy on correlated electron compounds. Our comparison critically tests
the reality of these theories. We find that relativistic interactions beyond the Dirac equation,
i.e. quantum-electro dynamics, only lead to minor shifts of the spectral peaks. The electronic
relaxation after an electron capture event due to the changed nuclear potential leads to a mixing
of different edges, but due to conservation of angular momentum of each scattered electron, no additional
structures emerge. Many-body Coulomb interactions lead to the formation of multiplets and to additional
peaks with multiple core-holes due to Auger decay. Multiplets crucially change the appearance
of the resonances on a Rydberg energy scale. The additional structures due to Auger decay are, although
clearly visible, relatively weak compared to the one core hole states and accidentally far away
from the end-point region of the spectrum. As the end-point of the spectrum is effected most by the
neutrino mass these additional states do not influence the statistics for determining the neutrino
mass directly. The multiplet broadening and Auger shake-up of the main core-level edges do change
the apparent line-width and accompanying lifetime of these edges, thereby invalidating experimentally
obtained lifetimes at the resonance for regions far away from the resonance.
