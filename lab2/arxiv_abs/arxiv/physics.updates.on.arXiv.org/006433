The use of active interrogation (AI) to induce delayed neutron emission is a well-established technique
for the characterization of special nuclear materials (SNM). Delayed neutrons have isotope-characteristic
spectral and temporal signatures, which provide the basis for isotope identification. However,
in bulk materials that contain an appreciable fissile (e.g., $^{235}$U or $^{233}$U) fraction,
such as highly-enriched uranium (HEU), delayed neutrons have a high probability of inducing additional
fissions. As a result, the overall delayed neutron signature consists of two distinct components:
the "primary" delayed neutrons (emitted directly by fission fragments), and the "secondary prompt"
fission neutrons produced in fission induced by primary delayed neutrons. These prompt products
differ from "primary" delayed neutrons both in their energy spectra and in the presence of coincident
radiation released by the parent fission event. The presence and relative quantity of prompt products
from delayed fission depend on the cross-section of the material in the energy range of delayed neutrons,
which may differ significantly between isotopes, thus providing an exploitable means for isotope
differentiation. In this work, we demonstrate two experimental approaches for discriminating
between $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U isotopes based on the measurement of delayed neutron-induced
fission products. First, HEU and depleted uranium objects are differentiated through the detection
of high-energy prompt neutrons from delayed fission using both recoil-based organic liquid scintillators
and thermalization spectra from a custom-built capture-gated composite detector. Secondly,
coincident radiation measurements are used as the basis for discrimination by comparing the overall
rates and time evolution of fission events when delayed neutrons are present.
