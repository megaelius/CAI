Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films possess different chemical and physical properties based
on surface modification. The bond structure of pristine PDMS films and plasma treated PDMS films
differ in a particular region of silicate bonds. We have studied the surface physical properties
of pristine PDMS films and plasma treated PDMS films through optical technique. It is already known
that plasma treated PDMS films forms very thin SiO2 layer on its surface. Due to difference in coefficient
of thermal expansion of the surface SiO2 and the remaining bulk layer, the SiO2 layer develops cracks.
These formations are explored to characterize PDMS surface by observing intensity of scattered
light while the films are stretched. Pristine PDMS films do not show such optical scattering. Further
the intensity measurements were repeated over period of time to monitor surface properties with
time. It was observed that plasma treated PDMS film; the scattered light intensity is linearly dependent
on the applied force for stretching. After a substantial time, scattering intensity is reduced
to the value which is almost equal to that of pristine PDMS surface. It is proposed that basic light
scattering through plasma treated PDMS occurs due to the decrease in the width of the cracks when
the PDMS film is stretched. The change in the scattering property of plasma treated PDMS surface
over time could be attributed to healing of cracks by the migration of polymer chain molecules from
the bulk to the surface. It is also reported that with reference to various bonds present on surface
plasma treated PDMS surface regains its original properties as that of pristine PDMS with time.
Therefore the optical technique could be employed to study surface characteristics of PDMS surface
as an alternative approach to conventional spectroscopic techniques.
