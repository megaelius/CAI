We present a theoretical and numerical study on the (in)stability of the interface between two immiscible
liquids, i.e., viscous fingering, in angled Hele-Shaw cells across a range of capillary numbers
($Ca$). We consider two types of angled Hele-Shaw cells: diverging cells with a positive depth gradient
and converging cells with a negative depth gradient, and compare those against parallel cells without
a depth gradient. A modified linear stability analysis is employed to derive an expression for the
growth rate of perturbations on the interface and for the critical capillary number ($Ca_c$) for
such tapered Hele-Shaw cells with small gap gradients. Based on this new expression for $Ca_c$,
a three-regime theory is formulated to describe the interface (in)stability: (i) in Regime I, the
growth rate is always negative, thus the interface is stable; (ii) in Regime II, the growth rate remains
zero (parallel cells), changes from negative to positive (converging cells), or from positive
to negative (diverging cells), thus the interface (in)stability possibly changes type at some
location in the cell; (iii) in Regime III, the growth rate is always positive, thus the interface
is unstable. We conduct three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of the full Navier--Stokes
equations, using a phase field method to enforce surface tension at the interface, to verify the
theory and explore the effect of depth gradient on the interface (in)stability. We demonstrate
that the depth gradient has only a slight influence in Regime I, and its effect is most pronounced
in Regime III. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the stability diagram derived from theoretical
considerations versus the one obtained from direct numerical simulations.
