Recent experiments demonstrated strongly directional coupling of light into waveguide modes.
We identify here the mechanisms behind this effect. We consider emitters near a waveguide, either
centered on the median plane of the waveguide, or displaced from such plane. We show that, independently
of the displacement, the directionality is mostly due to a mirror symmetry breaking caused by the
axial character of the angular momentum of the emitted light. The sign of the angular momentum along
an axis transverse to the waveguide determines the preferential coupling direction. The degree
of directionality grows exponentially as the magnitude of such transverse angular momentum increases
linearly. We trace this exponential dependence back to a property of the evanescent angular spectrum
of the emissions. A binary and less pronounced directional coupling effect due to the chiral character
of the handedness of the emission is possible when the displacement of the emitter breaks another
of the mirror symmetries of the waveguide. We find a selection rule that allows or prevents the coupling
of centered electric(magnetic) multipolar emissions onto the waveguide modes. We also show that
the selection of a different angular momentum axis made in some experiments causes significant
differences in the way in which directionality depends on angular momentum. We then use these differences
to propose an experiment featuring a transverse magnetic bias that allows to aggregate the directional
emissions from quantum dots on top of waveguides. Our symmetry-based results apply to any emitted
multipolar order, clarify the spin-momentum locking concept, and generalize it to an exponentially-strong
locking between the transverse angular momentumand the preferential coupling direction.
