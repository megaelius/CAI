Metastable states created by electron or hole capture in crystal defects are widely used in dosimetry
and photonic applications. Feldspar, the most abundant mineral in the Earth crust (>50%), generates
metastable states with lifetimes of millions of years upon exposure to ionizing radiation. Although
feldspar is widely used in dosimetry and geochronometry, the creation of metastable states and
charge transfer across them is poorly understood. Understanding such phenomena requires next-generation
methods based on high-resolution, site-selective probing of the metastable states. Recent studies
using site-selective techniques such as photoluminescence (PL), and radioluminescence (RL)
at 7 K have revealed that feldspar exhibits two near-infrared (NIR) emission bands peaking at 880
nm and 955 nm, which are believed to arise from the principal electron-trapping states. Here, we
map for the first time the electron-trapping states in potassium-rich feldspar using spectrally-resolved
cathodoluminescence microscopy at a spatial resolution of around 6 to 22 micrometer. Each pixel
probed by a scanning electron microscope provides us a cathodoluminescence spectrum (SEM-CL)
in the range 600-1000 nm, and elemental data from energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy.
We conclude that the two NIR emissions are spatially variable and, therefore, originate from different
sites. This conclusion contradicts the existing model that the two emissions arise from two different
excited states of a principal trap. Moreover, we are able to link the individual NIR emission peaks
with the geochemical variations (K, Na and Fe concentration), and propose a cluster model that explains
the quenching of the NIR emission by Fe4+.
