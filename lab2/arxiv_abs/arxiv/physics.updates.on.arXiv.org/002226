The flow of a liquid film over an inclined plane is frequently found in nature and industry, and, under
some conditions, instabilities in the free surface may appear. These instabilities are initially
two-dimensional surface waves, known as Kapitza waves. Surface waves are important to many industrial
applications. For example, liquid films with surface waves are employed to remove heat from solid
surfaces. The initial phase of the instability is governed by the Orr-Sommerfeld equation and the
appropriate boundary conditions; therefore, the fast and accurate solution of this equation is
useful for industry. This paper presents a spectral method to solve the Orr-Sommerfeld equation
with free surface boundary conditions. Our numerical approach is based on a Galerkin method with
Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, making it possible to express the Orr-Sommerfeld equation
and their boundary conditions as a generalized eigenvalue problem. The main advantages of the present
spectral method when compared to others such as, for instance, spectral collocation, are its stability
and its readiness in including the boundary conditions in the discretized equations. We compare
our numerical results with analytical solutions based on Perturbation Methods, which are valid
only for long wave instabilities, and show that the results agree in the region of validity of the
long-wave hypothesis. Far from this region, our results are still valid. In addition, we compare
our results with published experimental results and the agreement is very good. The method is stable,
fast, and capable to solve initial instabilities in free surface flows.
