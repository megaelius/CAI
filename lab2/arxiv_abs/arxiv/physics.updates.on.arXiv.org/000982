Multiple electron processes occur widely in atoms, molecules, clusters, and condensed matters
when they are interacting with energetic particles or intense laser fields. In this work, a unified
and accurate theoretical formalism is proposed on the direct multielectron processes of atoms
including the multiple Auger decay and multiple ionization by an impact of an energetic electron
or a photon based on the atomic collision theory described by a correlated many-body Green's function.
Such a practical treatment is made possible due to different coherence features of the particles
(matter waves) in the initial and final states. We first explain how the coherence characteristics
of the ejected continuum electrons is largely destructed, by taking the electron impact direct
double ionization process as an example. This process is completely different from the single ionization
where the complete interference can be maintained. The detailed expressions are obtained for the
energy correlations among the continuum electrons and energy resolved differential and integral
cross sections according to the separation of knock-out and shake-off mechanisms for the electron
impact direct double ionization, direct double and triple Auger decay, and double and triple photoionization
processes. The approach is applied to investigate the electron impact double ionization processes
of C$^+$, N$^+$, and O$^+$, the direct double and triple Auger decay of the K-shell excited states
of C$^{+}$ $1s2s^22p^2$ $^2D$ and $^2P$, and the double and triple photoionization of lithium.
Comparisons with available experimental and theoretical results show that our proposed theoretical
formalism is accurate and effective in treating the atomic multielectron processes.
