Single molecule superresolution microscopy was used to follow the translational diffusion of
a key neurotransmitter receptor protein, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Individual trajectories
and ensemble averages were obtained from single particle tracking of receptors labeled with a monovalent
ligand, fluorescent bungarotoxin or a monoclonal antibody. Bayesian inference analysis of the
mean square displacements yielded the relative probabilities of the highly heterogeneous mobile
populations, a combination of Brownian, anomalous subdiffusive and constrained motions, the
proportions of which were differentially modified by cholesterol levels. At the ensemble level,
trajectories exhibited weak ergodicity breaking, dominated by anomalous subdiffusion. When
the trajectories were separated into subpopulations according to their diffusivity, most of them
were found to be ergodic, suggesting that ergodicity breaking stemmed from their heterogeneous
nature. The distribution of the trajectories turning angles, markedly anticorrelated in the subdiffusive
tracks, appeared to conform to the obstructed diffusion model, characteristically observed in
the presence of obstacles. At the single track level, walks were transiently interrupted by intervals
of confinement in small ellipsoidal nanodomains with major semi-axis less than 60 nm. In conclusion,
a combination of non ergodic and ergodic anomalous mobilities, modulated by cholesterol, coexists
with Brownian diffusion. The signature motional behavior at the single-trajectory level, i.e.
the nanoscale heterogeneity, underlies the heterogeneous anomalous dynamics at the ensemble
level in the complex plasma membrane environment.
