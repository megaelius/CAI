The propagation of waves through transmission eigenchannels in complex media is emerging as a new
frontier of condensed matter and wave physics. A crucial step towards constructing a complete theory
of eigenchannels is to demonstrate their spatial structure in any dimension and their wave-coherence
nature. Here, we present new spatial properties of the radiation propagating in such channels in
diffusive random media. We show that the transverse (with respect to the direction of propagation)
intensity distribution depends on the aspect ratio of a sample. As the width of the sample increases,
so that it transforms from quasi one-dimensional (1D) to two-dimensional (2D) geometry, the shape
of the eigenvector of the transmission matrix (incoming signal) undergoes a delocalization-localization
crossover, which results in the formation of a transverse-localized structure of the eigenchannel.
As this takes place, the dependence on the longitudinal coordinate does not change and is given by
the same analytical expression as that for quasi-1D. This expression is super-universal in the
sense that, with a minimal modification, it describes also the spatial structures of localized
resonances in strictly 1D random systems. A remarkable intrinsic property of the eigenchannels
is that, notwithstanding the diffusive nature of the medium, a wave, being localized in the input
remains so in the course of propagation along the entire sample. The obtained results suggest that
despite the diversity of wave phenomena in different dimensions, the underlying physics of eigenchannels
might include universal key ingredients, which are of 1D nature and are closely related to the resonances.
Our findings open up a way to tailor the spatial energy density distribution in opaque materials.
