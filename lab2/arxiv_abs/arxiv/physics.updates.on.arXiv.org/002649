This paper presents a homogenisation-based constitutive model to describe the effective tran-
sient diffusion behaviour in heterogeneous media in which there is a large contrast between the
phase diffusivities. In this case mobile species can diffuse over long distances through the fast
phase in the time scale of diffusion in the slow phase. At macroscopic scale, contrasted phase diffusivities
lead to a memory effect that cannot be properly described by classical Fick's second law. Here we
obtain effective governing equations through a two-scale approach for composite materials consisting
of a fast matrix and slow inclusions. The micro-macro transition is similar to first-order computational
homogenisation, and involves the solution of a transient diffusion boundary-value problem in
a Representative Volume Element of the microstructure. Different from computational homogenisation,
we propose a semi-analytical mean-field estimate of the composite response based on the exact solution
for a single inclusion developed in our previous work [Brassart, L., Stainier, L., 2018. Effective
transient behaviour of inclusions in diffusion problems. Z. Angew Math. Mech. 98, 981-998]. A key
outcome of the model is that the macroscopic concentration is not one-to-one related to the macroscopic
chemical potential, but obeys a local kinetic equation associated with diffusion in the slow phase.
The history-dependent macroscopic response admits a representation based on internal variables,
enabling efficient time integration. We show that the local chemical kinetics can result in non-Fickian
behaviour in macroscale boundary-value problems.
