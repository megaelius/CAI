We present results on the effect of dispersed droplets in vertical natural convection (VC) using
direct numerical simulations based on a two-way fully coupled Euler-Lagrange approach with a liquid
phase and a dispersed droplets phase. For increasing thermal driving, characterised by the Rayleigh
number, $Ra$, of the two analysed droplet volume fractions, $\alpha = 5\times10^{-3}$ and $\alpha
= 2\times 10^{-2}$, we find non-monotonic responses to the overall heat fluxes, characterised
by the Nusselt number, $Nu$. The $Nu$ number is larger when the droplets are thermally coupled to
the liquid. However, $Nu$ retains the effective scaling exponents that are close to the ${1/4}$-laminar
VC scaling, suggesting that the heat transport is still modulated by thermal boundary layers. Local
analyses reveal the non-monotonic trends of local heat fluxes and wall-shear stresses: Whilst
regions of high heat fluxes are correlated to increased wall-shear stresses, the spatio-temporal
distribution and magnitude of the increase is non-universal, implying that the overall heat transport
is obscured by competing mechanisms. Most crucially, we find that the transport mechanisms inherently
depend on the dominance of droplet driving to thermal driving that can quantified by (i) the bubblance
parameter $b$, which measures the ratio of energy produced by the dispersed phase and the energy
of the background turbulence, and (ii) $Ra_d/Ra$, where $Ra_d$ is the droplet Rayleigh number,
which we introduce in this paper. When $b \lesssim O(10^{-1})$ and $Ra_d/Ra \lesssim O(100)$, the
$Nu$ scaling is expected to recover to the VC scaling without droplets, and comparison with $b$ and
$Ra_d/Ra$ from our data supports this notion.
