Motion management is a critical component of image guidance radiotherapy for lung cancer. We previously
proposed a scheme using kV scattered x-ray photons for marker-less real-time image guidance in
lung cancer radiotherapy. This study reports our recently progress using the photon counting detection
technique to demonstrate potential feasibility of this method and using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
and ray-tracing calculations to characterize the performance. In our scheme, a thin slice of x-ray
beam was directed to the target and we measured the outgoing scattered photons using a photon counting
detector with a parallel-hole collimator to establish the correspondence between detector pixels
and scatter positions. Image corrections of geometry, beam attenuation and scattering angle were
performed to convert the raw image to the actual image of Compton attenuation coefficient. We set
up a MC simulation system using an in-house developed GPU-based MC package modeling the image formation
process. We also performed ray-tracing calculations to investigate the impacts of imaging system
geometry on resulting image resolution. The experiment demonstrated feasibility of using a photon
counting detector to measure scattered x-ray photons and generate the proposed scattered x-ray
image. After correction, x-ray scattering image intensity and Compton scattering attenuation
coefficient were linearly related, with R2=0.91. Contrast to Noise Ratios of different objects
were improved and the values in experimental results and MC simulation results agreed with each
other. Ray-tracing calculations revealed the dependence of image resolution on imaging geometry.
The image resolution increases with reduced source to object distance and increased collimator
height. The study demonstrated potential feasibility of using scattered x-ray imaging as a real-time
image guidance method in radiation therapy.
