In this paper, a low-noise CMOS image sensor with enhanced dynamic range (DR), using an in-pixel
chopping technique, is presented. The proposed in-pixel chopping technique is used to reduce the
low-frequency or 1/f noise of the source follower (SF) in an active pixel sensor (APS), which is a
major component of the temporal noise. A conventional 3T active pixel, with n-well/p-sub photodiode
(PD), is modified to implement a chopper inside a pixel. A single minimum sized nMOS transistor is
used in each pixel, without much compromising in the fill-factor (FF). Using chopping action the
low-frequency noise of the source follower is modulated to the chopping frequency (f ch ) which is
much higher than the maximum frequency of the input signal frequency band. The up-converted low-frequency
noise is eliminated using a column level low-pass filter (LPF), in the later stage. The reduction
in the temporal noise also results in an enhanced dynamic range of the image sensor. In addition,
the readout consists of a column level high gain chopper amplifier also reduces the non-linearity
of the source follower. To validate the proposed technique a prototype sensor consists of a 128x128
sized pixel array with in-pixel chopping and column level read-out circuitry, is fabricated in
AMS 0.35 {\mu}m CMOS OPTO process. The pixel pitch is 10.5 um (horizontal and vertical both) with
a fill-factor of around 30%. The temporal noise is measured as 280 uVrms at the chopping frequency
(fch) of 8 MHz, which shows a reduction in the noise power by 11 dB. Due to the reduced noise floor, the
dynamic range is enhanced from 65 dB to 76 dB, using the proposed technique.
