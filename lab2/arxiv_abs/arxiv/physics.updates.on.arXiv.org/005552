Conductive hearing loss, due to middle ear pathologies or traumas, affects more than 5% of the population
worldwide. Passive prostheses to replace the ossicular chain mainly rely on piston-like titanium
and/or hydroxyapatite devices, which in the long term suffer from extrusion. Although the basic
shape of such devices always consists of a base for contact with the eardrum and a stem to have mechanical
connection with the residual bony structures, a plethora of topologies have been proposed, mainly
to help surgical positioning. In this work, we optimize the topology of a total ossicular replacement
prosthesis, by maximizing the global stiffness and under the smallest possible volume constraint
that ensures material continuity. This investigation optimizes the prosthesis topology in response
to static displacement loads with amplitudes that normally occur during sound stimulation in a
frequency range between 100 Hz and 10 kHz. Following earlier studies, we discuss how the presence
and arrangement of holes on the surface of the prosthesis plate in contact with the umbo affect the
overall geometry. Finally, we validate the designs through a finite-element model, in which we
assess the prosthesis performance upon dynamic sound pressure loads by considering four different
constitutive materials: titanium, cortical bone, silk, and collagen/hydroxyapatite. The results
show that the selected prostheses present, almost independently of their constitutive material,
a vibroacustic behavior close to that of the native ossicular chain, with a slight almost constant
positive shift that reaches a maximum of 5 dB close to 1 kHz. This work represents a reference for the
development of a new generation of middle ear prostheses with non-conventional topologies for
fabrication via additive manufacturing technologies or ultraprecision machining in order to
create patient-specific devices.
