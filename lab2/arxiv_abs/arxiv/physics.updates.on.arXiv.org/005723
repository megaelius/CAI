Materials representation plays a key role in machine learning based prediction of materials properties
and new materials discovery. Currently both graph and 3D voxel representation methods are based
on the heterogeneous elements of the crystal structures. Here, we propose to use electronic charge
density (ECD) as a generic unified 3D descriptor for materials property prediction with the advantage
of possessing close relation with the physical and chemical properties of materials. We developed
an ECD based 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting elastic properties of materials,
in which CNNs can learn effective hierarchical features with multiple convolving and pooling operations.
Extensive benchmark experiments over 2,170 Fm-3m face-centered-cubic (FCC) materials show that
our ECD based CNNs can achieve good performance for elasticity prediction. Especially, our CNN
models based on the fusion of elemental Magpie features and ECD descriptors achieved the best 5-fold
cross-validation performance. More importantly, we showed that our ECD based CNN models can achieve
significantly better extrapolation performance when evaluated over non-redundant datasets
where there are few neighbor training samples around test samples. As additional validation, we
evaluated the predictive performance of our models on 329 materials of space group Fm-3m by comparing
to DFT calculated values, which shows better prediction power of our model for bulk modulus than
shear modulus. Due to the unified representation power of ECD, it is expected that our ECD based CNN
approach can also be applied to predict other physical and chemical properties of crystalline materials.
