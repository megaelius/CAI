We study continuous minimizers with velocity discontinuities for the hydrogenoid atomic model
of the variational electromagnetic two-body problem with past and future boundary conditions.
These broken extrema satisfy the Euler-Lagrange neutral differential delay equations with state-dependent
deviating arguments along regular segments. At points where velocities are discontinuous, broken
extrema satisfy the Weierstrass-Erdmann corner conditions that energies and momenta are continuous.
We construct periodic broken extrema near some circular orbits, using solutions of the neutral
differential delay equations along regular segments and a variational approximation for the spiky
boundary-layer segments. A discrete set of finitely measured neighbourhoods of periodic orbits
result from the Weierstrass-Erdmann stabilization of explosive tangent modes near some circular
orbits. The Weierstrass-Erdmann conditions are further compatible with the requirement of vanishing
far-fields, thus creating finitely measured neighbourhoods of periodic orbits with vanishing
far-fields right at the atomic magnitude. We vary the mass ratio by three orders of magnitude, thus
studying the atomic models for hydrogen, muonium and positronium. In each case the broken extrema
have magnitudes in quantitative agreement with experiment and quantum mechanics, i.e., the spacings
between consecutive discrete orbital angular momenta agree with Planck's constant within thirty-percent,
while orbital frequencies agree with a corresponding spectroscopic line within a few percent.
Last, we discuss the extension of Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics to variational electrodynamics,
discuss the spiky multipliers of the combined Weierstrass-Erdmann conditions and prove the well-posedness
of the two-body boundary-value problem with near-circular boundary segments.
