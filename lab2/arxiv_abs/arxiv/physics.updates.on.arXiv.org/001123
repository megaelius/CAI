A semi-analytical study of the dynamics of incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid past a circular
cylinder with zero surface shear stress has been performed. Essentially, the modified flow field
is considered to be a perturbed flow field over the irrotational flow description around a circular
cylinder in an uniform cross flow. At finite Reynolds number, the perturbation over irrotational
flow field is confined within a thin boundary layer, rear stagnation and wake regions. Equations
governing the flow-field in boundary layer are linearized Navier-Stokes equations which is solved
by adopting analytical route. Solution is shown to be superposition of infinite self-similar terms.
Behind the circular cylinder, a stagnation region is formed where the perturbation and irrotational
flow velocity components are shown to be of equal order. Vorticity produced in boundary layer is
convected downstream through stagnation region to form a narrow wake. Similar to boundary layer
analysis, governing equation in wake is also linearized to facilitate the analytical study. Solution
in wake region is obtained by matching the solution from boundary layer near the stagnation region.
Far wake solution is shown to be consistent with the leading order drag coefficient estimated from
the momentum deficit in the far wake. Next, drag coefficient is estimated by calculating the net-dissipation
over the entire flow field. Asymptotic expansion of drag coefficient in terms of boundary layer
thickness is shown to have a logarithmic singularity. We show that at very high Reynolds number,
flow past a circular cylinder with shear-free boundary will cause a net increase in dissipation
of energy over the viscous irrotational flow, which stands in stark contrast to the case of spherical
geometry (Moore[1]). Results from present analysis is validated against computational results.
