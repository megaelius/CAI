Characterizing the properties of groundwater aquifers is essential for predicting aquifer response
and managing groundwater resources. In this work, we develop a high-dimensional scalable Bayesian
inversion framework governed by a three-dimensional quasi-static linear poroelastic model to
characterize lateral permeability variations in groundwater aquifers. We determine the maximum
a posteriori (MAP) point of the posterior permeability distribution from centimeter-level surface
deformation measurements obtained from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). The
scalability of our method to high parameter dimension is achieved through the use of adjoint-based
derivatives, inexact Newton methods to determine the MAP point, and a Mat\'ern class sparse prior
precision operator. Together, these guarantee that the MAP point is found at a cost, measured in
number of forward/adjoint poroelasticity solves, that is independent of the parameter dimension.
We apply our methodology to a test case for a municipal well in Mesquite, Nevada, in which InSAR and
GPS surface deformation data are available. We solve problems with up to 320,824 state variable
degrees of freedom (DOFs) and 16,896 parameter DOFs. A consistent treatment of noise level is employed
so that the aquifer characterization result does not depend on the pixel spacing of surface deformation
data. Our results show that the use of InSAR data significantly improves characterization of lateral
aquifer heterogeneity, and the InSAR-based aquifer characterization recovers complex lateral
displacement trends observed by independent daily GPS measurements.
