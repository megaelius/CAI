The acoustic bubble is an example of a highly nonlinear system which is the building block of several
applications and phenomena ranging from underwater acoustics to sonochemistry and medicine.
Nonlinear behavior of bubbles, and most importantly 1/2 order subharmonics (SH), are used to increase
the contrast to tissue ratio (CTR) in diagnostic ultrasound (US) and to monitor bubble mediated
therapeutic US. It is shown experimentally and numerically that when bubbles are sonicated with
their SH resonance frequency (fsh=2fr where fr is the linear resonance frequency), SHs are generated
at the lowest excitation pressure. SHs then increase rapidly with pressure increase and reach an
upper limit of the achievable SH signal strength. Numerous studies have investigated the pressure
threshold of SH oscillations; however, conditions to enhance the saturation level of SHs has not
been investigated. In this paper nonlinear dynamics of bubbles excited by frequencies in the range
of fr<f<2fr is studied for different sizes of bubbles (400nm-8 micron). We show that the SH resonance
frequency is pressure dependent and decreases as pressure increases. When a bubble is sonicated
with its pressure dependent SH resonance frequency, oscillations undergo a saddle node bifurcation
from a P1 or P2 regime to a P2 oscillation regime with higher amplitude. The saddle node bifurcation
is concomitant with over saturation of the SH and UH amplitude and eventual enhancement of the upper
limit of SH and UH strength (e.g. $\approx$ 7 dB in UH amplitude). This can increase the CTR and signal
to noise ratio in applications. Here, we show that the highest non-destructive SH amplitude occurs
when f~=1.5-1.8fr.
