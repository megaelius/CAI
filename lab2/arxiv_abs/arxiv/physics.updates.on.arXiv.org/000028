We derive a general formalism to model the polariton states resulting from the radiation-matter
interaction between an arbitrary number of excitonic transitions in semiconductor quantum dots
and photon modes in a photonic crystal structure in which the quantum dots are embedded. The Maxwell
equations, including the linear nonlocal susceptibility of the exciton transitions in the quantum
dots, are cast into an eigenvalue problem, which can be applied to any structure whose photon modes
can be computed with reliable accuracy, and in addition naturally allows for disorder effects to
be taken into account. We compute realistic photon modes using Bloch-mode expansion. As example
systems, we study typical InGaAs quantum dots in a GaAs photonic crystal structures -- an $Ln$ cavity
or a $\mathit{W1}$ waveguide. For a single dot, we reproduce known analytical results, while for
the two dot case, we study the radiative excitation transfer mechanism and characterize its strength,
the dependence on the detuning between quantum dot and photon modes, and the dependence on inter-dot
distance. We find in particular that the inter-dot radiative coupling strength can reach $100 \mu{eV}$
in a short cavity, and its decay with distance in longer cavities and waveguides is determined by
the group velocity of the exchanged photons and their radiative lifetime. We also show that, for
an $Ln$ cavity of increasing length, the radiative excitation transfer mechanism is subject to
a crossover from a regime where a single photon mode is dominating, to a multi-mode regime -- occurring
around $\mathit{n}$ = 150 for the system under study.
