This work uses the long-wavelength limit to compute LSPR response of biosensors, expanding the
open-source PyGBe code to compute the extinction cross-section of metallic nanoparticles in the
presence of any target for sensing. The target molecule is represented by a surface mesh, based on
its crystal structure. PyGBe is research software for continuum electrostatics, written in Python
with computationally expensive parts accelerated on GPU hardware, via PyCUDA. It is also accelerated
algorithmically via a treecode that offers O(N log N) computational complexity. These features
allow PyGBe to handle problems with half a million boundary elements or more. Using a model problem
consisting of an isolated silver nanosphere in an electric field, our results show grid convergence
as 1/N, and accurate computation of the extinction cross-section as a function of wavelength (compared
with an analytical solution). For a model of a sensor-analyte system, consisting of a spherical
silver nanoparticle and a set of bovine serum albumin (BSA) proteins, our results again obtain grid
convergence as 1/N (with respect to the Richardson extrapolated value). Computing the LSPR response
as a function of wavelength in the presence of BSA proteins captures a red-shift of 0.5 nm in the resonance
frequency due to the presence of the analytes at 1-nm distance. The final result is a sensitivity
study of the biosensor model, obtaining the shift in resonance frequency for various distances
between the proteins and the nanoparticle. All results in this paper are fully reproducible, and
we have deposited in archival data repositories all the materials needed to run the computations
again and re-create the figures. PyGBe is open source under a permissive license and openly developed.
