Optical frequency combs consist of equally spaced discrete optical frequency components and are
essential tools for optical communications and for precision metrology, timing and spectroscopy.
To date, wide-spanning combs are most often generated by mode-locked lasers or dispersion-engineered
resonators with third-order Kerr nonlinearity. An alternative comb generation method uses electro-optic
(EO) phase modulation in a resonator with strong second-order nonlinearity, resulting in combs
with excellent stability and controllability. Previous EO combs, however, have been limited to
narrow widths by a weak EO interaction strength and a lack of dispersion engineering in free-space
systems. In this work, we overcome these limitations by realizing an integrated EO comb generator
in a thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform that features a large electro-optic response,
ultra-low optical loss and highly co-localized microwave and optical felds, while enabling dispersion
engineering. Our measured EO frequency comb spans more than the entire telecommunications L-band
(over 900 comb lines spaced at ~ 10 GHz), and we show that future dispersion engineering can enable
octave-spanning combs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the high tolerance of our comb generator to
modulation frequency detuning, with frequency spacing finely controllable over seven orders
of magnitude (10 Hz to 100 MHz), and utilize this feature to generate dual frequency combs in a single
resonator. Our results show that integrated EO comb generators, capable of generating wide and
stable comb spectra, are a powerful complement to integrated Kerr combs, enabling applications
ranging from spectroscopy to optical communications.
