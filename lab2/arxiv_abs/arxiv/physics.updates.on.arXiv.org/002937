A stable added-mass partitioned (AMP) algorithm is developed for fluid-structure interaction
(FSI) problems involving viscous incompressible flow and compressible elastic-solids. The AMP
scheme remains stable and second-order accurate even when added-mass and added-damping effects
are large. The fluid is updated with an implicit-explicit (IMEX) fractional-step scheme whereby
the velocity is advanced in one step, treating the viscous terms implicitly, and the pressure is
computed in a second step. The AMP interface conditions for the fluid arise from the outgoing characteristic
variables in the solid and are partitioned into a Robin (mixed) interface condition for the pressure,
and interface conditions for the velocity. The latter conditions include an impedance-weighted
average between fluid and solid velocities using a fluid impedance of a special form. A similar impedance-weighted
average is used to define interface values for the solid. The fluid impedance is defined using material
and discretization parameters and follows from a careful analysis of the discretization of the
governing equations and coupling conditions near the interface. A normal mode analysis is performed
to show that the AMP scheme is stable for a few carefully-selected model problems. Two extensions
of the analysis in Banks et al. are considered, including a first-order accurate discretization
of a viscous model problem and a second-order accurate discretization of an inviscid model problem.
The AMP algorithm is shown to be stable for any ratio of solid and fluid densities, including when
added-mass effects are large. The algorithm is verified for accuracy and stability for a set of new
exact benchmark solutions where finite interface deformations are permitted. The AMP scheme is
found to be stable and second-order accurate even for very difficult cases of very light solids.
