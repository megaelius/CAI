We study single-phase and particulate turbulent channel flows, bounded by two incompressible
hyper-elastic walls. Different wall elasticities are considered with and without a 10% volume
fraction of finite-size rigid spherical particles, while elastic walls are modelled as a neo-Hookean
material. We report a significant drag increase and an enhancement of the turbulence activity with
growing wall elasticity for both single-phase and particulate cases in comparison with the single-phase
flow over rigid walls. A drag reduction and a turbulence attenuation is obtained for the particulate
cases with highly elastic walls, albeit with respect to the single-phase flow of the same wall elasticity;
whereas, an opposite effect of the particles is observed on the flow of the less elastic walls. This
is explained by investigating the near-wall turbulence of highly elastic walls, where the strong
asymmetry in the magnitude of wall-normal velocity fluctuations (favouring the positive), is
found to push the particles towards the channel centre. The particle layer close to the wall is shown
to contribute to the turbulence production by increasing the wall-normal velocity fluctuations,
while in the absence of this layer, smaller wall deformation and in turn a turbulence attenuation
is observed. We further address the effect of the volume fraction at a moderate wall elasticity,
by increasing the particle volume fraction up to 20%. Migration of the particles from the interface
region is found to be the cause of a further turbulence attenuation, in comparison to the same volume
fraction in the case of rigid walls. However, the particle induced stress compensates for the loss
of the Reynolds shear stress, thus, resulting in a higher overall drag for the case with elastic walls.
The effect of wall-elasticity on the drag is reported to reduce significantly with increasing volume
fraction of particles.
