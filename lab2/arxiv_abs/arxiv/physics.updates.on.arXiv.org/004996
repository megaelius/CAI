In magnetically-confined plasmas of tokamaks, neutral deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) atoms play a
role in energy, momentum, and particle balance, as well as the stabilization of plasma turbulence.
One key important fusion performance parameter is the pedestal density. Understanding the pedestal
density formation is critical for the development of predictive model of future fusion devices.
Typically, measurements of the neutrals are obtained using optical emission spectroscopy of the
Lyman alpha lines, which is a line-integrated measurement. The plasma in tokamaks is characterized
by a high density of electrons and ions and a relatively low concentration of neutral hydrogen atoms,
which could make direct measurement of density seemingly impossible at first. We propose a laser-based
method that allows for accurate measurement of both the spatial and absolute magnitude of the neutral
D/H with minimal knowledge of the radial profiles of electron temperatures and densities. This
relies on the fact that the neutral spectral profile can have a larger peak than the electron spectral
profile and thus make the neutral density signal resolvable. In practice, this method can be co-located
with Thomson scattering systems and is referred to as laser Rayleigh scattering (LRS). More specifically,
we assess and evaluate the LRS method for two test cases: in the midplane radii of the National Spherical
Torus Experiment (NSTX), and in the small angle slot divertor configuration of DIII-D. Preliminary
simulations and calculations will determine the feasibility of LRS in the presence of incoherent
Thomson scattering under neutral densities ranging from $ 10^{13} $ to $ 10^{21} \ \text{m}^{-3}
$. Wavelength dependence of LRS will be evaluated to determine the boost in the signal and photon
generation capability.
