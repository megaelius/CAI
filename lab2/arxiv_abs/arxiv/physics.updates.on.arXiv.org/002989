Geochemical data provide key information on the timing of accretion and on the prevailing physical
conditions during core/mantle differentiation. However, their interpretation depends critically
on the efficiency of metal/silicate chemical equilibration, which is poorly constrained. Fluid
dynamics experiments suggest that, before its fragmentation, a volume of liquid metal falling
into a magma ocean undergoes a change of topology from a compact volume of metal toward a collection
of sheets and ligaments. We investigate here to what extent the vigorous stretching of the metal
phase by the turbulent flow can increase the equilibration efficiency through what is known as stretching
enhanced diffusion. We obtain scaling laws giving the equilibration times of sheets and ligaments
as functions of a P\'eclet number based on the stretching rate. At large P\'eclet, stretching drastically
decreases the equilibration time, which in this limit depends only weakly on the diffusivity. We
also perform 2D numerical simulations of the evolution of a volume of metal falling into a magma ocean,
from which we identify several equilibration regimes depending on the values of the P\'eclet (Pe),
Reynolds (Re), and Bond (Bo) numbers. At large Pe, Re and Bo, the metal phase is vigorously stretched
and convoluted in what we call a stirring regime. The equilibration time is found to be independent
of viscosity and surface tension and depends weakly on diffusivity. Equilibration is controlled
by an efficient thermochemical stretching enhanced diffusion mechanism developing from the mean
flow and entraining the surrounding silicate phase.
