We propose the optical trapping of Rayleigh particles using tailored anisotropic and hyperbolic
metasurfaces illuminated with a linearly polarized Gaussian beam. This platform permits to engineer
optical traps at the beam axis with a response governed by nonconservative and giant recoil forces
coming from the directional excitation of ultra-confined surface plasmons during the light scattering
process. Compared to optical traps set over bulk metals, the proposed traps are broadband in the
sense that can be set with beams oscillating at any frequency within the wide range in which the metasurface
supports surface plasmons. Over that range, the metasurface evolves from an anisotropic elliptic
to a hyperbolic regime through a topological transition and enables optical traps with distinctive
spatially asymmetric potential distribution, local potential barriers arising from the momentum
imbalance of the excited plasmons, and an enhanced potential depth that permits the stable trapping
of nanoparticles using low-intensity laser beams. To investigate the performance of this platform,
we develop a rigorous formalism based on the Lorentz force within the Rayleigh approximation combined
with anisotropic Green's functions and calculate the trapping potential of nonconservative forces
using the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition method. Tailored anisotropic and hyperbolic metasurfaces,
commonly implemented by nanostructuring thin metallic layers, enables using low-intensity laser
sources operating in the visible or the IR to trap and manipulate particles at the nanoscale, and
may enable a wide range of applications in bioengineering, physics, and chemistry.
