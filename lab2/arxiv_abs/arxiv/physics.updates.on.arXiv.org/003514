We develop a unified perspective of unidirectional topological edge waves in non-reciprocal media.
We focus on the inherent role of photonic spin in non-reciprocal gyroelectric media, ie. magnetized
metals or magnetized insulators. We first review the concept of a Maxwell Hamiltonian in non-reciprocal
media, which immediately reveals that the gyrotropic coefficient behaves as a photon mass in two
dimensions. Similar to the Dirac mass, this photonic mass opens bandgaps in the energy dispersion
of bulk propagating waves. Within these bulk photonic bandgaps, three distinct classes of Maxwellian
edge waves exist - each arising from subtle differences in boundary conditions. On one hand, the
edge wave solutions are rigorous photonic analogs of Jackiw-Rebbi electronic edge states. On the
other hand, for the exact same system, they can be high frequency photonic counterparts of the integer
quantum Hall effect, familiar at zero frequency. Our Hamiltonian approach also predicts the existence
of a third distinct class of Maxwellian edge wave exhibiting topological protection. The Maxwellian
edge state in this unique \textit{quantum gyroelectric phase of matter} necessarily requires
a sign change in gyrotropy arising from non-locality (spatial dispersion). A signature property
of these topological electromagnetic edge states is that they are oblivious to the contacting medium,
ie. they occur at the interface of the quantum gyroelectric phase and any medium (even vacuum). Furthermore,
the Maxwellian spin waves exhibit photonic spin-1 quantization in exact analogy with their supersymmetric
spin-\sfrac{1}{2} counterparts. The goal of this paper is to discuss these three foundational
classes of edge waves in a unified perspective while providing in-depth derivations, taking into
account non-locality and various boundary conditions.
