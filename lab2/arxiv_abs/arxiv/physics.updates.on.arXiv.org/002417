In this paper, we aim to resolve two fundamental issues in the dynamics of relativity: (i) Under what
condition, the time-column space integrals of a Lorentz four-tensor constitute a Lorentz four-vector,
and (ii) under what condition, the time-element space integral of a Lorentz four-vector is a Lorentz
scalar; namely two "conservation laws", which are mispresented in traditional textbooks, and
widely used in fundamental research, such as relativistic analysis of the momentum of light in a
medium, and gravitation theory. To resolve issue (i), we have developed a generalized Lorentz \emph{four-vector}
theorem. We use this theorem to verify M{\o} ller's theorem; we surprisingly find that M{\o} ller's
theorem is flawed. We provide a corrected version of M{\o} ller's theorem, and indicate that the
corrected M{/o} ller's theorem only defines a trivial zero four-vector for an electromagnetic
stress-energy tensor of a finite closed physical system, even if this theorem is applicable. To
resolve issue (ii), we have developed a generalized Lorentz \emph{scalar} theorem. We use this
theorem to verify the "invariant conservation law" in relativistic electrodynamics, which states
that the \emph{divergence-less} of four-current density results in the \emph{Lorentz invariance}
of total electric charge, as presented by Weinberg in his textbook. We unexpectedly find that there
is no causality at all between the divergence-less and the Lorentz invariance. Thus the two "conservation
laws" in traditional textbooks, which have magically attracted several generations of most outstanding
scientists, turned out to be imaginary, creating a scientific myth in the modern theoretical and
mathematical physics: Believing is seeing.
