The Minima Hopping global optimization method uses physically realizable molecular dynamics
moves in combination with an energy feedback that guarantees the escape from any potential energy
funnel. For the purpose of finding reactions pathways, we argue that Minima Hopping is particularly
suitable as a guide through the potential energy landscape and as a generator for pairs of minima
that can be used as input structures for methods capable of finding transition states between two
minima. For Lennard-Jones benchmark systems we compared this Minima Hopping guided path search
method to a known approach for the exploration of potential energy landscapes that is based on deterministic
mode-following. Although we used a stabilized mode-following technique that reliably allows
to follow distinct directions when escaping from a local minimum, we observed that Minima Hopping
guided path search is far superior in finding lowest-barrier reaction pathways. We therefore suggest
that Minima Hopping guided path search can be used as a simple and efficient way to identify energetically
low-lying chemical reaction pathways. Finally we applied the Minima Hopping guided path search
approach to 75-atom and 102-atom Lennard Jones systems. For the 75-atom system we found pathways
whose highest energies are significantly lower than the highest energy along the previously published
lowest-barrier pathway. Furthermore, many of these pathways contain a smaller number of intermediate
transition states than the previously publish lowest-barrier pathway. In case of the 102-atom
system Minima Hopping guided path search found a previously unknown and energetically low-lying
funnel.
