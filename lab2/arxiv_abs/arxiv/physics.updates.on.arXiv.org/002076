Geography, including climatic factors, have long been considered potentially important elements
in shaping socio-economic activities. However, it has been argued that other possible drivers,
particularly institutions, can be more important factors. Here we demonstrate that geography/climate
variables satisfactorily explain the worldwide economic activity as measured by the per capita
Gross Cell Product (GCP-PC) at a high geographical resolution, typically much higher than country
average. A 1{\deg} by 1{\deg} GCP-PC dataset has been key for establishing and testing a direct relationship
between 'local' geography/climate and GCP-PC. Not only have we tested the geography/climate hypothesis
using many possible explanatory variables, importantly we have also predicted and reconstructed
GCP-PC worldwide by retaining the most significant predictors. While this study confirms that
latitude is the most important predictor for GCP-PC when taken in isolation, the accuracy of the
GCP-PC prediction is greatly improved when other factors mainly related to variations in climatic
variables, rather than average climatic conditions, are considered. However, latitude diminishes
in importance when only the wealthier parts of the globe are considered. This work points to specific
features of the climate system which appear key to driving economic activity, such as the variability
in air pressure or the seasonal variations of dew point temperature. The implications of these findings
range from a better understanding of why socio-economically better-off societies are geographically
placed where they are, in the present, past and future, to informing where new economic activities
could be established in order to yield favourable economic outcomes based on geography/climate
conditions.
