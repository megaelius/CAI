The QED contribution to the dipole polarizability of the $^4$He atom was computed, including the
effect of finite nuclear mass. The computationally most challenging contribution of the second
electric-field derivative of the Bethe logarithm was obtained using two different methods: the
integral representation method of Schwartz and the sum-over-states approach of Goldman and Drake.
The results of both calculations are consistent, although the former method turned out to be much
more accurate. The obtained value of the electric-field derivative of the Bethe logarithm, equal
to $0.048\,557\,2(14)$ in atomic units, confirms the small magnitude of this quantity found in
the only previous calculation [G. {\L}ach, B. Jeziorski, and K. Szalewicz, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92,
233001 (2004)], but differs from it by about 5\%. The origin of this difference is explained. The
total QED correction of the order of {\alpha} 3 in the fine-structure constant {\alpha} amounts
to 30.6671(1)$\cdot 10^{-6}$, including the 0.1822$\cdot 10^{-6}$ contribution from the electric-field
derivative of the Bethe logarithm and the 0.01112(1)$\cdot 10^{-6}$ correction for the finite
nuclear mass, with all values in atomic units. The resulting theoretical value of the molar polarizability
of helium-4 is $0.517\,254\,08(5)\,$cm$^3$/mol with the error estimate dominated by the uncertainty
of the QED corrections of order $\alpha^4$ and higher. Our value is in agreement with but an order
of magnitude more accurate than the result $0.517\, 254\, 4(10)\,$cm$^3$/mol of the most recent
experimental determination [C. Gaiser and B. Fellmuth, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 123203 (2018)].
