In the laboratory study of extreme conditions of temperature and density, the exposure of matter
to high intensity radiation sources has been of central importance. Here we interrogate the performance
of multi-layered targets in experiments involving high intensity, hard x-ray irradiation, motivated
by the advent of extremely high brightness hard x-ray sources, such as free electron lasers and 4th-generation
synchrotron facilities. Intense hard x-ray beams can deliver significant energy in targets having
thick x-ray transparent layers (tampers) around samples of interest, for the study of novel states
of matter and materials' dynamics. Heated-state lifetimes in such targets can approach the microsecond
level, regardless of radiation pulse duration, enabling the exploration of conditions of local
thermal and thermodynamic equilibrium at extreme temperature in solid density matter. The thermal
and mechanical response of such thick layered targets following x-ray heating, including hydrodynamic
relaxation and heat flow on picosecond to millisecond timescales, is modelled using radiation
hydrocode simulation, finite element analysis, and thermodynamic calculations. Assessing the
potential for target survival over one or more exposures, and resistance to damage arising from
heating and resulting mechanical stresses, this study doubles as an investigation into the performance
of diamond-anvil high pressure cells under high x-ray fluences. Long used in conjunction with synchrotron
x-ray radiation and high power optical lasers, the strong confinement afforded by such cells suggests
novel applications at emerging high intensity x-ray facilities and new routes to studying thermodynamic
equilibrium states of warm, very dense matter.
