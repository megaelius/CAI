Calculation of the rotation-vibration spectrum of H3+, as well as of its deuterated isotopologues,
with near-spectroscopic accuracy requires the development of sophisticated theoretical models,
methods, and codes. The present paper reviews the state-of-the-art in these fields. Computation
of rovibrational states on a given potential energy surface (PES) has now become standard for triatomic
molecules, at least up to intermediate energies, due to developments achieved by the present authors
and others. However, highly accurate Born--Oppenheimer energies leading to highly accurate PESs
are not accessible even for this two-electron system using conventional electronic structure
procedures e.g., configuration-interaction or coupled-cluster techniques with extrapolation
to the complete basis set limit). For this purpose highly specialized techniques must be used, e.g.,
those employing explicitly correlated Gaussians and nonlinear parameter optimizations. It has
also become evident that a very dense grid of \ai\ points is required to obtain reliable representations
of the computed points extending from the minimum to the asymptotic limits. Furthermore, adiabatic,
relativistic, and QED correction terms need to be considered to achieve near-spectroscopic accuracy
during calculation of the rotation-vibration spectrum of H3+. The remaining and most intractable
problem is then the treatment of the effects of non-adiabatic coupling on the rovibrational energies,
which, in the worst cases, may lead to corrections on the order of several \cm. A promising way of handling
this difficulty is the further development of effective, motion- or even coordinate-dependent,
masses and mass surfaces. Finally, the unresolved challenge of how to describe and elucidate the
experimental pre-dissociation spectra of H$_3^+$ and its isotopologues is discussed.
