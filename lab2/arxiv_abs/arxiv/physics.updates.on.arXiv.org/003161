The effects of surfactant coating on a deformable viscous drop under the combined action of a shear
flow and a uniform electric field, are investigated by solving the coupled equations of electrostatics,
fluid flow and surfactant transport. Employing a comprehensive three-dimensional solution technique,
the non-Newtonian shearing response of the bulk emulsion is analyzed in the dilute suspension regime.
The present results reveal that the surfactant non-uniformity creates significant alterations
in the flow disturbance around the drop, thereby influencing the viscous dissipation from the flowing
emulsion. This, in effect, triggers changes in the bulk shear viscosity. It is striking to observe
that the balance between electrical and hydrodynamic stresses is affected in such a way that surface
tension gradient on the drop surface vanishes for some specific shear rates and the corresponding
effective change in the bulk viscosity becomes negligible too. This critical condition hugely
depends on the electrical permittivity and conductivity ratios of the two fluids and orientation
of the applied electric field. Also the physical mechanisms of charge convection of surface deformation
play their role in determining this critical shear rate. The charge convection instigated shear
thinning or shear thickening behavior of the emulsion gets reversed due to a coupled interaction
of the charge convection and Marangoni stress. In addition, the electrically created anisotropic
normal stresses in the bulk rheology, get reduced due to the presence of surfactants, especially
when the drop viscosity is much lesser than the continuous fluid. A thorough description of the drop-level
flow physics and its connection to the bulk rheology of a dilute emulsion, may provide a fundamental
understanding of a more complex emulsion system.
