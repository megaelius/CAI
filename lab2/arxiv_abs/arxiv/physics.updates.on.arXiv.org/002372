Atmospheric transient eddies and low-frequency flow contribution to the ocean surface wave climate
in the North Atlantic during boreal winter is investigated (1980 - 2016). We conduct a set of numerical
simulations with a state-of-the-art spectral wave model Wavewatch III forced by decomposed wind
fields derived from the ERA-Interim reanalysis (0.7{\deg} horizontal resolution). Synoptic-scale
processes (2-10 day bandpassed winds) are found to have the largest impact on the formation of wind
waves in the western mid-latitude North Atlantic along the North American and western Greenland
coasts. The eastern North Atlantic is found to be influenced by the combination of low-frequency
forcing (>10 day bandpassed winds) contributing up to 60% and synoptic processes contributing
up to 30% to mean wave heights. Mid-latitude storm track variability is found to have a direct relationship
with wave height variability on the eastern and western margins of the North Atlantic in particular
implying an association between cyclone formation over the North American Eastern Seaboard and
wave heights anomalies in the eastern North Atlantic. A shift in wave height regimes defined using
an EOF analysis is reflected in the occurrence anomalies in their distribution. Results highlight
the dominant role of transient eddies on the ocean surface wave climatology in the mid-latitude
eastern North Atlantic both locally and through association with cyclone formation in the western
part of the basin. These conclusions are presented and discussed particularly within the context
of long-term storm-track shifts projected as a possible response to climate warming over the coming
century.
