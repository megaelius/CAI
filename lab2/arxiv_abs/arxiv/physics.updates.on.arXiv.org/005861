Controlling the directionality of an absorptive or thermally emissive material is a fundamental
challenge in contemporary materials and photonics research. Over the past two decades, a range
of photonic strategies have enabled angular beaming of thermal emission, but only over narrow sets
of bandwidths. However, thermal radiation is inherently a broadband phenomenon, and many emerging
applications in imaging and energy require broad spectrum control of emission and absorption.
We currently lack the ability to constrain thermal emission, as well as absorption, over arbitrary
angles of incidence, but consistently over a broad range of wavelengths. Here, we theoretically
propose and experimentally demonstrate a mechanism for broadband angular selectivity in absorption
and emission that leverages multiple materials that exhibit a permittivity near zero, ENZ materials.
We experimentally realize a broadband directional thermal emitter by introducing a subwavelength
photonic film consisting of multiple oxides that exhibit epsilon near zero (ENZ) regions in the
long-wave infrared region. We obtain high emissivity (> 0.6) in the p polarization from 7.7 to 11.5
micron over an angular range between 65 deg and 85 deg. Outside this range the photonic film is highly
reflective. The broadband nature of angular control enables strong radiative heat transfer only
at large angles and is directly observed through thermal imaging. The materials and photonic strategy
employed use abundant, low-cost materials that are fully compatible with large-area deposition.
By decoupling conventional limitations on angular and spectral response, our approach opens new
possibilities for radiative heat transfer in a range of applications, including thermal camouflaging,
solar heating, radiative cooling and waste heat recovery.
