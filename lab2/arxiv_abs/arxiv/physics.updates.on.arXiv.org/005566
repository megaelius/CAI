The aim of the present study is to analyze the stability of the pressure gradient driven modes (PM)
and Alfven eigenmodes (AE) in the Large Helical Device (LHD) plasma if the rotational transform
profile is modified by the current drive of the tangential neutral beam injectors (NBI). This study
forms a basic search for optimized operation scenarios with reduced mode activity. The analysis
is performed using the code FAR3d which solves the reduced MHD equations describing the linear evolution
of the poloidal flux and the toroidal component of the vorticity in a full 3D system, coupled with
equations for density and parallel velocity moments of the energetic particle (EP) species, including
the effect of the acoustic modes. The Landau damping and resonant destabilization effects are added
via the closure relation. On-axis and off-axis NBI current drive modifies the rotational transform
which becomes strongly distorted as the intensity of the neutral beam current drive (NBCD) increases,
leading to wider continuum gaps and modifying the magnetic shear. The simulations with on-axis
NBI injection show that a counter (ctr-) NBCD in inward shifted and default configurations leads
to a lower growth rate of the PM, although strong n=1 and 2 AEs can be destabilized. For the outward
shifted configurations, a co-NBCD improves the AEs stability but the PM are further destabilized
if the co-NBCD intensity is 30 kA/T. If the NBI injection is off-axis, the plasma stability is not
significantly improved due to the further destabilization of the AE and energetic particle modes
(EPM) in the middle and outer plasma region.
