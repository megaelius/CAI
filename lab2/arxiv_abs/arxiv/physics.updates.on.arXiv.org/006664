During the beginning of 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic took the world by surprise, rapidly spreading
undetected between and within many countries and wreaking havoc on the global economy both through
death tolls and lockdowns. Healthcare professionals treating the coronavirus patients grapple
with a massive and unprecedented shortage of Facepiece Respirators (FPRs) and other personal protective
equipment (PPE), which act as fundamental tools to protect the health of the medical staff treating
the patients affected by the coronavirus. While many FPRs are designed to be disposable single-use
devices, the development of sterilization strategies is necessary to circumvent future shortages.
Here, we describe the development of a plasma-based method to sterilize PPE such as FPRs with ozone.
The novel design uses a flow-through configuration where ozone directly flows through the fibers
of the PPE through the maintenance of a pressure gradient. Canonical ozone-based methods place
the mask into a sealed ozone-containing enclosure but lack pressurization to permeate the mask
fibers. In this device, ozone is created through an atmospheric pressure Dielectric Barrier Discharge
(DBD) fed with compressed air. Due to limited supply and clinical need of FPRs, we demonstrated sterilization
with surgical masks. We demonstrate rapid sterilization using E. coli as a model pathogen. A flow-through
configuration enables a >400% improvement of the sterilization efficiency with respect to the
canonical approach. This method has potential for a broad and cost-effective utilization. Using
the power supply from a readily available plasma ball toy, a plastic box, a glass tube, steel mesh,
and 3D printed components, we designed and tested an extremely affordable portable prototype system
for rapid single mask sterilization which produced comparable results to its large high-cost equivalent.
