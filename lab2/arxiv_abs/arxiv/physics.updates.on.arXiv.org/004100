This paper is a celebration of the frontiers of science. Goodenough, the maestro who transformed
energy usage and technology through the invention of the lithium ion battery, opens the programme,
reflecting on the ultimate limits of battery technology. This applied theme continues through
the subsequent pieces on energy related topics (the sodium ion battery and artificial fuels, by
Mansson) and the ultimate challenge for 3 dimensional printing the eventual production of life,
by Atala. A passage by Alexander follows, reflecting on a related issue: How might an artificially
produced human being behave? Next comes a consideration of consiousness and free will by Allen and
Lidstrom. Further voices and new instruments enter as Bowen, Mauranyapin and Madsen discuss whether
dynamical processes of single molecules might be observed in their native state. The exploitation
of chaos in science and technology, applications of Bose Einstein condensates and a consideration
of the significance of entropy follow in pieces by Reichl, Rasel and Allen, respectively. Katsnelson
and Koonin then discuss the potential generalisation of thermodynamic concepts in the context
of biological evolution. Entering with the music of the cosmos, Yasskin discusses whether we might
be able to observe torsion in the geometry of the universe. The crescendo comes with the crisis of
singularities, their nature and whether they can be resolved through quantum effects, in the composition
of Coley. The climax is Krenn, Melvin and Zeilinger consideration of how computer code can be autonomously
surprising and creative. In a harmonious counterpoint, Yampolskiy concludes that such code is
not yet able to take responsibility for coauthoring a paper.
