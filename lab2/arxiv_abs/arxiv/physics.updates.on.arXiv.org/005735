We employ simulated annealing to identify the global solution of a dynamical model, to make a favorable
impression upon colleagues at the departmental holiday party and then exit undetected as soon as
possible. The procedure, Gradual Freeze-out of an Optimal Estimation via Optimization of Parameter
Quantification - GFOOEOPQ, is designed for the socially awkward. The socially awkward among us
possess little instinct for pulling off such a maneuver, and may benefit from a machine to do it for
us. The method rests upon Bayes' Theorem, where the probability of a future model state depends on
current knowledge of the model. Here, model state vectors are party attendees, and the future event
of interest is their disposition toward us at times following the party. We want these dispositions
to be favorable. To this end, we first interact so as to make favorable impressions, or at least ensure
that these people remember having seen us there. Then we identify the exit that minimizes the chance
that anyone notes how early we high-tailed it. Now, poorly-resolved estimates will correspond
to degenerate solutions. As noted, we possess no instinct to identify a global optimum by ourselves.
This can have disastrous consequences. For this reason, GFOOEOPQ employs annealing to iteratively
home in on this optimum. The method is illustrated via a simulated event hosted by someone in the physics
department (I am not sure who), in a two-bedroom apartment on the fifth floor of an elevator building
in Manhattan, with viable Exit parameters: front door, side door to a stairwell, fire escape, and
a bathroom window that opens onto the fire escape. Preliminary tests are reported at two real social
celebrations. The procedure is generalizable to corporate events and family gatherings. Readers
are encouraged to report novel applications of GFOOEOPQ, to expand the algorithm.
