We define the de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) weak interpretation as the dBB interpretation restricted to
particles in unbound states whose wave function is defined in the three-dimensional physical space,
and the dBB strong interpretation as the usual dBB interpretation applied to all wave functions,
in particular to particles in bound states whose wave function is defined in a 3N-dimensional configuration
space in which N is the number of particules. We show that the current criticisms of the dBB interpretation
do not apply to this weak interpretation and that, furthermore, there are theoritical and experimental
reasons to justify the weak dBB interpretation. Theoretically, the main reason concern the continuity
existing for such particles between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics: we demonstrate
in fact that the density and the phase of the wave function of a single-particle (or a set of identical
particles without interaction), when the Planck constant tends to 0, converges to the density and
the action of a set of unrecognizable prepared classical particles that satisfy the statistical
Hamilton-Jacobi equations. As the Hamilton-Jacobi action pilots the particle in classical mechanics,
this continuity naturally concurs with the weak dBB interpretation. Experimentally, we show that
the measurement results of the main quantum experiments (Young's slits experiment, Stern and Gerlach,
EPR-B) are compatible with the de Broglie-Bohm weak interpretation and everything takes place
as if these unbounded particles had trajectories. In addition, we propose two potential solutions
to complete the dBB weak interpretation.
