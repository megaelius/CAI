We provide an overview of the successive steps that made possible to obtain increasingly accurate
excitation energies and properties with computational chemistry tools, eventually leading to
chemically accurate vertical transition energies for small- and medium-size molecules. First,
we describe the evolution of \textit{ab initio} state-of-the-art methods employed to define benchmark
values, with originally Roos' CASPT2 method, and then third-order coupled cluster (CC3) methods
as in the renowned Thiel set of vertical excitation energies described in a remarkable series of
papers in the 2000's. More recently, this quest for highly accurate excitation energies was reinitiated
thanks to the resurgence of selected configuration interaction (SCI) methods and their efficient
parallel implementation. These methods have been able to routinely deliver highly accurate excitation
energies for small molecules, as well as medium-size molecules with compact basis sets, for both
single and double excitations. Second, we describe how these high-level methods and the creation
of large, diverse, and accurate benchmark sets of excitation energies have allowed to assess fairly
and accurately the performance of computationally lighter theoretical models (\eg, TD-DFT, BSE@\textit{GW},
ADC, EOM-CC, etc.) for different types of excited states ($\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$, $n \rightarrow
\pi^*$, valence, Rydberg, singlet, triplet, double excitation, etc). We conclude this \textit{Perspective}
by discussing the current potentiality of these methods from both an expert and a non-expert points
of view, and what we believe could be the future theoretical and technological developments in the
field.
