In this thesis, we study the interplay of phase separation and wetting in multicomponent systems.
For this purpose, we have examined the phase separation pattern of a binary mixture (AB) in presence
of stationary spherical particles (C) which prefers one of the components of the binary (say, A).
Binary AB is composed of critical composition(50:50) and off-critical compositions(60:40, 40:60).
Particle sizes of 8 units and 16 units are used in the simulations. Two types of particle loading are
used, 5\% and 10\%. We have employed a ternary form of Cahn-Hilliard equation to incorporate immobile
fillers in our system. To elucidate the effect of wetting on phase separation we have designed three
sets of $\chi_{ij}$ and $\kappa_{ij}$ to include the effects of neutral preference, weak preference
and strong preference of the particle for one of the binary components. If the particles are preferentially
wetted by one of the components then early stage microstructures show transient concentric alternate
layers of preferred and non-preferred phases around the particles. When particles are neutral
to binary components then such a ring pattern does not form. At late times, neutral preference between
particles and binary components yields a continuous morphology whereas preferential wetting
produces isolated domains of non-preferred phases dispersed in a continuous matrix of preferred
phase. For off-critical compositions, if minor component wets the particle then a bicontinuous
morphology results whereas if major component wets the network a droplet morphology is seen. When
majority component wets the particle, a possibility of double phase separation is reported. In
such alloys phase separation starts near the particle surface and propagates to the bulk at intermediate
to late times forming spherical or nearly spherical droplets of the minor component.
