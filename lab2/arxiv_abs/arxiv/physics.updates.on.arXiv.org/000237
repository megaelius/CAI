We propose a definite search for sterile neutrinos at the J-PARC Materials and Life Science Experimental
Facility (MLF). With the 3 GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) and spallation neutron target, an
intense neutrino beam from muon decay at rest (DAR) is available. Neutrinos come from \mu+ decay,
and the oscillation to be searched for is (anti \nu \mu -> anti \nu e) which is detected by the inverse
\beta decay interaction (anti \nu e + p -> e+ + n), followed by a gamma from neutron capture. The
unique features of the proposed experiment, compared with the LSND and experiments using horn focused
beams, are; (1) The pulsed beam with about 600 ns spill width from J-PARC RCS and muon long lifetime
allow us to select neutrinos from \mu DAR only. (2) Due to nuclear absorption of \pi- and \mu-, neutrinos
from \mu- decay are suppressed to about the $10^{-3}$ level. (3) Neutrino cross sections are well
known. The inverse \beta decay cross section is known to be a few percent accuracy. (4) The neutrino
energy can be calculated from positron energy by adding ~1.8 MeV. (5) The anti \nu \mu and \nu e fluxes
have different and well defined spectra. This allows us to separate oscillated signals from those
due to \mu- decay contamination. We propose to proceed with the oscillation search in steps since
the region of \Delta m^2 to be searched can be anywhere between sub-eV^2 to several tens of eV^2. We
start to examine the large \Delta m^2 region, which can be done with short baseline at first. At close
distance to the MLF target gives a high neutrino flux, and allows us to use relatively small detector.
If no definitive positive signal is found, a future option exists to cover small \Delta m^2 region.
This needs a relatively long baseline and requires a large detector to compensate for the reduced
neutrino flux.
