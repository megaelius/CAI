By phenomenologically assuming a slow temporal variation of the percent acceleration rate $\ddot
S S^{-1}$ of the cosmic scale factor $S(t)$, it is shown that the orbit of a local binary undergoes
a secular expansion. To first order in the power expansion of $\ddot S S^{-1}$ around the present
epoch $t_0$, a non-vanishing shift per orbit $\left\langle\Delta r\right\rangle$ of the two-body
relative distance $r$ occurs for eccentric trajectories. A general relativistic expression,
which turns out to be cubic in the Hubble parameter $H_0$ at the present epoch, is explicitly calculated
for it in the case of matter-dominated epochs with Dark Energy. For a highly eccentric Oort comet
orbit with period $P_{\rm b}\approx 31$ Myr, the general relativistic distance shift per orbit
turns out to be of the order of $\left\langle\Delta r\right\rangle\approx 70$ km. For the Large
Magellanic Cloud, assumed on a bound elliptic orbit around the Milky Way, the shift per orbit is of
the order of $\left\langle\Delta r\right\rangle\approx 2-4$ pc. Our result has a general validity
since it holds in any cosmological model admitting the Hubble law and a slowly varying $\ddot S S^{-1}(t)$.
More generally, it is valid for an arbitrary Hooke-like extra-acceleration whose \virg{elastic}
parameter $\mathcal{K}$ is slowly time-dependent, irrespectively of the physical mechanism
which may lead to it. The coefficient $\mathcal{K}_1$ of the first-order term of the power expansion
of $\mathcal{K}(t)$ can be preliminarily constrained in a model-independent way down to a $\mathcal{K}_1\lesssim
2\times 10^{-13}$ yr$^{-3}$ level from latest Solar System's planetary observations. The radial
velocities of the double lined spectroscopic binary $\alpha$ Cen AB yield $\mathcal{K}_1\lesssim
10^{-8}$ yr$^{-3}$.
