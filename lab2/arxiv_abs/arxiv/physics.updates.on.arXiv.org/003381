Identifying the physical basis of heterosis (or hybrid vigor) has remained elusive despite over
a hundred years of research on the subject. The three main theories of heterosis are dominance theory,
overdominance theory, and epistasis theory. Kacser and Burns (1981) identified the molecular
basis of dominance, which has greatly enhanced our understanding of its importance to heterosis.
This paper aims to explain how overdominance, and some features of epistasis, can similarly emerge
from the molecular dynamics of proteins. Possessing multiple alleles at a gene locus results in
the synthesis of different allozymes at reduced concentrations. This in turn reduces the rate at
which each allozyme forms soluble oligomers, which are toxic and must be degraded, because allozymes
co-aggregate at low efficiencies. The model developed in this paper will be used to explain how heterozygosity
can impact the metabolic efficiency of an organism. It can also explain why the viabilities of some
inbred lines seem to decline rapidly at high inbreeding coefficients (F > 0.5), which may provide
a physical basis for truncation selection for heterozygosity. Finally, the model has implications
for the ploidy level of organisms. It can explain why polyploids are frequently found in environments
where severe physical stresses promote the formation of soluble oligomers. The model can also explain
why complex organisms, which need to synthesize aggregation-prone proteins that contain intrinsically
unstructured regions (IURs) and multiple domains because they facilitate complex protein interaction
networks (PINs), tend to be diploid while haploidy tends to be restricted to relatively simple organisms.
