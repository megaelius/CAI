Estimation of internal body motion with high spatio-temporal resolution can greatly benefit MR-guided
radiotherapy/interventions and cardiac imaging, but remains a challenge to date. In image-based
methods, where motion is indirectly estimated by reconstructing and co-registering images, a
trade off between spatial and temporal resolution of the motion-fields has to be made due to the image
reconstruction step. However, we observe that motion-fields are very compressible due to the spatial
correlation of internal body motion. Therefore, reconstructing only motion-fields directly
from surrogate signals or k-space data without the need for image reconstruction should require
few data, and could eventually result in high spatio-temporal resolution motion-fields. In this
work we introduce MR-MOTUS, a framework that makes exactly this possible. The two main innovations
of this work are (1) a signal model that explicitly relates the k-space signal of a deforming object
to general non-rigid motion-fields, and (2) model-based reconstruction of motion-fields directly
from highly undersampled k-space data by solving the corresponding inverse problem. The signal
model is derived by modeling a deforming object as a static reference object warped by dynamic motion-fields,
such that the dynamic signal is given explicitly in terms of motion-fields. We validate the signal
model through numerical experiments with an analytical phantom, and reconstruct motion-fields
from retrospectively undersampled in-vivo data. Results show that the reconstruction quality
is comparable to state-of-the-art image registration for undersampling factors as high as 63 for
3D non-rigid respiratory motion and as high as 474 for 3D rigid head motion.
