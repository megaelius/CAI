We study the effect of the chirped laser pulse on the transmission and associated ion acceleration
by the sub-wavelength target. In the chirped laser pulses, the pulse frequency has a temporal variation
about its fundamental frequency, which manifests to the temporal dependence of the critical density
($n_c$). In this work we used a chirp model which is beyond the linear approximation. For negatively
(positively) chirped pulses, the high (low) frequency component of the pulse interacts with the
target initially followed by the low (high) frequency component. The threshold plasma density
for the transmission of the pulse is found to be higher for the negatively chirped laser pulses as
compared to the unchirped or positively chirped pulses. The enhanced transmission of the negatively
chirped pulses for higher densities ($6n_c$) results in very efficient heating of the target electrons,
creating a very stable and persistent longitudinal electrostatic field behind the target. The
void of the electrons results in expansion of the target ions in either direction, resulting in the
broad energy spectrum. We have introduced a very thin, low density ($< n_c$) secondary layer behind
the primary layer. The ions from the secondary layer are then found to be accelerated as a mono-energetic
bunch under the influence of the electrostatic field created by the primary layer upon interaction
by the negatively chirped pulse. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum energy of the protons
are found to be $\sim 100$ MeV for 10 fs (intensity fwhm); Circularly Polarized; Gaussian; negatively
chirped laser pulse with peak intensity $\sim 8.5\times 10^{20}$ W/cm$^2$.
