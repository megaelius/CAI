Estimating the heat loads on re-entry vehicles is a crucial part of preparing for atmospheric re-entry
manoeuvres. Re-entry flows at high altitudes are in the rarefied regime and are governed by high
enthalpies and thermodynamic non-equilibrium. Additionally, catalytic gas-surface reactions
change the gas flow composition and can have a major influence on the heat transfer. Our goal is to
estimate the heat loads without a priori fitting of simulation parameters to experiments. We use
the tool PICLas for simulations of such rarefied gas flows. It combines different particle methods,
including the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method, for modelling of gases. Recently it has been
extended to include different catalysis models to treat reactions on surfaces. We evaluate a kinetic
Monte Carlo approach to model catalytic gas-surface interactions in combination with flow simulations
using particle methods. Here, the adsorbate distribution is modelled by reproducing a surface
system using a kinetic Monte Carlo approach and estimating the necessary parameters using model
assumptions. This catalytic model is compared to a simple recombination model. We present simulations
that show the capability of the implemented models for a $\mathrm{SiO_2}$ surface in an Oxygen flow.
Furthermore, simulation results are compared to heat fluxes and recombination coefficient obtained
from the respective experiment. The results show that simulations using the kinetic Monte Carlo
approach match the experimentally obtained values. Thus, the approach can be used to estimate the
reactivity of oxygen flows over $\mathrm{SiO_2}$ surfaces.
