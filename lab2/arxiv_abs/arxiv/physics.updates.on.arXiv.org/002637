The field of nuclear astrophysics is devoted to the study of the creation of the chemical elements.
By nature, it is deeply intertwined with the physics of the Sun. The nuclear reactions of the proton-proton
cycle of hydrogen burning, including the 3He({\alpha},{\gamma})7Be reaction, provide the necessary
nuclear energy to prevent the gravitational collapse of the Sun and give rise to the by now well-studied
pp, 7Be, and 8B solar neutrinos. The not yet measured flux of 13N, 15O, and 17F neutrinos from the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen
cycle is affected in rate by the 14N(p,{\gamma})15O reaction and in emission profile by the 12C(p,{\gamma})13N
reaction. The nucleosynthetic output of the subsequent phase in stellar evolution, helium burning,
is controlled by the 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O reaction. In order to properly interpret the existing
and upcoming solar neutrino data, precise nuclear physics information is needed. For nuclear reactions
between light, stable nuclei, the best available technique are experiments with small ion accelerators
in underground, low-background settings. The pioneering work in this regard has been done by the
LUNA collaboration at Gran Sasso/Italy, using a 0.4 MV accelerator. The present contribution reports
on a higher-energy, 5.0 MV, underground accelerator in the Felsenkeller underground site in Dresden/Germany.
Results from {\gamma}-ray, neutron, and muon background measurements in the Felsenkeller underground
site in Dresden, Germany, show that the background conditions are satisfactory for nuclear astrophysics
purposes. The accelerator is in the commissioning phase and will provide intense, up to 50{\mu}A,
beams of 1H+, 4He+ , and 12C+ ions, enabling research on astrophysically relevant nuclear reactions
with unprecedented sensitivity.
