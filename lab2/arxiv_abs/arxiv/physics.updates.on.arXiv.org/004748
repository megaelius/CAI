We employ a quasirandom methodology, recently developed by Martin Roberts, to estimate the separability
probabilities, with respect to the Bures (minimal monotone/statistical distinguishability)
measure, of generic two-qubit and two-rebit states. This procedure, based on generalized properties
of the golden ratio, yielded, in the course of almost seventeen billion iterations (recorded at
intervals of five million), two-qubit estimates repeatedly close to nine decimal places to $\frac{25}{341}
=\frac{5^2}{11 \cdot 31} \approx 0.073313783$. Howeer, despite the use of over twenty-three billion
iterations, we do not presently perceive an exact value (rational or otherwise) for an estimate
of 0.15709623 for the Bures two-rebit separability probability. The Bures qubit-qutrit case--for
which Khvedelidze and Rogojin gave an estimate of 0.0014--is analyzed too. The value of $\frac{1}{715}=\frac{1}{5
\cdot 11 \cdot 13} \approx 0.00139860$ is a well-fitting value to an estimate of 0.00139884. Interesting
values ($\frac{16}{12375} =\frac{4^2}{3^2 \cdot 5^3 \cdot 11}$ and $\frac{625}{109531136}=\frac{5^4}{2^{12}
\cdot 11^2 \cdot 13 \cdot 17}$) are conjectured for the Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) and Bures qubit-qudit
($2 \times 4$) positive-partial-transpose (PPT)-probabilities. We re-examine, strongly supporting,
conjectures that the HS qubit-{\it qutrit} and rebit-{\it retrit} separability probabilities
are $\frac{27}{1000}=\frac{3^3}{2^3 \cdot 5^3}$ and $\frac{860}{6561}= \frac{2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot
43}{3^8}$, respectively. Prior studies have demonstrated that the HS two-rebit separability
probability is $\frac{29}{64}$ and strongly pointed to the HS two-qubit counterpart being $\frac{8}{33}$,
and a certain operator monotone one (other than the Bures) being $1 -\frac{256}{27 \pi^2}$.
