Many of the biological phenomena involve collective dynamics driven by self-propelled motion
and nonequilibrium force (i.e., activity) that result in features unexpected from equilibrium
physics. On the other hand, biological experiments utilizing molecular motors, bacteria, and
mammalian cells have served as ideal setups to probe the effect of activity in materials and compare
with theory. As has been established, however, biomolecules are chiral in nature, which can lead
to the chiral patterning of cells and even to the left-right symmetry breaking in our body. The general
mechanism of how the dynamics of bio-matters can couple with its own inherent chirality to produce
macroscopic patterns is yet to be elucidated. Here we report that cultured neural progenitor cells
(NPCs), which undergo self-propelled motion with nematic cell-to-cell interactions, exhibit
large scale chiral patterns when flowing out from containers made by gel. Moreover, a robust chiral
cell flow is produced along the boundary when the NPCs are cultured on substrates with edges. Perturbation
by actomyosin inhibitors allowed control over the chirality, resulting in the switching of the
direction of the chiral patterning and boundary flow. As predicted by a hydrodynamic theory analogous
to the non-Hermitian Schrodinger equation, we find an edge-localized unidirectional mode in the
Fourier spectrum of the cell density, which corresponds to the topological Kelvin wave. These results
establish a novel mechanism of flow that emerges from a pool of bipolar cells, and demonstrate how
topological concepts from condensed matter physics can naturally arise in chiral active systems
and multi-cellular phenomena.
