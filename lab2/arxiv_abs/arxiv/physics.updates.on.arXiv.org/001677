Materials lacking in-plane symmetry are ubiquitous in a wide range of applications such as electronics,
thermoelectrics, and high-temperature superconductors, in all of which the thermal properties
of the materials play a critical part. However, very few experimental techniques can be used to measure
in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity. A beam-offset method based on time-domain thermoreflectance
(TDTR) was previously proposed to measure in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity. However,
a detailed analysis of the beam-offset method is still lacking. Our analysis shows that uncertainties
can be large if the laser spot size or the modulation frequency is not properly chosen. Here we propose
an alternative approach based on TDTR to measure in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity using
a highly elliptical pump (heating) beam. The highly elliptical pump beam induces a quasi-one-dimensional
temperature profile on the sample surface that has a fast decay along the short axis of the pump beam.
The detected TDTR signal is exclusively sensitive to the in-plane thermal conductivity along the
short axis of the elliptical beam. By conducting TDTR measurements as a function of delay time with
the rotation of the elliptical pump beam to different orientations, the in-plane thermal conductivity
tensor of the sample can be determined. In this work, we first conduct detailed signal sensitivity
analyses for both techniques and provide guidelines in determining the optimal experimental conditions.
We then compare the two techniques under their optimal experimental conditions by measuring the
in-plane thermal conductivity tensor of a ZnO [11-20] sample. The accuracy and limitations of both
methods are discussed.
