This paper is devoted in the study of the hydrostatic equilibrium of stellar structure in the framework
of modified $f(R, T)$ gravity theory that allows the non-conservation of energy-momentum, with
possible implications for several cosmological and astrophysical issues such as the late-time
cosmic acceleration of the universe without appealing to exotic matter fields. For this purpose,
we consider the gravitational Lagrangian by taking an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar and
the trace of the stress-energy tensor. We obtain a generic form for the gravitational field equations
and derive the field equation for $f(R,T)$ = $R+2 \chi T$. Here we propose a particular metric potential
\textit{Buchdahl ansatz} [Phys. Rev. D 116, 1027 (1959)] in principle, of explaining almost all
the known analytic solution to the spherically symmetric, static Einstein equations with a perfect
fluid source. We argue that pressure isotropy equation for $f(R,T)$ is identical to that of the standard
Einstein gravity therefore all known metric potentials solving Einstein's equations are valid
here. However, for the choice of $f(T)= 2\chi T$ one may observe that the pressure and energy density
profiles are markedly different. An important case, which is analyzed in detail, is the all possible
Buchdahl solutions for spherical equilibrium configuration in $f(R,T)$ gravity and compare them
with standard gravity theory. To support the theoretical results, graphical analysis are employed
to investigate the physical viability of compact stars. We find that Buchdahl solution in Einstein
gravity and $f(R,T)$ gravity behave in a similar manner but in some situation Einstein gravity displays
more pleasing behavior than its $f(R,T)$ counterpart.
