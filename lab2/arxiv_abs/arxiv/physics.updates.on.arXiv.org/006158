An artificial intelligence (AI) control system is developed to maximize the mixing rate of a turbulent
jet. This system comprises six independently operated unsteady minijet actuators, two hot-wire
sensors placed in the jet, and genetic programming for the unsupervised learning of a near-optimal
control law. The ansatz of this law includes multi-frequency open-loop forcing, sensor-feedback
and nonlinear combinations thereof. Mixing performance is quantified by the decay rate of the centreline
mean velocity of jet. Intriguingly, the learning process of AI control discovers the classical
forcings, i.e. axisymmetric, helical and flapping achievable from conventional control techniques,
one by one in the order of increased performance, and finally converges to a hitherto unexplored
forcing. Careful examination of the control landscape unveils typical control laws, generated
in the learning process, and their evolutions. The best AI forcing produces a complex turbulent
flow structure that is characterized by periodically generated mushroom structures, helical
motion and oscillating jet column, all enhancing the mixing rate and vastly outperforming others.
Being never reported before, this flow structure is examined in various aspects, including the
velocity spectra, mean and fluctuating velocity fields and their downstream evolution, and flow
visualization images in three orthogonal planes, all compared with other classical flow structures.
Along with the knowledge of the minijet-produced flow and its effect on the initial condition of
the main jet, these aspects cast valuable insight into the physics behind the highly effective mixing
of this newly found flow structure. The results point to the great potential of AI in conquering the
vast opportunity space of control laws for many actuators and sensors and in optimizing turbulence.
