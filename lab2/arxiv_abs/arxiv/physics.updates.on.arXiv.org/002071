In a highly turbulent medium characterized by a low Damk\"ohler number Da, reactions are commonly
considered to occur in distributed zones broadened by small-scale turbulent eddies. In the present
communication, an alternative regime of propagation of reaction waves in a highly turbulent medium
is introduced and studied theoretically and numerically. More specifically, propagation of an
infinitely thin reaction sheet in a turbulent medium is analyzed, with molecular mixing of the reactant
and product being allowed in wide layers. In this limiting case, an increase in the consumption velocity
by turbulence is solely controlled by an increase in the reaction-sheet area. Based on physical
reasoning and estimates, the area is hypothesized to be close to the mean area of an inert iso-scalar
surface at the same turbulent Reynolds number. This hypothesis leads to a relation for the turbulent
consumption velocity, which is similar to the well-known Damk\"ohler scaling associated commonly
with distributed reaction zones at a low Da. The obtained theoretical results are validated by analyzing
a big database (23 cases characterized by 0.01<Da<1) created recently in 3D direct numerical simulations
of propagation of a statistically planar, one-dimensional, dynamically passive reaction wave
in statistically stationary, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. The DNS data well support the
aforementioned relation. They also show that the reaction is localized to thin zones even at Da as
low as 0.01, with a ratio of the turbulent and laminar consumption velocities being mainly controlled
by the reaction-zone-surface area.
