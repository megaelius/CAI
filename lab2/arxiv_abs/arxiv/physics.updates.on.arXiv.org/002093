The excited short-lived volume-localized electron quantum levels (VLELs) existent due to Coulomb
potential well inside positive ion are analytically investigated in the paper using a simplified
spherical fullerene model. Hence, those electron levels appear exclusively after the ionization
of neutral fullerene taking into account the unique geometrical shape of sphere. The existence
of those levels is argued, and their basic parameters (the energy levels, the wave eigenfunctions)
are approximately calculated. The wave functions of VLELs are basically localized inside fullerene
ion sphere (with a maximum amplitude in the centre) in contrast to ordinary surface-localized electron
levels (SLELs) having a wave functions in the vicinity of fullerene sphere formed by the cluster
composed of carbon ions. Contrary to VLELs, the wave functions of SLELs are present both in charged
and neutral fullerene. The analysis of electron beam interaction with the medium consistent of
fullerenes ions is conducted as the application of the methods developed. The analytical dependencies
of free electron recombination cross-sections for the capture to the volume-localized electron
levels are obtained. It is shown that the probabilities of electron capture to these VLELs are considerably
larger compared to capture to SLELs. Also, the calculational results of dipole moments for quantum
transitions from fullerene ions VLELs to other VLELs and to SLELs with spontaneous photon emission
are also presented in the paper. The calculated dipole moments depend on fullerene ionization extent,
initial and final electron states, and are varied from about 0.2 to 5 in atomic system of units. Finally,
the principal possibility of coherent radiation generation on fullerene ions VLELs is discussed.
