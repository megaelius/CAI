In analogy with similar effects in adiabatic compressible fluid dynamics, the effects of buoyancy
gradients on incompressible stratified flows are said to be `thermal'. The thermal rotating shallow
water (TRSW) model equations contain three small nondimensional parameters. These are the Rossby
number, the Froude number and the buoyancy parameter. Asymptotic expansion of the TRSW model equations
in these three small parameters leads to the deterministic thermal versions of the Salmon's L1 (TL1)
model and the thermal quasi-geostrophic (TQG) model, upon expanding in the neighbourhood of thermal
quasi-geostrophic balance among the flow velocity and the gradients of free surface elevation
and buoyancy. The linear instability of TQG at high wave number tends to create circulation at small
scales. Such a high wave number instability could be unresolvable in many computational simulations,
but its presence at small scales may contribute significantly to fluid transport at resolvable
scales. Sometimes such effects are modelled via `stochastic backscatter of kinetic energy'. Here
we try another approach. Namely, we model `stochastic transport' in the hierarchy of models TRSW/TL1/TQG.
The models are derived via the approach of \emph{stochastic advection by Lie transport} (SALT)
as obtained from a recently introduced stochastic version of the Euler--Poincar\'e variational
principle. We also indicate the potential next steps for applying these models in uncertainty quantification
and data assimilation of the rapid, high wavenumber effects of buoyancy fronts at these three levels
of description by using the data-driven stochastic parametrisation algorithms derived previously
using the SALT approach.
