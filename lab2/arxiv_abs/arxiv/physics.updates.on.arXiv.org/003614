We present two case studies of FAST electrostatic analyzer measurements of both highly nonthermal
($\kappa \lesssim$~2.5) and weakly nonthermal/thermal monoenergetic electron precipitation
at $\sim$4000~km, from which we infer the properties of the magnetospheric source distributions
via comparison of experimentally determined number density--, current density--, and energy
flux--voltage relationships with corresponding theoretical relationships. We also discuss
the properties of the two new theoretical number density--voltage relationships that we employ.
Moment uncertainties, which are calculated analytically via application of the \citet{Gershman2015}
moment uncertainty framework, are used in Monte Carlo simulations to infer ranges of magnetospheric
source population densities, temperatures, $\kappa$ values, and altitudes. We identify the most
likely ranges of source parameters by requiring that the range of $\kappa$ values inferred from
fitting experimental moment-voltage relationships correspond to the range of $\kappa$ values
inferred from directly fitting observed electron distributions with two-dimensional kappa distribution
functions. Observations in the first case study, which are made over $\sim$78--79$^\circ$ invariant
latitude (ILAT) in the Northern Hemisphere and 4.5--5.5 magnetic local time (MLT), are consistent
with a magnetospheric source population density $n_m =$~0.7--0.8~cm$^{-3}$, source temperature
$T_m \approx$~70~eV, source altitude $h =$~6.4--7.7~$R_E$, and $\kappa =$~2.2--2.8. Observations
in the second case study, which are made over 76--79$^\circ$~ILAT in the Southern Hemisphere and
$\sim$21~MLT, are consistent with a magnetospheric source population density $n_m =$~0.07--0.09~cm$^{-3}$,
source temperature $T_m \approx$~95~eV, source altitude $h \gtrsim$~6~$R_E$, and $\kappa =$~2--6.
