Quantum simulators are a promising technology on the spectrum of quantum devices from specialized
quantum experiments to universal quantum computers. These quantum devices utilize entanglement
and many-particle behaviors to explore and solve hard scientific, engineering, and computational
problems. Rapid development over the last two decades has produced more than 300 quantum simulators
in operation worldwide using a wide variety of experimental platforms. Recent advances in several
physical architectures promise a golden age of quantum simulators ranging from highly optimized
special purpose simulators to flexible programmable devices. These developments have enabled
a convergence of ideas drawn from fundamental physics, computer science, and device engineering.
They have strong potential to address problems of societal importance, ranging from understanding
vital chemical processes, to enabling the design of new materials with enhanced performance, to
solving complex computational problems. It is the position of the community, as represented by
participants of the NSF workshop on "Programmable Quantum Simulators," that investment in a national
quantum simulator program is a high priority in order to accelerate the progress in this field and
to result in the first practical applications of quantum machines. Such a program should address
two areas of emphasis: (1) support for creating quantum simulator prototypes usable by the broader
scientific community, complementary to the present universal quantum computer effort in industry;
and (2) support for fundamental research carried out by a blend of multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary
collaborations with resources for quantum simulator software, hardware, and education.
