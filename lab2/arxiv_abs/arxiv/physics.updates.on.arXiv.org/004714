The luminescence and inner structure of GaAs-AlGaAs quantum well tube (QWT) nanowires were studied
using low-temperature cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopic imaging, in combination with
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography, allowing for the first time a robust
correlation between the luminescence properties of these nanowires and their size and inner 3D
structure down to the nanoscale. Besides the core luminescence and minor defects-related contributions,
each nanowire showed one or more QWT peaks associated with nanowire regions of different diameters.
The values of the GaAs shell thickness corresponding to each QWT peak were then determined from the
nanowire diameters by employing a multishell growth model upon validation against experimental
data (core diameter and GaAs and AlGaAs shell thickness) obtained from the analysis of the 3D reconstructed
STEM tomogram of a GaAs-AlGaAs QWT nanowire. We found that QWT peak energies as a function of thus-estimated
(3-7 nm) GaAs shell thickness are 40-120 meV below the theoretical values of exciton recombination
for uniform QWTs symmetrically wrapped around a central core. However, the analysis of the 3D tomogram
further evidenced azimuthal asymmetries as well as (azimuthal and axial) random fluctuations
of the GaAs shell thickness, suggesting that the red-shift of QWT emissions is prominently due to
carrier localization. The CL mapping of QWT emission intensities along the nanowire axis allowed
to directly image the nanoscale localization of the emission, supporting the above picture. Our
findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the luminescence-structure relationship in
QWT nanowires and will foster their applications as efficient nanolaser sources for future monolithic
integration onto silicon.
