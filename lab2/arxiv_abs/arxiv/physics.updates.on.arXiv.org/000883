We analyze the method of optimal balance which was introduced by Viudez and Dritschel (J. Fluid Mech.
521, 2004, pp. 343-352) to provide balanced initializations for two-dimensional and three-dimensional
geophysical flows, here in the simpler context of a finite dimensional Hamiltonian two-scale system
with strong gyroscopic forces. It is well known that when the potential is analytic, such systems
have an approximate slow manifold that is defined up to terms that are exponentially small with respect
to the scale separation parameter. The method of optimal balance relies on the observation that
the approximate slow manifold remains an adiabatic invariant under slow deformations of the nonlinear
interactions. The method is formulated as a boundary value problem for a homotopic deformation
of the system from a linear regime, where the slow-fast splitting is known exactly, to the full nonlinear
regime. We show that, providing the ramp function which defines the homotopy is of Gevrey class 2
and satisfies vanishing conditions to all orders at the temporal end points, the solution of the
optimal balance boundary value problem yields a point on the approximate slow manifold that is exponentially
close to the approximation to the slow manifold via exponential asymptotics, albeit with a smaller
power of the small parameter in the exponent. In general, the order of accuracy of optimal balance
is limited by the order of vanishing derivatives of the ramp function at the temporal end points.
We also give a numerical demonstration of the efficacy of optimal balance, showing the dependence
of accuracy on the ramp time and the ramp function.
