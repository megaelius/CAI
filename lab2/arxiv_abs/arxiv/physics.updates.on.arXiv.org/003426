Objective: Fast neural Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a method which permits imaging
of neuronal activity in nerves by measuring the associated impedance changes (dZ). Due to the small
magnitudes of dZ signals, EIT parameters require optimization, which can be done using in silico
modelling: apart from predicting the best parameters for imaging, it can also help to validate experimental
data and explain the nature of the observed dZ. This has previously been completed for unmyelinated
fibres, but an extension to myelinated fibres is required for the development of a full nerve model
which could aid imaging neuronal traffic at the fascicular level and optimise neuromodulation
of the supplied internal organs to treat various diseases. Methods: An active FEM model of a myelinated
fibre coupled with external space was developed. A spatial dimension was added to the experimentally
validated space-clamped model of a human sensory fibre using the double cable paradigm. Electrical
parameters of the model were changed so that nodal and internodal membrane potential as well as propagation
velocity agreed with experimental values. dZ was simulated during activity under various conditions
and the optimal parameters for imaging were determined. Main Results: When using AC, dZ could be
recorded only at frequencies above 4 kHz, which is supported by experimental data. Optimal bandwidths
for dZ measurement were found to increase with AC frequency. Conclusion and significance: The novel
fully bi-directionally coupled FEM model of a myelinated fibre was able to optimize EIT for myelinated
fibres and explain the biophysical basis of the measured signals.
