Challenging space missions include those at very low altitudes, where the atmosphere is source
of aerodynamic drag on the spacecraft. To extend such missions lifetime, an efficient propulsion
system is required. One solution is Atmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP). It collects
atmospheric particles to be used as propellant for an electric thruster. The system would minimize
the requirement of limited propellant availability and can also be applied to any planet with atmosphere,
enabling new mission at low altitude ranges for longer times. Challenging is also the presence of
reactive chemical species, such as atomic oxygen in Earth orbit. Such species cause erosion of (not
only) propulsion system components, i.e. acceleration grids, electrodes, and discharge channels
of conventional EP systems. IRS is developing within the DISCOVERER project, an intake and a thruster
for an ABEP system. The paper describes the design and implementation of the RF helicon-based inductive
plasma thruster (IPT). This paper deals in particular with the design and implementation of a novel
antenna called the birdcage antenna, a device well known in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
also lately employed for helicon-wave based plasma sources in fusion research. The IPT is based
on RF electrodeless operation aided by an externally applied static magnetic field. The IPT is composed
by an antenna, a discharge channel, a movable injector, and a solenoid. By changing the operational
parameters along with the novel antenna design, the aim is to minimize losses in the RF circuit, and
accelerate a quasi-neutral plasma plume. This is also to be aided by the formation of helicon waves
within the plasma that are to improve the overall efficiency and achieve higher exhaust velocities.
Finally, the designed IPT with a particular focus on the birdcage antenna design procedure is presented
