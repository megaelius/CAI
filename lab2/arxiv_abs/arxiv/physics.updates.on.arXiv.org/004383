Charged particles breaking the speed of light in an optical medium spontaneously create a shockwave
of light just as jet planes breaking the speed of sound create a shockwave of sound, in a process called
the Cherenkov effect. Using resonant laser-driving, we can trigger stimulated Cherenkov emission
and accelerate the particle. These and all of the other implementations of the Cherenkov effects
were always described within the framework of classical physics. A similar classical treatment
has been satisfactory in all experiments of free-electron radiation and electron acceleration,
which solidified our understanding of these free-electron effects as completely classical. Meanwhile,
theoretical work has predicted an underlying quantum nature to the Cherenkov effects, yet no experimental
evidence has been found up to this date. Here, we observe the quantized nature of the stimulated Cherenkov
effect by achieving coherent resonant electron-laser interaction. Each electron in our experiment
is both accelerated and decelerated, simultaneously absorbing and emitting hundreds of photons
in a coherent manner. Consequently, the quantum wavepacket of each electron evolves into a coherent
plateau of hundreds of energy peaks quantized by the laser photon energy. This observation constitutes
the relativistic free-electron analogue of above-threshold ionization, yet with orders of magnitude
lower laser intensities. We measure all of the above in a laser-driven (ultrafast) transmission
electron microscope. Our findings expose the quantum nature in a wide range of free-electron phenomena:
proving that stimulated electron-photon interaction cannot always be described in terms of classical
point charges. Looking forward, exploiting quantum wave-dependent interactions may open a new
degree of freedom in the design of dielectric laser accelerators, Smith-Purcell sources, and other
free-electron processes.
