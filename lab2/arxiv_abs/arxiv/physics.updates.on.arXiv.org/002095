Many geophysical and astrophysical phenomena are driven by turbulent fluid dynamics, containing
behaviors separated by tens of orders of magnitude in scale. While direct simulations have made
large strides toward understanding geophysical systems, such models still inhabit modest ranges
of the governing parameters that are difficult to extrapolate to planetary settings. The canonical
problem of rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection provides an alternate approach - isolating
the fundamental physics in a reduced setting. Theoretical studies and asymptotically-reduced
simulations in rotating convection have unveiled a variety of flow behaviors likely relevant to
natural systems, but still inaccessible to direct simulation. In lieu of this, several new large-scale
rotating convection devices have been designed to characterize such behaviors. It is essential
to predict how this potential influx of new data will mesh with existing results. Surprisingly,
a coherent framework of predictions for extreme rotating convection has not yet been elucidated.
In this study, we combine asymptotic predictions, laboratory and numerical results, and experimental
constraints to build a heuristic framework for cross-comparison between a broad range of rotating
convection studies. We categorize the diverse field of existing predictions in the context of asymptotic
flow regimes. We then consider the physical constraints that determine the points of intersection
between flow behavior predictions and experimental accessibility. Applying this framework to
several upcoming devices demonstrates that laboratory studies may soon be able to characterize
geophysically-relevant flow regimes. These new data may transform our understanding of geophysical
and astrophysical turbulence, and the conceptual framework developed herein should provide the
theoretical infrastructure needed for meaningful discussion of these results.
