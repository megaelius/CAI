The nonlinear mechanism in the self-sustaining process (SSP) of wall-bounded turbulence is investigated.
Resolvent analysis is used to identify the principal forcing mode which produces the maximum amplification
of the velocities in direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the minimal channel for the buffer layer
and the modified logarithmic (log) layer. The wavenumbers targeted in this study are those of the
fundamental mode that is infinitely long in the streamwise direction and once periodic in the spanwise
direction. The identified mode is then projected out from the nonlinear term of the Navier- Stokes
equations at each time step from the DNS of the corresponding minimal channel. The results show that
the removal of the principal forcing mode of the fundamental wavenumber can inhibit turbulence
in both the buffer and log layer, with the effect being greater in the buffer layer. Removing the subsequent
modes or principal modes in the non-fundamental wavenumbers instead of the principal mode of the
fundamental wavenumber only marginally affects the flow. Analysis of the dyadic interactions
in the nonlinear term shows that contributions toward the principal forcing mode come from a limited
number of wavenumber interactions. Using conditional averaging, the flow structures that are
responsible for generating the nonlinear interaction to self-sustain turbulence are identified
as spanwise rolls interacting with oblique streaks. This method, based on the equations of motion,
corroborates previous studies, validates the similarities in the SSP of the buffer and log layer,
and characterises the underlying quadratic interactions in the SSP of the minimal channel.
