We present a brief overview of Sommerfeld's forerunner signal, which occurs when a monochromatic
plane-wave (frequency {\omega}={\omega}_s) suddenly arrives, at time t=0 and at normal incidence,
at the surface of a dispersive dielectric medium of refractive index n({\omega}). Deep inside the
dielectric host at a distance z0 from the surface, no signal arrives until t=z0/c, where c is the speed
of light in vacuum. Immediately after this point, a weak but extremely high frequency signal is observed
at z=z0. This so-called Sommerfeld forerunner (or precursor) is highly chirped, meaning that its
frequency, which is much greater than {\omega}_s immediately after t=z0/c, declines rapidly with
the passage of time. The incident light with its characteristic frequency {\omega}_s eventually
arrives at t~z0/vg , where vg is the group velocity of the incident light inside the host medium. Brillouin
has identified a second forerunner that occupies the interval between the end of the Sommerfeld
forerunner at t~n(0)z0/c and the beginning of the steady signal. This second forerunner is commonly
referred to as the Brillouin forerunner (or precursor). Given that the incident wave has a sudden
start at t=0, its frequency spectrum spans the entire range of frequencies from minus infinity to
infinity. Consequently, the high-frequency first forerunner cannot be considered a superoscillation,
nor can the low-frequency second forerunner be regarded as a suboscillation. The goal of the present
paper is to extend the Sommerfeld-Brillouin theory of precursors to bandlimited incident signals,
in an effort to determine the conditions under which these precursors would continue to exist, and
to answer the question as to whether or not such precursors, upon arising from a bandlimited incident
signal, constitute super- or sub-oscillations.
