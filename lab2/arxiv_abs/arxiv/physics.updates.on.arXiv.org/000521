A detailed study of the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima model and its extensions is presented. These simple
nonlinear partial differential equations suggested for both Rossby waves in the atmosphere and
also drift waves in a magnetically-confined plasma exhibit some remarkable and nontrivial properties,
which in their qualitative form survive in more realistic and complicated models, and as such form
a conceptual basis for understanding the turbulence and zonal flow dynamics in real plasma and geophysical
systems. Two idealised scenarios of generation of zonal flows by small-scale turbulence are explored:
a modulational instability and turbulent cascades. A detailed study of the generation of zonal
flows by the modulational instability reveals that the dynamics of this zonal flow generation mechanism
differ widely depending on the initial degree of nonlinearity. A numerical proof is provided for
the extra invariant in Rossby and drift wave turbulence -zonostrophy and the invariant cascades
are shown to be characterised by the zonostrophy pushing the energy to the zonal scales. A small scale
instability forcing applied to the model demonstrates the well-known drift wave - zonal flow feedback
loop in which the turbulence which initially leads to the zonal flow creation, is completely suppressed
and the zonal flows saturate. The turbulence spectrum is shown to diffuse in a manner which has been
mathematically predicted. The insights gained from this simple model could provide a basis for
equivalent studies in more sophisticated plasma and geophysical fluid dynamics models in an effort
to fully understand the zonal flow generation, the turbulent transport suppression and the zonal
flow saturation processes in both the plasma and geophysical contexts as well as other wave and turbulence
systems where order evolves from chaos.
