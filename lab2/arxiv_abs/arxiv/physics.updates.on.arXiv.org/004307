We present wall-resolved large-eddy simulations (LES) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
together with empirical modeling for {turbulent} Taylor-Couette {(TC)} flow where the inner cylinder
is rotating with angular velocity $\Omega_i$ and the outer cylinder is stationary. A simple empirical
model of the turbulent, TC flow is developed consisting of near-wall, log-like turbulent wall layers
separated by an annulus of constant angular momentum. The model is closed by a proposed scaling relation
concerning the thickness of the wall layer on the inner cylinder. Model results include the Nusselt
number $Nu$ (torque required to maintain the flow) and various measures of the wall-layer thickness
as a function of both the Taylor {number} $Ta$ and $\eta$. These agree reasonably with experimental
measurements, direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the present LES over a range of both $Ta$ and
$\eta$. In particular, the model shows that, at fixed $\eta<1$, $Nu$ grows like $Ta^{1/2}$ divided
by the square of the Lambert, (or Product-Log) function of a variable proportional to $Ta^{1/4}$.
This cannot be represented by a power law dependence on $Ta$. At the same time the wall-layer thicknesses
reduce slowly in relation to the cylinder gap. This suggests an asymptotic, very large $Ta$ state
consisting of constant angular momentum in the cylinder gap with $u_\theta = 0.5\,\Omega_i\,R_i^2/r$,
where $r$ is the radius, with vanishingly thin turbulent wall layers at the cylinder surfaces. An
extension of the model to rough-wall turbulent wall flow at the inner cylinder surface is described.
This shows an asymptotic, fully rough-wall state where the torque is independent of $Re_i/Ta$,
and where $Nu\sim Ta^{1/2}$.
