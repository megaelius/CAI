The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab searches for the charged-lepton flavour violating (CLFV) conversion
of a negative muon into an electron in the field of an aluminum nucleus, with a distinctive signature
of a mono-energetic electron of energy slightly below the muon rest mass (104.967 MeV). The Mu2e
goal is to improve by four orders of magnitude the search sensitivity with respect to the previous
experiments. Any observation of a CLFV signal will be a clear indication of new physics. The Mu2e
detector is composed of a tracker, an electro- magnetic calorimeter and an external veto for cosmic
rays surrounding the solenoid. The calorimeter plays an important role in providing particle identification
capabilities, a fast online trigger filter, a seed for track reconstruction while working in vacuum,
in the presence of 1 T axial magnetic field and in an harsh radiation environment. The calorimeter
requirements are to provide a large acceptance for 100 MeV electrons and reach at these energies:
(a) a time resolution better than 0.5 ns; (b) an energy resolution < 10% and (c) a position resolution
of 1 cm. The calorimeter design consists of two disks, each one made of 674 undoped CsI crystals read
by two large area arrays of UV-extended SiPMs. We report here the construction and test of the Module-0
prototype. The Module-0 has been exposed to an electron beam in the energy range around 100 MeV at
the Beam Test Facility in Frascati. Preliminary results of timing and energy resolution at normal
incidence are shown. A discussion of the technical aspects of the calorimeter engineering is also
reported in this paper.
