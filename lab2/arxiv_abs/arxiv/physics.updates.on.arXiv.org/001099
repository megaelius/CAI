The index of refraction governs the flow of light through materials. At visible and near infrared
wavelengths the real part of the refractive index is limited to less than 3 for naturally occurring
transparent materials, fundamentally restricting applications. Here, we carried out experiments
to study the upper limit of the effective refractive index of self-assembled metasurfaces at visible
and near-infrared wavelengths. The centimeter-scale metasurfaces were made of a hexagonally
close packed (hcp) monolayer of gold nanospheres coated with tunable alkanethiol ligand shells,
controlling the interparticle gap from 2.8 to 0.45 nm. In contrast to isolated dimer studies, the
macro-scale areas allow for billions of gaps to be simultaneously probed and the hcp symmetry leads
to large wavelength shifts in the resonance mode, enabling subnanometer length scale mechanisms
to be reproducibly measured in the far-field. We demonstrate for subnanometer gaps, that the optical
response of the metasurfaces agrees well with a classical (local) model, with minor nonlocal effects
and no clear evidence of ligand-mediated charge transfer at optical frequencies. We determine
the effective real part of the refractive index for the metasurfaces has a minimum of 1.0 for green-yellow
colors, then quickly reaches a maximum of 5.0 in the reds and remains larger than 3.5 far into the near
infrared. We further show changing the terminal group and conjugation of the ligands in the metasurfaces
has little effect on the optical properties. These results establish a pragmatic upper bound on
the confinement of visible and near infrared light, potentially leading to unique dispersion engineered
coatings
