We investigate gravity models emerging from nonholonomic (subjected to non-integrable constraints)
Ricci flows. Considering generalizations of G. Perelman's entropy functionals, relativistic
geometric flow equations, nonholonomic Ricci soliton and equivalent (modified) Einstein equations
are derived. There are studied nonholonomic configurations which allow explicit modeling of entropic
scenarios for gravity and dark matter (in the E. Verlinde approach and/or other variants). It is
shown that using the anholonomic frame deformation method, the systems of nonlinear partial differential
equations for geometric flow evolution of nonlinear stationary gravitations systems can be decoupled
and integrated in general forms. In this and a series of partner works, we elaborate on stationary
models of emergent gravity with quasi-periodic gravitational, matter fields and dark energy/matter
structure. Such configurations can not be described thermodynamically using the concept of Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy if there are not involved additionally any area-entropy, holographic or duality relations.
Nevertheless, generalizing G. Perelman statistic thermodynamic approach to models of relativistic
Ricci flows and nonholonomic solitons, we can compute respective thermodynamic values for all
types of gravitational and matter field configurations and their geometric evolution. There are
considered nonholonomic deformations of the F- and W-entropy and studied relativistic thermodynamic
models for more general classes of physically important solutions with quasi-periodic and pattern
forming structure in modified gravity theories and general relativity.
