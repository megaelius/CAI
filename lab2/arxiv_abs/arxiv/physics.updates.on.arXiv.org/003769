Although quantum fields comprise infinitely many modes, the current description of the interactions
among quantum fields is not constrained by the laws of statistical mechanics. We present a new framework
that incorporates the laws of statistical mechanics into the theory of quantum fields. When the
interactions of quantum fields are constrained by the laws of statistical mechanics, the scattering
amplitudes are rendered naturally divergence-free at all orders. As a first test of the new framework,
we use it to calculate the amplitudes of the two scattering processes that have played a pivotal role
in the development of QED. The 1-loop correction to electron's anomalous magnetic moment, predicted
by the new framework, differs from the experimentally measured value by less than 0.06%. The calculation
of the Lamb shift yields a result that differs from the experimentally measured value by less than
0.33%. In the hard scattering regime we calculate, at 1-loop, the running of the fine structure constant
at high momentum transfers. At momentum transfer scales that are one to four orders of magnitude
above the electron mass scale, the predictions of the new framework deviate from the previously
known results by less than 0.8%. At the tree level, the angular distribution of the differential
cross section for Compton scattering predicted by the new framework is shown to be in good agreement
with the experimental results and the Klein-Nishina formula. Finally, we consider the most spectacular
disagreement between the prediction of the previous framework and observations---the cosmological
constant problem. We show that the free Maxwell field's contribution to vacuum energy density predicted
by the new framework is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the WMAP's latest upper bound
for dark energy density, in contrast to the divergent contribution predicted by previous results.
