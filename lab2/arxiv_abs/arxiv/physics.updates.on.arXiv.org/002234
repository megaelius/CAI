Radical pair recombination reactions are known to be sensitive to the application of both low and
high magnetic fields. The application of a weak magnetic field reduces the singlet yield of a singlet-born
radical pair, whereas the application of a strong magnetic field increases the singlet yield. The
high field effect arises from energy conservation: when the magnetic field is stronger than the
sum of the hyperfine fields in the two radicals, ${\rm S}\to {\rm T}_{\pm}$ transitions become energetically
forbidden, thereby reducing the number of pathways for singlet to triplet interconversion. The
low field effect arises from symmetry breaking: the application of a weak magnetic field lifts degeneracies
among the zero field eigenstates and increases the number of pathways for singlet to triplet interconversion.
However, the details of this effect are more subtle, and have not previously been properly explained.
Here we present a complete analysis of the low field effect in a radical pair containing a single proton,
and in a radical pair in which one of the radicals contains a large number of hyperfine-coupled nuclear
spins. We find that the new transitions that occur when the field is switched on are between ${\rm
S}$ and ${\rm T}_0$ in both cases, and not between ${\rm S}$ and ${\rm T}_{\pm}$ as has previously
been claimed. We then illustrate this result by using it in conjunction with semiclassical spin
dynamics simulations to account for the observation of a biphasic--triphasic--biphasic transition
with increasing magnetic field strength in the magnetic field effect on the time-dependent survival
probability of a photoexcited carotenoid-porphyrin-fullerene radical pair.
