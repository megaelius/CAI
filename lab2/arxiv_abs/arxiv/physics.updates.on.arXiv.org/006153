Active- and transfer-learning are applied to polymer flows for the multiscale discovery of effective
constitutive approximations required in viscoelastic flow simulation. The result is macroscopic
rheology directly connected to a microstructural model. Micro and macroscale simulations are
adaptively coupled by means of Gaussian process regression to run the expensive microscale computations
only as necessary. This active-learning guided multiscale method can automatically detect the
inaccuracy of the learned constitutive closure and initiate simulations at new sampling points
informed by proper acquisition functions, leading to an autonomic microscale-macroscale coupled
system. Also, we develop a new dissipative particle dynamics model with the range of interaction
cutoff between particles allowed to vary with the local strain-rate invariant, which is able to
capture both the shear-thinning viscosity and the normal stress difference functions consistent
with rheological experiments for aqueous polyacrylamide solutions. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of using active- and transfer-learning schemes to on-the-fly couple
a spectral element solver and a mesoscopic particle-based simulator, and verify that the microscale-macroscale
coupled model with effective constitutive closure learned from microscopic dynamics can outperform
empirical constitutive models compared to experimental observations. The effective closure
learned in a channel simulation is then transferred directly to the flow past a circular cylinder,
where the results show that only two additional microscopic simulations are required to achieve
a satisfactory constitutive model to once again close the continuum equations. This new paradigm
of active- and transfer-learning for multiscale modeling is readily applicable to other microscale-macroscale
coupled simulations of complex fluids and other materials.
