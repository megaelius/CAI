The optical emission spectra of high pressure CO$_2$ microwave plasmas are usually dominated by
the C$_2$ Swan bands. In this paper, the use of the C$_2$ Swan bands for estimating the gas temperature
in CO$_2$ microwave plasmas is assessed. State by state fitting is employed to check the correctness
of assuming a Boltzmann distribution for the rotational and vibrational distribution functions
and, within statistical and systematic uncertainties, the C$_2$ Swan band can be fitted accurately
with a single temperature for rotational and vibrational levels. The processes leading to the production
of the C$_2$ molecule and particularly its d$^3\Pi_g$ state are briefly reviewed as well as collisional
relaxation times of the latter. It is concluded that its rotational temperature can be associated
to the gas temperature of the CO$_2$ microwave plasma and the results are moreover cross-checked
by adding a small amount of N$_2$ in the discharge and measuring the CN violet band system. The 2.45~GHz
plasma source is analyzed in the pressure range 180-925~mbar, for input microwave powers ranging
from 0.9 - 3 kW and with gas flow rates of 5-100~L/min. An intense C$_2$ Swan bands emission spectrum
can be measured only when the plasma is operated in contracted regime. A unique temperature of about
6000 $\pm$ 500 K is obtained for all investigated conditions. A spectroscopic database is constructed
using the recent compilation and calculations by Brooke et al. \cite{BROOKE201311} of the line
strengths and molecular constants for the C$_2$ (d$^3\Pi_g$-a$^3\Pi_u$) Swan bands system and
