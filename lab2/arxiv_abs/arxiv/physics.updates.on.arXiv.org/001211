The atomic scale insights into the interaction of water with oxide surface are essential for elucidating
the mechanism of physiochemical processes in various scientific and practical fields, since the
water is ubiquitous and coats multifarious material surface under ambient conditions. By utilizing
periodic density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections, herein we report
for the first time the energetically and thermodynamically favorable homolytic dissociative
adsorption behavior of water over magnesia (001) films deposited on metal substrate. The water
adsorption on pristine magnesia (001) is quite weak and the heterolytic dissociation is the only
fragmentation pathway, which is highly endothermic with large activation barrier of 1.167 eV.
The binding strength for the molecular and dissociative adsorption configurations of water on
hybrid MgO(001) films are significantly larger than corresponding configurations on bare magnesia
(001). The homolytic dissociative adsorption energy of water on monolayer oxide is calculated
to be -1.192 eV, which is even larger than all the heterolytic dissociative adsorption states. With
the increase of the oxide thickness, the homolytic dissociative adsorption energy decreases promptly,
indicating the nanoscale of oxide film play a crucial role in homolytic splitting of water. The homolytic
dissociative adsorption structure could be obtained by transformation reaction from heterolytic
dissociative adsorption structure, presenting activation barriers 0.733, 1.103, 1.306, 1.571,
and 1.849 eV for reactions on 1 ML to 5 ML films. It is anticipated that the results here could provide
inspiring clue and versatile strategy for enhancing chemical reactivity and properties of insulating
oxide toward homolytic water splitting processes involved in novel and unprecedented applications.
