Micro-combs [1 - 4], optical frequency combs generated by integrated micro-cavity resonators,
offer the full potential of their bulk counterparts [5,6], but in an integrated footprint. The discovery
of temporal soliton states (DKS dissipative Kerr solitons) [4,7-11] as a means of modelocking microcombs
has enabled breakthroughs in many fields including spectroscopy [12,13], microwave photonics
[14], frequency synthesis [15], optical ranging [16,17], quantum sources [18,19], metrology
[20,21] and more. One of their most promising applications has been optical fibre communications
where they have enabled massively parallel ultrahigh capacity multiplexed data transmission
[22,23]. Here, by using a new and powerful class of microcomb called soliton crystals [11], we achieve
unprecedented data transmission over standard optical fibre using a single integrated chip source.
We demonstrate a line rate of 44.2 Terabits per second using the telecommunications C band at 1550nm
with a spectral efficiency, a critically important performance metric, of 10.4 bits/s/Hz. Soliton
crystals exhibit robust and stable generation and operation as well as a high intrinsic efficiency
that, together with a low soliton microcomb spacing of 48.9 GHz enable the use of a very high coherent
data modulation format of 64 QAM (quadrature amplitude modulated). We demonstrate error free transmission
over 75 km of standard optical fibre in the laboratory as well as in a field trial over an installed
metropolitan optical fibre network. These experiments were greatly aided by the ability of the
soliton crystals to operate without stabilization or feedback control. This work demonstrates
the capability of optical soliton crystal microcombs to perform in demanding and practical optical
communications networks.
