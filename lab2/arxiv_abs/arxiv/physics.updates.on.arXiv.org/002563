Infectious disease outbreaks recapitulate biology: they emerge from the multi-level interaction
of hosts, pathogens, and their shared environment. As a result, predicting when, where, and how
far diseases will spread requires a complex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated
that predicting different components of outbreaks--e.g., the expected number of cases, pace and
tempo of cases needing treatment, demand for prophylactic equipment, importation probability
etc.--is feasible. Therefore, advancing both the science and practice of disease forecasting
now requires testing for the presence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction. To investigate
the question of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to forecasting
across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy as a model independent measure
of predictability. Studying the predictability of a diverse collection of historical outbreaks--including,
chlamydia, dengue, gonorrhea, hepatitis A, influenza, measles, mumps, polio, and whooping cough--we
identify a fundamental entropy barrier for infectious disease time series forecasting. However,
we find that for most diseases this barrier to prediction is often well beyond the time scale of single
outbreaks. We also find that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both shifting
model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely mechanisms for the observed
differences across contagions. Our results highlight the importance of moving beyond time series
forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches, and suggest challenges for performing
model selection across long time series. We further anticipate that our findings will contribute
to the rapidly growing field of epidemiological forecasting and may relate more broadly to the predictability
of complex adaptive systems.
