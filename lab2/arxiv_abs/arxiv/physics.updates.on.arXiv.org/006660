Aims: The secondary atmospheres of terrestrial planets form and evolve as a consequence of interaction
with the interior over geological time. We aim to quantify the influence of planetary bulk composition
on interior--atmosphere evolution to aid the interpretation of future observations of terrestrial
exoplanet atmospheres. Methods: We use a geochemical model to determine the major-element composition
of planetary interiors (MgO, FeO, and SiO$_2$) following the crystallization of a magma ocean after
planet formation, predicting a compositional profile of the interior as an initial condition for
our long-term thermal evolution model. Our 1D evolution model predicts the pressure-temperature
structure of the interior which we use to evaluate near-surface melt production and subsequent
volatile outgassing. Volatiles are exchanged between the interior and atmosphere according to
mass conservation. Results: Based on stellar compositions reported in the Hypatia catalog, we
predict that about half of rocky exoplanets have a mantle that convects as a single layer (whole-mantle
convection), and the other half exhibit double-layered convection due to the presence of a mid-mantle
compositional boundary. Double-layered convection is more likely for planets with high bulk planetary
Fe-content and low Mg/Si-ratio. We find that planets with low Mg/Si-ratio tend to cool slowly because
their mantle viscosity is high. Accordingly, low-Mg/Si planets also tend to lose volatiles swiftly
through extensive melting. Moreover, the dynamic regime of the lithosphere (plate tectonics vs.
stagnant lid) has a first-order influence on the thermal evolution and volatile cycling. These
results suggest that the composition of terrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres can inform about
the dynamic regime of the lithosphere, and the thermo-chemical evolution of the interior.
