We report on new findings in a laser driven enhanced electron beam generation in the multi MeV energy
range at moderate relativistic laser intensities and their applications. In our experiment, an
intense sub-picosecond laser pulse propagates through a plasma of a near critical electron density
(NCD) and direct laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons takes place. The breakthrough toward high
current relativistic electron beams became possible due to application of low density polymer
foams of sub-mm thickness. In foams, the NCD-plasma was produced by a mechanism of super-sonic ionization.
Compared to NCD-plasmas generated by laser irradiation of conventional foils, the DLA acceleration
path in foams was strongly enhanced. Measurements resulted into 11{\div}13 MeV of the effective
electron temperature and up to 100 MeV maximum of the electron energy measured in the laser pulse
propagation direction. The growth of the electron energy was accompanied by a strong increase of
the number of super-ponderomotive electrons and a well-defined directionality of the electron
beam that propagates in a divergence cone with a half angle of 12{\deg}. For the energy range above
7.5 MeV that is relevant for gamma-driven nuclear reactions, we estimate a charge carried by these
well-directed electron beams as high as 50 nC and a corresponding efficiency of the laser energy
conversion into electrons of 6%. The electron spectra generated by the DLA-mechanism in NCD-plasma
at 1019 Wcm-2 laser intensity were compared with those measured in shots onto conventional metallic
foils at ultra-relativistic laser intensities of 1021 Wcm-2 . In the last case, the twice lower effective
electron temperature and the twice lower maximum of the electron energy were registered. The substantial
difference in the electron spectra for these two cases presented itself in the isotope production
yield.
