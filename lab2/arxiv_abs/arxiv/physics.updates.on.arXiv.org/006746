Many materials have anisotropic thermal conductivity, with diverse applications such as transistors,
thermoelectrics, and laser gain media. Yet measuring the thermal conductivity tensor of such materials
remains a challenge, particularly for materials lacking in-plane symmetry (i.e., transversely
anisotropic materials). This paper demonstrates thermal conductivity tensor measurements for
transversely anisotropic materials, by extending beam-offset frequency-domain thermoreflectance
(BO-FDTR) methods which had previously been limited to transversely isotropic materials. Extensive
sensitivity analysis is used to determine an appropriate range of heating frequencies and beam
offsets to extract various tensor elements. The new technique is demonstrated on a model transversely
anisotropic material, x-cut quartz (<110> {\alpha}-SiO2), by combining beam offset measurements
from different sample orientations to reconstruct the full in-plane thermal conductivity tensor.
The technique is also validated by measurements on two transversely isotropic materials, sapphire
and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The anisotropic measurements demonstrated very
good self-consistency in correctly identifying isotropic directions when present, with residual
anisotropy errors below 4% for sapphire and 2% for HOPG and quartz. Finally, a computational case
study (simulated experiment) shows how the arbitrary in-plane thermal conductivity tensor of
a fictitious material with high in-plane anisotropy can in principle be obtained from only a single
sample orientation, rather than multiple orientations like the experiments on x-cut quartz.
