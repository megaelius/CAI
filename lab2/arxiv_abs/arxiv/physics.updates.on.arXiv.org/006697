In this paper we present the Neuron Module that we implemented within the Matlab-based diffusion
MRI simulation toolbox SpinDoctor. SpinDoctor uses finite element discretization and adaptive
time integration to solve the Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation for general diffusion-encoding
sequences, at multiple b-values and in multiple diffusion directions. In order to facilitate the
diffusion MRI simulation of realistic neurons by the research community, we constructed finite
element meshes for a group of 36 pyramidal neurons and a group of 29 spindle neurons whose morphological
descriptions were found in the publicly available neuron repository NeuroMorpho. We also broke
the neurons into the soma and dendrite branches and created finite elements meshes for these cell
components. Through the Neuron Module, these neuron and cell components finite element meshes
can be seamlessly coupled with the functionalities of SpinDoctor. To illustrate some potential
uses of the Neuron Module, we show numerical examples of the simulated diffusion MRI signals in multiple
diffusion directions from whole neurons as well as from the soma and dendrite branches, and include
a comparison of the high b-value behavior between dendrite branches and whole neurons. In addition,
we demonstrate that the neuron meshes can be used to perform Monte-Carlo diffusion MRI simulations
as well. We show that at equivalent accuracy, if only one gradient direction needs to be simulated,
SpinDoctor is faster than a GPU implementation of Monte-Carlo. Finally, we numerically compute
the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of the Bloch-Torrey and the Laplace operators on the neuron
geometries using a finite elements discretization, in order to give guidance in the choice of the
space and time discretization parameters for both finite elements and Monte-Carlo approaches.
