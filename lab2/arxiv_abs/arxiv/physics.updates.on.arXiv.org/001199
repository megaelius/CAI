Turbulent flows under transcritical conditions are present in regenerative cooling systems of
rocker engines and extraction processes in chemical engineering. The turbulent flows and the corresponding
heat transfer phenomena in these complex processes are still not well understood experimentally
and numerically. The objective of this work is to investigate the turbulent flows under transcritical
conditions using DNS of turbulent channel flows. A fully compressible solver is used in conjunction
with a Peng-Robinson real-fluid equation of state to describe the transcritical flows. A channel
flow with two isothermal walls is simulated with one heated and one cooled boundary layers. The grid
resolution adopted in this study is slightly finer than that required for DNS of incompressible
channel flows. The simulations are conducted using both fully (FC) and quasi-conservative (QC)
schemes to assess their performance for transcritical wall-bounded flows. The instantaneous
flows and the statistics are analyzed and compared with the canonical theories. It is found that
results from both FC and QC schemes qualitatively agree well with noticeable difference near the
top heated wall, where spurious oscillations in velocity can be observed. Using the DNS data, we
then examine the usefulness of Townsend attached eddy hypothesis in the context of flows at transcritical
conditions. It is shown that the streamwise energy spectrum exhibits the inverse wavenumber scaling
and that the streamwise velocity structure function follows a logarithmic scaling, thus providing
support to the attached eddy model at transcritical conditions.
