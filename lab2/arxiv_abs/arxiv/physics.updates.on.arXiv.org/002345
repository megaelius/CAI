If a system undergoing phase transitions exhibits some characteristics of both first and second
order, it is said to be of 'mixed order' or to display the Thouless effect. Such a transition is present
in a simple model of a dynamic social network, in which $N_{I/E}$ extreme introverts/extroverts
always cut/add random links. In particular, simulations showed that $\left\langle f\right\rangle
$, the average fraction of cross-links between the two groups (which serves as an 'order parameter'
here), jumps dramatically when $\Delta \equiv N_{I}-N_{E}$ crosses the 'critical point' $\Delta
_{c}=0$, as in typical first order transitions. Yet, at criticality, there is no phase co-existence,
but the fluctuations of $f$ are much larger than in typical second order transitions. Indeed, it
was conjectured that, in the thermodynamic limit, both the jump and the fluctuations become maximal,
so that the system is said to display an 'extreme Thouless effect.' While earlier theories are partially
successful, we provide a mean-field like approach that accounts for all known simulation data and
validates the conjecture. Moreover, for the critical system $N_{I}=N_{E}=L$, an analytic expression
for the mesa-like stationary distribution, $P\left( f\right) $, shows that it is essentially flat
in a range $\left[ f_{0},1-f_{0}\right] $, with $f_0 \ll 1$. Numerical evaluations of $f_{0}$ provides
excellent agreement with simulation data for $L\lesssim 2000$. For large $L$, we find $f_{0}\rightarrow
\sqrt{\left( \ln L^2 \right) /L}$ , though this behavior begins to set in only for $L>10^{100}$.
For accessible values of $L$, we provide a transcendental equation for an approximate $f_{0}$ which
is better than $\sim$1% down to $L=100$. We conjecture how this approach might be used to attack other
systems displaying an extreme Thouless effect.
