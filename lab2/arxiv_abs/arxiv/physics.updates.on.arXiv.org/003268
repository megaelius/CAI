Uncovering meaningful regularities in complex oscillatory signals is a challenging problem with
applications across a wide range of disciplines. Here we present a novel approach, based on the Hilbert
transform (HT). We show that temporal periodicity can be uncovered by averaging the signal in a moving
window of appropriated length, $\tau$, before applying the HT. By analyzing the variation of the
mean rotation period, $\overline{T}$, of the Hilbert phase as a function of $\tau$, we discover
well-defined plateaus. In many geographical regions the plateau corresponds to the expected one-year
solar cycle; however, in regions where SAT dynamics is highly irregular, the plateaus reveal non-trivial
periodicities, which can be interpreted in terms of climatic phenomena such as El Ni\~no. In these
regions, we also find that Fourier analysis is unable to detect the periodicity that emerges when
$\tau$ increases and gradually washes out SAT variability. The values of $\overline{T}$ obtained
for different $\tau$s are then given to a standard machine learning algorithm. The results demonstrate
that these features are informative and constitute a new approach for SAT time series classification.
To support these results, we analyse synthetic time series generated with a simple model and confirm
that our method extracts information that is fully consistent with our knowledge of the model that
generates the data. Remarkably, the variation of $\overline{T}$ with $\tau$ in the synthetic data
is similar to that observed in real SAT data. This suggests that our model contains the basic mechanisms
underlying the unveiled periodicities. Our results demonstrate that Hilbert analysis combined
with temporal averaging is a powerful new tool for discovering hidden temporal regularity in complex
oscillatory signals.
