The beam-ion interaction is a potential limitation of beam performance in electron accelerators,
especially where the beam emittance is of a great concern in future ultra-low emittance light source.
"Conventionally", the beam instability due to beam-ion interaction is attributed to two types
of effects: ion trapping effect and fast ion effect, which emphasize the beam-ion dynamics in different
time scales. Whereas, in accelerators, the beam suffers from a mixture of ion trapping effect and
fast ion effect, leading to a more complicated process and requiring a self-consistent treatment.
To evaluate the beam characteristics, as emittance growth under the influence from beam-ion effect,
a new numerical simulation code based on the "quasi-strong-strong" model has been developed, including
modules of ionization, beam-ion interaction, synchrotron radiation damping, quantum excitation,
bunch-by-bunch feedback, etc. In the study, we do not regularly distinguish the ion trapping effect
and the fast ion effect, but treat beam-ion interaction more generally and consistently. The lattice
of High Energy Photon Source, a diffraction limit ring under construction in Beijing, is used as
an example to show the beam-ion effect. It is found that in this low emittance ring, the beam-ion instability
is not a dominant mechanism in operation mode with a high beam current, but seriously occurs in a lower
beam current region. When the beam-ion instability were significantly driven and can not be damped
by the synchrotron radiation damping, the simulations show the bunch-by-bunch feedback system
based on the Finite Impulse Response filter technique can be adopted to mitigate it effectively.
