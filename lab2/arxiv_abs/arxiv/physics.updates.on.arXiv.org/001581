A model of the ionospheric global conductor is designed. The ionospheric conductor is considered
in the framework of a two-dimensional approximation based on high conductivity in the direction
of the magnetic field. Under this assumption the magnetic field lines are equipotential, and the
charge transfer between them is determined only by integral Pedersen and Hall conductivities.
The model is constructed as the first approximation in the small parameter expansion of the solution
of the three-dimensional problems of electrical conductivity. The small parameter is the ratio
of Pedersen and field-aligned conductivities. The space distributions of the Pedersen and Hall
conductivities are calculated using the empirical models IRI, MSISE, IGRF and applied to construct
the maps of the integral conductivities. The parts of the magnetosphere with high conductivity
across the magnetic field lines, namely, the cusps and the plasma layer are analyzed. It is shown
that the connection of these magnetospheric conductors to the ionosphere in parallel makes the
auroral zones equipotential regions. As a consequence, for the ionospheric electric fields, which
generators are located in the ionosphere or in the atmosphere, the global problem of electrical
conductivity is separated into three independent boundary value problems in three regions: two
polar caps and the main part of the ionosphere which includes the mid- and low-latitude parts of the
ionosphere. The model can be used for the analysis of the ionospheric part of the Global Electric
Circuit, for calculation of the ionospheric dynamo electric field and as a fragment in more complex
ionospheric and magnetospheric models.
