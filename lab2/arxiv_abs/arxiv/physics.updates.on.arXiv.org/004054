Linear super-resolution microscopy via synthesis aperture approach permits fast acquisition
because of its wide-field implementations, however, it has been limited in resolution because
a missing spatial-frequency band occurs when trying to use a shift magnitude surpassing the cutoff
frequency of the detection system beyond a factor of two, which causes ghosting to appear. Here,
we propose a method of chip-based 3D nanoscopy through large and tunable spatial-frequency-shift
effect, capable of covering full extent of the spatial-frequency component within a wide passband.
The missing of spatial-frequency can be effectively solved by developing a spatial-frequency-shift
actively tuning approach through wave vector manipulation and operation of optical modes propagating
along multiple azimuthal directions on a waveguide chip to interfere. In addition, the method includes
a chip-based sectioning capability, which is enabled by saturated absorption of fluorophores.
By introducing ultra-large propagation effective refractive index, nanoscale resolution is
possible, without sacrificing the temporal resolution and the field-of-view. Imaging on GaP waveguide
material demonstrates a lateral resolution of lamda/10, which is 5.4 folds above Abbe diffraction
limit, and an axial resolution of lamda/19 using 0.9 NA detection objective. Simulation with an
assumed propagation effective refractive index of 10 demonstrates a lateral resolution of lamda/22,
in which the huge gap between the directly shifted and the zero-order components is completely filled
to ensure the deep-subwavelength resolvability. It means that, a fast wide-field 3D deep-subdiffraction
visualization could be realized using a standard microscope by adding a mass-producible and cost-effective
spatial-frequency-shift illumination chip.
