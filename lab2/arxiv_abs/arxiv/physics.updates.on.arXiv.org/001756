Actuator line model has been widely employed in wind turbine simulations. However, the standard
actuator line model does not include a model for the turbine nacelle which can significantly impact
turbine wake characteristics as shown in the literature. Another disadvantage of the standard
actuator line model is that more geometrical features of turbine blades cannot be resolved on a finer
mesh. To alleviate these disadvantages of the standard model, we develop a new class of actuator
surface models for turbine blades and nacelle to take into account more geometrical details of turbine
blades and include the effect of turbine nacelle. In the actuator surface model for blade, the aerodynamic
forces calculated using the blade element method are distributed from the surface formed by the
foil chords at different radial locations. In the actuator surface model for nacelle, the forces
are distributed from the actual nacelle surface with the normal force component computed in the
same way as in the direct forcing immersed boundary method and the tangential force component computed
using a friction coefficient and a reference velocity of the incoming flow. The actuator surface
model for nacelle is evaluated by simulating the flow over periodically placed nacelles. Both the
actuator surface simulation and the wall-resolved large-eddy simulation are carried out. The
comparison shows that the actuator surface model is able to give acceptable results especially
at far wake locations on a very coarse mesh. It is noted that although this model is employed for the
turbine nacelle in this work, it is also applicable to other bluff bodies. The capability of the actuator
surface model in predicting turbine wakes is assessed by simulating the flow over the MEXICO (Model
experiments in Controlled Conditions) turbine and a hydrokinetic turbine.
