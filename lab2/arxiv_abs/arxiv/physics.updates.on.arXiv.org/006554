Very high frequency (VHF) driven capacitive discharges are now being increasingly adopted for
plasma-based materials processing due to their high processing rates and lower substrate damage.
Past studies related to complex plasma dynamics and higher harmonics generation in such systems
were limited to constant voltage/current conditions, whereas, industrial systems are mostly
driven by constant power density sources. In the present study, using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation,
we explore the dynamics of collisionless symmetric capacitive discharges that is operated at constant
power densities. Our focus is on the effect of the driving frequency on the discharge parameters
like the electron density/temperature, the electron energy distribution function (EEDF), the
ion energy distribution function (IEDF), and the generation of higher harmonics in the device.
The simulations are performed for a driving frequency from 27.12-100 MHz in argon plasma at a gas
pressure of 1 Pa and for two values of the power density, namely, 2 kW/m3 and 20 kW/m3. It is observed
that the required discharge voltage for maintaining constant power density decreases and discharge
current increases with an increase in the driving frequency. A transition frequency is observed
at both power densities. The density decreases (electron temperature increases) before the transition
frequency and the trend is reversed after crossing the transition frequency. The EEDF shows an enhancement
in the population of the mid-energy range of electrons as the driving frequency increases up to the
transition frequency thereby changing the shape of EEDF from bi-Maxwellian to nearly Maxwellian,
and then transforms into a nearly bi-Maxwellian at higher driving frequencies.
