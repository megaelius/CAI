The emergence of second-generation high temperature superconducting tapes has favored the development
of large-scale superconductor systems. The mathematical models for superconductors have evolved
from simple analytical models to complex numerical models. The available analytical models are
just capable of estimating electromagnetic quantities in single wires or small arrays. The numerical
models like the H formulation finite element models are useful for the analysis of more medium-size
systems, but their application in large-scale systems is problematic due to the excessive cost
in terms of memory and the computation time. Then it is necessary to devise new strategies to tackle
this challenge. The homogenization and the multi-scale approach are methodologies that have successfully
simplified the description of the systems allowing the study of large-scale systems. Recently,
efficient calculations have been achieved using the T-A formulation. In this manuscript, we analyze
the adequate order of the elements used in the T-A formulation. More importantly, we propose a series
of adaptations to the homogenization and multi-scale methodologies in order to allow their implementation
to the T-A formulation models. The proposed strategies are validated by means of comparing them
with the H reference model of a racetrack coil. The computation time and memory demand are substantially
reduced up to a point that makes it possible to perform real-time simulations for slow ramping cycles.
At the same time the comparison demonstrates a very good agreement with respect to the reference
model, both at a local and global level, is achieved.
