In a previous paper, I demonstrated the accuracy of simple, precessing, power ellipse (p-ellipse)
approximations to orbits of low-to-moderate eccentricity in power-law potentials. Here I explore
several extensions of these approximations to improve accuracy, especially for nearly radial
orbits. 1) It is found that moderately improved orbital fits can be achieved with higher order perturbation
expansions (in eccentricity), with the addition of `harmonic' terms to the solution. 2) Alternately,
a matching of the extreme radial excursions of an orbit can be imposed, and a more accurate estimate
of the eccentricity parameter is obtained. However, the error in the precession frequency is usually
increased. 3) A correction function of small magnitude corrects the frequency problem. With this
correction, even first order approximations yield excellent fits at quite high eccentricity over
a range of potential indices that includes flat and falling rotation curve cases. 4) Adding a first
harmonic term to fit the breadth of the orbital loops, and determining the fundamental and harmonic
coefficients by matching to three orbital positions further improves the fit. With a couple of additional
small corrections one obtains excellent fits to orbits with radial ranges of more than a thousand
for some potentials. These simple corrections to the basic p-ellipse are basically in the form of
several successive approximations, and can provide high accuracy. They suggest new results including
that the apsidal precession rate scales approximately as $log(1+e)$ at very high eccentricities
$e$. New insights are also provided on the occurrence of periodic orbits in various potentials,
especially at high eccentricity.
