Mathematical models of diffusive transport underpin our understanding of chemical, biochemical
and biological transport phenomena. Analysis of such models often focusses on relatively simple
geometries and deals with diffusion through highly idealised homogeneous media. In contrast,
practical applications of diffusive transport theory inevitably involve dealing with more complicated
geometries as well as dealing with heterogeneous media. One of the most fundamental properties
of diffusive transport is the concept of $\textit{mean particle lifetime}$ or $\textit{mean exit
time}$, which are particular applications of the concept of $\textit{first passage time}$, and
provide the mean time required for a diffusing particle to reach an absorbing boundary. Most formal
analysis of mean particle lifetime applies to relatively simple geometries, often with homogeneous
(spatially-invariant) material properties. In this work, we present a general framework that
provides exact mathematical insight into the mean particle lifetime, and higher moments of particle
lifetime, for point particles diffusing in heterogeneous discs and spheres with radial symmetry.
Our analysis applies to geometries with an arbitrary number and arrangement of distinct layers,
where transport in each layer is characterised by a distinct diffusivity. We obtain exact closed-form
expressions for the mean particle lifetime for a diffusing particle released at an arbitrary location
and we generalise these results to give exact, closed-form expressions for any higher-order moment
of particle lifetime for a range of different boundary conditions. Finally, using these results
we construct new homogenization formulae that provide an accurate simplified description of diffusion
through heterogeneous discs and spheres.
