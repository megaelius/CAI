This paper theoretically proposes a multichannel functional metasurface computer characterized
by Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) and surface susceptibility tensors. The study
explores a polarization- and angle-multiplexed metasurfaces enabling multiple and independent
parallel analog spatial computations when illuminated by differently polarized incident beams
from different directions. The proposed synthesis overcomes substantial restrictions imposed
by previous designs such as large architectures arising from the need of additional subblocks,
slow responses, and most importantly, supporting only the even reflection symmetry operations
for normal incidences, working for a certain incident angle or polarization, and executing only
single mathematical operation. The versatility of the design is demonstrated in a way that an ultra-compact,
integrable and planar metasurface-assisted platform can execute a variety of optical signal processing
operations such as spatial differentiation and integration. It is demonstrated that a metasurface
featuring non-reciprocal property can be thought of as a new paradigm to break the even symmetry
of reflection and perform both even- and odd-symmetry mathematical operations at normal incidences.
Numerical simulations also illustrate different aspects of multichannel edge detection scheme
through projecting multiple images on the metasurface from different directions. Such appealing
findings not only circumvent the major potential drawbacks of previous designs but also may offer
an efficient, easy-to-fabricate, and flexible approach in wave-based signal processing, edge
detection, image contrast enhancement, hidden object detection, and equation solving without
any Fourier lens.
