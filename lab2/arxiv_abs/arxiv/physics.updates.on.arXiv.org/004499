Purpose: To develop an accelerated, robust, and accurate diffusion MRI acquisition and reconstruction
technique for submillimeter whole human brain in-vivo scan on a clinical scanner. Methods: We extend
the ultra-high resolution diffusion MRI acquisition technique, gSlider, by allowing under-sampling
in q-space and Radio-Frequency (RF)-encoded data, thereby accelerating the total acquisition
time of conventional gSlider. The novel method, termed gSlider-SR, compensates for the lack of
acquired information by exploiting redundancy in the dMRI data using a basis of Spherical Ridgelets
(SR), while simultaneously enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. Using Monte-Carlo simulation
with realistic noise levels and several acquisitions of in-vivo human brain dMRI data (acquired
on a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner), we demonstrate the efficacy of our method using several quantitative
metrics. Results: For high-resolution dMRI data with realistic noise levels (synthetically added),
we show that gSlider-SR can reconstruct high-quality dMRI data at different acceleration factors
preserving both signal and angular information. With in-vivo data, we demonstrate that gSlider-SR
can accurately reconstruct 860 ${\mu}m$ diffusion MRI data (64 diffusion directions at b = 2000
$s/ {mm}^2$), at comparable quality as that obtained with conventional gSlider with four averages,
thereby providing an eight-fold reduction in scan time (from 1 h 20 min to 10 min). Conclusion: gSlider-SR
enables whole-brain high angular resolution dMRI at a submillimeter spatial resolution with a
dramatically reduced acquisition time, making it feasible to use the proposed scheme on existing
clinical scanners.
