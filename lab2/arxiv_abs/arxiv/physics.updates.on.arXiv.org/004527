In this dissertation, we analytically study the apex field enhancement factor (FEF), $\gamma_a$,
by constructing a method which consists in minimizing an error function defined as to measure the
deviation of the potential at the boundary, yielding approximate axial multipole coefficients
of a general axial-symmetric conducting emitter shape, on which the apex FEF can be calculated by
summing its respective Legendre series. Such method is analytically applied for a conducting hemisphere
on a flat plate, confirming the known result of $\gamma_a = 3$. Also, it is applied on a hemi-ellipsoid
on a plate where the values of the apex FEF are compared with the ones extracted from the analytical
expression. Then, the method is applied for the hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) model. In
this case, to analytically estimate the apex FEF from first principles is a problem of considerable
complexity. Despite the slow convergence of the apex FEF, useful analytical conclusions are drawn
and explored, such as, it is confirmed that all even multipole contributions of the HCP model are
zero, which in turn leads to restrictions on the charge density distribution: it will be shown the
surface charge density must be an odd function with respect to height in an equivalent system. Also,
expressions found for the apex FEF depend explicitly on the aspect ratio, that is, the ratio of height
by base radius. Using the dominant multipole contribution, the dipole, at sufficient large distances,
it is shown that, for two interacting emitters, as their separation distance increases, the fractional
change in apex FEF, $\delta$, decreases following a power law with exponent $-3$. The result is extended
for conducting emitters having an arbitrary axially-symmetric shape, where it is also shown $\delta$
has a pre-factor depending on geometry, confirming the tendency observed in recent analytical
and numerical results.
