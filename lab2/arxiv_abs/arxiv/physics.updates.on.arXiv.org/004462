We propose and numerically analyze the hybrid Si-Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5}
strip waveguide switches for Mid-IR wavelength of 2.1 $\mu$m. The switches investigated are one
input-one output (on-off) type and one input-two outputs (directional coupler) type. The reversible
transition between the switch states is achieved by inducing the phase transition from crystalline
to amorphous and vice-versa by application of voltage pulses. The approach of embedding the nanoscale
active material Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} within the Si
waveguide is taken to enhance the interaction of light with the active region of the switches. The
dimensions of the active regions of the switches are optimized to achieve low insertion loss, low
switching energy, and high extinction ratio. In case of one input-one output switch, an extinction
ratio of 33.79 dB along with an extremely low insertion loss of 0.52 dB is achieved using optimum Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5}
length of only 0.92 $\mu$m. For one input-two outputs switch, an extinction ratio of 10.33 dB and
5.23 dB is obtained in cross and bar state respectively using an active length of 52 $\mu$m. These
values of extinction ratio, which are otherwise 18.59 dB and 8.33 dB respectively, are due to the
necessity of doping the Si beneath the Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5}
to facilitate the electrical conduction needed for Joule heating. A suitable gap of 100 nm is kept
between the active and passive arm of the directional coupler switch. The electro-thermal co-simulations
confirm that phase change occurs in whole of the Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5}
region in both types of switches.
