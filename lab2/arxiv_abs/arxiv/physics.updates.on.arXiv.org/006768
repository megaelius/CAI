Ideal systems of equations such as Euler and MHD may develop singular structures like shocks, vortex/current
sheets. Among these, vortical singularities arise due to vortex stretching which can lead to unbounded
growth of enstrophy. Viscosity and resistivity provide dissipative regularizations of these
singularities. In analogy with the dispersive KdV regularization of the 1D inviscid Burgers' equation,
we propose a local conservative regularization of ideal 3D compressible flows, MHD and 2-fluid
plasmas (with potential applications to high vorticity flows with low dissipation). The regularization
involves introducing a vortical `twirl' term lambda^2 w x curl w in the velocity equation. The cut-off
length lambda must be inversely proportional to square root of density to ensure the conservation
of a `swirl' energy. The latter includes positive kinetic, compressional, magnetic and vortical
contributions, thus leading to a priori bounds on enstrophy. The extension to 2-fluid plasmas involves
additionally magnetic `twirl' terms in the ion and electron velocity equations and a solenoidal
addition to the current in Ampere's law. A Hamiltonian-Poisson bracket formulation is developed
using the swirl energy as Hamiltonian. We also establish a minimality property of the twirl regularization.
A swirl velocity field is shown to transport vortex and magnetic flux tubes as well as w/rho and B/rho,
thus generalizing the Kelvin-Helmholtz and Alfven theorems. The steady regularized equations
are used to model a rotating vortex, MHD pinch and vortex sheet. Our regularization could facilitate
numerical simulations and a statistical treatment of vortex and current filaments in 3D. Finally,
we briefly describe a conservative regularization of shock-like singularities in compressible
flow generalizing both the KdV and nonlinear Schrodinger equations to the adiabatic dynamics of
a gas in 3D.
