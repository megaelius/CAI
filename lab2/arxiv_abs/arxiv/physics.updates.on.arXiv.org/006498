The electro-optical properties of most semiconductors and insulators of technological interest
are dominated by the presence of electron-hole quasiparticles called excitons. The manipulation
of these hydrogen-like quasi-particles in dielectrics, has received great interest under the
name excitonics that is expected to be of great potential for a variety of applications, including
optoelectronics and photonics. A crucial step for such exploitation of excitons in advanced technological
applications is a detailed understanding of their dynamical nature. However, the ultrafast processes
unfolding on few-femtosecond and attosecond time scales, of primary relevance in view of the desired
extension of electronic devices towards the petahertz regime, remain largely unexplored. Here
we apply attosecond transient reflection spectroscopy in a sequential two-foci geometry and observe
sub-femtosecond dynamics of a core-level exciton in bulk MgF$_2$ single crystals. With our unique
setup, we can access absolute phase delays which allow for an unambiguous comparison with theoretical
calculations based on the Wannier-Mott model. Our results show that excitons surprisingly exhibit
a dual atomic- and solid-like character which manifests itself on different time scales. While
the former is responsible for a femtosecond optical Stark effect, the latter dominates the attosecond
excitonic response and originates by the interaction with the crystal. Further investigation
of the role of exciton localization proves that the bulk character persists also for strongly localised
quasi-particles and allows us to envision a new route to control exciton dynamics in the close-to-petahertz
regime.
