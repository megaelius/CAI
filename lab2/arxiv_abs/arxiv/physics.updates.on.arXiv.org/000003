A detailed understanding of the interface between living cells and substrate materials is of rising
importance in many fields of medicine, biology and biotechnology. Cells at interfaces often form
epithelia. The physical barrier that they form is one of their main functions. It is governed by the
properties of the networks forming the cytoskeleton systems and by cell-to-cell contacts. Different
substrates with varying surface properties modify the migration velocity of the cells. On the one
hand one can change the materials composition. Organic and inorganic materials induce differing
migration velocities in the same cell system. Within the same class of materials, a change of the
surface stiffness or of the surface energy modifies the migration velocity, too. For our cell adhesion
studies a variety of different, homogeneous substrates were used (polymers, bio-polymers, metals,
oxides). In addition, an effective lithographic method, Polymer Blend Lithography (PBL), is reported,
to produce patterned Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAM) on solid substrates featuring two or three
different chemical functionalities. This we achieve without the use of conventional lithography
like e-beam or UV lithography, only by using self-organization. These surfaces are decorated with
a Teflon-like and with an amino-functionalized molecular layer. The resulting pattern is a copy
of a previously created self-organized polymer pattern, featuring a scalable lateral domain size
in the sub-micron range down below 100 nanometers. The resulting monolayer pattern features a high
chemical and biofunctional contrast with feature sizes in the range of cell adhesion complexes
like e.g. focal adhesion points.
