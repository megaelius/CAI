This paper presents a theoretical study of a non-linear rheological fluid transport in an axisymmetric
tube by cilia. However, an attempt has been made to explain the role of cilia motion on the transport
of fluid through the ductus efferentes of the male reproductive tract. Ostwald-de Waele power-law
viscous fluid has been considered to represent the rheological fluid. To analyze pumping by means
of a sequence of beat of cilia from row-to-row of cilia in a given row of cells and from one row of cells
to the next (metachronal wave movement), we consider the conditions that the corresponding Reynolds
number is small enough for inertial effects to be negligible and the wavelength to diameter ratio
is large enough for the pressure to be considered uniform over the cross-section. Analyses and computations
of the detailed fluid motion reveal that the time-averaged flow rate is dependent on $\epsilon$,
a non-dimensional measure involving the mean radius $a$ of the tube and the cilia length. Thus, flow
rate significantly varies with the cilia length. Moreover, the flow rate has been reported near
to the estimated value $6\times 10^{-3}$$ml/h$ for human efferent ducts if $\epsilon$ is near by
0.4. The estimated value was suggested by Lardner and Shack [1] in human, based on the experimental
observations for flow rates in efferent ducts of other animals, e.g., rat, ram and bull. In addition,
the nature of the rheological fluid, i.e., the value of the fluid index $n$ strongly influences various
flow-governed characteristics. The interesting feature of the paper is that the pumping improves
with the thickening behavior for small values of $\epsilon$ or in free pumping ($\Delta P=0$) and
pumping ($\Delta P>0$) regions.
