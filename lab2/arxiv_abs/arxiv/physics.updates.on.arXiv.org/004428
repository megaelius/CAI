The GERmanium Detector Array (GERDA) experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory (LNGS)
of INFN is searching for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of $^{76}$Ge. The
technological challenge of GERDA is to operate in a background-free regime in the region of interest
(ROI) after analysis cuts for the full 100 kg$\cdot$y target exposure of the experiment. A careful
modeling and decomposition of the full-range energy spectrum is essential to predict the shape
and composition in the ROI around \qbb\ for the \onbb\ search, to extract a precise measurement of
the half-life of the double-beta decay mode with neutrinos ($2\nu\beta\beta$) and in order to identify
the location of residual impurities. The latter will permit future experiments to build strategies
in order to further lower the background and achieve even better sensitivities. In this article
the background decomposition is presented within a Bayesian framework for GERDA Phase II. The background
model fit, which is conducted prior active background suppression techniques, yields a flat spectrum
in the ROI with a background index (BI) of $16.04^{+0.78}_{-0.85}\cdot10^{-3}$ cts/(kg$\cdot$keV$\cdot$yr)
for the enriched BEGe data set and $14.68^{+0.47}_{-0.52}\cdot 10^{-3}$ cts/(kg$\cdot$keV$\cdot$yr)
for the enriched coaxial data set. This indicates that, despite major hardware changes and higher
inactive mass close to the detectors after the upgrade works completed in 2015, the BI before applying
active background reduction remains unchanged for the enriched coaxial detectors and is improved
by a factor of three for the enriched BEGe detectors.
