Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been applied to predict or model fluid dynamics.
However, mechanisms of CNNs for learning fluid dynamics are still not well understood, while such
understanding is highly necessary to optimize the network or to reduce trial-and-errors during
the network optmization. In the present study, a CNN to predict future three-dimensional unsteady
wake flow using flow fields in the past occasions is developed. Mechanisms of the developed CNN for
prediction of wake flow behind a circular cylinder are investigated in two flow regimes: the three-dimensional
wake transition regime and the shear-layer transition regime. Feature maps in the CNN are visualized
to compare flow structures which are extracted by the CNN from flow at the two flow regimes. In both
flow regimes, feature maps are found to extract similar sets of flow structures such as braid shear-layers
and shedding vortices. A Fourier analysis is conducted to investigate mechanisms of the CNN for
predicting wake flow in flow regimes with different wave number characteristics. It is found that
a convolution layer in the CNN integrates and transports wave number information from flow to predict
the dynamics. Characteristics of the CNN for transporting input information including time histories
of flow variables is analyzed by assessing contributions of each flow variable and time history
to feature maps in the CNN. Structural similarities between feature maps in the CNN are calculated
to reveal the number of feature maps that contain similar flow structures. By reducing the number
of feature maps that contain similar flow structures, it is also able to successfully reduce the
number of parameters to learn in the CNN by 85\% without affecting prediction performances.
