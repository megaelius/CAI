It is convenient to describe a quantum system at all times by means of a "history operator" $C$, encoding
measurements and unitary time evolution between measurements. These operators naturally arise
when computing the probability of measurement sequences, and generalize the "sum over position
histories " of the Feynman path-integral. As we argue in the present note, this description has some
computational advantages over the usual state vector description, and may help to clarify some
issues regarding nonlocality of quantum correlations and collapse. A measurement on a system described
by $C$ modifies the history operator, $C \rightarrow PC$, where $P$ is the projector corresponding
to the measurement. We refer to this modification as "history operator collapse". Thus $C$ keeps
track of the succession of measurements on a system, and contains all histories compatible with
the results of these measurements. The collapse modifies the history content of $C$, and therefore
modifies also the past (relative to the measurement), but never in a way to violate causality. Probabilities
of outcomes are obtained as $Tr(C^\dagger P C)/Tr(C^\dagger C)$. A similar formula yields probabilities
for intermediate measurements, and reproduces the result of the two-vector formalism in the case
of given initial and final states. We apply the history operator formalism to a few examples: entangler
circuit, Mach-Zehnder interferometer, teleportation circuit, three-box experiment. Not surprisingly,
the propagation of coordinate eigenstates $|q\rangle$ is described by a history operator $C$ containing
the Feynman path-integral.
