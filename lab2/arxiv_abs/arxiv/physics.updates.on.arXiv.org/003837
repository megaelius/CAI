This paper posits the existence of, and finds a candidate for, a variable change that allows quantum
mechanics to be interpreted as quantum geometry. The Bohr model of the Hydrogen atom is thought of
in terms of an indeterministic electron position and a deterministic metric and the motivation
for this paper is to try to change variables to have a deterministic position and momentum for the
electron and nucleus but with an indeterministic (quantum) metric that reproduces the physics
of the Bohr model. This mapping is achieved by allowing the metric in the Hamiltonian to be different
to the metric in the space-time distance element and then representing the two metrics with vierbeins
and assuming they are canonically conjugate variables. Effectively, the usual Schr\"odinger
space-time variables have been re-interpreted as four of the potentially sixteen parameters of
the metric tensor vierbein in the distance element while the metric tensor vierbein in the Hamiltonian
is an operator expressible as first-order derivatives in these variables or vice versa. I then argue
that this reproduces observed quantum physics at the sub-atomic level by demonstrating the energy
spectrum of electron orbitals is exactly the same as the usual relativistic Bohr model for the Hydrogen
atom in a certain limit. Next, by introducing a single dimensionless running coupling that shows
up in the analogous place as, but in addition to, Planck's constant in the commutator definition
I argue that this allows massive objects to couple to the physical space-time geometry but not massless
ones - no matter coupling value. This claim is based on a fit to the Schwarzschild metric with a few
simple assumptions and thus obtaining an effective theory of how the quantum geometries at nearby
space-time points couple to one another. This demonstrates that this coupling constant is related
to Newton's gravitational constant.
