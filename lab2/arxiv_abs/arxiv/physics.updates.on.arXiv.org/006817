In this work, distortion gradient plasticity is used to gain insight into material deformation
ahead of a crack tip. This also constitutes the first fracture mechanics analysis of gradient plasticity
theories adopting Nye's tensor as primal kinematic variable. First, the asymptotic nature of crack
tip fields is analytically investigated. We show that an inner elastic region exists, adjacent
to the crack tip, where elastic strains dominate plastic strains and Cauchy stresses follow the
linear elastic stress singularity. This finding is verified by detailed finite element analyses
using a new numerical framework, which builds upon a viscoplastic constitutive law that enables
capturing both rate-dependent and rate-independent behaviour in a computationally efficient
manner. Numerical analysis is used to gain further insight into the stress elevation predicted
by distortion gradient plasticity, relative to conventional J2 plasticity, and the influence
of the plastic spin under both mode I and mixed-mode fracture conditions. It is found that Nye's tensor
contributions have a weaker effect in elevating the stresses in the plastic region, while predicting
the same asymptotic behaviour as constitutive choices based on the plastic strain gradient tensor.
A minor sensitivity to X, the parameter governing the dissipation due to the plastic spin, is observed.
Finally, distortion gradient plasticity and suitable higher order boundary conditions are used
to appropriately model the phenomenon of brittle failure along elastic-plastic material interfaces.
We reproduce paradigmatic experiments on niobium-sapphire interfaces and show that the combination
of strain gradient hardening and dislocation blockage leads to interface crack tip stresses that
are larger than the theoretical lattice strength, rationalising cleavage in the presence of plasticity
at bi-material interfaces.
