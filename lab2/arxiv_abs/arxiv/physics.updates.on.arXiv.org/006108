We introduce a network (graph) theoretic community-based framework to extract vortical structures
that serve the role of connectors for the vortical interactions in two- and three-dimensional isotropic
turbulence. The present framework represents the vortical interactions on a network, where the
vortical elements are viewed as the nodes and the vortical interactions are regarded as edges weighted
by induced velocity. We identify closely interacting vortical elements as vortical network communities
through community detection algorithms. We show that the inter- and intra-community interactions
can be used to decompose the governing equation for the evolution of network nodes. These community-based
interactions are used to identify the communities which have the strongest and weakest interactions
amongst them. These vortical communities are referred to as connector and peripheral communities,
respectively. We demonstrate the influence of the network-based structures to modify the dynamics
of a collection of discrete point vortices. Taking advantage of the strong inter-community interactions,
connector community can significantly modify the collective dynamics of vortices through the
application of multiple impulse perturbations. We then apply the community-based framework to
extract influential structures in isotropic turbulence. The connector and peripheral communities
extracted from turbulent flows resemble shear-layer and vortex-core like structures, respectively.
The influence of the connector structures on the flow field and their neighboring vortical structures
is analyzed by adding impulse perturbations to the connectors in direct numerical simulations.
The findings are compared with the cases of perturbing the strongest vortex tube and shear-layer
regions. We find that perturbing the connector structures enhances local turbulent mixing beyond
what are achieved by the other cases.
