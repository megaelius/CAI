Purpose: Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common eye tumor in childhood and can be treated external
radiotherapy. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the adequacy of Monte Carlo simulations and
the accuracy of a commercial treatment planning system by means of experimental measurements.
Dose measurements in water were performed using a dedicated collimator. Methods: A 6MV Varian Clinac
2100 C/D and a dedicated collimator are used for RB treatment. The collimator conforms a D-shaped
off-axis field whose irradiated area can be either 5.2 or 3.1cm$^2$. Depth dose distributions and
lateral profiles were measured and compared with Monte Carlo simulations run with PENELOPE and
with calculations performed with the analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA) using the gamma test.
Results: PENELOPE simulations agree well with the experimental data with discrepancies in the
dose profiles less than 3mm of distance-to-agreement and 3% of dose. Discrepancies between the
results of AAA and the experimental data reach 3mm and 6%. The agreement in the penumbra region between
AAA and the experiment is noticeably worse than that between the latter and PENELOPE. The percentage
of voxels passing the gamma test when comparing PENELOPE (AAA) and the experiment is on average 99%
(93%) assuming a 3mm distance-to-agreement and a discrepancy of 3% of dose. Conclusions: Although
the discrepancies between AAA and experimental results are noticeable, it is possible to consider
this algorithm for routine treatment planning of RB patients, provided the limitations of the algorithm
are known and taken into account by the medical physicist. Monte Carlo simulation is essential for
knowing these limitations. Monte Carlo simulation is required for optimizing the treatment technique
and the dedicated collimator.
