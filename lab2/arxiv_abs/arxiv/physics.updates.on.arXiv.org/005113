Although the structural phase transitions in single-crystal hybrid methyl-ammonium (MA) lead
halide perovskites (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) are common phenomena, they have never been observed in
the corresponding nanocrystals. Here we demonstrate that two-photon-excited photoluminescence
(PL) spectroscopy is capable of more precisely monitoring the structural phase transitions compared
to conventional one-photon-excited PL spectroscopy since nonlinear susceptibilities govern
the light absorption rates. Using this technique, we provide evidence that the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal
structural phase transition in 20-nm-sized 3D MAPbBr3 nanocrystals is spread out within the ~70
- 140 K range. This structural phase instability is believed to arise because, unlike in single-crystal
MAPbX3, free rotations of MA ions in the corresponding nanocrystals are no longer restricted by
long-range MA dipole order. We also show that the resulting configurational entropy loss and the
corresponding liquid-like motion of MA cations can be even enhanced by the interfacial electric
field arising due to charge separation at the MAPbBr3/ZnO heterointerface, extending the structural
phase instability range from 70 to 230 K. Finally, we conclude that the weak sensitivity of conventional
one-photon-excited PL spectroscopy to the structural phase transitions in 3D MAPbX3 nanocrystals
results from the structural phase instability providing negligible distortions of PbX6 octahedra
responsible for the band-edge electronic transitions. In contrast, the intensity of two-photon-excited
PL and electric-field-induced one-photon-excited PL still remains sensitive enough to weak structural
distortions due to the higher rank tensor nature of nonlinear susceptibilities.
