The ubiquity of high-energy tails in the charged particle velocity distribution functions observed
in space plasmas suggests the existence of an underlying process responsible for taking a fraction
of the charged particle population out of thermal equilibrium and redistributing it to suprathermal
velocity and energy ranges. The present Letter focuses on a new and fundamental physical explanation
for the origin of suprathermal electron distribution function in a highly collisional plasma.
This process involves a newly discovered electrostatic bremsstrahlung emission that is effective
in a plasma in which binary collisions are present. The steady-state electron velocity distribution
function dictated by such a process corresponds to a Maxwellian core plus a quasi-inverse power-law
tail, which is a feature commonly observed in many space plasma environment. In order to demonstrate
this, the system of self-consistent particle- and wave- kinetic equations are numerically solved
with an initially Maxwellian electron velocity distribution and Langmuir wave spectral intensity,
which is a state that does not reflect the presence of electrostatic bremsstrahlung process, and
hence not in force balance. The electrostatic bremsstrahlung term subsequently drives the system
to a new force-balanced steady state. After a long integration period it is demonstrated the initial
Langmuir fluctuation spectrum is modified, which in turn distorts the initial Maxwellian electron
distribution into a velocity distribution that resembles the said core-suprathermal velocity
distribution. Such a mechanism may thus be operative at the coronal source region, which is characterized
by high collisionality.
