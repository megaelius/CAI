The quality of today's research is often tightly limited to the available computing power and scalability
of codes to many processors. For example, tackling the problem of heating the solar corona requires
a most realistic description of the plasma dynamics and the magnetic field. Numerically solving
such a magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) description of a small active region (AR) on the Sun requires
millions of computation hours on current high-performance computing (HPC) hardware. The aim of
this work is to describe methods for an efficient parallelization of boundary conditions and data
input/output (IO) strategies that allow for a better scaling towards thousands of processors (CPUs).
The Pencil Code is tested before and after optimization to compare the performance and scalability
of a coronal MHD model above an AR. We present a novel boundary condition for non-vertical magnetic
fields in the photosphere, where we approach the realistic pressure increase below the photosphere.
With that, magnetic flux bundles become narrower with depth and the flux density increases accordingly.
The scalability is improved by more than one order of magnitude through the HPC-friendly boundary
conditions and IO strategies. This work describes also the necessary nudging methods to drive the
MHD model with observed magnetic fields from the Sun's photosphere. In addition, we present the
upper and lower atmospheric boundary conditions (photospheric and towards the outer corona),
including swamp layers to diminish perturbations before they reach the boundaries. Altogether,
these methods enable more realistic 3D MHD simulations than previous models regarding the coronal
heating problem above an AR -- simply because of the ability to use a large amount of CPUs efficiently
in parallel.
