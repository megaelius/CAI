Recent findings of possible applications of bio-friendly synthetic self-phoretic swimmers,
have motivated the researchers in investigating the various motion-generating mechanisms to
optimize the operating characteristics of the same. In this paper we model the auto-electrophoretic
motion of a bimetallic (Au-Pt) spherical swimmer in a non-Newtonian medium. In view of the fact that
many bio-fluids closely follow the generalized Newtonian rheology, the rheology of the surrounding
swimming medium is considered to follow the Carreau-Yasuda viscosity model. Further to capture
the experimentally observed effects of peroxide concentration and feedback of generated proton
concentration on the surface cation flux, we incorporate a Michaelis-Menten like surface reaction
kinetics. The electrocatalytic efficiency defined as a ratio between the cost of swimming of an
equivalent passively dragged particle and the input chemical energy via surface reaction, is utilized
to assess the influence of the rheological parameters on the swimmer performance. The results indicate
that the shear thinning and shear thickening nature of the surrounding fluid causes an enhancement
and reduction in swimmer velocity, respectively. However, an increase in the shear thinning effect
does not always guarantee an efficient operation of the microswimmer. A competition between the
particle velocity and reduction in the drag force on the particle, decides whether the propulsion
efficiency will have a relative augmentation or attenuation with varying power law index. We further
report the existence of maximum efficiency points for some specific range of Weissenberg number
and optimum power law indices. Moreover the behaviour of such optimum operating conditions strongly
depends on the non-trivial and highly coupled interplay among the rheology and electrocatalytic
parameters.
