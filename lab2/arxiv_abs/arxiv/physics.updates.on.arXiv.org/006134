We explore the coherent dynamics in a small network of three coupled parametric oscillators and
demonstrate the effect of frustration on the persistent beating between them. Since a single-mode
parametric oscillator represents an analog of a classical Ising spin, networks of coupled parametric
oscillators are considered as simulators of Ising spin models, aiming to efficiently calculate
the ground state of an Ising network - a computationally hard problem. However, the coherent dynamics
of coupled parametric oscillators can be considerably richer than that of Ising spins, depending
on the nature of the coupling between them (energy preserving or dissipative), as was recently shown
for two coupled parametric oscillators. In particular, when the energy-preserving coupling is
dominant, the system displays everlasting coherent beats, transcending the Ising description.
Here, we extend these findings to three coupled parametric oscillators, focusing in particular
on the effect of frustration of the dissipative coupling. We theoretically analyze the dynamics
using coupled nonlinear Mathieu's equations, and corroborate our theoretical findings by a numerical
simulation that closely mimics the dynamics of the system in an actual experiment. Our main finding
is that frustration drastically modifies the dynamics. While in the absence of frustration the
system is analogous to the two-oscillator case, frustration reverses the role of the coupling completely,
and beats are found for small energy-preserving couplings. This result is specifically relevant
to Ising simulators, where residual energy-preserving couplings may lead to coherent beats and
prevent the system from converging to the Ising ground state.
