The potential to perform attenuation and scatter compensation (ASC) in single-photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using only the SPECT emission data is highly significant.
In this context, attenuation in SPECT is primarily due to Compton scattering, where the probability
of Compton scatter is proportional to the attenuation coefficient of the tissue and the energy of
the scattered photon and the scattering angle are related. Given this premise, we investigate whether
the SPECT scattered-photon data acquired in list-mode (LM) format and including the energy information
can be used to estimate the attenuation map. For this purpose, we propose a Fisher-information-based
method that yields the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the task of jointly estimating the activity/attenuation
distribution using only the SPECT emission data. The proposed method is applied to analyze the information
content of SPECT LM emission data in a 2D SPECT system using computational studies with digital phantoms
for different photon-count levels. The results show that scattered photons contain information
to estimate the attenuation coefficients. An increase in the number of detected photons leads to
lower CRB for both the attenuation and activity coefficients. Also, the CRB obtained for the attenuation
and activity coefficients is typically much lower than the true value of these coefficients. Further,
processing the emission data in LM format yields a lower CRB in comparison to binning data. Finally,
we observe that systems with better energy resolution yield a lower CRB for the attenuation coefficient.
Overall, the results provide strong evidence that LM SPECT emission data, including the scattered
photons, contains information to jointly estimate the activity and attenuation coefficients.
