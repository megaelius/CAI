Network-based interventions against epidemic spread are most powerful when the full network structure
is known. However, in practice, resource constraints require decisions to be made based on partial
network information. We investigated how the accuracy of network data available at individual
and village levels affected network-based vaccination effectiveness. We simulated a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
process on empirical social networks from 75 villages. First, we used regression to predict the
percentage of individuals ever infected based on village-level network. Second, we simulated
vaccinating 10 percent of each of the 75 empirical village networks at baseline, selecting vaccinees
through one of five network-based approaches: random individuals; random contacts of random individuals;
random high-degree individuals; highest degree individuals; or most central individuals. The
first three approaches require only sample data; the latter two require full network data. We also
simulated imposing a limit on how many contacts an individual can nominate (Fixed Choice Design,
FCD), which reduces the data collection burden but generates only partially observed networks.
We found mean and standard deviation of the degree distribution to strongly predict cumulative
incidence. In simulations, the Nomination method reduced cumulative incidence by one-sixth compared
to Random vaccination; full network methods reduced infection by two-thirds. The High Degree approach
had intermediate effectiveness. Surprisingly, FCD truncating individuals' degrees at three
was as effective as using complete networks. Using even partial network information to prioritize
vaccines at either the village or individual level substantially improved epidemic outcomes.
Such approaches may be feasible and effective in outbreak settings, and full ascertainment of network
structure may not be required.
