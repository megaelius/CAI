Origami-inspired structures have a rich design space, offering new opportunities for the development
of deployable systems that undergo large and complex yet predictable shape transformations. There
has been growing interest in such structural systems that can extend uniaxially into tubes and booms.
The Kresling origami pattern, which arises from the twist buckling of a thin cylinder and can exhibit
multistability, offers great potential for this purpose. However, much remains to be understood
regarding the characteristics of Kresling origami deployment. Prior studies have been limited
to Kresling structures' kinematics, quasi-static mechanics, or low-amplitude wave responses,
while their dynamic behaviors with large shape change during deployment remain unexplored. These
dynamics are critical to the system design and control processes, but are complex due to the strong
nonlinearity, bistability, and potential for off-axis motions. To advance the state of the art,
this research seeks to uncover the deployment dynamics of Kresling structures with various system
geometries and operating strategies. A full, six-degree-of-freedom model is developed and employed
to provide insight into the axial and off-axis dynamic responses, revealing that the variation
of key geometric parameters may lead to regions with qualitatively distinct mechanical responses.
Results illustrate the sensitivity of dynamic deployment to changes in initial condition and small
variations in geometric design. Further, analyses show how certain geometries and configurations
affect the stiffness of various axial and off-axis deformation modes, offering guidance on the
design of systems that deploy effectively while mitigating the effects of off-axis disturbances.
Overall, the research outcomes suggest the strong potential of Kresling-based designs for deployable
systems with robust and tunable performance.
