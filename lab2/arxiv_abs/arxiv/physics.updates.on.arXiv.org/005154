Predicting accurate NMR chemical shieldings relies upon cancellation of different types of error
in the ab initio methodology used to calculate the shielding tensor of the analyte of interest and
the reference. Often the intrinsic error in computed shieldings due to basis sets, approximations
in the Hamiltonian, description of the wave function, and dynamic effects, is nearly identical
between the analyte and reference, yet if the electronic structure or sensitivity to local environment
differs dramatically, this cannot be taken for granted. Detailed prior work has examined the octahedral
trivalent cation $\text{Al}(\text{H}_{2}\text{O})_{6}^{3+}$ , accounting for ab initio intrinsic
errors. However, the fact that this analyte is used as a reference for the chemically distinct tetrahedral
anion $\text{Al}(\text{OH})_{4}^{-}$ inspires the study of how these errors cancel in an attempt
to understand the limits of predictive capability for accurately determining $^{27}\text{Al
}$ shielding in $\text{Al}(\text{OH})_{4}^{-}$. In this work, we estimate the absolute shielding
of $^{27}\text{Al }$ nucleus in $\text{Al}(\text{OH})_{4}^{-}$ at the coupled cluster level
(515.1 $\pm$ 5.3 ppm). Shielding sensitivity to the choice of method approximation and atomic basis
sets treatment has been evaluated. Solvent and thermal effects are assessed through ensemble averaging
techniques using ab-initio molecular dynamics. The contribution of each type of intrinsic error
is assessed for $\text{Al}(\text{H}_{2}\text{O})_{6}^{3+}$ and $\text{Al}(\text{OH})_{4}^{-}$
ions, revealing significant differences that fundamentally hamper the ability to accurately
calculate the $^{27}\text{Al }$ chemical shift of $\text{Al}(\text{OH})_{4}^{-}$ from first
principles.
