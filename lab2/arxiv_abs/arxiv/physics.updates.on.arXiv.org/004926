A deailed knowledge of pp collision is required both as input to comprehensive theoretical models
of strong interactions and as baseline to decipher the AA collisions at relativistic and ultrarelativistic
energies, which has been of great interest in the area of theoretical and experimental physics.
The multiplicity distribution of particles produced in pp collisions and the multiplicity dependence
of various global event features serve as rudimentary observables which reflect the features of
the inherent dynamics of the process of particle production. Recent availability of dimuon data
has triggered spur of interests in revisiting strong interaction process, the study of which in
detail is extremely important for enhancement of our understanding on not only the theory of strong
interaction but also possible physics scenarios beyond the standard model. Numerous papers have
come up where background of production process of dimuon in pp collision has been discussed and analyzed
particularly for production of dimuon from {\gamma}{\gamma} interaction. Apart from conventional
approaches the present authors proposed a new approach with successful application in context
of symmetry scaling in AA collision data from ALICE, pp collisions at 8TeV from CMS and so on. The different
approach essentially analyses fluctuation pattern from the perspective of symmetry scaling or
degree of self-similarity involved in the process. The proposed methods of analysis using pseudorapidity
values of di-muon data taken from the primary dataset of RunA(2011)-7TeV and RunB(2012)-8TeV of
the pp collision from CMS, reveal that pseudorapidity spaces corresponding to different ranges
of rapidity are highly scale-free and the scaling pattern changes from one rapidity range to another
at both energy. Also, the degree of cross-correlation between rapidity and azimuthal space has
been found to follow the similar behavior.
