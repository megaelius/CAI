Doping $La_2CuO_{4}$ with alkaline-earth, $Ae= Sr,Ba$ (possibly co-doped with lanthanide, $Ln
=$ $Nd,Eu$), generates holes in the $La_{2-y-x}Ln_yAe_xCuO_{4}$ crystals. A small fraction of
the holes, $\check{p} \le $ $0.02$, suppresses 3D-AFM. The rest resides as double holes at $O$ atoms
in the $CuO_2$ planes. The superlattice, formed by the $O$ atoms, gives rise to both charge density
stripes and magnetization stripes with incommensurability $q_{c,m}(x) \propto \sqrt{x-\check{p}}$
for $Ae$ doping up to a watershed value, $x \le \hat{x}$. More doping causes overflow of new holes
to the $LaO$ planes, leaving stripes of constant $q_c$ in the $CuO_2$ planes. Antiparallel orientation
of magnetic moments $\mathbf{m}(O)$ yields a natural explanation for the coupling of $q_m(x) =
\frac{1}{2} q_c(x)$. Hole population in the $LaO$ planes may also be responsible for the watershed
in the doping dependence of X-ray intensity, diffracted by stripes, upon cooling through the transition
to superconductivity. Above a threshold temperature, electron-hole pairs are thermally generated,
but then separate to reside at $Cu^+$ ions and $O$ atoms, respectively. The latter, adding to the
$Ae$ generated holes, account for the increase of $q_c(x,T)$ with temperature. Failing to compensate
antiparallel magnetic moments $\mathbf{m}(Cu^{2+})$, the thermally generated $Cu^+$ ions oppose
indirectly the magnetic moments of the $O$ atoms. This breaks the locking of the incommensurability
of charge density and magnetization stripes, $q_m(p) \ne \frac{1}{2} q_c(p)$. The degree of antiparallel
compensation is determined by the relative magnitude of magnetic moments, $r = |\mathbf{m}(Cu^{2+})|
\; \textbf{/} \;|\mathbf{m}(O)|$.
