Large scale simulations are performed by means of the transfer-matrix method to reveal optimal
conditions for metal-dielectric core-shell particles to induce the largest fluorescence on their
surfaces. With commonly used plasmonic cores (Au and Ag) and dielectric shells (SiO2, Al2O3, ZnO),
optimal core and shell radii are determined to reach maximum fluorescence enhancement for each
wavelength within 550~850 nm (Au core) and 390~500 nm (Ag core) bands, in both air and aqueous hosts.
The peak value of the maximum achievable fluorescence enhancement factors of core-shell nanoparticles,
taken over entire wavelength interval, increases with the shell refractive index and can reach
values up to 9 and 70 for Au and Ag cores, within 600~700 nm and 400~450 nm wavelength ranges, respectively,
which is much larger than that for corresponding homogeneous metal nanoparticles. Replacing air
by an aqueous host has a dramatic effect of nearly halving the sizes of optimal core-shell configurations
at the peak value of the maximum achievable fluorescence. In the case of Au cores,the fluorescence
enhancements for wavelengths within the first near-infrared biological window (NIR-I) between
700 and 900 nm can be improved twofold compared to homogeneous Au particle when the shell refractive
index ns > 2. As a rule of thumb, the wavelength region of optimal fluorescence (maximal nonradiative
decay) turns out to be red-shifted (blue-shifted) by as much as 50 nm relative to the localized surface
plasmon resonance wavelength of corresponding optimized core-shell particle. Our results provide
important design rules and general guidelines for enabling versatile platforms for imaging, light
source, and biological applications.
