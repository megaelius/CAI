Tropical precipitation extremes are expected to strengthen with warming, but quantitative estimates
of future changes remain uncertain because of a poor understanding of changes in convective dynamics.
This uncertainty is addressed here by analyzing idealized convection-permitting simulations
of radiative-convective equilibrium. Across a wide range of climates, the thermodynamic contribution
to changes in instantaneous precipitation extremes follows near-surface moisture, and the dynamic
contribution is positive but small. The shapes of mass flux profiles associated with precipitation
extremes are determined by conditional sampling that favors strong vertical motion at levels where
the vertical saturation specific humidity gradient is large, and mass flux profiles collapse to
a common shape across climates when plotted in a moisture-based vertical coordinate. The collapse
implies a thermodynamic contribution that scales with near-surface moisture despite substantial
convergence in the free troposphere and allows the dynamic contribution to be defined in terms of
pressure velocity at a single level. Linking the simplified dynamic mode to vertical velocities
from entraining plume models shows that the smallness of the dynamic mode results from opposite
height-dependences of vertical velocity and density. A self-contained simple model suggests
that, provided the moisture-coordinate collapse holds, the dynamic mode is likely to be around
2 %/K at current tropical temperatures, larger in colder climates, and smaller in warmer climates.
These results reinforce an emerging picture of the response of extreme tropical precipitation
rates to warming: a thermodynamic mode of about 7%/K dominates, with a minor contribution from changes
in dynamics.
