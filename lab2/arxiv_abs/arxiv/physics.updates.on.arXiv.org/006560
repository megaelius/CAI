A popular analogue used in the space domain is that of historical building projects, notably cathedrals
that took decades and in some cases centuries to complete. Cathedrals are often taken as archetypes
for long-term projects. In this article, I will explore the cathedral from the point of view of project
management and systems architecting and draw implications for long-term projects in the space
domain, notably developing a starship. I will show that the popular image of a cathedral as a continuous
long-term project is in contradiction to the current state of research. More specifically, I will
show that for the following propositions: The cathedrals were built based on an initial detailed
master plan; Building was a continuous process that adhered to the master plan; Investments were
continuously provided for the building process. Although initial plans might have existed, the
construction process took often place in multiple campaigns, sometimes separated by decades.
Such interruptions made knowledge-preservation very challenging. The reason for the long stretches
of inactivity was mostly due to a lack of funding. Hence, the availability of funding coincided with
construction activity. These findings paint a much more relevant picture of cathedral building
for long-duration projects today: How can a project be completed despite a range of uncertainties
regarding loss in skills, shortage in funding, and interruptions? It is concluded that long-term
projects such as an interstellar exploration program can take inspiration from cathedrals by developing
a modular architecture, allowing for extensibility and flexibility, thinking about value delivery
at an early point, and establishing mechanisms and an organization for stable funding.
