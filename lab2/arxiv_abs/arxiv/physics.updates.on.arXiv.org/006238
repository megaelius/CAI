The use of engineered nanoscale magnetic materials in healthcare and biomedical technologies
is rapidly growing. Two examples which have recently attracted significant attention are magnetic
particle imaging (MPI) for biological monitoring, and magnetic field hyperthermia (MFH) for cancer
therapy. Here for the first time, the capability of a Lissajous scanning MPI device to act as a standalone
platform to support the application of MFH cancer treatment is presented. The platform is shown
to offer functionalities for nanoparticle localization, focused hyperthermia therapy application,
and non-invasive tissue thermometry in one device. Combined, these capabilities have the potential
to significantly enhance the accuracy, effectiveness and safety of MFH therapy. Measurements
of nanoparticle hyperthermia during protracted exposure to the MPI scanner's 3D imaging field
sequence revealed spatially focused heating, with a maximum that is significantly enhanced compared
with a simple 1-dimensional sinusoidal excitation. The observed spatial heating behavior is qualitatively
described based on a phenomenological model considering torques exerted in the Brownian regime.
In-vitro cell studies using a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) demonstrated strong
suppression of both structural integrity and metabolic activity within 24 h following a 40 min MFH
treatment actuated within the Lissajous MPI scanner. Furthermore, reconstructed MPI images of
the nanoparticles distributed among the cells, and the temperature-sensitivity of the MPI imaging
signal obtained during treatment are demonstrated. In summary, combined Lissajous MPI and MFH
technologies are presented; demonstrating for the first time their potential for cancer treatment
with maximum effectiveness, and minimal collateral damage to surrounding tissues.
