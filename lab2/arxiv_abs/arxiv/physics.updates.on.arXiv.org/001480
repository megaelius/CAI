The declination of the Sun along the year varies according to a sinusoid. Around the solstices this
curve is approximated by a parabola. In kinematics a parabola is obtained with a constant acceleration.
This acceleration has been estimated in the days 21-29 December 2017, from the measurements taken
at the meridian line in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Rome made by Francesco Bianchini
in 1702 with purpose of measuring the variation of the obliquity of the ecliptic. The parabola equation
is fitted to the data to obtain the solstice's instant with an accuracy of one hour. The departure
of the measures is within 4 arcsec (the daytime seeing during these solar transits) from the ephemerides
of IMCCE. The pipeline of the algorithm used to obtain the angular data of the center of the Sun, starting
from the ground measurements affected by the atmospheric refraction, and corrected by the Cassini
equation, is described. Bianchini in 1703 reduced the error on the solstices timings by using the
difference in right ascension between the Sun and a star observed at the same meridian line even in
daytime (as he did with Sirius in June-July 1703). The present one is an absolute measurement, without
stellar references. The meridian diameter is averagely measured 24 arcsec less than the true value,
with 20 arcsec of standard deviation, because of different luminosity contrasts in the sky and in
the Basilica. Conversely the center of the image is much better defined (the contrast acts symmetrically
without moving the center of the image), allowing an accuracy to the nearest arcsecond in the determination
of the true obliquity.
