Electricity plays a special role in our lives and life. Equations of electron dynamics are nearly
exact and apply from nuclear particles to stars. These Maxwell equations include a special term
the displacement current (of vacuum). Displacement current allows electrical signals to propagate
through space. Displacement current guarantees that current is exactly conserved from inside
atoms to between stars, as long as current is defined as Maxwell did, as the entire source of the curl
of the magnetic field. We show how the Bohm formulation of quantum mechanics allows easy definition
of current. We show how conservation of current can be derived without mention of the polarization
or dielectric properties of matter. Matter does not behave the way physicists of the 1800's thought
it does with a single dielectric constant, a real positive number independent of everything. Charge
moves in enormously complicated ways that cannot be described in that way, when studied on time scales
important today for electronic technology and molecular biology. Life occurs in ionic solutions
in which charge moves in response to forces not mentioned or described in the Maxwell equations,
like convection and diffusion. Classical derivations of conservation of current involve classical
treatments of dielectrics and polarization in nearly every textbook. Because real dielectrics
do not behave in a classical way, classical derivations of conservation of current are often distrusted
or even ignored. We show that current is conserved exactly in any material no matter how complex the
dielectric, polarization or conduction currents are. We believe models, simulations, and computations
should conserve current on all scales, as accurately as possible, because physics conserves current
that way. We believe models will be much more successful if they conserve current at every level of
resolution, the way physics does.
