The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe, the dynamics of the supernovae
that produced the heavy elements necessary for life, and whether protons eventually decay -- these
mysteries at the forefront of particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early
evolution of our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. DUNE is an international world-class
experiment dedicated to addressing these questions as it searches for leptonic charge-parity
symmetry violation, stands ready to capture supernova neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon
decay as a signature of a grand unified theory underlying the standard model. The DUNE far detector
technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE physics program and the technical designs of the
single- and dual-phase DUNE liquid argon TPC far detector modules. Volume II of this TDR, DUNE Physics,
describes the array of identified scientific opportunities and key goals. Crucially, we also report
our best current understanding of the capability of DUNE to realize these goals, along with the detailed
arguments and investigations on which this understanding is based. This TDR volume documents the
scientific basis underlying the conception and design of the LBNF/DUNE experimental configurations.
As a result, the description of DUNE's experimental capabilities constitutes the bulk of the document.
Key linkages between requirements for successful execution of the physics program and primary
specifications of the experimental configurations are drawn and summarized. This document also
serves a wider purpose as a statement on the scientific potential of DUNE as a central component within
a global program of frontier theoretical and experimental particle physics research. Thus, the
presentation also aims to serve as a resource for the particle physics community at large.
