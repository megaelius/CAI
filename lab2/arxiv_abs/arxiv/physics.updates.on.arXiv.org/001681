Convection is the predominant mechanism by which energy and angular momentum are transported in
the outer portion of the Sun. The resulting overturning motions are also the primary energy source
for the solar magnetic field. An accurate solar dynamo model therefore requires a complete description
of the convective motions, but these motions remain poorly understood. Studying stellar convection
numerically remains challenging; it occurs within a parameter regime that is extreme by computational
standards. The fluid properties of the convection zone are characterized in part by the Prandtl
number $\mathrm{Pr}=\nu/\kappa$, where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity and $\kappa$ is the thermal
diffusion; in stars, $\mathrm{Pr}$ is extremely low, $\mathrm{Pr}\approx 10^{-7}$. The influence
of $\mathrm{Pr}$ on the convective motions at the heart of the dynamo is not well understood since
most numerical studies are limited to using $\mathrm{Pr}\approx1$. We systematically vary $\mathrm{Pr}$
and the degree of thermal forcing, characterized through a Rayleigh number, to explore its influence
on the convective dynamics. For sufficiently large thermal driving, the simulations reach a so-called
convective free-fall state where diffusion no longer plays an important role in the interior dynamics.
Simulations with a lower $\mathrm{Pr}$ generate faster convective flows and broader ranges of
scales for equivalent levels of thermal forcing. Characteristics of the spectral distribution
of the velocity remain largely insensitive to changes in $\mathrm{Pr}$. Importantly, we find that
$\mathrm{Pr}$ plays a key role in determining when the free-fall regime is reached by controlling
the thickness of the thermal boundary layer.
