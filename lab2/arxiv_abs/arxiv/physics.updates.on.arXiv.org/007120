The main result in this paper is a provably entropy stable shock capturing approach for the high order
entropy stable Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method based on a hybrid blending with
a subcell low order variant. Lead by theoretical findings presented in Fisher and Carpenter, where
they show how to rewrite a high order summation-by-parts operator into an equivalent conservative
finite difference form, it is possible to design a low order scheme directly with the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto
nodes that is compatible to the discrete entropy analysis used for the proof of the entropy stable
DGSEM. We are able to design a hybrid low order/high order discretisation where it is possible to
seamlessly blend between the two approaches, while still being provably entropy stable. With tensor
products and careful design of the low order scheme on curved elements, we are able to extend the approach
to three spatial dimensions on unstructured curvilinear hexahedral meshes. We validate our theoretical
findings and demonstrate convergence order for smooth problems, conservation of the primary quantities
and discrete entropy stability for an arbitrary blending on curvilinear grids. In practical simulations,
we connect the blending factor to a local troubled element indicator that provides the control of
the amount of low order dissipation injected into the high order scheme. We extended the shock indicator
of Persson and Peraire to our provably stable hybrid scheme. We describe our indicator in detail
and demonstrate its robustness in combination with the hybrid scheme, as it is possible to compute
all the different test cases without changing the indicator. The test cases include e.g. the double
Mach reflection setup, forward and backward facing steps with shock Mach numbers up to 100.
