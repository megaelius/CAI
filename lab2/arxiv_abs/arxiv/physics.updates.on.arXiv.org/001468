Unlike conventional optics, plasmonics enables unrivalled concentration of optical energy well
beyond the diffraction limit of light. However, a significant part of this energy is dissipated
as heat. Plasmonic losses present a major hurdle in the development of plasmonic devices and circuits
that can compete with other mature technologies. Until recently, they have largely kept the use
of plasmonics to a few niche areas where loss is not a key factor, such as surface enhanced Raman scattering
and biochemical sensing. Here, we discuss the origin of plasmonic losses and various approaches
to either minimize or mitigate them based on understanding of fundamental processes underlying
surface plasmon modes excitation and decay. Along with the ongoing effort to find and synthesize
better plasmonic materials, optical designs that modify the optical powerflow through plasmonic
nanostructures can help in reducing both radiative damping and dissipative losses of surface plasmons.
Another strategy relies on the development of hybrid photonic-plasmonic devices by coupling plasmonic
nanostructures to resonant optical elements. Hybrid integration not only helps to reduce dissipative
losses and radiative damping of surface plasmons, but also makes possible passive radiative cooling
of nano-devices. Finally, we review emerging applications of thermoplasmonics that leverage
Ohmic losses to achieve new enhanced functionalities. The most successful commercialized example
of a loss-enabled novel application of plasmonics is heat-assisted magnetic recording. Other
promising technological directions include thermal emission manipulation, cancer therapy,
nanofabrication, nano-manipulation, plasmon-enabled material spectroscopy and thermo-catalysis,
and solar water treatment.
