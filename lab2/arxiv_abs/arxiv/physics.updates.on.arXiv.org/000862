Triadic relationships are accepted to play a key role in the dynamics of social and political networks.
Building on insights gleaned from balance theory in social network studies and from Boltzmann-Gibbs
statistical physics, we propose a model to quantitatively capture the dynamics of the four types
of triadic relationships in a network. Central to our model are the triads' incidence rates and the
idea that those can be modeled by assigning a specific triadic energy to each type of triadic relation.
We emphasize the role of the degeneracy of the different triads and how it impacts the degree of frustration
in the political network. In order to account for a persistent form of disorder in the formation of
the triadic relationships, we introduce the systemic variable temperature. In order to learn about
the dynamics and motives, we propose a generic Hamiltonian with three terms to model the triadic
energies. One term is connected with a three-body interaction that captures balance theory. The
other terms take into account the impact of heterogeneity and of negative edges in the triads. The
validity of our model is tested on four datasets including the time series of triadic relationships
for the standings between two classes of alliances in a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG).
We also analyze real-world data for the relationships between the "agents" involved in the Syrian
civil war, and in the relations between countries during the Cold War era. We find emerging properties
in the triadic relationships in a political network, for example reflecting itself in a persistent
hierarchy between the four triadic energies, and in the consistency of the extracted parameters
from comparing the model Hamiltonian to the data.
