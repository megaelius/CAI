The critical dimension necessary for a flame to propagate in suspensions of fuel particles in oxidizer
is studied analytically and numerically. Two types of models are considered: First, a continuum
model, wherein the individual particulate sources are not resolved and the heat release is assumed
spatially uniform, is solved via conventional finite difference techniques. Second, a discrete
source model, wherein the heat diffusion from individual sources is modeled via superposition
of the Green's function of each source, is employed to examine the influence of the random, discrete
nature of the media. Heat transfer to cold, isothermal walls and to a layer of inert gas surrounding
the reactive medium are considered as the loss mechanisms. Both cylindrical and rectangular (slab)
geometries of the reactive medium are considered, and the flame speed is measured as a function of
the diameter and thickness of the domains, respectively. In the continuum model with inert gas confinement,
a universal scaling of critical diameter to critical thickness near 2:1 is found. In the discrete
source model, as the time scale of heat release of the sources is made small compared to the interparticle
diffusion time, the geometric scaling between cylinders and slabs exhibits values greater than
2:1. The ability of the flame in the discrete regime to propagate in thinner slabs than predicted
by continuum scaling is attributed to the flame being able to exploit local fluctuations in concentration
across the slab to sustain propagation. As the heat release time of the sources is increased, the
discrete source model reverts back to results consistent with the continuum model. Implications
of these results for experiments are discussed.
