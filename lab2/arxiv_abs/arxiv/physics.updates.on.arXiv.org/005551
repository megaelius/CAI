A conservative finite-volume framework, based on a collocated variable arrangement, for the simulation
of flows at all speeds, applicable to incompressible, ideal-gas and real-gas fluids is proposed
in conjunction with a fully-coupled pressure-based algorithm. The applied conservative discretisation
and implementation of the governing conservation laws as well as the definition of the fluxes using
a momentum-weighted interpolation are identical for incompressible and compressible fluids,
and are suitable for complex geometries represented by unstructured meshes. Incompressible fluids
are described by predefined constant fluid properties, while the properties of compressible fluids
are described by the Noble-Abel-stiffened-gas model, with the definitions of density and specific
static enthalpy of both incompressible and compressible fluids combined in a unified thermodynamic
closure model. The discretised governing conservation laws are solved in a single linear system
of equations for pressure, velocity and temperature. Together, the conservative finite-volume
discretisation, the unified thermodynamic closure model and the pressure-based algorithm yield
a conceptually simple, but versatile, numerical framework. The proposed numerical framework
is validated thoroughly using a broad variety of test-cases, with Mach numbers ranging from 0 to
239, including viscous flows of incompressible fluids as well as the propagation of acoustic waves
and transiently evolving supersonic flows with shock waves in ideal-gas and real-gas fluids. These
results demonstrate the accuracy, robustness and the convergence, as well as the conservation
of mass and energy, of the numerical framework for flows of incompressible and compressible fluids
at all speeds, on structured and unstructured meshes.
