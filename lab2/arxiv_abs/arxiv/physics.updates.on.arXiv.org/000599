Hosting six different experiments at four different interaction points and widely different requirements
for the running conditions, the LHC machine has been faced with a long list of challenges in the first
three years of luminosity production (2010-2012, Run 1), many of which were potentially capable
of limiting the performance due to instabilities resulting from the extremely high bunch brightness.
Nonetheless, LHC met the challenges and performed extremely well at high efficiency and routinely
with beam brightness at twice the design, well over one-third of the time in collision for physics,
average luminosity lifetimes in excess of 10 h and extremely good background conditions in the experiments.
While the experimental running configurations remain largely the same for the future high luminosity
proton-proton operational mode, the energy and the luminosity should increase significantly,
making a prior assessment of related beam-beam effects extremely important to guarantee high performance.
Of particular interest is the need for levelling the luminosity individually in the different experiments.
Luminosity control as the more general version of 'levelling' has been at the heart of the success
for LHCb, and to a large extent also for ALICE, throughout Run 1. With the increasing energy and potential
luminosity, luminosity control may be required by all the experiments at some point in the future
as a means of controlling the pileup conditions and trigger rates, but possibly also as a way of optimizing
the integrated luminosity. This paper reviews the various motivations and possibilities for controlling
the luminosity from the experiments' point of view, and outlines the future running conditions
and desiderata for the experiments as they are viewed currently, with the aim of giving guidelines
for different options.
