Bernaise (Binary ElectRohydrodyNAmIc SolvEr) is a flexible high-level finite element solver
of two-phase electrohydrodynamic flow in complex geometries. Two-phase flow with electrolytes
is relevant across a broad range of systems and scales, from 'lab-on-a-chip' devices for medical
diagnostics to enhanced oil recovery at the reservoir scale. For the strongly coupled multi-physics
problem, we employ a recently developed thermodynamically consistent model which combines a generalized
Nernst-Planck equation for ion transport, the Poisson equation for electrostatics, the Cahn-Hilliard
equation for the phase field (describing the interface separating the phases), and the Navier-Stokes
equations for fluid flow. As an efficient alternative to solving the coupled system of partial differential
equations in a monolithic manner, we present a linear, decoupled numerical scheme which sequentially
solves the three sets of equations. The scheme is validated by comparison to limiting cases where
analytical solutions are available, benchmark cases, and by the method of manufactured solution.
The solver operates on unstructured meshes and is therefore well suited to handle arbitrarily shaped
domains and problem set-ups where, e.g., very different resolutions are required in different
parts of the domain. Bernaise is implemented in Python via the FEniCS framework, which effectively
utilizes MPI and domain decomposition, and should therefore be suitable for large-scale/high-performance
computing. Further, new solvers and problem set-ups can be specified and added with ease to the Bernaise
framework by experienced Python users.
