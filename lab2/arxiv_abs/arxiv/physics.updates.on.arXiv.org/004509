Nanowires are versatile nanostructures, which allow an exquisite control over bandgap energies
and charge carrier dynamics making them highly attractive as building blocks for a broad range of
photonic devices. For optimal solutions concerning device performance and cost, a crucial element
is the selection of a suitable material system which could enable a large wavelength tunability,
strong light interaction and simple integration with the mainstream silicon technologies. The
emerging GaBiAs alloys offer such promising features and may lead to a new era of technologies. Here,
we apply million-atom atomistic simulations to design GaBiAs/GaAs core-shell nanowires suitable
for low-loss telecom-wavelength photonic devices. The effects of internal strain, Bi Composition
(x), random alloy configuration, and core-to-shell diameter ratio ($\rm \rho_D$) are analysed
and delineated by systematically varying these attributes and studying their impact on the absorption
wavelength and charge carrier confinement. The complex interplay between x and $\rm \rho_D$ results
in two distinct pathways to accomplish 1.55 um optical transitions: either fabricate nanowires
with $\rm \rho_D \geq$ 0.8 and $x \sim$15\%, or increase $x$ to $\sim$30\% with $\rm \rho_D \leq$
0.4. Upon further analysis of the electron hole wave functions, inhomogeneous broadening and optical
transition strengths, the nanowires with $\rm \rho_D \leq$ 0.4 are unveiled to render favourable
properties for the design of photonic devices. Another important outcome of our study is to demonstrate
the possibility of modulating the strain character from a compressive to a tensile regime by simply
engineering the thickness of the core region. The availability of such a straightforward knob for
strain manipulation would be highly desirable for devices involving polarisation-sensitive
light interactions.
