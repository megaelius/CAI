Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of flow in a turbulent channel with a random rough wall is performed
at $Re_{\tau}=400$ and $600$. The roughness geometry corresponds to the experiments of Flack and
Schultz (personal communication). The rough surface is used on the bottom wall of the channel. DNS
of a smooth channel flow and a rod-roughened channel flow are also performed at $Re_{\tau}=400$
for validation and comparison. The skin friction coefficient of the random-rough channel shows
good agreement with the experimental results of Flack and Schultz. Due to the roughness, the slip
velocity on the rough wall increases while the mean velocity decreases in the log-law region. The
streamwise and spanwise velocity fluctuations are enhanced near the rough wall. The pressure fluctuations
show a significant increase in the roughness layer and exhibit a good collapse with the smooth wall
in the outer layer. The streamwise mean momentum balance shows that pressure and viscous stress
gradients are induced in the roughness layer, and the gradients are amplified at higher $Re_{\tau}$.
The statistics of wall-shear stress fluctuations in the peak (above the mean height location) and
valley (below the mean height location) regions are examined. The results indicate that reverse
flow mainly occurs in the valley regions of the random roughness, and is enhanced at higher $Re_{\tau}$,
but is not as strong as the recirculation within the cavities in the rod-roughened channel. The probability
distribution function of wall-shear stress shows a better collapse after subtracting the mean
and normalizing by the root-mean-squared value. The distribution tail is widened by the random
roughness, implying that the probability of extreme events is increased. The probability of extreme
events in the random-rough channel increases with increasing $Re_{\tau}$, in accordance with
previous studies on smooth-wall flows.
