Incremental 4D-Var is a data assimilation algorithm used routinely at operational numerical weather
predictions centers worldwide.This paper implements a new method for parallelizing incremental
4D-Var, the Randomized Incremental Optimal Technique (RIOT), which replaces the traditional
sequential conjugate gradient (CG) iterations in the inner-loop of the minimization with fully
parallel randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) of the preconditioned Hessian of the
cost function. RIOT is tested using the standard Lorenz-96 model (L-96) as well as two realistic
high-dimensional atmospheric source inversion problems based on aircraft observations of black
carbon concentrations. A new outer-loop preconditioning technique tailored to RSVD was introduced
to improve convergence stability and performance. Results obtained with the L-96 system show that
the performance improvement from RIOT compared to standard CG algorithms increases significantly
with non-linearities. Overall, in the realistic black carbon source inversion experiments, RIOT
reduces the wall-time of the 4D-Var minimization by a factor 2-3, at the cost of a factor 4-10 increase
in energy cost due to the large number of parallel cores used. Furthermore, RIOT enables reduction
of the wall-time computation of the analysis error covariance matrix by a factor 40 compared to a
standard iterative Lanczos approach. Finally, as evidenced in this study, implementation of RIOT
in an operational numerical weather prediction system will require a better understanding of its
convergence properties as a function of the Hessian characteristics and, in particular, the degree
of freedom for signal (DOFs) of the inverse problem.
