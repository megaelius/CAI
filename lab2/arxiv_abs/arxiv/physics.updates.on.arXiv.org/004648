Manual forward planning for GK radiosurgery is complicated and time-consuming, particularly
for cases with large or irregularly shaped targets. Inverse planning eases GK planning by solving
an optimization problem. However, due to the vast search space, most inverse planning algorithms
have to decouple the planning process to isocenter preselection and sector duration optimization.
This sequential scheme does not necessarily lead to optimal isocenter locations and hence optimal
plans. In this study, we attempt to optimize the isocenter positions, beam shapes and durations
simultaneously by proposing a multi-resolution-level (MRL) strategy to handle the large-scale
GK optimization problem. In our approach, several rounds of optimizations were performed with
a progressively increased spatial resolution for isocenter candidate selection. The isocenters
selected from last round and their neighbors on a finer resolution were used as new isocenter candidates
for next round of optimization. After plan optimization, shot sequencing was performed to group
the optimized sectors to deliverable shots supported by GK treatment units. We have tested our algorithm
on 6 GK cases previously treated in our institution (2 meningioma cases, 3 cases with single metastasis
and 1 case with 6 metastases). Compared with manual planning, achieving same coverage and similar
selectivity, our algorithm improved the gradient index averagely from 3.1 to 2.9 and reduced the
maximum dose of brainstem from 8.0Gy to 5.6Gy. The average beam-on time was also reduced by from 103.8
mins to 87.4 mins. Our method was also compared with the inverse planning algorithm provided in Leksell
GammaPlan planning system, and outperformed it with better plan quality for all the 6 cases.This
preliminary study has demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of our MRL inverse planning
approach for GK radiosurgery.
