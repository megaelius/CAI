Water has many anomalous properties compared to "simple" liquids, and these anomalies are typically
enhanced in supercooled water. While numerous models have been proposed, including the liquid-liquid
critical point, the singularity-free scenario, and the stability limit conjecture, a molecular-level
understanding remains elusive.The main difficulty in determining which, if any, of these models
is correct is the limited amount of data in the relevant temperature and pressure ranges. For water
at ambient pressures, which is the focus of this work, data is largely missing from 160 - 232 K due to
rapid crystallization. Whether rapid crystallization is just an experimental obstacle, or a fundamental
problem signaling the inability of water to thermally equilibrate prior to crystallization is
also a major unanswered question. Here, we investigate the structural transformations of transiently-heated,
supercooled water with nanosecond time resolution using infrared vibrational spectroscopy.
The experiments demonstrate three key results. First, water's structure relaxes from its initial
configuration to a "steady-state" configuration prior to the onset of crystallization over a wide
temperature range. Second, water's steady-state structure can be reproduced by a linear combination
of two, temperature-independent structures that correspond to a "high-temperature liquid" and
a "low-temperature liquid." Third, the observed structural changes are reversible over the full
temperature range. Taken together, these results show that supercooled water can equilibrate
prior to crystallization for temperatures from the homogeneous nucleation temperature down to
the glass transition temperature. Second, the results provide support for the hypothesis that
supercooled water can be described as a mixture of two, structurally-distinct, interconvertible
liquids from 135 K to 245 K.
