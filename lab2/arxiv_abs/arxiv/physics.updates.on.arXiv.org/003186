Ground-based astro-geodetic observations and atmospheric occultations, are two examples of
observational techniques requiring a scrutiny analysis of atmospheric refraction. In both cases,
the measured changes in observables are geometrically related to changes in the photon path and
the light time of the received electromagnetic signal. In the context of geometrical optics, the
change in the physical properties of the signal are related to the refractive profile of the crossed
medium. Therefore, having a clear knowledge of how the refractivity governs the photon path and
the light time evolution is of prime importance to clearly understand observational features.
Analytical studies usually focused on spherically symmetric atmospheres and only few aimed at
exploring the effect of the non-spherical symmetry on the observables. In this paper, we analytically
perform the integration of the photon path and the light time of rays traveling across a planetary
atmosphere. We do not restrict our attention to spherically symmetric atmospheres and introduce
a comprehensive mathematical framework which allows to handle any kind of analytical studies in
the context of geometrical optics. To highlight the capabilities of this new formalism, we carry
out five realistic applications for which we derive analytical solutions. The accuracy of the method
of integration is assessed by comparing our results to a numerical integration of the equations
of geometrical optics in the presence of a quadrupolar moment $J_2$. This shows that the analytical
solution leads to the determination of the light time and the refractive bending with relative errors
at the level of one part in $10^8$ and one part in $10^5$, for typical values of the refractivity and
the $J_2$ parameter at levels of $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-2}$, respectively.
