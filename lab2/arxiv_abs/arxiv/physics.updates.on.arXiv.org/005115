Coherent ranging, also known as frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) laser based ranging
(LIDAR) is currently developed for long range 3D distance and velocimetry in autonomous driving.
Its principle is based on mapping distance to frequency, and to simultaneously measure the Doppler
shift of reflected light using frequency chirped signals, similar to Sonar or Radar. Yet, despite
these advantages, coherent ranging exhibits lower acquisition speed and requires precisely chirped
and highly-coherent laser sources, hindering their widespread use and impeding Parallelization,
compared to modern time-of-flight (TOF) ranging that use arrays of individual lasers. Here we demonstrate
a novel massively parallel coherent LIDAR scheme using a photonic chip-based microcomb. By fast
chirping the pump laser in the soliton existence range of a microcomb with amplitudes up to several
GHz and sweep rate up to 10 MHz, the soliton pulse stream acquires a rapid change in the underlying
carrier waveform, while retaining its pulse-to-pulse repetition rate. As a result, the chirp from
a single narrow-linewidth pump laser is simultaneously transferred to all spectral comb teeth
of the soliton at once, and allows for true parallelism in FMCW LIDAR. We demonstrate this approach
by generating 30 distinct channels, demonstrating both parallel distance and velocity measurements
at an equivalent rate of 3 Mpixel/s, with potential to improve sampling rates beyond 150 Mpixel/s
and increase the image refresh rate of FMCW LIDAR up to two orders of magnitude without deterioration
of eye safety. The present approach, when combined with photonic phase arrays based on nanophotonic
gratings, provides a technological basis for compact, massively parallel and ultra-high frame
rate coherent LIDAR systems.
