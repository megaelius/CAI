Upscaling Klinkenberg-corrected gas permeability, k, in unconventional tight sandstones has
numerous practical applications, particularly in gas exploration and production. In this study,
we adapt the effective-medium approximation (EMA) model of Doyen - proposed first to estimate bulk
electrical conductivity, {\sigma}_b, and permeability in sandstones from rock images - to scale
up {\sigma}_b and k in tight-gas sandstones from pore to core. For this purpose, we calculate two
characteristic pore sizes: an effective hydraulic and an effective electrical pore size from pore-throat
size distributions - determined from mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP) curves - and
pore-throat connectivity. The latter is estimated from critical volume fraction (or percolation
threshold) for macroscopic flow. Electrical conductivity and permeability are then scaled up
from the two characteristic pore sizes, tortuosity, and porosity by assuming two different pore
geometries: cylindrical and slit-shaped. Comparison of results obtained for eighteen tight-gas
sandstones indicates that the EMA estimates {\sigma}_b and k more accurately when pores are assumed
to be cylindrical. We also estimate k from the pore-throat size distributions and the measured electrical
conductivity using the EMA and critical path analysis (CPA), another upscaling technique borrowed
from statistical physics. Theoretically, the former is valid in relatively heterogeneous porous
media with narrow pore-throat size distribution, while the latter is valid in heterogeneous media
with broad pore-throat size distribution. Results show that the EMA estimates k more accurately
than CPA and arrives within a factor of two of the measurements on average.
