The plasma wakefield accelerator may accelerate particles to high energy in a future linear collider
with unprecedented acceleration gradients, exceeding the GeV/m range. Beams for this application
would have extremely high brightness and, subject to the intense plasma ion-derived focusing,
they would achieve densities high enough to induce the plasma ions to collapse into the beam volume.
This non-uniform ion density gives rise to strong nonlinear focusing which may lead to deleterious
beam emittance growth. The effects of ion collapse and their mitigation has been investigated recently
through particle-in-cell simulations, which show that by dynamically matching the beam to the
focusing of the collapsed ion distribution, one may avoid serious emittance growth. We extend this
work by exploring the near-equilibrium state of the beam-ion system reached after the ions have
collapsed, a condition yielding the emittance growth mitigation observed. We show through PIC
simulations and analytical theory that in this case a dual electron beam-ion Bennett-type equilibrium
distribution is approached. Here, the beam and ion distributions share nearly the same shape, which
generates nonlinear transverse electromagnetic fields. We exploit a Bennett-type model to study
beam phase space dynamics and emittance growth over time scales much longer than permitted by PIC
simulations through use of a 2D symplectic tracking code with Monte Carlo scattering based on Moliere's
theory of small angle multiple scattering. We find that while phase space diffusion due to parametric
excitations of the beam size due to plasma non-uniformity is negligible, scattering from collapsed
ions gives rise to manageable emittance growth in the case of a linear collider. The implications
of these results on experiments planned at FACET-II are examined.
