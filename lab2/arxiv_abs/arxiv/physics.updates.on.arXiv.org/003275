Convection schemes are a large source of error in global weather and climate models, and modern resolutions
are often too fine to parameterize convection but are still too coarse to fully resolve it. Recently,
numerical solutions of multi-fluid equations have been proposed for a more flexible and consistent
treatment of sub-grid scale convection, including net mass transport by convection and non-equilibrium
dynamics. The technique involves splitting the atmosphere into various fluid components which
are defined by their physical properties, such as the stable environment or buoyant updrafts. The
fluids interact through a common pressure, but such equations are ill-posed, meaning extra terms
such as drag or mass transfers are needed to stabilise them. Relatively little is known about the
numerical stability of the multi-fluid equations or the numerical properties of mass transfer
terms between the fluids. This study aims to provide an insight for these two topics: 1. We analyse
the physical and numerical stability of the multi-fluid shallow water equations with a common height
gradient. We show that the 2-fluid linearized equations are less stable than the 1-fluid case. However,
the full, non-linear equations have a greater numerical stability due to a direct energy cascade
which removes energy from the most unstable modes. 2. We derive mass transfer terms which relabel
the fluids and derive numerical properties of the transfer schemes including boundedness, momentum
conservation and energy properties. Numerical solutions of the multi-fluid Euler equations are
presented using stable and unstable treatments of the transfers. We find three transfer schemes
which possess desirable numerical properties, two of which are suitable for use on staggered grids.
