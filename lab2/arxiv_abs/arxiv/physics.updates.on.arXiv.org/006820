Crystal calorimeters have a long history of pushing the frontier on high-resolution electromagnetic
(EM) calorimetry. We explore in this paper major innovations in collider detector performance
that can be achieved with crystal calorimetry when longitudinal segmentation and dual-readout
capabilities are combined with a new high EM resolution approach to PFA in multi-jet events, such
as $e^+e^+\rightarrow HZ$ events in all-hadronic final-states at Higgs factories. We demonstrate
a new technique for pre-processing $\pi^0$ momenta through combinatoric di-photon pairing in
advance of applying jet algorithms. This procedure significantly reduces $\pi^0$ photon splitting
across jets in multi-jet events. The correct photon-to-jet assignment efficiency improves by
a factor of 3 with a $3\%/\sqrt{E}$ EM resolution. In addition, the technique of bremsstrahlung
photon recovery significantly improves electron momentum measurements. A high EM resolution
calorimeter increases the Z boson recoil mass resolution in Higgstrahlung events for decays into
electron pairs to 80% of that for muon pairs. We present the design and optimization of a highly segmented
crystal detector concept that achieves the required energy resolution, and a time resolution better
than 30 ps providing exceptional particle identification capabilities. We demonstrate that,
contrary to previous detector designs that suffered from large neutral hadron resolution degradation
from one interaction length of crystals in front of a sampling hadron calorimeter, the implementation
of dual-readout on crystals permits to achieve a resolution better than $30\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus
2\%$ for neutral hadrons. Our studies find that the integration of crystal calorimetry into future
Higgs factory collider detectors can open new perspectives by yielding the highest level of combined
EM and neutral hadron resolution in the PFA paradigm.
