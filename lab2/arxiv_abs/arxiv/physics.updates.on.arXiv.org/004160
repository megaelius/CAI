In recent years, a number of purpose-built scintillator-based polarimeters have studied bright
astronomical sources for the first time in the hard X-ray band (tens to hundreds of keV). The addition
of polarimetry can help data interpretation by resolving model-dependent degeneracies. The typical
instrument approach is that incident X-rays scatter off a plastic scintillator into an adjacent
scintillator cell. In all missions to date, the scintillators are read out using traditional vacuum
tube photo-multipliers (PMTs). The advent of solid-state PMTs ("silicon PM" or "MPPC") is attractive
for space-based instruments since the devices are compact, robust and require a low bias voltage.
We have characterised the plastic scintillator, EJ-248M, optically coupled to a multi-pixel photon
counter (MPPC) and read out with the Citiroc ASIC. A light-yield of 1.6 photoelectrons/keV has been
obtained, with a low energy detection threshold of $\lesssim$5 keV at room temperature. We have
also constructed an MPPC-based polarimeter-demonstrator in order to investigate the feasibility
of such an approach for future instruments. Incident X-rays scatter from a plastic-scintillator
bar to surrounding cerium-doped GAGG (Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet) scintillators yielding
time-coincident signals in the scintillators. We have determined the polarimetric response of
this set-up using both unpolarised and polarised $\sim$50 keV X-rays. We observe a clear asymmetry
in the GAGG counting rates for the polarised beam. The low-energy detection threshold in the plastic
scintillator can be further reduced using a coincidence technique. The demonstrated polarimeter
design shows promise as a space-based Compton polarimeter and we discuss ways in which our polarimeter
can be adapted for such a mission.
