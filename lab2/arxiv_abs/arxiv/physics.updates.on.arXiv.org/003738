I tentatively compile the formal uncertainties in the secular rates of change of the orbital elements
$a,~e,~I,~\Omega$ and $\varpi$ of the planets of the solar system from the recently released formal
errors in $a$ and the nonsingular elements $h,~k,~p$ and $q$ estimated for the same bodies with the
EPM2017 ephemerides by E.\,V. Pitjeva and N.\,P. Pitjev. The highest accuracies occur for the inner
planets and Saturn in view of the extensive use of radiotechnical data collected over the last decades.
For the inclination $I$, node $\Omega$ and perihelion $\varpi$ of Mercury and Mars, I obtain accuracies
$\sigma_{\dot I},\,\sigma_{\dot\Omega},\,\sigma_{\dot \varpi}\simeq 1-10\,\mu\textrm{as~cty}^{-1}$,
while for Saturn they are $\sigma_{\dot I},\,\sigma_{\dot\Omega},\,\sigma_{\dot \varpi}\simeq
10\,\mu\textrm{as~cty}^{-1}-1\,\textrm{mas~cty}^{-1}$. As far as the semimajor axis $a$ is
concerned, its rates for the inner planets are accurate to the $\sigma_{\dot a}\simeq 1-100\,\textrm{mm~cty}^{-1}$
level, while for Saturn I obtain $\sigma_{\dot a}\simeq 17\,\textrm{m~cty}^{-1}$. In terms of
the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$, a formal error as little
as $8\,\mu\textrm{as~cty}^{-1}$ for the Hermean apsidal rate corresponds to a $\simeq 2\times
10^{-7}$ bias in the combination $\left(1 + 2\gamma- \beta\right)/3$ parameterizing the Schwarzschild-type
periehlion precession of Mercury. The realistic uncertainties of the planetary precessions may
be up to one order of magnitude larger. I discuss their potential multiple uses in fundamental physics,
astronomy, and planetology.
