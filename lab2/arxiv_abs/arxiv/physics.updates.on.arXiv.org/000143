In this paper we present a lattice Boltzmann model for combustion and detonation. In this model the
fluid behavior is described by a finite-difference lattice Boltzmann model by Gan et al. [Physica
A, 2008, 387: 1721]. The chemical reaction is described by the Lee-Tarver model [Phys. Fluids, 1980,
23: 2362]. The reaction heat is naturally coupled with the flow behavior. Due to the separation of
time scales in the chemical and thermodynamic processes, a key technique for a successful simulation
is to use the operator-splitting scheme. The new model is verified and validated by well-known benchmark
tests. As a specific application of the new model, we studied the simple steady detonation phenomenon.
To show the merit of LB model over the traditional ones, we focus on the reaction zone to study the non-equilibrium
effects. It is interesting to find that, at the von Neumann peak, the system is nearly in its thermodynamic
equilibrium. At the two sides of the von Neumann peak, the system deviates from its equilibrium in
opposite directions. In the front of von Neumann peak, due to the strong compression from the reaction
product behind the von Neumann peak, the system experiences a sudden deviation from thermodynamic
equilibrium. Behind the von Neumann peak, the release of chemical energy results in thermal expansion
of the matter within the reaction zone, which drives the system to deviate the thermodynamic equilibrium
in the opposite direction. From the deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium, defined in this
paper, one can understand more on the macroscopic effects of the system due to the deviation from
its thermodynamic equilibrium.
