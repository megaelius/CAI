The energy transition towards high shares of renewable energy resources may affect the dynamics
and the stability of electricity grids in many ways. Renewable energy resources fluctuate strongly
in time. Moreover, inverter-connected wind turbines and solar cells provide no inertia for the
grid, in contrast to conventional generators, whose rotating masses hold inertia that is essential
for the stability of the grid. It is therefore essential to understand the impact of this development
on the stability of electricity grids. We aim to contribute to this understanding by solving the
nonlinear swing equations describing the dynamics of coupled rotating masses of synchronous generators
and motors as function of the system parameters on three different grid topologies, the German transmission
grid, square grids and Cayley tree grid. Comparison with analytical results, obtained by spectral
analysis of the swing equations, allows us to identify parameter regimes with qualitatively very
different transient dynamics: the disturbance may either decay exponentially in time, superimposed
by oscillations, with the fast decay rate of a single node, or exponentially with a smaller decay
rate without oscillations. Most remarkably, we find that there exists another regime as the inertia
is lowered, where the nodes become correlated and the spreading of a disturbance is slowed down to
a collective diffusive spreading. There, the disturbance decays very slowly, with a power law in
time. We find that this collective effect exists in meshed transmission grids, but is absent in the
unmeshed tree grid. We conclude by discussing the consequences of these results for the stability
of transmission grids if no measures are undertaken to substitute the inertia of conventional power
plants or new control mechanisms are developed.
