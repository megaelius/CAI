The emergence of replicases that can replicate themselves is a central issue in the origin of life.
Recent experiments suggest that such replicases can be realized if an RNA polymerase ribozyme is
divided into fragments short enough to be replicable by the ribozyme and if these fragments self-assemble
into a functional ribozyme. However, the continued self-replication of such replicases requires
that the production of every essential fragment be balanced and sustained. Here, we use mathematical
modeling to investigate whether and under what conditions fragmented replicases achieve continued
self-replication. We first show that under a simple batch condition, the replicases fail to display
continued self-replication owing to positive feedback inherent in these replicases. This positive
feedback inevitably biases replication toward a subset of fragments, so that the replicases eventually
fail to sustain the production of all essential fragments. We then show that this inherent instability
can be resolved by small rates of random content exchange between loose compartments (i.e., horizontal
transfer). In this case, the balanced production of all fragments is achieved through negative
frequency-dependent selection operating in the population dynamics of compartments. This selection
mechanism arises from an interaction mediated by horizontal transfer between intracellular and
intercellular symmetry breaking. The horizontal transfer also ensures the presence of all essential
fragments in each compartment, sustaining self-replication. Taken together, our results underline
compartmentalization and horizontal transfer in the origin of the first self-replicating replicases.
