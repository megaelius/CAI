Renewable energy sources (RES) are close to grid parity compared with conventional generation.
Therefore, it is important to consider proper costs to assess the economics instead of technological
aspects only. While some scholars are in the opinion that RES only adds complexity - as RES production
is volatile and stochastic - others share the opinion that RES has value in terms of energy savings,
as well as capacity savings, and contributes to the reliability of an energy system. Instead of analyzing
the losses as a result of adding RES, it should be focused on the overall system economics, as this
is more important than if more or less electricity is lost for whatever reason. Economy of Scale (EoS)
can have significant impact on project evaluation, and therefore should be considered in medium-
and long-term planning exercises. As a result of not limiting RES to minimize losses within the system,
the most economic systems show penetration for photovoltaic of above 80 percent, and for Wind of
above 55 percent, on peak demand for both locations. This shows that significant energy out of RES
is not used during the winter, as the demand is less than 50 percent of summer RES, adding value to the
system, as RES saves fuel and increases system reliability by decreasing the required electricity
from conventional generation. Dependent on the location, between 30 and 40 percent of peak demand
on renewable technologies are required before curtailing takes place. It looks like the concept
of Effective Load Carrying Capacity (ELCC) is not that important anymore, as prices for RES came
down significantly within the last decades. The RES quality still plays an important role but is
getting less important as RES costs are decreasing further. It is expected that also average RES
quality site will be more economic in several years.
