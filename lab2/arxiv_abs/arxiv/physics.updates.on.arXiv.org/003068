In this paper, a hypothesis that the cosmological gravitational potential can be measured with
the use of high-precision atomic clocks is proposed and substantiated. The consideration is made
with the use of a quasi-classical description of the gravitational shift that lies in the frame of
nonmetric theories of gravity. It is assumed that the cosmological potential is formed by all matter
of the Universe (including dark matter and dark energy) and that it is spatially uniform on planet
scales. It is obvious that the cosmological potential, $\Phi_\text{CP}$, is several orders of
magnitude greater than Earth's gravitational potential $\varphi_\text{E}$ (where $|\varphi_\text{E}/c^2|\sim
10^{-9}$ on Earth's surface). In our method, the tick rates of identical atomic clocks are compared
at two points with different gravitational potentials, i.e. at different heights. In this case,
the information on $\Phi_\text{CP}$ is contained in the cosmological correction $\alpha\neq
0$ in the relationship $\Delta\omega/\omega=(1+\alpha)\Delta \varphi/c^2$ between the relative
change of the frequencies $\Delta \omega/\omega$ (in atomic clocks) and the difference of the gravitational
potential $\Delta \varphi$ at the measurement points. We have estimated the low limit of cosmological
correction, $\alpha >10^{-6}$. It is shown that using a modern atomic clock of the optical range
it is possible to measure the value of $\alpha$ in earth-based experiments if $|\alpha|>10^{-5}$.
The obtained results, in the case of their experimental confirmation, will open up new unique opportunities
for the study of the Universe and the testing of various cosmological models. These results will
also increase the measurement accuracy in relativistic geodesy, chronometric gravimetry, global
navigation systems, and global networks of atomic clocks.
