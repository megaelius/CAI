As the diversity of people in higher education grows, Universities are struggling to provide inclusive
environments that nurture the spirit of free inquiry in the presence of these differences. At the
extreme, the value of diversity is under attack as a few, vocal academics use public forums to question
the innate intellectual abilities of certain demographic groups. Throughout my career as an astronomer,
from graduate student, through professor to department chair, I have witnessed these struggles
firsthand. Exclusive cultures result in lost opportunities in the form of unfulfilled potential
of all members of the institution - students, administrators and faculty alike. How to move steadily
towards inclusion is an unsolved problem that hampers the advancement of knowledge itself. As every
scientist knows, problem definition is an essential feature of problem solution. This article
draws on insights from dynamical systems descriptions of conflict developed in the social and behavioral
sciences to present a model that captures the convoluted, interacting challenges that stifle progress
on this problem. This description of complexity explains the persistence of exclusive cultures
and the inadequacy of quick or simple fixes. It also motivates the necessity of prolonged and multifaceted
approaches to solutions. It is incumbent on our faculties to recognize the complexities in both
problem and solutions, and persevere in responding to these intractable dynamics. It is incumbent
on our administrations to provide the consistent structure that supports these tasks. It incumbent
on all of our constituents - students, administration and faculty - to be cognizant of and responsive
to these efforts.
