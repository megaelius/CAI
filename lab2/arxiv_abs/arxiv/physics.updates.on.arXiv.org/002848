Microbial communities display extreme diversity. A variety of strains or species coexist even
when limited by a single resource. It has been argued that metabolite secretion creates new niches
and facilitates such diversity. Nonetheless, it is still a controversial topic why cells secrete
even essential metabolites so often, in fact, even under isolation conditions, microbial cells
secrete a variety of metabolites, including those essential for their growth. First, we demonstrate
that the leakage of essential metabolites can be advantageous. If the intracellular chemical reactions
include multibody reactions, in particular, catalytic reactions, this advantageous leakage
of essential metabolites is shown to be possible and indeed typical for most of metabolic networks
via a mechanism termed as "catalytic flux control." Counterintuitively, the mechanism can work
even when the supplied resource is scarce. Next, when such cells are crowded, the presence of another
cell type, which takes up and consumes the leaked chemicals is beneficial for both cell types, so
that their coexistence enhances the growth of both. The latter part of the paper is devoted to the
analysis of such unusual form of symbiosis: "consumer" cell types benefit from the uptake of metabolites
secreted by "leaker" cell types, and such consumption reduces the concentration of metabolites
accumulated in the environment, this environmental change enables further secretion from the
leaker cell types. This situation leads to frequency-dependent coexistence of several cell types,
as supported by extensive simulations. A new look at the diversity in a microbial ecosystem is thus
presented.
