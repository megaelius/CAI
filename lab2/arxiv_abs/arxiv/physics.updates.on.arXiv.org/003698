Pulse-like ruptures arise spontaneously in many elastodynamic rupture simulations and seem to
be the dominant rupture mode along several crustal faults. Pulse-like ruptures propagating under
steady-state conditions can be efficiently analysed theoretically, but it remains unclear how
they can arise and how they evolve if perturbed. Using thermal pressurisation as a representative
constitutive law, we conduct elastodynamic simulations of pulse-like ruptures and determine
the spatio-temporal evolution of slip, slip rate and pulse width perturbations induced by infinitesimal
perturbations in background stress. These simulations indicate that steady-state pulses driven
by thermal pressurisation are unstable. If the initial stress perturbation is negative, ruptures
stop; conversely, if the perturbation is positive, ruptures grow and transition to either self-similar
pulses (at low background stress) or expanding cracks (at elevated background stress). Based on
a dynamic dislocation model, we develop an elastodynamic equation of motion for slip pulses, and
demonstrate that steady-state slip pulses are unstable if their accrued slip $b$ is a decreasing
function of the uniform background stress $\tau_\mathrm{b}$. This condition is satisfied by slip
pulses driven by thermal pressurisation. The pulse equation of motion also predicts quantitatively
the growth rate of perturbations, and provides a generic tool to analyse the propagation of slip
pulses. The unstable character of steady-state slip pulses implies that this rupture mode is a key
one determining the minimum stress conditions for sustainable ruptures along faults, i.e., their
"strength". Furthermore, slip pulse instabilities can produce a remarkable complexity of rupture
dynamics, even under uniform background stress conditions and material properties.
