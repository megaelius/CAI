Mathematical models and numerical simulations are widely used in the field of hemodynamics, representing
a valuable resource to better understand physiological and pathological processes. The theory
behind the phenomenon is closely related to the study of incompressible flow through compliant
thin-walled tubes. The mechanical interaction between blood flow and vessel wall must be properly
described by the model. Recent works show the benefits of characterizing the rheology of the vessel
wall through a viscoelastic law. Considering the viscous contribution of the wall material and
not simply the elastic one leads to a more realistic representation of the vessel behavior, which
manifests not only an instantaneous elastic strain but also a viscous damping effect on pulse pressure
waves, coupled to energy losses. The aim of this work is to propose an easily extensible 1D mathematical
model able to accurately capture the FSI. The originality lies in the introduction of a viscoelastic
tube law in PDE form, valid for both arterial and venous networks, leading to an augmented FSI system.
In contrast to well established mathematical models, the proposed one is natively hyperbolic.
The model is solved with a 2nd-order numerical scheme based on an IMEX RK scheme conceived for applications
to hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation terms. The validation of the model is performed on different
tests. Results obtained in Riemann problems, adopting a simple elastic tube law for the characterization
of the vessel wall, are compared with available exact solutions. To validate the contribution given
by the viscoelastic term, the Method of Manufactured Solutions is applied. Specific tests are designed
to verify the well-balancing and the AP property of the scheme. A specific test with an inlet pulse
pressure wave is designed to assess the effects of viscoelasticity.
