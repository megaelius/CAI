I give some personal remarks on some current issues in the nucleon spin structure study. At an elementary
level I propose a new angular momentum separation for the massless Dirac field in a free theory which
mimics the usual free photon angular momentum separation pattern in Coulomb gauge. In connection
with this construction I introduce a somewhat idiosyncratic formalism in a free massless Dirac
theory which I call "dressed axial $U(1)_A$ symmetry". I show that this new "fermion spin operator",
which is more correctly called "helicity vector operator", can be incorporated into this new symmetry
pattern in a natural way. This set of "dressed axial vector current" and its corresponding charges
show an interesting internal structure and may be useful in a broader physical context. I then discuss
the case of the QED model with a massless Dirac fermion. In the case of covariant quantization, I give
a new and correct proof that the additional term in the total angular momentum operator stemming
from the gauge-fixing term does not contribute at the level of physical matrix elements, which is
discussed in the relevant literature. At the level of asymptotic fields I construct the helicity
vector operator of the QED theory which actually coincides with the usual projection of the total
angular momentum operator when acting on a beam of collinearly moving free particles. I then consider
the QCD model with only two massless light quarks. In this context I discuss the approximate concept
of "asymptotic quark and gluon fields" which is relevant to the usual parton model picture and propose
to use the asymptotic "quark helicity vector" operator to describe the quark helicity contribution
to an IMF proton. Finally, I give some remarks on the concept of IMF itself, which show that this very
concept should be understood with some reservation from a rigorous mathematical consideration.
