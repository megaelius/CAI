A novel variant of spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER)
is introduced and experimentally demonstrated. Other than most previously demonstrated variants
of SPIDER, our method is based on a third-order nonlinear optical effect, namely self-diffraction,
rather than the second-order effect of sum-frequency generation. On one hand, self-diffraction
(SD) substantially simplifies phase-matching capabilities for multi-octave spectra that cannot
be hosted by second-order processes, given manufacturing limitations of crystal lengths in the
few-micrometer range. On the other hand, however, SD SPIDER imposes an additional constraint as
it effectively measures the spectral phase of a self-convolved spectrum rather than immediately
measuring the fundamental phase. Reconstruction of the latter from the measured phase and the spectral
amplitude of the fundamental turns out to be an ill-posed problem, which we address by a regularization
approach. We discuss the numerical implementation in detail and apply it to measured data from a
Ti:sapphire amplifier system. Our experimental demonstration used 40-fs pulses and a 500 $\mu$m
thick BaF${}_2$ crystal to show that the SD SPIDER signal is sufficiently strong to be separable
from stray light. Extrapolating these measurements to the thinnest conceivable nonlinear media,
we predict that bandwidths well above two optical octaves can be measured by a suitably adapted SD
SPIDER apparatus, enabling the direct characterization of pulses down to single-femtosecond
pulse durations. Such characteristics appear out of range for any currently established pulse
measurement technique.
