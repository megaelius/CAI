This paper describes a study of the self-sustaining process in wall-turbulence based on a second
order statistical state dynamics (SSD) model of Couette flow. SSD models with this form are referred
to as S3T models and self-sustain turbulence with a mean flow and second order perturbation structure
similar to that obtained by DNS. The use of a SSD model to study the physical mechanisms underlying
turbulence has advantages over the traditional approach of studying the dynamics of individual
realizations of turbulence. One advantage is that the analytical structure of SSD isolates and
directly expresses the interaction between the coherent mean flow and the incoherent perturbation
components of the turbulence. Isolation of the interaction between these components reveals how
this interaction underlies both the maintenance of the turbulence variance by transfer of energy
from the externally driven flow to the perturbation components as well as the enforcement of the
observed statistical mean turbulent state by feedback regulation between the mean and perturbation
fields. Another advantage of studying turbulence using SSD models is that the analytical structure
of S3T turbulence can be completely characterized. For example, turbulence in the S3T system is
maintained by a parametric growth mechanism. Furthermore, the equilibrium statistical state
of the turbulence can be demonstrated to be enforced by feedback regulation in which transient growth
of the incoherent perturbations episodically suppresses coherent streak growth preventing runaway
parametric growth of the incoherent turbulent component. Using S3T to isolate these parametric
growth and feedback regulation mechanisms allows a detailed characterization of the dynamics
of the self-sustaining process in S3T turbulence with compelling implications for understanding
the mechanism of wall-turbulence.
