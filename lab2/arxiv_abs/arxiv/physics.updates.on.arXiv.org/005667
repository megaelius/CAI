Past planetary missions have been broad and detailed for Gas Giants, compared to flyby missions
for Ice Giants. Presently, a mission to Neptune using electrodynamic tethers is under consideration
due to the ability of tethers to provide free propulsion and power for orbital insertion as well as
additional exploratory maneuvering --- providing more mission capability than a standard orbiter
mission. Tether operation depends on plasma density and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, though tethers
can deal with ill-defined density profiles, with the anodic segment self-adjusting to accommodate
densities. Planetary magnetic fields are due to currents in some small volume inside the planet,
magnetic-moment vector, and typically a dipole law approximation --- which describes the field
outside. When compared with Saturn and Jupiter, the Neptunian magnetic structure is significantly
more complex: the dipole is located below the equatorial plane, is highly offset from the planet
center, and at large tilt with its rotation axis. Lorentz-drag work decreases quickly with distance,
thus requiring spacecraft periapsis at capture close to the planet and allowing the large offset
to make capture efficiency (spacecraft-to-tether mass ratio) well above a no-offset case. The
S/C might optimally reach periapsis when crossing the meridian plane of the dipole, with the S/C
facing it; this convenient synchronism is eased by Neptune rotating little during capture. Calculations
yield maximum efficiency of approximately 12, whereas a $10^{\circ}$ meridian error would reduce
efficiency by about 6%. Efficiency results suggest new calculations should be made to fully include
Neptunian rotation and consider detailed dipole and quadrupole corrections.
