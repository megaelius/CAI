Quality improvement of interferometric data collected by gravitational-wave detectors such
as Advanced LIGO and Virgo is mission critical for the success of gravitational-wave astrophysics.
Gravitational-wave detectors are sensitive to a variety of disturbances of non-astrophysical
origin with characteristic frequencies in the instrument band of sensitivity. Removing non-astrophysical
artifacts that corrupt the data stream is crucial for increasing the number and statistical significance
of gravitational-wave detections and enabling refined astrophysical interpretations of the
data. Machine learning has proved to be a powerful tool for analysis of massive quantities of complex
data in astronomy and related fields of study. We present two machine learning methods, based on
random forest and genetic programming algorithms, that can be used to determine the origin of non-astrophysical
transients in the LIGO detectors. We use two classes of transients with known instrumental origin
that were identified during the first observing run of Advanced LIGO to show that the algorithms
can successfully identify the origin of non-astrophysical transients in real interferometric
data and thus assist in the mitigation of instrumental and environmental disturbances in gravitational-wave
searches. While the data sets described in this paper are specific to LIGO, and the exact procedures
employed were unique to the same, the random forest and genetic programming code bases and means
by which they were applied as a dual machine learning approach are completely portable to any number
of instruments in which noise is believed to be generated through mechanical couplings, the source
of which is not yet discovered.
