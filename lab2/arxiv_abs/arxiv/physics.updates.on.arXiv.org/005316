We investigate the effect of turbulence on the combined condensational and collisional growth
of cloud droplets by means of high resolution direct numerical simulations of turbulence and a superparticle
approximation for droplet dynamics and collisions. The droplets are subject to turbulence as well
as gravity, and their collision and coalescence efficiencies are taken to be unity. We solve the
thermodynamic equations governing temperature, water-vapor mixing ratio, and the resulting
supersaturation fields together with the Navier-Stokes equation. We find that the droplet-size
distribution broadens with increasing Reynolds number and/or mean energy dissipation rate. Turbulence
affects the condensational growth directly through supersaturation fluctuations, and it influences
collisional growth indirectly through condensation. Our simulations show for the first time that,
in the absence of the mean updraft cooling, supersaturation fluctuation-induced broadening of
droplet-size distributions enhances the collisional growth. This is contrary to classical (non-turbulent)
condensational growth, which leads to a growing mean droplet size, but a narrower droplet-size
distribution. Our findings, instead, show that condensational growth facilitates collisional
growth by broadening the size distribution in the tails at an early stage of rain formation. With
increasing Reynolds numbers, evaporation becomes stronger. This counteracts the broadening
effect due to condensation at late stages of rain formation. Our conclusions are consistent with
results of laboratory experiments and field observations, and show that supersaturation fluctuations
are important for precipitation.
