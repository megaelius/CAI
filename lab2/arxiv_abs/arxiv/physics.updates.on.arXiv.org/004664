Absorption efficiency profiles and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelengths are
reported for metallic core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) placed over a BK7 glass substrate. A numerical
study is performed with the vectorized version of the discrete dipole approximation with surface
interactions (DDA-SI-v). Gold (Au) and silver (Ag) metallic components are used for the simulations
of two different core-shell structures. Absorption enhancement and the hybrid modes of plasmon
resonances of the core-shell structures are compared by using a measure that defines a size configuration.
It is observed that a small volume fraction of the core sizes results in shell domination over the
plasmon response. An additional study is conducted to discern the sensitivity of the refractive
index of nanoparticles in different surrounding environments. With a selected core-shell size
configuration of Ag-Au pairs, a significant absorption enhancement with a redshift of LSPR wavelength
is observed for both Ag core-Au shell and Au core-Ag shell NPs. The absorption behavior of the bare
metallic NPs and selected core-shell pairs in proximity to an external probe is also analyzed. The
gallium phosphide (GaP) and silicon (Si) AFM tip usage are investigated with transverse electric
(TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) wave polarizations. It is observed that the dominance of light
polarization on the absorption enhancement of the NPs switches at different wavelengths, where
the dielectric transition for tip materials occurs. These findings show the possible targeted
uses of metallic core-shell nanoparticles in several areas such as nanomanufacturing, localized
heating, bio-sensing, and material detection applications.
