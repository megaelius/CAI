We continue our work on the long-range corrected double-hybrid density functionals (LC-DHDFs)
{\omega}B2PLYP and {\omega}B2GP-PLYP that we developed in the context of time-dependent (TD)
Density Functional Theory (DFT) to enable the robust description of singlet-singlet excitations
[J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 4735 (2019)]. In our initial study, we only assessed the impact of a long-range
correction (LC) on BLYP-based DHDFs, and herein we extend our understanding by providing the first
test of PBE-based LC-DHDFs within the established TD-DHDF scheme. Moreover, this study is one of
few that provides a direct comparison between TD-DHDFs and their faster Tamm-Dancoff-Approximation
variants (TDA-DHDFs). Most importantly, this is the first TDA-DHDF study since Grimme and Neese's
TDA-B2PLYP [J. Chem. Phys. 127, 154116 (2007)] and the first work on TD-DHDFs that addresses singlet-triplet
excitations. We show how the difference between TD-DHDFs and TDA-DHDFs is often negligible for
singlet-singlet excitations, but how one has to apply TDA-DHDFs for triplet excitations. For both
excitation types, the LC is beneficial to the BLYP-based DHDFs but detrimental to the PBE-based
ones. For local-valence and Rydberg excitations, {\omega}B2PLYP and {\omega}B2GP-PLYP as well
as the global DHDF PBE-QIDH can be recommended. If a transition exhibits charge-transfer character,
{\omega}B2PLYP and {\omega}B2GP-PLYP should be applied. An analysis of the gaps between the first
singlet and triplet excited states of our systems revealed that there is room for further improvements
to reach better robustness. Until that goal has been achieved, we recommend {\omega}B2PLYP and
{\omega}B2GP-PLYP as some of the currently best TDA-DFT methods.
