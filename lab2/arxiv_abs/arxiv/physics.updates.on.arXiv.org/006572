Purpose: Bowel motion is a source of artifacts in mouse abdominal MRI. The use of fasting and hyoscine
butylbromide (BUSC) for the purpose of bowel motion reduction has been inconsistently reported,
without a thorough assessment of efficacy. This work aimed to better evaluate these methods in the
mouse with high-field MRI. Methods: Thirty-two adult C57BL/6 mice were imaged in a pre-clinical
9.4T MR scanner. A FLASH sequence with 284 repetitions was used, lasting 90 minutes, with a ~19s temporal
resolution. Eight mice were injected with a high-dose and eight mice with a low-dose bolus of BUSC.
Eight mice were food deprived for 4.5-6.5 hours and another group of 8 mice were injected with saline.
Two readers reviewed the images and classified the magnitude of bowel motion during each scan. Also,
the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive images was calculated for 10-11 min intervals
throughout the acquisition and mapped voxelwise for identification of moving regions. After defining
the most effective protocol, high-resolution T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were
acquired to demonstrate its applicability. Results: High-dose BUSC was the most effective protocol
for bowel motion reduction, for up to 45 min. Fasting and saline effects were negligible. The high-resolution
images clearly demonstrate BUSC effectiveness in abdominal MRI. Conclusion: These data favor
the use of BUSC for abdominal MRI in the mouse, when bowel motion reduction is desired, taking into
account the estimated time interval from injection to start of bowel motion reduction (~8.5 minutes)
and duration of effect (~45 minutes).
