JUNO is a multi-purpose neutrino experiment currently under construction in Jiangmen, China.
It is primary aiming to determine the neutrino mass ordering. Moreover, its 20 kt target mass makes
it an ideal detector to study neutrinos from various sources, including nuclear reactors, the Earth
and its atmosphere, the Sun, and even supernovae. Due to the small cross section of neutrino interactions,
the event rate of neutrino experiments is limited. In order to maximize the signal-to noise ratio,
it is extremely important to control the background levels. In this paper we discuss the potential
of particle identification in a large liquid scintillator detector like JUNO. We discuss the underlying
principles of particle identification and its application in the experiment. In order to investigate
the potential of event discrimination, several event pairings are analysed, i.e. alpha/beta?,
e/p?, e+/e-, and e/gamma. We compare the discrimination performance of advanced analytical techniques
based on neural networks and on the topological event reconstruction keeping the standard Gatti
filter as a reference. We use the Monte Carlo samples generated in the physically motivated energy
intervals. We study the dependence of our cuts on energy, radial position, PMT time resolution,
and dark noise. The results show an excellent performance for alpha/beta? and e/p? with the Gatti
method and the neural network. Furthermore, e+/e- and e/gamma can partly be distinguished by means
of neural network and topological reconstruction on a statistical basis. Especially in the latter
case, the topological method proved very successful.
