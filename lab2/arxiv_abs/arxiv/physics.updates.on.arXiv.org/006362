Among the large family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), recently ReS2 has stood out
due to its nearly layer-independent optoelectronic and physicochemical properties. These are
related to its 1T distorted octahedral structure, which leads to strong in-plane anisotropy and
the presence of active sites at its surface, which makes ReS2 interesting for applications such
as gas sensors and catalysts for H2 production. However, the current fabrication methods for ReS2
use chemical or physical vapor deposition (CVD or PVD) processes that are costly and involve complex
and lengthy fabrication procedures, therefore limiting their large-scale production and exploitation.
To address this issue, we developed a colloidal synthesis approach, which allows the production
of ReS2 to be attained at temperatures below 360 Celsius degrees and with reaction times < 2 h, resulting
in a more cost-efficient strategy than the CVD and PVD methods. By combining the solution-based
synthesis with surface functionalization strategies, we demonstrate the feasibility of colloidal
ReS2 nanosheet films for gas sensing of different toxic gases, moisture and other volatile compounds
with highly competitive performance in comparison with devices built with CVD-grown ReS2 and MoS2.
In addition, the integration of the ReS2 nanosheet films in assemblies, in which they are deposited
on top of networks of carbon nanotubes, allowed us to fabricate electrodes for electrocatalysis
for H2 production in both acid and alkaline conditions. Results from proof-of-principle devices
show an electrocatalytic overpotential that is competitive with devices based on ReS2 produced
by CVD, and even with MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2 electrocatalysts.
