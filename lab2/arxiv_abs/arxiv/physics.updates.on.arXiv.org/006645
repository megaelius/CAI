Ultrasonic backscatter communication has gained popularity in recent years with the advent of
deep-tissue sub-mm scale biosensing implants in which piezoceramic (piezo) resonators are used
as acoustic antennas. Miniaturization is a key design goal for such implants to reduce tissue displacement
and enable minimally invasive implantation techniques. Here, we provide a systematic design approach
for the implant piezo geometry and operation frequency to minimize the overall volume of the implant.
Moreover, a critical design aspect of an ultrasonic backscatter communication link is the response
of the piezo acoustic reflection coefficient $\Gamma$ with respect to the variable shunt impedance,
$Z_E$, of the implant uplink modulator. Due to the complexity of the piezo governing equations and
multi-domain, electro-acoustical nature of the piezo, $\Gamma(Z_E)$ has often been characterized
numerically and the implant uplink modulator has been designed empirically resulting in sub-optimal
performance in terms of data rate and linearity. Here, we present a SPICE friendly end-to-end equivalent
circuit model of the channel as a piezo-IC co-simulation tool that incorporates inherent path losses
present in a typical ultrasonic backscatter channel. The circuit model is then used to simulate
the channel transient response in a common CAD tool. To provide further insight into the channel
response, we present experimentally validated closed form expressions for $\Gamma(Z_E)$ under
various boundary conditions. These expressions couple $\Gamma$ to the commonly used Thevenin
equivalent circuit model of the piezo, facilitating systematic design and synthesis of ultrasonic
backscatter uplink modulators
