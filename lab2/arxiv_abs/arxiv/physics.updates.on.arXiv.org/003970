A new deep-learning-based reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework is proposed for application
in subsurface flow simulation. The reduced-order model is based on an existing embed-to-control
(E2C) framework and includes an auto-encoder, which projects the system to a low-dimensional subspace,
and a linear transition model, which approximates the evolution of the system states in low dimension.
In addition to the loss function for data mismatch considered in the original E2C framework, we introduce
a physics-based loss function that penalizes predictions that are inconsistent with the governing
flow equations. The loss function is also modified to emphasize accuracy in key well quantities
of interest (e.g., fluid production rates). The E2C ROM is shown to be very analogous to an existing
ROM, POD-TPWL, which has been extensively developed for subsurface flow simulation. The new ROM
is applied to oil-water flow in a heterogeneous reservoir, with flow driven by nine wells operating
under time-varying control specifications. A total of 300 high-fidelity training simulations
are performed in the offline stage, and the network training requires 10-12~minutes on a Tesla V100
GPU node. Online (runtime) computations achieve speedups of $\mathcal{O}$(1000) relative to
full-order simulations. Extensive test case results, with well controls varied over large ranges,
are presented. Accurate ROM predictions are achieved for global saturation and pressure fields
at particular times, and for injection and production well responses as a function of time. Error
is shown to increase when 100 or 200 (rather than 300) training runs are used to construct the E2C ROM.
