Air travel has become one of the most common means of transportation. The most common question which
is generally asked is: How does an airplane gain lift? And the most common answer is via the Bernoulli
principle. It turns out that it is wrongly applied in common explanations, and there are certain
misconceptions. In an alternative explanation the push of air from below the wing is argued to be
the lift generating force via Newton's law. There are problems with this explanation too. In this
paper we try to clear these misconceptions, and the correct explanation, using the Lancaster-Prandtl
circulation theory, is discussed. We argue that even the Lancaster-Prandtl theory at the zero angle
of attack needs further insights. To this end, we put forward a theory which is applicable at zero
angle of attack. A new length scale perpendicular to the lower surface of the wing is introduced and
it turns out that the ratio of this length scale to the cord length of a wing is roughly $0.4930\pm0.09498$
for typical NACA airfoils that we analyzed. This invariance points to something fundamental. The
idea of our theory is simple. The "squeezing" effect of the flow above the wing due to camber leads
to an effective Venturi tube formation and leads to higher velocity over the upper surface of the
wing and thereby reducing pressure according the Bernoulli theorem and generating lift. Thus at
zero angle of attack there is no need to invoke vortex and anti-vortex pair generation. In fact vortex
and anti-vortex pair generation cannot be justified. We come up with the equation for the lift coefficient
at zero angle of attack: \[C_l = \frac{1}{c}\int_0^c dx \left(\frac{h_c^2}{(h_c - f(x))^2}-1\right).\]
Here $C_l$ is the lift coefficient, $h_c$ is our new length scale perpendicular to the lower surface
of the wing and $f(x)$ is the functional profile of the upper surface of the wing.
