Lipid bilayers composed of non-alpha hydroxy sphingosine ceramide (CER NS), cholesterol (CHOL),
and free fatty acids (FFA), which are components of the human skin barrier, are studied via molecular
dynamics simulations. Since mixtures of these lipids exist in dense gel phases with little molecular
mobility at physiological conditions, care must be taken to ensure that the simulations become
decorrelated from the initial conditions. Thus, we propose and validate an equilibration protocol
based on simulated tempering in which the simulation takes a random walk through temperature space,
allowing the system to break out of metastable configurations and hence become decorrelated form
its initial configuration. After validating the equilibration protocol, the effects of the lipid
composition and ceramide tail length on bilayer properties are studied. Systems containing pure
CER NS, CER NS + CHOL, and CER NS + CHOL + FFA, with the CER fatty acid tail length varied within each CER
NS-CHOL-FFA composition, are simulated. The bilayer thickness is found to depend on the structure
of the center of the bilayer, which arises as a result of the tail length asymmetry between the lipids
studied. The hydrogen bonding between the lipid headgroups and with water is found to change with
the overall lipid composition, but is mostly independent of the CER fatty acid tail length. Subtle
differences in the lateral packing of the lipid tails are also found as a function of CER tail length.
Overall, these results provide insight into the experimentally observed trend of altered barrier
properties in skin systems where there are more ceramides with shorter tails present.
