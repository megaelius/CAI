We developed a CANDLES-III system using 96 CaF$_{2}$ scintillation crystals with a total mass of
305 kg to study the neutrino-less double beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay of $^{48}$Ca. The system
was equipped with a 4$\pi$ active shield using a liquid scintillator to reject external backgrounds.
The internal backgrounds caused by the radioactive impurities within the CaF$_2$ crystals can
be effectively reduced by observing the signal pulse shape. We analyzed the data observed in the
Kamioka underground for the live-time of 130.4 days to evaluate the feasibility of the low background
measurement with the CANDLES-III detector. Moreover, we estimated the number of background events
from the simulation based on the radioactive impurities in the CaF$_{2}$ crystals and the rate of
high energy $\gamma$-rays caused by the (n, $\gamma$) reaction induced by environmental neutrons.
The expected background rate was in a good agreement with the measured rate. In conclusion, the background
candidates were properly estimated by comparing the measured energy spectrum with the background
simulations. Consequently, no events were observed in the Q$_{\beta\beta}$-value region when
21 high purity CaF$_{2}$ crystals were selected. This gave a lower limit on the half-life of T$^{0\nu\beta\beta}_{1/2}$
$\ge$ 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ yr (90\% confidence level) for the 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{48}$Ca.
With this measurement, we achieved the first 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay search in a low background
condition with a detector using a Ca isotope, which was not enriched but natural, in a scale of hundreds
of kg. The $^{48}$Ca isotope has a high potential for the 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay search, and expected
to be useful for the development of the next detector for a highly sensitive measurement.
