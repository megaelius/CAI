How to artificially encode observer in universal information coding structure like DNA ? It requires
naturally creating information Bits and natural encoding triplet code enables recognizing other
encoded information. These Bits become standard units of different information languages in modern
communications. Fundamental interactions build structure of Universe. Numerous multilevel
inter-species interactions selforganize biosystems. Human interactions unify these and many
others. Physical reality is only interactions identified or not yet. Each interaction is elementary
yes-no action of impulse which models a natural Bit. Natural interactive process, transferring
Bits, models information process. Information is universal physical substance a phenomenon of
interaction which not only originates information but transfers it sequentially. Mutually interacting
processes enable creating new elements like chemical chain reactions. The elements enclosing
components of reaction memorize the interactive yes-no result similar to encoding. Energy quantity
and quality of specific interaction determine sequence of transferring information, its encoding,
and limit the code length. The introduced formalism of natural emergence information and its encoding
also shows advantage over non-natural encoding. The impulse sequential natural encoding merges
memory with the time of memorizing information and compensates the cost by running time intervals
of encoding. Information process binds the encoding impulse reversible microprocesses in multiple
impulses macroprocess of information irreversible dynamics establishing interactive integrated
information dynamics. The encoding process integrates geometrical triplet coding structure
rotating double helix of sequencing cells Bits, which commands cognition, intelligence including
conscience. The results validate computer simulation, and experiments.
