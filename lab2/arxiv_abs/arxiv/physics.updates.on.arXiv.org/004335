In order to support students in the development of expertise in quantum mechanics (QM), as well as
to provide insight on teaching, we asked which concepts and structures can act as organizing principles
in basic QM (RQ1). The research question has been addressed in a multi-step process based on the analysis
of categorization studies, on a content analysis of a sample of upper-undergraduate course textbooks
and on the results of existing research on learning difficulties in QM. The answer to RQ1 consists
in seven concept maps, intended as models of the organizing principles of quantum knowledge needed
to account for the results of measurement and time evolution both at a qualitative and quantitative
level. By means of these instruments, it is possible to visualize and explore the different facets
of the interplay of the vector structure of the quantum states and the operator structure of the observables
from a global perspective, and in particular, to highlight the central position of the relations
between observables. The relations provide basic tools for predicting the results of the processes,
and explain how information on measurement and time evolution is encoded in the modulus and in the
phase of the probability amplitudes associated with the representations of the state. Additional
roles of these relations are discussed in the article. At upper-undergraduate level, the maps can
be used by instructors as a support for helping students build a well-organized knowledge structure
and by researchers as a basis for the design of investigations into student understanding. While
they can be adapted to different approaches, we show how this framework provides indications in
favor of a spin-first approach over a waves-first one. At high school level, a simplified version
of the framework has been used as a basis for the design of a teaching-learning sequence.
