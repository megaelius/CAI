We consider the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox in first-quantized quantum mechanics.
If quantum mechanics is augmented by postulating that measurements are not governed by quantum
mechanics but are governed by wavefunction collapse, then we are able to show (using several gedanken
experiments for the system of two particles with entangled 1/2 spins) that a number of fundamental
principles including conservation of angular momentum and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
can be violated. We conclude that a measurement on this system cannot cause the collapse of the spin
part of the wavefunction and therefore an EPR paradox cannot arise for this system. Indeed, we demonstrate
that quantum mechanical unitarity alone is sufficient to rule out "spooky" action at a distance.
The lack of a possible spin wavefunction collapse for the entangled spin-1/2 system leads to several
interesting conclusions about how measurement works in first-quantized quantum mechanics: When
Copenhagen wavefunction collapse does not happen, (i) a signal from a macroscopic measuring devices
indicating that a system is in a state S does not necessarily mean that the it is or was in S and (ii) the
uncertainty in quantum mechanics at the microscopic level is transmitted to uncertainty in signals
for the macroscopic measuring device. We illustrate these statements using Stern-Gerlach to measure
spin. For this framework to work, nonlinearities need to be present in quantum mechanics. However,
such nonlinearities do not need to be introduced "by hand": Feedback effects due to interactions
of two or more quantum objects naturally lead to them. These nonlinear effects are expected to be
greatest when large numbers of quantum entities interact, which is precisely the situation for
macroscopic measuring devices.
