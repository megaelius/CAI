Magnetospheric ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves contribute to space weather in the solar wind -
magnetosphere - ionosphere system. The monitoring of these waves by space- and ground-based instruments,
however, produces "big data" which is difficult to navigate, mine and analyse effectively. We present
sonification, the process of converting an oscillatory time-series into audible sound, and citizen
science, where members of the public contribute to scientific investigations, as a means to potentially
help tackle these issues. Magnetometer data in the ULF range at geostationary orbit has been sonified
and released to London high schools as part of exploratory projects. While this approach reduces
the overall likelihood of useful results from any particular group of citizen scientists compared
to typical citizen science projects, it promotes independent learning and problem solving by all
participants and can result in a small number of unexpected research outcomes. We present one such
example, a case study identified by a group of students -of decreasing-frequency poloidal field
line resonances over multiple days found to occur during the recovery phase of a CME-driven geomagnetic
storm. Simultaneous plasma density measurements show that the decreasing frequencies were due
to the refilling of the plasmasphere following the storm. The waves were likely generated by internal
plasma processes. Further exploration of the audio revealed many similar events following other
major storms, thus they are much more common than previously thought. We therefore highlight the
potential of sonification and exploratory citizen science in addressing some of the challenges
facing ULF wave research.
