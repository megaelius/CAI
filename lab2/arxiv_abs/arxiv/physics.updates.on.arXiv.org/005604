A fundamental understanding of the evaporation/condensation phenomena is vital to many fields
of science and engineering, yet there is much discrepancy in the usage of phase change models and
associated coefficients. We review kinetic theory of phase change from a fundamental standpoint
and discuss the controversial mass accommodation coefficient, MAC ($\alpha$), and its inconsistent
definitions. The discussion focuses on the departure from equilibrium; represented as a macroscopic
drift velocity. Constructing a continuous flow, phase change driven molecular dynamics setup,
we investigate the steady state condensation at a flat liquid-vapor interface of Argon at various
heating rates and temperatures. We calculate a value of MAC directly from the kinetic theory based
Hertz-Knudsen (H-K) and Schrage expressions without the need for a priori physical definitions,
ad hoc particle injection/removal or particle counting. MAC values from the approximate and exact
Schrage expressions ($\alpha_{app}^{Schrage}$ and $\alpha_{exact}^{Schrage}$ ) are between
0.8 and 0.9 while MAC values from the H-K expression ($\alpha^{H-K}$) was surprisingly above unity
for all cases tested. All values of MAC reduce with saturation temperature in a manner consistent
with prior studies. $\alpha_{exact}^{Schrage}$ yields values closest to the results from transition
state theory [J Chem Phys, 118, 1392-1399 (2003)]. The departure from equilibrium (drift velocity,
phase change rate) does not affect the value of $\alpha_{exact}^{Schrage}$ but causes $\alpha^{H-K}$
to vary drastically giving rise to the need for a velocity dependent correction. MAC values greater
than unity violate conservation laws within the purview of commonly used physical definitions.
Between multiple kinetic theory models and definitions, MAC values are not universal and cannot
be interchangeably without appropriate correction factors.
