Here we report results from fully-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and present the calculated
binding free energies of the associations between metal cations and anionic functional groups
under brine condition. Specifically the ion pair formations of Na+ and Ca2+ metal cations with sulfonate
and carboxylate functional groups were considered. In our simulations, sulfonate and carboxylate
functional groups in polyelectrolytes were modeled by mesylate and acetate anions, respectively.
The simulations show that the binding strengths of Na+ and Ca2+ with sulfonate group are relatively
weak with correlation times for the contact ion pairs being around 300-400 ps. In the case of acetate,
the binding strength with Na+ was found to be comparable to the case of sulfonate group, while the
binding of acetate with Ca2+ was found to be much stronger with a correlation time of the order of hundreds
of nanoseconds. The binding free energies of Na+ and Ca2+ with sulfonate as well as that of Na+ with
acetate have been calculated directly from the radial distribution functions. For the case of binding
between Ca2+ and acetate constrained MD simulations with umbrella sampling were carried out to
improve the sampling of the phase space and the potential of mean force was obtained by the weighted
histogram analysis method. The binding free energy of a 2:1 binding event between one Ca2+ ion and
two acetates was also calculated. Finally the binding free energies between Ca2+ and acetate were
compared for different force field parameters and water models, and also with experimental and
calculated values reported in the literature.
