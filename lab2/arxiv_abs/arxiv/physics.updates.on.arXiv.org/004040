Computer-assisted modelling is an essential approach to design new devices. It speeds up the process
from the initial idea to an actual device and saves resources by reducing the number of built prototypes.
This is also a significant practical motivator behind scientific research in contemporary high-temperature
superconductor (HTS) AC loss modelling. However, in the scientific literature in this field, consistent
practices about modelling terminology have not been established. Then, it is up to the reader to
decide, what is the true intent and meaning of the authors. Consequently, the interpretation of
such literature might be very much reader-dependent. Moreover, an inseparable part of the whole
modelling process is the development of modelling approaches and numerical methods and comparing
the predictions obtained via modelling to experimentally achieved results: It is commonplace
to discuss the accuracy of modelling results or the validation of a model. In this paper, we discuss
the terminology related to theories, models and experiments in the context of HTS AC loss modelling.
We discuss the recursive nature of theories and models in this context, discuss the compatibility
of discrete formulations of physics utilized in our field with the corresponding continuum descriptions,
as well as with intuition, and interpret the perceived meaning of validation of a self-consistent
model, shedding light on the relationships between theories, models and measurements. We present
our view on understanding these relations in the familiar context of AC losses in HTS. As a result,
we end this paper with four conjectures describing our views.
