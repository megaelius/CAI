We consider the radiation properties and processes of a gas with a population inversion using the
formalism based on the Maxwell-Bloch equations. We focus on the maser action and Dicke's superradiance
to establish their relationship in the overall radiation process during the temporal evolution
of the system as a function of position. We show that the maser action and superradiance are not competing
phenomena but are rather complementary, and define two distinct limits for the intensity of radiation.
Masers characterise the quasi-steady state limit, when the population inversion density and the
polarisation amplitude vary on time-scales longer than those of non-coherent processes affecting
their evolution (e.g., collisions), while superradiance defines the fast transient regime taking
place when these conditions are reversed. We show how a transition from a maser regime to superradiance
will take place whenever a critical threshold for the column density of the population inversion
is reached, at which point a strong level of coherence is established in the system and a powerful
burst of radiation can ensue during the transient regime. This critical level also determines the
spatial region where a transition from the unsaturated to the saturated maser regimes will take
place; superradiance can thus be seen as the intermediary between the two. We also quantify the gain
in radiation intensity attained during the superradiance phase relative to the two maser regimes,
and show how the strong coherence level during superradiance is well suited to explain observations
that reveal intense and fast radiation flares in maser-hosting regions.
