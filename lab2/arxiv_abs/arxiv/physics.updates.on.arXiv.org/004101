Aerodynamic pressure field over bluff bodies immersed in boundary layer flows is correlated both
in space and time. Conventional approaches for the analysis of distributed aerodynamic pressures,
e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), can only offer relevant spatial patterns in a
set of coherent structures. This study provides an operator-theoretic approach that describes
dynamic pressure fields in a functional space rather than conventional phase space via the Koopman
operator. Subsequently, spectral analysis of the Koopman operator provides a spatiotemporal
characterization of the pressure field. An augmented dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method
is proposed to perform the spectral decomposition. The augmentation is achieved by the use of the
Takens's embedding theorem, where time delay coordinates are considered. Consequently, the identified
eigen-tuples (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and time evolution) can capture not only dominant spatial
structures but also identify each structure with a specific frequency and a corresponding temporal
growth/decay. This study encompasses learning the evolution dynamics of the random aerodynamic
pressure field over a scaled model of a finite height prism using limited wind tunnel data. The POD
analysis of the experimental data was also carried out. To demonstrate the unique feature of the
proposed approach, the DMD and POD based learning results including algorithm convergence, data
sufficiency, and modal analysis are examined. The ensuing observations offer a glimpse of the complex
dynamics of the surface pressure field over bluff bodies that lends insights to features previously
masked by conventional analysis approaches.
