Recent calculations of nuclear structure corrections to the Lamb shift in light muonic atoms are
based on an expansion in a parameter eta, where only terms up to second order are retained. The parameter
eta can be shown to be proportional to the square root of the muon/proton mass ratio, so that it is small
and the expansion is expected to converge. However, practical implementations show that the eta
convergence may be slower than expected. In this work we probe the uncertainties due to this expansion
using a different formalism, which is based on a multipole expansion of the longitudinal and transverse
response functions and was first introduced by Leidemann and Rosenfelder. We refer to this alternative
expansion as the eta-less formalism. We generalize this formalism to account for the cancellation
of elastic terms such as the third Zemach moment (or Friar moment) and embed it in a computationally
efficient framework. We implement and test this approach in the case of muonic deuterium. The comparison
of results in the point nucleon limit for both methods achieve sub-percent agreement. When nucleon
form factors are introduced we find a 4% and 2% difference in the third Zemach moment and nuclear polarizability,
respectively, compared to the eta-less expansion, indicating that the nucleon form factor approximations
should be improved. However, we find that the sum of these terms removes this dependence and the uncertainty
due to the eta-expansion and the related second-order approximation in the nucleon form factors
amounts only to 0.2% and thus is fully justified in muonic deuterium. This computationally efficient
framework paves the way to further studies in light muonic systems with more than two nucleons, where
controlling and reducing uncertainties in nuclear structure corrections is key to the experimental
efforts of the CREMA collaboration.
