The estimate of individual wave run-up is especially important for tsunami warning and risk assessment
as it allows to evaluate the inundation area. Here as a model of tsunami we use the long single wave
of positive polarity. The period of such wave is rather long which makes it different from the famous
Korteweg-de Vries soliton. This wave nonlinearly deforms during its propagation in the ocean,
what results in a steep wave front formation. Situations, when waves approach the coast with a steep
front are often observed during large tsunamis, e.g. 2004 Indian Ocean and 2011 15 Tohoku tsunamis.
Here we study the nonlinear deformation and run-up of long single waves of positive polarity in the
conjoined water basin, which consists of the constant depth section and a plane beach. The work is
performed numerically and analytically in the framework of the nonlinear shallow water theory.
Analytically, wave propagation along the constant depth section and its run-up on a beach are considered
independently without taking into account wave interaction with the toe of the bottom slope. The
propagation along the bottom of constant depth is described by Riemann wave, while the wave 20 run-up
on a plane beach is calculated using rigorous analytical solutions of the nonlinear shallow water
theory following the Carrier-Greenspan approach. Numerically, we use the finite volume method
with the second order UNO2 reconstruction in space and the third order Runge-Kutta scheme with locally
adaptive time steps. During wave propagation along the constant depth section, the wave becomes
asymmetric with a steep wave front. Shown, that the maximum run-up height depends on the front steepness
of the incoming wave approaching the toe of the bottom slope. The corresponding formula for maximum
25 run-up height, which takes into account the wave front steepness, is proposed.
