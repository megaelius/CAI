We investigate the atmospheric dynamics of terrestrial planets in synchronous rotation within
the habitable zone of low-mass stars using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). The surface temperature
contrast between day and night hemispheres decreases with an increase in incident stellar flux,
which is opposite the trend seen on gas giants. We define three dynamical regimes in terms of the equatorial
Rossby deformation radius and the Rhines length. The slow rotation regime has a mean zonal circulation
that spans from day to night side, with both the Rossby deformation radius and the Rhines length exceeding
planetary radius, which occurs for planets around stars with effective temperatures of 3300 K to
4500 K (rotation period > 20 days). Rapid rotators have a mean zonal circulation that partially spans
a hemisphere and with banded cloud formation beneath the substellar point, with the Rossby deformation
radius is less than planetary radius, which occurs for planets orbiting stars with effective temperatures
of less than 3000 K (rotation period < 5 days). In between is the Rhines rotation regime, which retains
a thermally-direct circulation from day to night side but also features midlatitude turbulence-driven
zonal jets. Rhines rotators occur for planets around stars in the range of 3000 K to 3300 K (rotation
period ~ 5 to 20 days), where the Rhines length is greater than planetary radius but the Rossby deformation
radius is less than planetary radius. The dynamical state can be observationally inferred from
comparing the morphology of the thermal emission phase curves of synchronously rotating planets.
