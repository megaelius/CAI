In this work we present a solution of the one-dimensional spherical symmetric time-dependent neutron
transport equation (written for a moving system in lagrangian coordinates) by using the characteristic
method. One of the objectives is to overcome the negative flux problem that arises when the system
is very opaque and the angular neutron flux can become negative when it is extrapolated in spatial
meshes --- as, for example, in diamond scheme adopted in many codes. Although there are recipes to
overcome this problem, it can completely degrade the numerical solution if repeated many times.
The solution presented here can be easily coupled to radiation-hydrodynamics equations, but it
is necessary an additional term to maintain neutron conservation in a moving system in lagrangian
coordinates. Energy multigroup method and a former SN method to deal with the angular variable are
used, with the assumption of isotropic scattering and the transport cross sections approximation.
An artifice is employed for emulating the neutron upscattering when neutron energy is lower than
the temperature of the medium. The consistency of the numerical solution is checked by making at
each time-step the balance of neutrons in the system. Two examples of applications are shown using
a neutronic-radiation-hydrodynamic code to which the solution here presented was incorporated:
one consists of a heterogeneous pellet of DT (deuterium-tritium) tamped by an highly-enriched
uranium or plutonium (a symbiotic fusion-fission system); and the other is a very complex and also
a symbiotic fission-fusion-fission system composed by layers of the thermonuclear fuels LiDT,
LiD and a highly-supercritical fission fuel. The last is considered an extreme case for testing
the time-dependent neutron transport solution presented here.
