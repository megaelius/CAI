Soft elastic composite materials containing particulate rigid inclusions in a soft elastic matrix
are candidates for developing soft actuators or tunable damping devices. The possibility to reversibly
drive the rigid inclusions within such a composite together to a close-to-touching state by an external
stimulus would offer important benefits. Then, a significant tuning of the mechanical properties
could be achieved due to the resulting mechanical hardening. For a long time, it has been argued whether
a virtual touching of the embedded magnetic particles with subsequent detachment can actually
be observed in real materials, and if so, whether the process is reversible. Here, we present experimental
results that demonstrate this phenomenon in reality. Our system consists of two paramagnetic nickel
particles embedded at finite initial distance in a soft elastic polymeric gel matrix. Magnetization
in an external magnetic field tunes the magnetic attraction between the particles and drives the
process. We quantify the scenario by different theoretical tools, i.e., explicit analytical calculations
in the framework of linear elasticity theory, a projection onto simplified dipole-spring models,
as well as detailed finite-element simulations. From these different approaches, we conclude
that in our case the cycle of virtual touching and detachment shows hysteretic behavior due to the
mutual magnetization between the paramagnetic particles. Our results are important for the design
and construction of reversibly tunable mechanical damping devices. Moreover, our projection
on dipole-spring models allows the formal connection of our description to various related systems,
e.g., magnetosome filaments in magnetotactic bacteria.
