In this work, we investigate the dynamics of vortex-induced vibration of an elastically mounted
cylinder with very low values of mass and damping. We use two methods to investigate this canonical
problem: first we calculate the instantaneous phase between the cylinder motion and the fluid forcing;
second we decompose the total hydrodynamic force into drag and lift components that act along and
normal to, respectively, the instantaneous effective angle of attack. We focus on the phase dynamics
in the large-amplitude-response range, consisting of the initial, upper and lower branches of
response. The instantaneous phase between the transverse force and displacement shows repeated
phase slips separating periods of constant, or continuous-drifting, phase in the second half of
the upper branch. The phase between the lift component and displacement shows strong phase locking
throughout the large-amplitude range - the average phase varies linearly with the primary frequency
- however the modulation of this phase is largest in the second half of the upper branch. These observations
suggest that the large-amplitude-response dynamics is driven by two distinct limit cycles - one
that is stable over a very small range of reduced velocity at the beginning of the upper branch, and
another that consists of the lower branch. The chaotic oscillation between them - the majority of
the upper branch - occurs when neither limit cycle is stable. The transition between the upper and
lower branches is marked by intermittent switching with epochs of time where different states exist
at a constant reduced velocity. These different states are clearly apparent in the phase between
the lift and displacement, illustrating the utility of the force decomposition employed.
