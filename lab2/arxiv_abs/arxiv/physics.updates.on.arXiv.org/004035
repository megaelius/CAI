In materials science and related fields, small datasets ($\ll1000$ samples) are common. Our ability
to characterize compounds is therefore highly dependent on our theoretical and empirical knowledge,
as our aptitude to develop efficient human-engineered descriptors, when it comes to use conventional
machine learning algorithms to infer their physicochemical properties. Additionally, deep learning
techniques are often neglected in this case due to the common acceptance that a lot of data samples
are needed. In this article, we tackle the data scarcity of molecular compounds paired to their physicochemical
properties, and the difficulty to develop novel task-specific descriptors, by proposing the SMILES-X.
The SMILES-X is an autonomous pipeline for the characterization of molecular compounds based on
a \{Embed-Encode-Attend-Predict\} neural architecture processing textual data, a data-specific
Bayesian optimization of its hyper-parameters, and an augmentation of small datasets naturally
coming from the non-canonical SMILES format. The SMILES-X shows new state-of-the-art results
in the inference of aqueous solubility ($\overline{RMSE}_{test} \simeq 0.57 \pm 0.07$ mols/L),
hydration free energy ($\overline{RMSE}_{test} \simeq 0.81 \pm 0.22$ kcal/mol, $\sim 24.5\%$
better than from molecular dynamics simulations), and octanol/water distribution coefficient
($\overline{RMSE}_{test} \simeq 0.59 \pm 0.02$ for LogD at pH 7.4) of molecular compounds. The
SMILES-X is intended to become an important asset in the toolkit of materials scientists and chemists
for autonomously characterizing molecular compounds, and for improving a task-specific knowledge
through hereby proposed interpretations of the outcomes. The source code for the SMILES-X is available
