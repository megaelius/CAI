Whether listening to overlapping conversations in a crowded room or recording the simultaneous
electrical activity of millions of neurons, the natural world abounds with sparse measurements
of complex overlapping signals that arise from dynamical processes. While tools that separate
mixed signals into linear sources have proven necessary and useful, the underlying equational
forms of most natural signals are unknown and nonlinear. Hence, there is a need for a framework that
is general enough to extract sources without knowledge of their generating equations, and flexible
enough to accommodate nonlinear, even chaotic, sources. Here we provide such a framework, where
the sources are chaotic trajectories from independently evolving dynamical systems. We consider
the mixture signal as the sum of two chaotic trajectories, and propose a supervised learning scheme
that extracts the chaotic trajectories from their mixture. Specifically, we recruit a complex
dynamical system as an intermediate processor that is constantly driven by the mixture. We then
obtain the separated chaotic trajectories based on this intermediate system by training the proper
output functions. To demonstrate the generalizability of this framework \emph{in silico}, we
employ a tank of water as the intermediate system, and show its success in separating two-part mixtures
of various chaotic trajectories. Finally, we relate the underlying mechanism of this method to
the state-observer problem. This relation provides a quantitative theory that explains the performance
of our method, such as why separation is difficult when two source signals are trajectories from
the same chaotic system.
