Expressing the evolution equations for the filtered velocity gradient tensor (FVGT) in the strain-rate
eigenframe provides an insightful way to disentangle and understand various processes such as
strain self-amplification, vortex stretching and tilting, and to consider their properties at
different scales in the flow. Using data from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the forced Navier-Stokes
equation, we consider the relative importance of local and non-local terms in the FVGT eigenframe
equations across the scales using statistical analysis. The analysis of the eigenframe rotation-rate,
that drives vorticity tilting, shows that the anisotropic pressure Hessian plays a key role, with
the sub-grid stress making an important contribution outside the dissipation range, and the local
spinning due to vorticity making a much smaller contribution. The results also show the striking
behavior that the vorticity tilting term remains highly intermittent even at relatively large
scales. We derive a generalization of the Lumley triangle that allows us to show that the pressure
Hessian has a preference for two-component axisymmetric configurations at small scales, with
a transition to a more isotropic state at larger scales. Correlations between the sub-grid stress
and other terms in the eigenframe equations are considered, highlighting the coupling between
the sub-grid and nonlinear amplification terms, with the sub-grid term playing an important role
in regularizing the system. These results provide useful guidelines for improving Lagrangian
models of the FVGT, since current models fail to capture a number of subtle features observed in our
results.
