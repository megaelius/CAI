Terahertz (THz) and sub-THz frequency emitter and detector technologies are receiving increasing
attention, underpinned by emerging applications in ultra-fast THz physics, frequency-combs
technology and pulsed laser development in this relatively unexplored region of the electromagnetic
spectrum. In particular, semiconductor-based ultrafast THz receivers are required for compact,
ultrafast spectroscopy and communication systems, and to date, quantum well infrared photodetectors
(QWIPs) have proved to be an excellent technology to address this given their intrinsic ps-range
response However, with research focused on diffraction-limited QWIP structures (lambda/2),
RC constants cannot be reduced indefinitely, and detection speeds are bound to eventually meet
un upper limit. The key to an ultra-fast response with no intrinsic upper limit even at tens of GHz
is an aggressive reduction in device size, below the diffraction limit. Here we demonstrate sub-wavelength
(lambda/10) THz QWIP detectors based on a 3D split-ring geometry, yielding ultra-fast operation
at a wavelength of around 100 {\mu}m. Each sensing meta-atom pixel features a suspended loop antenna
that feeds THz radiation in the ~20 m3 active volume. Arrays of detectors as well as single-pixel
detectors have been implemented with this new architecture, with the latter exhibiting ultra-low
dark currents below the nA level. This extremely small resonator architecture leads to measured
optical response speeds - on arrays of 300 devices - of up to ~3 GHz and an expected device operation
of up to tens of GHz, based on the measured S-parameters on single devices and arrays.
