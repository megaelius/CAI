Collective cell migration contributes to morphogenesis, wound healing or tumor metastasis. Culturing
epithelial monolayers on a substrate enables to quantify such tissue migration. By using narrow
strips, we stabilise the front shape; by inhibiting cell division, we limit density increase and
favor steady migration; by using long strips, we observe a confined cell monolayer migrating over
days. A coherent collective movement propagates over millimeters; cells spread and density decreases
from the monolayer bulk toward the front. Cell velocity ($\sim$micrometer per minute) increases
linearly with cell radius, and does not depend explicitly on the distance to the front. Over ten periods
of backwards propagating velocity waves, with wavelength $\sim$millimeter, are detected with
a signal-to-noise ratio enabling for quantitative spatio-temporal analysis. Their velocity
($\sim$ten micrometers per minute) is ten times the cell velocity; it increases linearly with the
cell radius. Their period ($\sim$two hours) is spatially homogeneous, and increases with the front
density. When we inhibit the formation of lamellipodia, cell velocity drops while waves either
disappear, or have a smaller amplitude and slower period. Our phenomenological model assumes that
both cell and wave velocities are related with the activity of lamellipodia, and that the local stretching
in the monolayer bulk modulates traction stresses. We find that parameter values close to the instability
limit where waves appear yield qualitative and quantitative predictions compatible with experiments,
including the facts that: waves propagate backwards; wave velocity increases with cell radius;
lamellipodia inhibition attenuates, slows down or even suppresses the waves. Together, our experiments
and modelling evidence the importance of lamellipodia in collective cell migration and waves.
