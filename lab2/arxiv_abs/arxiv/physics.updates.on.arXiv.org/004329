We perform two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in magnetically dominated
electron-positron plasmas subject to strong Compton cooling. Magnetic reconnection under such
conditions can operate in accretion disk coronae around black holes, which produce hard X-rays
through Comptonization. Our simulations show that most of the plasma in the reconnection layer
is kept cold by Compton losses and locked in magnetically dominated plasmoids with a small thermal
pressure. Compton drag clears cavities inside plasmoids and also affects their bulk motions. These
effects, however, weakly change the reconnection rate and the plasmoid size distribution from
those in non-radiative reconnection. This demonstrates that the reconnection dynamics is governed
by similar magnetic stresses in both cases and weakly affected by thermal pressure. We examine the
energy distribution of particles energized by radiative reconnection and observe two distinct
components. (1) A mildly relativistic peak, which results from bulk motions of cooled plasmoids.
This component receives most of the reconnection power and dominates the output X-ray emission.
The peak has a quasi-Maxwellian shape with an effective temperature of ~100 keV. Thus, it mimics
thermal Comptonization used previously to fit hard-state spectra of accreting black holes. (2)
A high-energy tail, which receives ~20% of the reconnection power. It is populated by particles
accelerated impulsively at X-points or "picked up" by fast outflows from X-points. The high-energy
particles immediately cool, and their inverse Compton emission explains the MeV spectral tail
detected in the hard state of Cyg X-1. Our first-principle simulations support magnetic reconnection
as a mechanism powering hard X-ray emission from accreting black holes.
