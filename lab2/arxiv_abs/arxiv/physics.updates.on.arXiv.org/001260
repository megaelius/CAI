Current and future experiments with antihydrogen ($\overline{\text{H}}$) for a study of matter--antimatter
(CPT) symmetry and antimatter gravity require ultracold $\overline{\text{H}}$ in order to reach
ultimate levels of precision. A promising path towards the production of anti-atoms much colder
than a few kelvin involves the pre-cooling of antiprotons by laser-cooled anions. Due to the unusual
binding of the valence electron in anions -- dominated by polarization and correlation effects
-- only few candidate systems with bound--bound transitions suitable for laser cooling exist.
We report on a combination of experimental and theoretical studies to fully determine the relevant
binding energies, transition rates and branching ratios of the most promising candidate La$^{-}$.
Using a combination of transverse and collinear laser spectroscopy, we determined the resonant
frequency of the laser cooling transition to be 96.592713(91) THz and the transition rate of its
highest-intensity hyperfine component to be $A = 4.90(50) \times 10^{4}$ s$^{-1}$. We developed
a novel relativistic high-precision theoretical treatment of the La$^-$ ion and demonstrate a
drastic improvement of theoretical accuracy. Values of yet unmeasured energy levels, transition
rates, branching ratios, and level lifetimes calculated in this work complement experimental
information on the laser cooling cycle of La$^-$. The new data establish the suitability of La$^-$
for laser cooling and show that the cooling transition is significantly, by a factor $\approx$50\%,
stronger than previously assumed. Unwanted branching to other decay channels is negligible and
can easily be repumped if necessary. Present theoretical methodology may be applied to other negative
ions.
