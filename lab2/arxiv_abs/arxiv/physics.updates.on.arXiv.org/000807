Harnessing short-lived photoexcited electron-hole pairs in metal nanostructures has the potential
to define a new phase of optoelectronics, enabling control of athermal mechanisms for light harvesting,
photodetection and photocatalysis. To date, however, the spatiotemporal dynamics and transport
of these photoexcited carriers have been only qualitatively characterized. Plasmon excitation
has been widely viewed as an efficient mechanism for generating non-thermal hot carriers. Despite
numerous experiments, conclusive evidence elucidating and quantifying the full dynamics of hot
carrier generation, transport, and injection has not been reported. Here, we combine experimental
measurements with coupled first-principles electronic structure theory and Boltzmann transport
calculations to provide unprecedented insight into the internal quantum efficiency, and hence
internal physics, of hot carriers in photoexcited gold (Au)-gallium nitride (GaN) nanostructures.
Our results indicate that photoexcited electrons generated in 20 nm-thick Au nanostructures impinge
ballistically on the Au-GaN interface. This discovery suggests that the energy of hot carriers
could be harnessed from metal nanostructures without substantial losses via thermalization.
Measurements and calculations also reveal the important role of metal band structure in hot carrier
generation at energies above the interband threshold of the plasmonic nanoantenna. Taken together,
our results advance the understanding of excited carrier dynamics in realistically-scaled metallic
nanostructures and lay the foundations for the design of new optoelectronic devices that operate
in the ballistic regime.
