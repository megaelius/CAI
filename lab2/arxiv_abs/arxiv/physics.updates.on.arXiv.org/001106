The importance of electrostatic interactions in soft matter and biological systems can often be
traced to non-uniform charge effects, which are commonly described using a multipole expansion
of the corresponding charge distribution. The standard approach when extracting the charge distribution
of a given system is to treat the constituent charges as points. This can, however, lead to an overestimation
of multipole moments of high order, such as dipole, quadrupole, and higher moments. Focusing on
distributions of charges located on a spherical surface -- characteristic of numerous biological
macromolecules, such as globular proteins and viral capsids, as well as of inverse patchy colloids
-- we develop a novel way of representing spherical surface charge distributions based on the von
Mises-Fisher distribution. This approach takes into account the finite spatial extension of individual
charges, and leads to a simple yet powerful way of describing surface charge distributions and their
multipole expansions. In this manner, we analyze charge distributions and the derived multipole
moments of a number of different spherical configurations of identical charges with various degrees
of symmetry. We show how the number of charges, their size, and the geometry of their configuration
influence the behavior and relative importance of multipole magnitudes of different order. Importantly,
we clearly demonstrate how neglecting the effect of charge size leads to an overestimation of high-order
multipoles. The results of our work can be applied to construct analytical models of electrostatic
interactions and multipole expansion of charged particles in diverse soft matter and biological
systems.
