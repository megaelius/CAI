The physical mechanism underlying the voltage-dependent gating of K channels is usually addressed
theoretically using molecular dynamics simulations.However, besides being computationally
very expensive, this approach is presently unable to fully predict the behavior of fundamental
variables of channel gating, such as the macroscopic gating current.To fill this gap here we propose
a voltage gating model that treats the S4 segment as a Brownian particle moving through a gating channel
pore and adjacent internal and external vestibules.In our model charges on the S4 segment are screened
by charged residues localized on the other segments of the channel protein, and by ions present in
the vestibules, whose dynamics is assessed using a flux conservation equation. The electrostatic
voltage spatial profile is consistently assessed by applying the Poisson equation to all the charges
present in the system. The treatment of the S4 segment as a Brownian particle allows to alternatively
describe the dynamics of a single S4 segment, using the Langevin stochastic differential equation,
or the behavior of a population of S4 segments, useful to assess the macroscopic gating current,
using the Fokker-Planck equation. The proposed model confirms the gating charge transfer hypothesis,
with the movement of the S4 segment among 5 different stable positions where the gating charges differently
interact with the negatively charged residues on the channel protein. This behavior results in
macroscopic gating currents displaying properties quite similar to those experimentally found,
including a very fast component followed by a slower one with an evident rising phase at high depolarizing
voltages.
