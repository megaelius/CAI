The current work presents a realizable method to control streaky disturbances in boundary layer
flows and delay transition to turbulence via active flow control. Numerical simulations of the
nonlinear transitional regime in a Blasius boundary layer are performed where streaks are excited
in the boundary layer via a high level of free-stream turbulence (FST). The occurring disturbances
are measured via localized wall sensors and damped via near-wall actuators resembling plasma actuators.
The time-varying amplitude of the signal of each actuator is computed by processing signals from
the sensors. This processing is the result of two control laws: the Linear Quadratic Gaussian regulator
(LQG) and the Inverse Feed-Forward Control technique (IFFC). The use of the first, LQG, requires
a state-space representation of the system dynamics, so the flow is described via an operator that
captures only the most relevant information of the dynamics and results in a reduced order model
(ROM). The ROM is computed via the eigensystem realization algorithm, based on the impulse responses
of the real system. Collecting such impulse responses may be unfeasible when considering FST because
of the high dimensionality of the input forcing needed for a precise description of such a phenomenon.
Here, a new method to identify the relevant system dynamics and generate the needed impulse responses
is proposed, in a data-driven approach that would be realizable in experiments. Finally, the effectiveness
of the technique in delaying bypass transition is shown. The work (i) presents a systematic way to
deal with high dimensional disturbances to build ROMs for a control technique, and (ii) shows that
even when considering constraints such as the type and size of actuators and sensors, it is possible
to achieve at least as large delay of bypass transition as that obtained in more idealized cases found
in literature.
