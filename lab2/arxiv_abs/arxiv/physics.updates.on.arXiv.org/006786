Nonreciprocity and nonreciprocal optical devices play a vital role in modern photonic technologies
by enforcing one-way propagation of light. Most nonreciprocal devices today are made from a special
class of low-loss ferrites that exhibit a magneto-optical response in the presence of an external
static magnetic field. While breaking transmission symmetry, ferrites fail to satisfy the need
for miniaturization of photonic circuitry due to weak character of nonreciprocal responses at
optical wavelengths and are not easy to integrate into on-chip photonic systems. These challenges
led to the emergence of magnetic-free approaches relying on breaking time reversal symmetry, e.g.
with nonlinear effects modulating optical system in time. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical
approach to nonreciprocity based on nonlinear valley-selective response in transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs). This approach overcomes the limitations of magnetic materials and it
does not require an external magnetic field. We provide experimental evidence of photoinduced
nonreciprocity in a monolayer WS2 pumped by circularly polarized light. Nonreciprocity stems
from valley-selective exciton-exciton interactions, giving rise to nonlinear circular dichroism
controlled by circularly polarized pump fields. Our experimental results reveal a significant
effect even at room temperature, despite considerable intervalley-scattering, showing potential
for practical applications in magnetic-free nonreciprocal platforms. As an example, we propose
a device scheme to realize an optical isolator based on a pass-through silicon nitride (SiN) ring
resonator integrating the optically biased TMD monolayer.
