Gravitational waves (GWs, from binary merger) interacting with ultra-strong magnetic fields
of neutron star in the same binary system, would lead to perturbed electromagnetic waves [EMWs,
in the same frequencies of these GWs, usually categorized into super-low-frequency (SLF) band
for the EMWs]. The generation of such perturbed SLF-EMWs is calculated, and strengths of their magnetic
components are estimated to be around 10^-14 Tesla to 10^-18 Tesla near the Earth. Characteristic
waveforms of such perturbed SLF-EMWs are presented, which would be modified into shapes different
but related to the waveforms of the GWs, due to the amplification process during binary merger which
could amplify the magnetic fields into 10^12Tesla or higher. Particular polarizations of the perturbed
SLF-EMWs are addressed, with specific connection relationship to the tensorial and nontensorial
polarizations of the GWs of binary mergers. With helps of the characteristic waveforms and particular
polarizations, these weak SLF-EMWs would be observable by very fast developing cutting-edge techniques
of high sensitive SLF detectors and magnetometers (have already been widely used for submarine
communication, earthquake forecasting and mining, etc) aiming at sensitivities approaching
atto-Tesla (10^-18T) levels. The perturbed SLF-EMWs are not only the signals, but also a new type
of special EM counterparts of the GWs with very different properties to usual EM counterparts, e.g.
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). If these SLF-EMWs can be observed, such a potential way of detection for
GWs from binary mergers would bring us some different new information of fundamental properties
of the gravity and Universe that perhaps other GW detectors may not provide.
