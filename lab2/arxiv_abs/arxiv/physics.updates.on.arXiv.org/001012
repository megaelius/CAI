We get point vortices dynamics equations on a rotating sphere surface directly from the hydrodynamic
equations as representing their weak exact solution contrary to the conventional case of the use
of a kinematic relationship between a given singular vortex field and velocity field. It is first
time that the effect of a sphere rotation on the vortices interaction is accounted for in exact form.
We show that only the stream function of a vortex pair of antipodal vortices (APV), and only it satisfies
the original three-dimensional hydrodynamics equations on a sphere. We prove that only APV pair
with two point vortices in the diameter-conjugated points of a sphere with equal by quantity but
different sign circulations may be correctly considered as an elementary (stationary, not self-affecting)
singular point object on a sphere. We suggest using the axis connecting the two point vortices in
an APV for describing of an axis of rotation of the global vortices introduced in (Barrett, 1958)
to reflect the observed global rotation of atmospheric masses with the rotation axes not coinciding
with the planet rotation axis and precessing about it. Up to now, the question about interaction
of global vortices corresponding to such solutions with rotations about different axis was not
even posed. This is the first model describing interaction of the Barrett-type global vortices
corresponding to atmospheric centers of action (ACA). The new steady-state and its stability conditions
for N=2 are obtained and used for the analysis of coupled cyclone-anticyclone ACAs over oceans in
the Northern Hemisphere. On the base of corresponding exact solutions, we show acceptability of
modelling of the stable blocks of splitting flow type when in line with the exact accounting for the
sphere rotation, we define also conditions of the polar vortices affecting on the stability boundaries
of the block modes.
