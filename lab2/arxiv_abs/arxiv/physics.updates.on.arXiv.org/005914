Although the governing equations of many systems, when derived from first principles, may be viewed
as known, it is often too expensive to numerically simulate all the interactions within the first
principles description. Therefore researchers often seek simpler descriptions that describe
complex phenomena without numerically resolving all the interacting components. Stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) arise naturally as models in this context. The growth in data acquisition
provides an opportunity for the systematic derivation of SDE models in many disciplines. However,
inconsistencies between SDEs and real data at small time scales often cause problems, when standard
statistical methodology is applied to parameter estimation. The incompatibility between SDEs
and real data can be addressed by deriving sufficient statistics from the time-series data and learning
parameters of SDEs based on these. Following this approach, we formulate the fitting of SDEs to sufficient
statistics from real data as an inverse problem and demonstrate that this inverse problem can be
solved by using ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). Furthermore, we create a framework for non-parametric
learning of drift and diffusion terms by introducing hierarchical, refineable parameterizations
of unknown functions, using Gaussian process regression. We demonstrate the proposed methodology
for the fitting of SDE models, first in a simulation study with a noisy Lorenz 63 model, and then in
other applications, including dimension reduction starting from various deterministic chaotic
systems arising in the atmospheric sciences, large-scale pattern modeling in climate dynamics,
and simplified models for key observables arising in molecular dynamics. The results confirm that
the proposed methodology provides a robust and systematic approach to fitting SDE models to real
data.
