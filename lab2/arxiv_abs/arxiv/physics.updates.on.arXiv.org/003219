Many searches for axion cold dark matter rely on the use of tunable electromagnetic resonators.
Current detectors operate at or near microwave frequencies and use cylindrical cavities with cylindrical
tuning rods. The cavity performance strongly impacts the signal power of the detector, which is
expected to be very small even under optimal conditions. There is strong motivation to characterize
these microwave cavities and improve their performance in order to maximize the achievable signal
power. We present the results of a study characterizing the HAYSTAC (Haloscope At Yale Sensitive
to Axion Cold dark matter) cavity using bead perturbation measurements and detailed 3D electromagnetic
simulations. This is the first use of bead perturbation methods to characterize an axion haloscope
cavity. In this study, we measured impacts of misalignments on the order of 0.001 in and demonstrated
that the same impacts can be predicted using electromagnetic simulations. We also performed a detailed
study of mode crossings and hybridization between the TM$_{010}$ mode used in operation and other
cavity modes. This mixing limits the tuning range of the cavity that can be used during an axion search.
By characterizing each mode crossing in detail, we show that some mode crossings are benign and are
potentially still useful for data collection. The level of observed agreement between measurements
and simulations demonstrates that finite element modeling can capture non-ideal cavity behavior
and the impacts of very small imperfections. 3D electromagnetic simulations and bead perturbation
measurements are standard tools in the microwave engineering community, but they have been underutilized
in axion cavity design. This work demonstrates their potential to improve understanding of existing
cavities and to optimize future designs.
