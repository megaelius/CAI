Remotely sensed, spatially continuous and high spatiotemporal resolution (hereafter referred
to as high resolution) land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter for studying the thermal
environment and has important applications in many fields. However, difficult atmospheric conditions,
sensor malfunctioning and scanning gaps between orbits frequently introduce spatial discontinuities
into satellite-retri1eved LST products. For a single sensor, there is also a trade-off between
temporal and spatial resolution and, therefore, it is impossible to obtain high temporal and spatial
resolution simultaneously. In recent years the reconstruction and spatiotemporal fusion of LST
products have become active research topics that aim at overcoming this limitation. They are two
of most investigated approaches in thermal remote sensing and attract increasing attention, which
has resulted in a number of different algorithms. However, to the best of our knowledge, currently
no review exists that expatiates and summarizes the available LST reconstruction and spatiotemporal
fusion methods and algorithms. This paper introduces the principles and theories behind LST reconstruction
and spatiotemporal fusion and provides an overview of the published research and algorithms. We
summarized three kinds of reconstruction methods for missing pixels (spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal
methods), two kinds of reconstruction methods for cloudy pixels (Satellite Passive Microwave
(PMW)-based and Surface Energy Balance (SEB)-based methods) and three kinds of spatiotemporal
fusion methods (weighted function-based, unmixing-based and hybrid methods). The review concludes
by summarizing validation methods and by identifying some promising future research directions
for generating spatially continuous and high resolution LST products.
