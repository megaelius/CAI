Compressible flow varies from ideal-gas behavior at high pressures where molecular interactions
become important. Density is described through a cubic equation of state while enthalpy and sound
speed are functions of both temperature and pressure, based on two parameters, A and B, related to
intermolecular attraction and repulsion, respectively. Assuming small variations from ideal-gas
behavior, a closed-form solution is obtained that is valid over a wide range of conditions. An expansion
in these molecular-interaction parameters simplifies relations for flow variables, elucidating
the role of molecular repulsion and attraction in variations from ideal-gas behavior. Real-gas
modifications in density, enthalpy, and sound speed for a given pressure and temperature lead to
variations in many basic compressible flow configurations. Sometimes, the variations can be substantial
in quantitative or qualitative terms. The new approach is applied to choked-nozzle flow, isentropic
flow, nonlinear-wave propagation, and flow across a shock wave, all for the real gas. Modifications
are obtained for allowable mass-flow through a choked nozzle, nozzle thrust, sonic wave speed,
Riemann invariants, Prandtl's shock relation, and the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Forced acoustic
oscillations can show substantial augmentation of pressure amplitudes when real-gas effects
are taken into account. Shocks at higher temperatures and pressures can have larger pressure jumps
with real-gas effects. Weak shocks decay to zero strength at sonic speed. The proposed framework
can rely on any cubic equation of state and be applied to multicomponent flows or to more-complex
flow configurations.
