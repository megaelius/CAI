This work examines the Standard Model under the strong-electroweak gauge group $SU_S(3)\times
U_{EW}(2)$ subject to the Lie algebra condition $u_{EW}(2)\not\cong su_I(2)\oplus u_Y(1)$.
Physically, the condition means that all electroweak gauge bosons mix with each other prior to symmetry
breaking --- as one might expect from $U(2)$ invariance. Unlike the Standard Model which posits
a change of Lie algebra basis induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking, here the basis is unaffected
and $W^\pm,\,Z^0,\,\gamma$ represent (modulo $U_{EW}(2)$ gauge transformations) the physical
bosons both before and after spontaneous symmetry breaking. This notion of physical gauge bosons
requires some modification of the matter field sector of the Standard Model. Careful attention
to the product group structure calls for strong-electroweak degrees of freedom in the $(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2})$
and the $(\mathbf{3},\overline{\mathbf{2}})$ of $SU_S(3)\times U_{EW}(2)$ that possess integer
electric charge just like leptons. This leads to a modified Lagrangian kinetic term for quarks that
nevertheless reproduces the same strong and electroweak currents of the Standard Model if one is
willing to identify the pair $(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2}),\,(\mathbf{3},\overline{\mathbf{2}})$
with a single quark doublet in the Standard Model. The close resemblance between quark and lepton
electroweak doublets in this picture encourages us to propose a mechanism for a phase transition
between quarks and leptons. Our hypothesis is that the strong and electroweak bosons see each other
as a source of decoherence. In effect, leptons are identified with the $SU_S(3)$-trace of quark
representations. This mechanism allows for possible extensions of the Standard Model that don't
require large inclusive multiplets of matter fields. As an example, we investigate a model that
turns out to have some promising cosmological implications.
