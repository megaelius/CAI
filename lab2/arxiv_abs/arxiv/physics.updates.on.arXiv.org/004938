Isotopic enrichment offers cutting-edge properties of materials opening exciting research and
development opportunities. In semiconductors, reached progress of ultimate control in growth
and doping techniques follows nowadays the high level isotopic purification. This requires deep
understanding of isotopic disorder effects and techniques of their effective determination.
Isotopic content of both crystal lattice and impurity centers cause the effects, which can be examined
by different optical techniques. While disorder in the host lattice can be straight forward evaluated
by inelastic light scattering or by SIMS measurements, determination of isotopic contributions
of many orders less presented impurities remains challenging and usually observed in high-resolution
photoluminescence or optical absorption spectra. Boron-doped diamonds exhibit complex infrared
absorption spectra while boron-related luminescence remains unobserved. Boron, as a most light
element acting as a hydrogen-like dopant in elemental semiconductors, has a largest relative difference
in its isotope masses, and by this, cause the largest isotopic disorder in semiconductors, including
diamond, an elemental semiconductor with the lightest atomic mass of a host lattice. This enables
an access to the isotopic constitution of boron in diamond by infrared absorption spectroscopy.
By comparison of low-temperature absorption spectra of a natural (20% of 10B and 80% of 11B isotopes)
and 11B enriched (up to 99%) doped diamonds we differentiate the intracenter transitions related
to 10B and to 11B isotopes. We have found that the isotopic spectral lines of the same boron intracenter
transition are separated with the energy of about 0.7 meV. This is the largest impurity isotopic
shift ever observed in semiconductors doped by hydrogen-like impurity centers.
