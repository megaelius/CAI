Over the last decades, photoreceptive proteins were extensively studied with biophysical methods
to gain a fundamental understanding of their working mechanisms and further guide the development
of optogenetic tools from them. Time-resolved infrared (IR) spectroscopy is one of the key methods
to access their functional non-equilibrium processes with high temporal resolution, but has the
major drawback that experimental data is usually highly convoluted. Linking the spectral response
to specifc molecular events is a major obstacle and usually requires costly isotope labeling or
mutagenesis methods. Here, we investigate a cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR) photoreceptor with a
combined approach of transient absorption spectroscopy in the visible and IR wavelength regions.
We obtain kinetic information in both spectral regions by freqency resolved lifetime analysis,
in contrast to the widely used approach of global fitting. This technique allows us to analyse different
regions in the IR response and compare them to kinetic labels obtained from the Vis data. We find that
the non-equilibrium response differ when either the phycocyanobilin (PCB) cofactor or the protein
backbone is chosen as an experimental observable. While spectroscopic signals associated with
PCB evolve through well-separated intermediate states, a higher complexity in the amide I' region
indicates that changes in the protein structure can be better described by diffusion on a rugged
energy landscape. We discuss the implications of these findings for sequential intermediate schemes
and conclude on how the modeling of non-equilibrium dynamics depends on the point of view.
