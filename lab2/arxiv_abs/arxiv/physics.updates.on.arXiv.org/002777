Purpose-Optimal use of established and imaging methods, such as multiparametric magnetic resonance
imaging(mpMRI) can simultaneously identify key functional parameters and provide unique imaging
phenotypes of breast cancer. Therefore, we have developed and implemented a new machine-learning
informatic system that integrates clinical variables, derived from imaging and clinical health
records, to compare with the 21-gene array assay, OncotypeDX. Materials and methods-We tested
our informatics modeling in a subset of patients (n=81) who had ER+ disease and underwent OncotypeDX
gene expression and breast mpMRI testing. The machine-learning informatic method is termed Integrated
Radiomic Informatic System-IRIS was applied to the mpMRI, clinical and pathologic descriptors,
as well as a gene array analysis. The IRIS method using an advanced graph theoretic model and quantitative
metrics. Summary statistics (mean and standard deviations) for the quantitative imaging parameters
were obtained. Sensitivity and specificity and Area Under the Curve were calculated for the classification
of the patients. Results-The OncotypeDX classification by IRIS model had sensitivity of 95% and
specificity of 89% with AUC of 0.92. The breast lesion size was larger for the high-risk groups and
lower for both low risk and intermediate risk groups. There were significant differences in PK-DCE
and ADC map values in each group. The ADC map values for high- and intermediate-risk groups were significantly
lower than the low-risk group. Conclusion-These initial studies provide deeper understandings
of imaging features and molecular gene array OncotypeDX score. This insight provides the foundation
to relate these imaging features to the assessment of treatment response for improved personalized
medicine.
