Reform movements in science education, such as inquiry-based instruction, have been heavily influenced
by constructivist learning theories (National Research Council, 2000). These learning theories
place the learner as the sole constructor of knowledge and emphasize the importance of the learner's
inquiry process (Yilmaz, 2008). In constructivist inquiry-based science education, lab experiences
frequently play an important role in instruction as they provide students with opportunities to
observe and make sense of the world around them (National Research Council, 2000), which raises
the question of how inquiry-based science instruction can be translated to online environments.
There are several models for lab experiences in online science courses, including hands-on labs
where students directly manipulate materials, remote labs where students manipulate materials
through a computer, and virtual labs and simulations where students work with simulated materials
(Powell, et al., 2010). Hands-on labs play an important role, especially given constructivist
views that students construct meaning by making observations of the world around them, but there
is evidence that simulated and virtual labs can play an important role and may even be better suited
to some instructional goals than hands-on labs. Constructivist instruction also requires students
to make their process visible and teachers to be responsive to student thinking, both of which are
more challenging in online environments (Crippen, et al., 2013). However, with intentional design,
these features can be incorporated into online science courses (Jaber, et al., 2018; Jang, 2009).
