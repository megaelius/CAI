We analyze two alterations of the standard SIS dynamics that preserve the central properties of
spontaneous healing and infection capacity of a vertex increasing unlimitedly with its degree.
The modified models have the same epidemic thresholds of the original dynamics in both heterogeneous
and quenched mean-field theories. However, depending on the network properties, simulations
yield a dual scenario, in which the epidemic thresholds of the modified SIS models can be either dramatically
altered or remain unchanged in comparison with the standard dynamics. For uncorrelated synthetic
networks having a power-law degree distribution with exponent $\gamma<5/2$, the SIS dynamics
are robust exhibiting essentially the same outcomes for all investigated models. A threshold in
better agreement with the heterogeneous mean-field rather than the individual-based quenched
mean-field theory is observed in the modified dynamics for exponent $\gamma>5/2$. Differences
are more remarkable for $\gamma>3$ where a finite threshold is found in the modified models in contrast
with the vanishing threshold of the original one. This duality is elucidated in terms of self-sustained
metastable states centered on hubs which are suppressed in the modified dynamics and functioning
in the original one. We verify that the activation of the epidemics in the modified SIS models is triggered
in the densely connected, innermost component of the network given by a $k$-core decomposition
for $\gamma<3$ while it happens only for $\gamma<5/2$ in the standard model. For $\gamma>3$, the
activation in the modified dynamics is collective involving essentially the whole network while
it is triggered by hubs in the standard SIS. The duality also appears in the finite-size scaling of
the critical quantities where mean-field behaviors are observed for the modified, but not for the
original dynamics.
