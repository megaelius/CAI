As a huge threat to the public health, China's air pollution has attracted extensive attention and
continues to grow in tandem with the economy. Although the real-time air quality report can be utilized
to update our knowledge on air quality, questions about how pollutants evolve across time and how
pollutants are spatially correlated still remain a puzzle. In view of this point, we adopt the PMFG
network method to analyze the six pollutants' hourly data in 350 Chinese cities in an attempt to find
out how these pollutants are correlated temporally and spatially. In terms of time dimension, the
results indicate that, except for O$_3$, the pollutants have a common feature of the strong intraday
patterns of which the daily variations are composed of two contraction periods and two expansion
periods. Besides, all the time series of the six pollutants possess strong long-term correlations,
and this temporal memory effect helps to explain why smoggy days are always followed by one after
another. In terms of space dimension, the correlation structure shows that O$_3$ is characterized
by the highest spatial connections. The PMFGs reveal the relationship between this spatial correlation
and provincial administrative divisions by filtering the hierarchical structure in the correlation
matrix and refining the cliques as the tinny spatial clusters. Finally, we check the stability of
the correlation structure and conclude that, except for PM$_{10}$ and O$_3$, the other pollutants
have an overall stable correlation, and all pollutants have a slight trend to become more divergent
in space. These results not only enhance our understanding of the air pollutants' evolutionary
process, but also shed lights on the application of complex network methods into geographic issues.
