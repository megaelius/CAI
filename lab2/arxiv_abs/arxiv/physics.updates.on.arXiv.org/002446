Building on the framework of Zhang \& Shu \cite{zhangShu_2010a,zhangShu_2010b}, we develop a
realizability-preserving method to simulate the transport of particles (fermions) through a
background material using a two-moment model that evolves the angular moments of a phase space distribution
function $f$. The two-moment model is closed using algebraic moment closures; e.g., as proposed
by Cernohorsky \& Bludman \cite{cernohorskyBludman_1994} and Banach \& Larecki \cite{banachLarecki_2017a}.
Variations of this model have recently been used to simulate neutrino transport in nuclear astrophysics
applications, including core-collapse supernovae and compact binary mergers. We employ the discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) method for spatial discretization (in part to capture the asymptotic diffusion limit
of the model) combined with implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration to stably bypass short timescales
induced by frequent interactions between particles and the background. Appropriate care is taken
to ensure the method preserves strict algebraic bounds on the evolved moments (particle density
and flux) as dictated by Pauli's exclusion principle, which demands a bounded distribution function
(i.e., $f\in[0,1]$). This realizability-preserving scheme combines a suitable CFL condition,
a realizability-enforcing limiter, a closure procedure based on Fermi-Dirac statistics, and
an IMEX scheme whose stages can be written as a convex combination of forward Euler steps combined
with a backward Euler step. Numerical results demonstrate the realizability-preserving properties
of the scheme. We also demonstrate that the use of algebraic moment closures not based on Fermi-Dirac
statistics can lead to unphysical moments in the context of fermion transport.
