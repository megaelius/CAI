We explore the possibility of using free (as opposed to driven) oscillations to verify wire tension
in large, open-frame multiwire planes. Using finite-element simulation we predict the signal
when two wires are set in motion by applying and holding a DC voltage between them (electrostatic
excitation). The resulting current signal is marginal. However, the program relates voltage,
oscillation amplitude and signal, and it is easy to get enough amplitude (of order microns) by gently
tapping the wire frame. We perform an end-to-end experimental test. Four 1.5m wires, at various
tensions around 5N, are mounted in an aluminum channel. They are connected to a low-noise, balanced
current-to-voltage preamp designed for good common-mode rejection. The 150V bias, from 9V batteries
in series, is built into the preamp. Data are taken with a Tektronix 1202B scope, stored on a USB flash
drive, and transferred to a laptop computer for analysis. Ten measurements, each with 2500 samples
spanning 1s, are taken for each of the three wire pairs. The wires are excited by tapping the frame
with a small mallet. Because the wire tensions are different, the waveforms exhibit beats. The data
are analyzed by a program which decomposes the waveform step by step to extract the base and beat frequencies
and thereby, two resonant frequencies per wire pair. Finally, those frequencies are disambiguated
to obtain the frequency for each wire, which is then converted to a tension. The four tensions are
then found mechanically by measuring the g/mm required to deflect each wire at its midpoint. The
two values of tension agree well. We conclude that the method verifies tension to approximately
2% (1 sigma) in a little over 1s for 1.5m wires, and would be faster for shorter wires.
