Surface heat transfer in convective and radiative environments is sometimes measured by recording
the surface temperature history in a transient experiment and interpreting this surface temperature
with the aid of a suitable model for transient conduction within the substrate. The semi-infinite
one-dimensional model is often adopted, and several well-developed techniques for application
of this model to surface temperature data are available. However, when a spatial variation of heat
flux exists across the surface, the application of the semi-infinite one-dimensional approach
may not always be a reasonable approximation. In this paper we introduce a method for treatment of
the measured surface temperature history that is more accurate than the semi-infinite one-dimensional
approximation when substrate lateral conduction is significant and the relative spatial distribution
of the flux is known a priori. This new method uses the so-called \textit{Neumann heat kernel}, which
evolves a temperature over an insulated domain with unit energy initially deposited at a specified
point. A useful impulse response function is formed by integrating this Neumann heat kernel against
the spatial variation of flux over the surface of the domain. Neumann heat kernels are constructed
for the solid box, cylinder, and sphere. By applying the heat kernel result for the sphere to the analysis
of a convective experiment using hemispherical-nosed probes, we demonstrate how the theoretical
results enhance the practical analysis of transient surface temperature measurements. The current
approach is superior to former methods relying on semi-empirical approximations because the multi-dimensional
heat conduction within the substrate is modelled with greater fidelity using the heat kernel analysis.
