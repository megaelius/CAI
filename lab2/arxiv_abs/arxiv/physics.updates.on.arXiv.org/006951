Organic-inorganic perovskite light-emitting devices have recently emerged as a reliable light
source. Here, we developed a Single Layer Perovskite Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (SL-PeLEC)
with laminated free-standing Carbon Nanotube Sheet (CNT) sheets as an effective charge electron
injecting cathode electrode. The structure consists of bottom ITO-on-glass as a transparent electrode,
the composite of CsPbBr3:PEO:LiPF6 with additive ionic salt as an emitting layer (EML) and 5 layers
of CNT aerogel sheets as a top laminated cathode . Utilizing CNT free standing sheets laminated right
on top of perovskite thin film in this simple single layer configuration has multiple benefits.
Such CNT top cathode does not show any chemical degradation by reaction with halogens from perovskite,
which is detrimental for metallic cathodes. Moreover, the formation of an internal p-i-n junction
in perovskite EML composite layer by ionic migration under applied voltage bias and electric double
layer (EDL) formation at each electrode interface is beneficially effecting CNT sheets by Li+ ionic
doping and raises their Fermi level, further enhancing electron injection. Besides, inspired
by successes of ionic additives in LECs and electrochemical doping of perovskite with alkali metals,
we leveraged a lithium salt, LiPF6, within a CsPbBr3:PEO composite matrix to achieve optimal ionic
redistribution and doping effects in this SL-PeLEC. Although initially CNT electrode has slightly
high sheet resistance, the SL-PeLEC device has a low turn-on voltage of 2.6v and a maximum luminance
intensity of 530 cd/m2, confirming the n-doping increased conductivity. This work provides a unique
route toward flexible and bright perovskite LECs with stable and transparent CNT electrodes that
can have injection efficiency tuned by poling induced ionic EDL-doping
