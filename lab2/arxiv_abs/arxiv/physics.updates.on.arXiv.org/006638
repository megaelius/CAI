Scientific codes are an indispensable link between theory and experiment; in (astro-)plasma physics,
such numerical tools are one window into the universe's most extreme flows of energy. The discretization
of Maxwell's equations - needed to make highly magnetized (astro)physical plasma amenable to its
numerical modeling - introduces numerical diffusion. It acts as a source of dissipation independent
of the system's physical constituents. Understanding the numerical diffusion of scientific codes
is the key to classify their reliability. It gives specific limits in which the results of numerical
experiments are physical. We aim at quantifying and characterizing the numerical diffusion properties
of our recently developed numerical tool for the simulation of general relativistic force-free
electrodynamics, by calibrating and comparing it with other strategies found in the literature.
Our code correctly models smooth waves of highly magnetized plasma. We evaluate the limits of general
relativistic force-free electrodynamics in the context of current sheets and tearing mode instabilities.
We identify that the current parallel to the magnetic field ($\mathbf{j}_\parallel$), in combination
with the break-down of general relativistic force-free electrodynamics across current sheets,
impairs the physical modeling of resistive instabilities. We find that at least eight numerical
cells per characteristic size of interest (e.g. the wavelength in plasma waves or the transverse
width of a current sheet) are needed to find consistency between resistivity of numerical and of
physical origins. High-order discretization of the force-free current allows us to provide almost
ideal orders of convergence for (smooth) plasma wave dynamics. The physical modeling of resistive
layers requires suitable current prescriptions or a sub-grid modeling for the evolution of $\mathbf{j}_\parallel$.
