SARS-CoV-2 has disrupted the life of billions of people around the world since the first outbreak
was officially declared in China at the beginning of 2020. Yet, important questions such as how deadly
it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit
the `universal' growth of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the
beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence
tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We validate these results with an analogous
antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. We also argue that the official number
of deaths over 70 years old is importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the
comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death
certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the fatality infection
ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different
countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations
for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar
growth of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected)
of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function
of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential growth of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates
large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers
that range from 1.82\% in Italy, to 0.62\% in China or even 0.14\% in middle Africa.
