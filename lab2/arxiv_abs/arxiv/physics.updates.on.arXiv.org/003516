Advancements in high temperature superconducting technology have opened a path toward high-field,
compact fusion devices. This new parameter space introduces both opportunities and challenges
for diagnosis of the plasma. This paper presents a physics review of a neutron diagnostic suite for
a SPARC-like tokamak [Greenwald et al 2018 doi:10.7910/DVN/OYYBNU]. A notional neutronics model
was constructed using plasma parameters from a conceptual device, called the MQ1 (Mission $Q \geq
1$) tokamak. The suite includes time-resolved micro-fission chamber (MFC) neutron flux monitors,
energy-resolved radial and tangential magnetic proton recoil (MPR) neutron spectrometers, and
a neutron camera system (radial and off-vertical) for spatially-resolved measurements of neutron
emissivity. Geometries of the tokamak, neutron source, and diagnostics were modeled in the Monte
Carlo N-Particle transport code MCNP6 to simulate expected signal and background levels of particle
fluxes and energy spectra. From these, measurements of fusion power, neutron flux and fluence are
feasible by the MFCs, and the number of independent measurements required for 95% confidence of
a fusion gain $Q \geq 1$ is assessed. The MPR spectrometer is found to consistently overpredict the
ion temperature and also have a 1000$\times$ improved detection of alpha knock-on neutrons compared
to previous experiments. The deuterium-tritium fuel density ratio, however, is measurable in
this setup only for trace levels of tritium, with an upper limit of $n_T/n_D \approx 6\%$, motivating
further diagnostic exploration. Finally, modeling suggests that in order to adequately measure
the self-heating profile, the neutron camera system will require energy and pulse-shape discrimination
to suppress otherwise overwhelming fluxes of low energy neutrons and gamma radiation. *Co-first-authorship
