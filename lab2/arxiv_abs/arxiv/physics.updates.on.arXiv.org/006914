We present a multi-level delumping method suitable for thermal enhanced oil recovery processes,
for which hydrocarbon components are vaporized under high temperatures, move downstream in the
gas phase and condense back to the liquid phase. To reduce the computational cost, it is standard
practice to reduce the number of (pseudo-)components used in thermal reservoir simulation. Depending
on the number and type of hydrocarbon pseudo-components retained in the simulations, we may not
be able to capture the correct displacement due to large errors in the lumped phase behavior (flash)
computations. We address that problem through a multi-level method: we use data obtained from a
short simulation using the most detailed fluid description available, and leverage that information
to guide a delumping process. We use temperature as a proxy variable for composition, and select
reference temperatures. We extract the corresponding reference compositions from the detailed
run and use them to extend the lumped pseudo-components to an approximate detailed composition.
We test our method using six heavy oil samples, and under two different recovery processes: hot nitrogen
injection and in-situ combustion (air injection and exothermic oxidation reactions). The average
error on the liquid mole fraction is reduced by 4-12 times (depending on the oil samples) compared
to the flash using pseudo-components, and the maximum error by 6-48 times. We illustrate that the
method is amenable to manually adding more information about the physics of some oil samples. We
also discuss how to efficiently pick the reference temperatures. For uniformly sampled temperatures
(between a minimum and maximum temperature), we conduct a sensitivity study which led us to use six
temperatures. We ran both local (Pattern Search, PS) and global (Particle Swarm Optimization,
PSO) gradient-free optimization methods.
