The present investigation provides the first field characterization of the influence of turbulent
inflow on the blade structural response of a utility-scale wind turbine (2.5MW), using the unique
facility available at the Eolos Wind Energy Research Station of the University of Minnesota. A representative
one-hour dataset under a stable atmosphere is selected for the characterization, including the
inflow turbulent data measured from the meteorological tower, high-resolution blade strain measurement
at different circumferential and radiation positions along the blade, and the wind turbine operational
conditions. The results indicate that the turbulent inflow modulates the turbine blade structural
response in three representative frequency ranges: a lower frequency range (corresponding to
modulations due to large eddies in the atmosphere), a higher frequency range (corresponding to
flow structures in scales smaller than the rotor diameter), and an intermediate-range in between.
The blade structure responds strongly to the turbulent inflow in the lower and intermediate ranges,
while it is primarily dominated by the rotation effect and other high-frequency characteristics
of wind turbines in the higher frequency range. Moreover, the blade structural behaviors at different
azimuth angles, circumferential and radial locations along the blade are also compared, suggesting
the comparatively high possibility of structural failure at certain positions. Further, the present
study also uncovers the linkage between the turbulent inflow and blade structural response using
temporal correlation. The derived findings provide insights into the development of advanced
control strategies or blade design to mitigate the structural impact and increase blade longevity
for the safer and more efficient operation of large-scale wind turbines.
