Solar chromosphere consists of a partially ionized plasma, which makes modeling the solar chromosphere
a particularly challenging numerical task. Here we numerically model chromospheric waves using
a two-fluid approach with a newly developed numerical code. The code solves two-fluid equations
of conservation of mass, momentum and energy, together with the induction equation, for the case
of the purely hydrogen plasma with collisional coupling between the charged and neutral fluid components.
The implementation of a semi-implicit algorithm allows us to overcome the numerical stability
constraints due to the stiff collisional terms. We test the code against analytical solutions of
acoustic and Alfv\'en wave propagation in uniform medium in several regimes of collisional coupling.The
results of our simulations are consistent with the analytical estimates, and with other results
described in the literature. In the limit of a large collisional frequency, the waves propagate
with a common speed of a single fluid. In the other limit of a vanishingly small collisional frequency,
the Alfv\'en waves propagate with an Alfv\'en speed of the charged fluid only, while the perturbation
in neutral fluid is very small. The acoustic waves in these limits propagate with the sound speed
corresponding to either the charges or the neutrals, while the perturbation in the other fluid component
is very small. Otherwise, when the collision frequency is similar to the real part of the wave frequency,
the interaction between charges and neutrals through momentum transfer collisions cause alterations
of the waves frequencies and damping of the wave amplitudes.
