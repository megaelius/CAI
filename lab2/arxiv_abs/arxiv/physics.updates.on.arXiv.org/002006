Recently the use of neural networks has been introduced in the context of the signed particle formulation
of quantum mechanics to rapidly and reliably compute the Wigner kernel of any provided potential.
This new technique has introduced two important advantages over the more standard finite difference/element
methods: 1) it reduces the amount of memory required for the simulation of a quantum system. As a matter
of fact, it does not require storing the kernel in a (expensive) multi-dimensional array, and 2)
a consistent speedup is obtained since now one can compute the kernel on the cells of interest only,
i.e. the cells occupied by signed particles. Although this certainly represents a step forward
into the direction of rapid simulations of quantum systems, it comes at a price: the number of hidden
neurons is constrained by design to be equal to the number of cells of the discretized real space.
It is easy to see how this limitation can quickly become an issue when very fine meshes are necessary.
In this work, we continue to ameliorate this previous approach by reducing the complexity of the
neural network and, consequently, by introducing an additional speedup. More specifically, we
propose a new network architecture which requires less neurons than the previous approach in its
hidden layer. For validation purposes, we apply this novel technique to a well known simple, but
very indicative, one-dimensional quantum system consisting of a Gaussian wave packet interacting
with a potential barrier. In order to clearly show the validity of our suggested approach, time-dependent
comparisons with the previous technique are presented. In spite of its simpler architecture, a
good agreement is observed, thus representing one step further towards fast and reliable simulations
of time-dependent quantum systems.
