We perform numerical simulations of trapped $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions that are buffer gas cooled by a
cold cloud of $^6$Li atoms. This species combination has been suggested to be the most promising
for reaching the quantum regime of interacting atoms and ions in a Paul trap. Treating the atoms and
ions classically, we compute that the collision energy indeed reaches below the quantum limit for
a perfect linear Paul trap. We analyze the effect of imperfections in the ion trap that cause excess
micromotion. We find that the suppression of excess micromotion required to reach the quantum limit
should be within experimental reach. Indeed, although the requirements are strong, they are not
excessive and lie within reported values in the literature. We analyze the detection and suppression
of excess micromotion in our experimental setup. Using the obtained experimental parameters in
our simulation, we calculate collision energies that are a factor 2-11 larger than the quantum limit,
indicating that improvements in micromotion detection and compensation are needed there. We also
analyze the buffer-gas cooling of linear and two-dimensional ion crystals. We find that the energy
stored in the eigenmodes of ion motion may reach 10-100 $\mu$K after buffer-gas cooling under realistic
experimental circumstances. Interestingly, not all eigenmodes are buffer-gas cooled to the same
energy. Our results show that with modest improvements of our experiment, studying atom-ion mixtures
in the quantum regime is in reach, allowing for buffer-gas cooling of the trapped ion quantum platform
and to study the occurrence of atom-ion Feshbach resonances.
