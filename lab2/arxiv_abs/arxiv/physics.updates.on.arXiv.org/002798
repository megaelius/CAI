Nanoantennas offer the ultimate spatial control over light by concentrating optical energy well
below the diffraction limit, whereas their quality factor (Q) is constrained by large radiative
and dissipative losses. Dielectric microcavities, on the other hand, are capable of generating
a high Q-factor through an extended photon storage time but have a diffraction-limited optical
mode volume. Here we bridge the two worlds, by studying an exemplary hybrid system integrating plasmonic
gold nanorods acting as nanoantennas with an on-resonance dielectric photonic crystal (PC) slab
acting as a low-loss microcavity and, more importantly, by synergistically combining their advantages
to produce a much stronger local field enhancement than that of the separate entities. To achieve
this synergy between the two polar opposite types of nanophotonic resonant elements, we show that
it is crucial to coordinate both the dissipative loss of the nanoantenna and the Q-factor of the low-loss
cavity. In comparison to the antenna-cavity coupling approach using a Fabry-Perot resonator,
which has proved successful for resonant amplification of the antenna's local field intensity,
we theoretically and experimentally show that coupling to a modest-Q PC guided resonance can produce
a greater amplification by at least an order of magnitude. The synergistic nanoantenna-microcavity
hybrid strategy opens new opportunities for further enhancing nanoscale light-matter interactions
to benefit numerous areas such as nonlinear optics, nanolasers, plasmonic hot carrier technology,
and surface-enhanced Raman and infrared absorption spectroscopies.
