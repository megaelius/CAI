The squared Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} Frequency (BVF) is computed in terms of the moist entropy
potential temperature recently defined in Marquet (2011). Both homogeneously saturated and non-saturated
versions of $N^2$ (the squared BVF) are derived. The method employed for computing these special
homogeneous cases relies on the expression of density written as a function of pressure, total water
content and specific moist entropy only. The associated conservative variable diagrams are discussed
and compared with existing ones. Despite being obtained without any simplification, the formulations
for $N^2$ remain nicely compact and are clearly linked with the squared BVF expressed in terms of
the adiabatic non-saturated and saturated lapse rates. As in previous similar expressions, the
extreme homogeneous solutions for $N^2$ are of course different, but they are not analytically
discontinuous. This allows us to define a simple bridging expression for a single general shape
of $N^2$, depending only on the basic mean atmospheric quantities and on a transition parameter,
to be defined (or parameterized) in connection with the type of application sought. This integrated
result remains a linear combination (with complex but purely local weights) of two terms only, namely
the environmental gradient of the moist entropy potential temperature and the environmental gradient
of the total water content. Simplified versions of the various equations are also proposed for the
case in which the moist entropy potential temperature is approximated by a function of both so-called
moist-conservative variables of Betts (1973).
