The ability of Anisotropic Minkowski Functionals (AMFs) to capture local anisotropy while evaluating
topological properties of the underlying gray-level structures has been previously demonstrated.
We evaluate the ability of this approach to characterize local structure properties of trabecular
bone micro-architecture in ex vivo proximal femur specimens, as visualized on multi-detector
CT, for purposes of biomechanical bone strength prediction. To this end, volumetric AMFs were computed
locally for each voxel of volumes of interest (VOI) extracted from the femoral head of 146 specimens.
The local anisotropy captured by such AMFs was quantified using a fractional anisotropy measure;
the magnitude and direction of anisotropy at every pixel was stored in histograms that served as
a feature vectors that characterized the VOIs. A linear multi-regression analysis algorithm was
used to predict the failure load (FL) from the feature sets; the predicted FL was compared to the true
FL determined through biomechanical testing. The prediction performance was measured by the root
mean square error (RMSE) for each feature set. The best prediction performance was obtained from
the fractional anisotropy histogram of AMF Euler Characteristic (RMSE = 1.01 +- 0.13), which was
significantly better than MDCT-derived mean BMD (RMSE = 1.12 +- 0.16, p<0.05). We conclude that
such anisotropic Minkowski Functionals can capture valuable information regarding regional
trabecular bone quality and contribute to improved bone strength prediction, which is important
for improving the clinical assessment of osteoporotic fracture risk.
