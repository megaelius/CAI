The predominant structural protein in vertebrates is collagen, which plays a key role in extracellular
matrix and connective tissue mechanics. Despite its prevalence and physical importance in biology,
the mechanical properties of molecular collagen are far from established. The flexibility of its
triple helix is unresolved, with descriptions from different experimental techniques ranging
from flexible to semirigid. Furthermore, it is unknown how collagen type (homo- vs. heterotrimeric)
and source (tissue-derived vs. recombinant) influence flexibility. Using SmarTrace, a chain
tracing algorithm we devised, we performed statistical analysis of collagen conformations collected
with atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the protein's mechanical properties. Our results
show that types I, II and III collagens - the key fibrillar varieties - exhibit molecular flexibilities
that are very similar. However, collagen conformations are strongly modulated by salt, transitioning
from compact to extended as KCl concentration increases, in both neutral and acidic pH. While analysis
with a standard worm-like chain model suggests that the persistence length of collagen can attain
almost any value within the literature range, closer inspection reveals that this modulation of
collagen's conformational behavior is not due to changes in flexibility, but rather arises from
the induction of curvature (either intrinsic or induced by interactions with the mica surface).
By modifying standard polymer theory to include innate curvature, we show that collagen behaves
as an equilibrated curved worm-like chain (cWLC) in two dimensions. Analysis within the cWLC model
shows that collagen's curvature depends strongly on pH and salt, while its persistence length does
not. Thus, we find that triple-helical collagen is well described as semiflexible, irrespective
of source, type, pH and salt environment.
