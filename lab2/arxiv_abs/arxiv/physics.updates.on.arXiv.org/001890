A simple analytical model is developed for the current induced by the wind and modified by surface
wind-waves in the oceanic surface layer, based on a first-order turbulence closure and including
the effect of a vortex force representing the Stokes drift of the waves. The shear stress is partitioned
between a component due to shear in the current, which is reduced at low turbulent Langmuir number
($La_t$), and a wave-induced component, which decays over a depth proportional to the dominant
wavelength. The model reproduces the apparent reduction of the friction velocity and enhancement
of the roughness length estimated from current profiles, detected in a number of studies. These
effects are predicted to intensify as $La_t$ decreases, and are entirely attributed to non-breaking
surface waves. The current profile becomes flatter for low $La_t$ owing to a smaller fraction of
the total shear stress being supported by the current shear. Comparisons of the model with the comprehensive
dataset provided by the laboratory experiments of Cheung and Street show encouraging agreement,
with the current speed decreasing as the wind speed increases (corresponding to decreasing $La_t$),
if the model is adjusted to reflect the effects of a full wave spectrum on the intensity and depth of
penetration of the wave-induced stress. A version of the model where the shear stress decreases
to zero over a depth consistent with the measurements accurately predicts the surface current speed.
These results contribute towards developing physically-based momentum flux parameterizations
for the wave-affected boundary layer in ocean circulation models.
