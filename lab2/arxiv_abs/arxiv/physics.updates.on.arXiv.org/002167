The purpose of this work is to expand the work of Streher (2017) in order to investigate the aeroelastic
instabilities generated by the flow around a moving NACA0012 airfoil. The profile has a chord length
of $c=0.1 m and is exposed to a flow at a Reynolds number of Re=30,000. The airfoil has only two degrees
of freedom: Translation in relation to the vertical direction and a rotation around the span-wise
axis. A partitioned approach based on two separate solvers and a fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
coupling scheme is applied. The in-house CFD solver FASTEST-3D computes the fluid sub-problem
according to the wall-resolved large-eddy simulation (LES) combined with the Smagorinsky model
(1963). The structural sub-problem is solved by a rigid movement solver implemented by Viets (2013),
which is based on the equations of motion for rigid bodies. The FSI coupling exchanges information
between both solvers based on loose or strong coupling algorithms. A thorough analysis of the problem
is primarily performed in order to acquire a computational setup that provides the best compromise
between accuracy and CPU-time requirements. Three system configurations are then tested and thoroughly
investigated: One leads to an oscillatory behavior of the airfoil characterized by limited small
amplitudes. The other is characterized by the presence of the torsional divergence aeroelastic
instability. Finally, a configuration aimed at the flutter phenomenon is established. However,
not enough data are currently available and therefore this dynamic aeroelastic instability can
not be thoroughly investigated in the present work. In the near future, this study will serve as a
base for the flutter experiments and computations performed at the Department of Fluid Mechanics
located of the Helmut-Schmidt-University.
