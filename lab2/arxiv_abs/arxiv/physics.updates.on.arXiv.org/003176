We describe the long-term dynamics of sustained stratified shear flows in the laboratory. The Stratified
Inclined Duct (SID) experiment sets up a two-layer exchange flow in an inclined duct connecting
two reservoirs containing salt solutions of different densities. This flow is primarily characterised
by two non-dimensional parameters: the tilt angle of the duct with respect to the horizontal, $\theta$
(a few degrees at most), and the Reynolds number $Re$, an input parameter based on the density difference
driving the flow. The flow can be sustained with constant forcing over arbitrarily long times and
exhibits a wealth of dynamical behaviours representative of geophysically-relevant sustained
stratified shear flows. Varying $\theta$ and $Re$ leads to four qualitatively different regimes:
laminar flow; mostly laminar flow with finite-amplitude, travelling Holmboe waves; spatio-temporally
intermittent turbulence with substantial interfacial mixing; and sustained, vigorous interfacial
turbulence (Meyer & Linden, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 753, 2014, pp. 242-253). We seek to explain the scaling
of the transitions between flow regimes in the two-dimensional plane of input parameters $(\theta,
Re)$. We improve upon previous studies of this problem by providing a firm physical basis and non-dimensional
scaling laws that are mutually consistent and in good agreement with the empirical transition curves
we inferred from 360 experiments spanning $\theta \in [-1^\circ, 6^\circ]$ and $Re \in [300, 5000]$.
To do so, we employ state-of-the-art simultaneous volumetric measurements of the density field
and the three-component velocity field, and analyse these experimental data using time- and volume-averaged
potential and kinetic energy budgets. We show that regime transitions are caused by ...
