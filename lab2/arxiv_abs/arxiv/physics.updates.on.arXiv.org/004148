The improvement of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is one of the major goals of optoelectronics and
photonics research. While emission rate enhancement is certainly one of the targets, in this regard,
for LED integration to complex photonic devices, one would require to have, additionally, precise
control of the wavefront of the emitted light. Metasurfaces are spatial arrangements of engineered
scatters that may enable this light manipulation capability with unprecedented resolution. Most
of these devices, however, are only able to function properly under irradiation of light with a large
spatial coherence, typically normally incident lasers. LEDs, on the other hand, have angularly
broad, Lambertian-like emission patterns characterized by a low spatial coherence, which makes
the integration of metasurface devices on LED architectures extremely challenging. A novel concept
for metasurface integration on LED is proposed, using a cavity to increase the LED spatial coherence
through an angular collimation. Due to the resonant character of the cavity, extending the spatial
coherence of the emitted light does not come at the price of any reduction in the total emitted power.
The experimental demonstration of the proposed concept is implemented on a GaP LED architecture
including a hybrid metallic-Bragg cavity. By integrating a silicon metasurface on top we demonstrate
two different functionalities of these compact devices: directional LED emission at a desired
angle and LED emission of a vortex beam with an orbital angular momentum. The presented concept is
general, being applicable to other incoherent light sources and enabling metasurfaces designed
for plane waves to work with incoherent light emitters.
