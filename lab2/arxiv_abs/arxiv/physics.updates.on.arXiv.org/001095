This paper is concerned with the partitioned iterative formulation to simulate the fluid-structure
interaction of a nonlinear multibody system in an incompressible turbulent flow. The proposed
formulation relies on a three-dimensional (3D) incompressible turbulent flow solver, a nonlinear
monolithic elastic structural solver for constrained flexible multibody system and the nonlinear
iterative force correction scheme for coupling of the turbulent fluid-flexible multibody system
with nonmatching interface meshes. While the fluid equations are discretized using a stabilized
Petrov-Galerkin formulation in space and the generalized-$\alpha$ updates in time, the multibody
system utilizes a discontinuous space-time Galerkin finite element method. We address two key
challenges in the present formulation. Firstly, the coupling of the incompressible turbulent
flow with a system of nonlinear elastic bodies described in a co-rotated frame. Secondly, the projection
of the tractions and displacements across the nonmatching 3D fluid surface elements and the one-dimensional
line elements for the flexible multibody system in a conservative manner. Through the nonlinear
iterative correction and the conservative projection, the developed fluid-flexible multibody
interaction solver is stable for problems involving strong inertial effects between the fluid-flexible
multibody system and the coupled interactions among each multibody component. The accuracy of
the proposed coupled finite element framework is validated against the available experimental
data for a long flexible cylinder undergoing vortex-induced vibration in a uniform current flow
condition. Finally, a practical application of the proposed framework is demonstrated by simulating
the flow-induced vibration of a realistic offshore floating platform connected to a long riser
and an elastic mooring system.
