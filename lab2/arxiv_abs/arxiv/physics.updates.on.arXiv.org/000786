Assigning boundary conditions, such as acoustic impedance, to the frequency domain thermoviscous
wave equations (TWE), derived from the linearized Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) poses a Helmholtz
problem, solution to which yields a discrete set of complex eigenfunctions and eigenvalue pairs.
The proposed method -- the inverse Helmholtz solver (iHS) -- reverses such procedure by returning
the value of acoustic impedance at one or more unknown impedance boundaries (IBs) of a given domain,
via spatial integration of the TWE for a given real-valued frequency with assigned conditions on
other boundaries. The iHS procedure is applied to a second-order spatial discretization of the
TWEs on an unstructured staggered grid arrangement. Only the momentum equation is extended to the
center of each IB face where pressure and velocity components are co-located and treated as unknowns.
The iHS is finally closed via assignment of the surface gradient of pressure phase over the IBs, corresponding
to assigning the shape of the acoustic waveform at the IB. The iHS procedure can be carried out independently
for different frequencies, making it embarrassingly parallel, and able to return the complete
broadband complex impedance distribution at the IBs in any desired frequency range to arbitrary
numerical precision. The iHS approach is first validated against Rott's theory for viscous rectangular
and circular ducts. The impedance of a toy porous cavity with a complex geometry is then reconstructed
and validated with companion fully compressible unstructured Navier-Stokes simulations resolving
the cavity geometry. Verification against one-dimensional impedance test tube calculations
based on time-domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC) is also carried out. Finally, results
from a preliminary analysis of a thermoacoustically unstable cavity are presented.
