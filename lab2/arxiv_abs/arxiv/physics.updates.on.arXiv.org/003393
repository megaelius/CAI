We report a numerical analysis of the unforced break-up of free cylindrical threads of viscous Newtonian
liquid whose interface is coated with insoluble surfactants, focusing on the formation of satellite
droplets. The initial conditions are harmonic disturbances of the cylindrical shape with a small
amplitude $\epsilon$, and whose wavelength is the most unstable one deduced from linear stability
theory. We demonstrate that, in the limit $\epsilon \to 0$, the problem depends on two dimensionless
parameters, namely the Laplace number, $La=\rho\sigma_0\bar{R}/\mu^2$, and the elasticity
parameter, $\beta=E/\sigma_0$, where $\rho$, $\mu$ and $\sigma_0$ are the liquid density, viscosity
and initial surface tension, respectively, $E$ is the Gibbs elasticity and $\bar{R}$ is the unperturbed
thread radius. A parametric study is presented to quantify the influence of $La$ and $\beta$ on two
key quantities: the satellite droplet volume and the mass of surfactant trapped at the satellite's
surface just prior to pinch-off, $V_{sat}$ and $\Sigma_{sat}$, respectively. We identify a weak-elasticity
regime, $\beta \lesssim 0.125$, in which the satellite volume and the associated mass of surfactant
obey the scaling law $V_{sat} = \Sigma_{sat} = 0.0042 La^{1.64}$ for $0.05\lesssim La \lesssim
2$, while $V_{sat}$ and $\Sigma_{sat}$ become negligible when $La \lesssim 0.05$. For $La \gtrsim
10$, $V_{sat}$ and $\Sigma_{sat}$ reach a plateau of about $3 \%$ and $2.9 \%$ respectively, $V_{sat}$
being in close agreement with previous experiments of low viscosity threads with clean interfaces.
For $La<7.5$, we reveal the existence of a discontinuous transition at a critical elasticity, $\beta_c
(La)$, with $\beta_c \to 0.98$ for $La \lesssim 0.2$, such that no satellite droplet is formed when
$\beta<\beta_c$, while a satellite droplet with finite volume and finite surfactant mass appears
for $\beta>\beta_c$.
