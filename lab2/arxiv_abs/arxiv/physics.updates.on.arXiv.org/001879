Charge trapping and formation of polarons is a pervasive phenomenon in transition metal oxide compounds,
in particular at the surface, affecting fundamental physical properties and functionalities
of the hosting materials. Here we investigate via first-principle techniques the formation and
dynamics of small polarons on the reduced surface of titanium dioxide, an archetypal system for
polarons, for a wide range of oxygen vacancy concentrations. We report how the essential features
of polarons can be adequately accounted in terms of few quantities: the local structural and chemical
environment, the attractive interaction between negatively charged polarons and positively
charged oxygen vacancies, and the spin-dependent polaron-polaron Coulomb repulsion. We combined
molecular dynamics simulations on realistic samples derived from experimental observations
with simplified static models, aiming to disentangle the various variables at play. We find that
depending on the specific trapping site, different types of polarons can be formed, with distinct
orbital symmetries and different degree of localization and structural distortion. The energetically
most stable polaron site is the subsurface Ti atom below the undercoordinated surface Ti atom, owing
to a small energy cost to distort the lattice and a suitable electrostatic potential. Polaron-polaron
repulsion and polaron-vacancy attraction determine the spatial distribution of polarons as well
as the energy of the polaronic in-gap state. In the range of experimentally reachable oxygen vacancy
concentrations the calculated data are in excellent agreement with observations, thus validating
the overall interpretation.
