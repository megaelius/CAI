In this article we discuss in detail the effective approaches to enhance the thermal conductivity
in polymer composites. It is shown from numerical simulations that maximizing interfacial area
between filler and polymer enhances very significantly the effective thermal conductivity in
composites. Our study outlines two main facts. (a) Although the nature of the filler's geometry
plays an important role in the effective thermal conductivity, we show that among the different
geometries thermal conductivity is high for those geometries for which the ratio of surface-area
to volume is high. Thus non-spherical shaped fillers show high thermal conductivity compared to
the spherical fillers. (b) For fillers of a particular geometry, by maximizing its surface area
without changing the volume fraction of the metallic filler, the effective thermal conductivity
increases. Thus, the interfacial area between filler and polymer plays an important role in the
enhancement of thermal conductivity. Maximizing interfaces facilitates more routes for heat
conduction through the metallic filler. Thus filler material can be transformed to result into
more surface such that more interfaces between the filer polymer can be obtained. It is also observed
that as this interfacial area increases, increase in effective thermal conductivity follows from
linear to the logarithmic growth. It should be noted that to inherit the polymer properties there
is a restriction on the upper bound of volume fraction of the fillers. The current study bring out
an important step in this direction. Our results are technologically very important in designing
composite polymers for better heat conduction, and are very cost-effective. This study also provides
a connection between the bulk and the surface area in effectively determination of the thermal conductivity.
