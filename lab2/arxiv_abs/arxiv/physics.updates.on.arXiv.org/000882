It was proven that the intense tightly focused Gauss beam (GB) generates pressures in excess of a
few TPa creating the novel super-dense phases of Aluminium and silicon [1-5]. Recently it was demonstrated
that the Bessel beam (BB) focused inside sapphire produced the cylindrical void being two orders
of magnitude larger than that generated by the GB [6-8]. Analysis of the experimental data presented
below allows making the remarkable conclusions based solely on the void size measurements without
any ad hoc assumptions about the interaction process. First, the void size is direct evidence of
strong (>40%) absorption of the pulse energy. Second, it is a direct experimental evidence of the
high-energy concentration in the central spike of the focus. The unique features of the intense
Bessel beam interaction then allow understanding the experimental observation. This interaction
generates early in the pulse time the spatial distribution of excited permittivity changing from
positive to negative values. Then the light interacts with zero-real-permittivity surface, separating
plasma and dielectric areas, which leads to high energy concentration near the axis of cylindrical
focus up to several MJ/cm3 (pressure range of 4-8 TPa). The effect depends on the angle between the
permittivity gradient and the field polarisation. High pressure generates intense cylindrical
shock/ rarefaction waves, which led to formation of void and compressed shell. We demonstrate that
the Bessel beam proves to be an effective tool for producing extreme pressure/temperature conditions
on the laboratory tabletop. It appears that adjusting polarisation and permittivity gradient
might be a novel way for increasing the maximum pressure. This tool allows for search of novel high-pressure
material phases, for the 3D laser machining and for creating Warm Dense Matter as those in star cores.
