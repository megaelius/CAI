A geomagnetic storm is the result of sustained interaction between solar wind with a southward magnetic
field and the magnetosphere. To investigate the influence of various solar wind parameters on the
intensity of major geomagnetic storm, 67 major geomagnetic storms that occurred between 1998 and
2006 were used to calculate the correlation coefficients (CCs) between the intensities of major
geomagnetic storms and the time integrals of southward interplanetary magnetic field $B_s$, solar
wind electric field ($E_y$) and injection function (Q) during the main phase of the associated geomagnetic
storms. SYM-H$_{min}$ was used to indicate the intensity of the associated major geomagnetic storm,
while I($B_z$), I($E_y$) and I(Q) were used to indicate the time integrals of $B_z$, $E_y$ and Q during
the main phase of associated major geomagnetic storm respectively. The derived CC between I($B_z$)
and SYM-H$_{min}$ is 0.33, while the CC between I($E_y$) and SYM-H$_{min}$ is 0.57 and the CC between
I(Q) and SYM-H$_{min}$ is 0.86. The results provide statistical evidence that solar wind dynamic
pressure or solar wind density plays a significant role in transferring solar wind energy into the
magnetosphere, in addition to the southward magnetic field and solar wind speed. Solar wind that
has a strong geoeffectiveness requires solar wind dynamic pressure $>$3 nPa or solar wind density
$>3$ nPa$/V_{sw}^2$. Large and long duration $B_s$ alone cannot ensure a major geomagnetic storm,
especially if the solar wind dynamic pressure is very low, as large and long duration Bs is not a full
condition, only a necessary condition to trigger a major geomagnetic storm.
