The molecular dipole moment ($\boldsymbol{\mu}$) is a central quantity in chemistry. It is essential
in predicting infrared and sum-frequency generation spectra, as well as induction and long-range
electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, it can be extracted directly from high-level quantum
mechanical calculations, making it an ideal target for machine learning (ML). In this work, we choose
to represent this quantity with a physically inspired ML model that captures two distinct physical
effects: local atomic polarization is captured within the symmetry-adapted Gaussian process
regression (SA-GPR) framework, which assigns a (vector) dipole moment to each atom, while movement
of charge across the entire molecule is captured by assigning a partial (scalar) charge to each atom.
The resulting "MuML" models are fitted together to reproduce molecular $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ computed
using high-level coupled-cluster theory (CCSD) and density functional theory (DFT) on the QM7b
dataset. The combined model shows excellent transferability when applied to a showcase dataset
of larger and more complex molecules, approaching the accuracy of DFT at a small fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that the uncertainty in the predictions can be estimated reliably using
a calibrated committee model. The ultimate performance of the models depends, however, on the details
of the system at hand, with the scalar model being clearly superior when describing large molecules
whose dipole is almost entirely generated by charge separation. These observations point to the
importance of simultaneously accounting for the local and non-local effects that contribute to
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$; further, they define a challenging task to benchmark future models, particularly
those aimed at the description of condensed phases.
