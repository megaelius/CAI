Fluorine-19 (19F) MRI of injected perfluorocarbon emulsions (PFCs) allows for the non-invasive
quantification of inflammation and cell tracking, but suffers from a low signal-to-noise ratio
and extended scan time. To address this limitation, we tested the hypothesis that a 19F MRI pulse
sequence that combines a specific undersampling regime with signal averaging has increased sensitivity
and robustness against motion artifacts compared to a non-averaged fully-sampled dataset, when
both are reconstructed with compressed sensing. To this end, numerical simulations and phantom
experiments were performed to characterize the point spread function (PSF) of undersampling patterns
and the vulnerability to noise of acquisition-reconstruction strategies with paired numbers
of x signal averages and acceleration factor x (NAx-AFx). At all investigated noise levels, the
DSC of the acquisition-reconstruction strategies strongly depended on the regularization parameters
and acceleration factor. In phantoms, motion robustness of an NA8-AF8 undersampling pattern versus
NA1-AF1 was evaluated with simulated and real motions. Differences were assessed with Dice similarity
coefficients (DSC), and were consistently higher for NA8-AF8 compared to NA1-AF1 strategy, for
both simulated and real cyclic motions (P<0.001). Both acquisition-reconstruction strategies
were validated in vivo in mice (n=2) injected with perfluoropolyether. These images displayed
a sharper delineation of the liver with the NA8-AF8 strategy than with the NA1-AF1 strategy. In conclusion,
we validated the hypothesis that in 19F MRI, the combination of undersampling and averaging improves
both the sensitivity and the robustness against motion artifacts compared to a non-averaged fully-sampled
dataset, when both are reconstructed with compressed sensing.
