The linearized, compressible Navier-Stokes equations can be used to model acoustic wave propagation
in the presence of viscous and thermal boundary layers. However, acoustic boundary layers are notorious
for invoking prohibitively high resolution requirements on numerical solutions of the equations.
We derive and present a strategy for how viscous and thermal boundary-layer effects can be represented
as a boundary condition on the standard Helmholtz equation for the acoustic pressure. This boundary
condition constitutes an $O(\delta)$ perturbation, where $\delta$ is the boundary-layer thickness,
of the vanishing Neumann condition for the acoustic pressure associated with a lossless sound-hard
wall. The approximate model is valid when the wavelength and the minimum radius of curvature of the
wall is much larger than the boundary layer thickness. In the special case of sound propagation in
a cylindrical duct, the model collapses to the classical Kirchhoff solution. We assess the model
in the case of sound propagation through a compression driver, a kind of transducer that is commonly
used to feed horn loudspeakers. Due to the presence of shallow chambers and thin slits in the device,
it is crucial to include modeling of visco-thermal losses in the acoustic analysis. The transmitted
power spectrum through the device calculated numerically using our model agrees well with computations
using a hybrid model, where the full linearized, compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
in the narrow regions of the device and the inviscid Helmholtz equations elsewhere. However, our
model needs almost two orders of magnitude less memory and computational time than the more complete
model.
