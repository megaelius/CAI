Cyanopolyyne anions were among the first anions discovered in the interstellar medium. The discovery
have raised questions about routes of formation of these anions in space. Some of the proposed mechanisms
assumed that anionic excited electronic states, either metastable or weakly bound, play a key role
in the formation process. Verification of this hypothesis requires detailed knowledge of the electronic
states of the anions. Here we investigate bound and continuum states of four cyanopolyyne anions,
CN$^-$, C$_3$N$^-$, C$_5$N$^-$, and C$_7$N$^-$, by means of ab initio calculations. We employ
the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method augmented with complex absorbing potential.
We predict that already in CN$^-$, the smallest anion in the family, there are several low-lying
metastable states of both singlet and triplet spin symmetry. These states, identified as shape
resonances, are located between 6.3-8.5 eV above the ground state of the anion (or 2.3-4.5 eV above
the ground state of the parent radical) and have widths of a few tenths of eV up to 1 eV. We analyze the
identified resonances in terms of leading molecular orbital contributions and Dyson orbitals.
As the carbon chain length increases in the C$_{2n+1}$N$^-$ series, these resonances gradually
become stabilized and eventually turn into stable valence bound states. The trends in energies
of the transitions leading to both resonance and bound excited states can be rationalized by means
of the H\"{u}ckel model. Apart from valence excited states, some of the cyanopolyynes can also support
dipole bound states and dipole stabilized resonances, owing to a large dipole moment of the parent
radicals in the lowest $^2\Sigma^+$ state. We discuss the consequences of open-shell character
of the neutral radicals on the dipole-stabilized states of the respective anions.
