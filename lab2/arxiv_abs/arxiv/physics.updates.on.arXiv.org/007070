In this paper we explore a time-depended SEIR model, in which the dynamics of the infection in four
groups from a selected target group (population), divided according to the infection, are modeled
by a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Several basic parameters are involved
in the model: coefficients of infection rate, incubation rate, recovery rate. The coefficients
are adaptable to each specific infection, for each individual country, and depend on the measures
to limit the spread of the infection and the effectiveness of the methods of treatment of the infected
people in the respective country. If such coefficients are known, solving the nonlinear system
is possible to be able to make some hypotheses for the development of the epidemic. This is the reason
for using Bulgarian COVID-19 data to first of all, solve the so-called "inverse problem" and to find
the parameters of the current situation. Reverse logic is initially used to determine the parameters
of the model as a function of time, followed by computer solution of the problem. Namely, this means
predicting the future behavior of these parameters, and finding (and as a consequence applying
mass-scale measures, e.g., distancing, disinfection, limitation of public events), a suitable
scenario for the change in the proportion of the numbers of the four studied groups in the future.
In fact, based on these results we model the COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Bulgaria and make
a two-week forecast for the numbers of new cases per day, active cases and recovered individuals.
Such model, as we show, has been successful for prediction analysis in the Bulgarian situation.
We also provide multiple examples of numerical experiments with visualization of the results.
