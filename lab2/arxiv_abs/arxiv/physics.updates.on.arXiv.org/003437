We present femtosecond laser-induced electron emission from nanodiamond-coated tungsten tips.
Based on the shortness of the femtosecond laser pulses, electrons can be photo-excited for wavelengths
from the infrared (1932 nm) to the ultraviolet (235 nm) because multi-photon excitation becomes
efficient over the entire spectral range. Depending on the laser wavelength, we find different
dominant emission channels identified by the number of photons needed to emit electrons. Based
on the band alignment between tungsten and nanodiamond, the relevant emission channels can be identified
as specific transitions in diamond and its graphitic boundaries. It is the combination of the character
of initial and final states (i.e. bulk or surface-near, direct or indirect excitation in the diamond
band structure), the number of photons providing the excitation energy and the peak intensity of
the laser pulses that determines the dominant excitation channel for photoemission. A specific
feature of the hydrogen-terminated nanodiamond coating is its negative electron affinity that
significantly lowers the work function and enables efficient emission from the conduction band
minimum into vacuum without energy barrier. The properties of these tips are encouraging for their
use as laser-triggered electron sources in applications such as ultrafast electron microscopy
and diffraction and novel photonics-based laser accelerators. Emission is stable for bunch charges
up to 400 electrons per laser pulse. We infer a normalized emittance of < 0.20~nm~rad and a normalized
brightness of > $1.2 \cdot 10^{12} \text{A} \text{ m}^{-2} \text{ sr}^{-1}$.
