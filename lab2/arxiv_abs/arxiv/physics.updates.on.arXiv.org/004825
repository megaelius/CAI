This paper presents an experimental study on thermal transport to single water droplets evaporating
on heated bi-phobic surfaces consisting of a superhydrophobic matrix with a circular hydrophobic
pattern with strong contact line pinning. A single water droplet of 8 ul volume is placed on a preheated
surface and allowed to evaporate in an open laboratory environment. We investigate the influence
of substrate orientation (horizontal and vertical) on evaporation dynamics. Using optical and
infrared imaging, we report droplet fluid dynamics and heat transfer characteristics of the evaporating
droplet. Overall, evaporation is more efficient on the vertical surface, exhibiting higher total
heat transfer rates and up to 10% shorter evaporation times. Counterintuitively, on the vertical
surface, the substrate-droplet interfacial heat flux was higher near the lower contact line than
in the upper region, despite a high contact angle and an expected wedge effect at the bottom. At the
same time, the temperature is colder in the lower part of the droplet. We attribute this apparent
anomaly to the competition between sensible heating and evaporation, and a modified convective
flow signature (both within the droplet and the gas phase) compared to a horizontal surface. We also
show that the thermal signature becomes uniform once the contact angles at the upper and lower contact
lines become equal towards the end of the evaporation process. Insights from this work can guide
the design of spray cooling devices, or be used to alter particle deposition patterns during evaporation-based
fabrication techniques and ink-jet printing.
