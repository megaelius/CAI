We present Vehicle Energy Dataset (VED), a novel large-scale dataset of fuel and energy data collected
from 383 personal cars in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. This open dataset captures GPS trajectories
of vehicles along with their time-series data of fuel, energy, speed, and auxiliary power usage.
A diverse fleet consisting of 264 gasoline vehicles, 92 HEVs, and 27 PHEV/EVs drove in real-world
from Nov, 2017 to Nov, 2018, where the data were collected through onboard OBD-II loggers. Driving
scenarios range from highways to traffic-dense downtown area in various driving conditions and
seasons. In total, VED accumulates approximately 374,000 miles. We discuss participant privacy
protection and develop a method to de-identify personally identifiable information while preserving
the quality of the data. After the de-identification, we conducted case studies on the dataset to
investigate the impacts of factors known to affect fuel economy and identify energy-saving opportunities
that hybrid-electric vehicles and eco-driving techniques can provide. The case studies are supplemented
with a number of examples to demonstrate how VED can be utilized for vehicle energy and behavior studies.
Potential research opportunities include data-driven vehicle energy consumption modeling,
driver behavior modeling, machine and deep learning, calibration of traffic simulators, optimal
route choice modeling, prediction of human driver behaviors, and decision making of self-driving
cars. We believe that VED can be an instrumental asset to the development of future automotive technologies.
