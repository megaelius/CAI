The so-called rotational mixing, which transports angular momentum and chemical elements in stellar
radiative zones, is one of the key processes for modern stellar evolution. In the two last decades,
the stress has been put on the turbulent transport induced by the vertical shear instability. However,
the instabilities of horizontal shears and the strength of the anisotropic turbulent transport
they may trigger are still largely unknown. In this paper, we investigate the combined effects of
stable stratification, rotation, and thermal diffusion on the instabilities of horizontal shears
in the context of stellar radiative zones. The eigenvalue problem describing the instabilities
of a flow with a hyperbolic-tangent horizontal shear profile is solved numerically and asymptotically
by means of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) analysis to provide explicit asymptotic
dispersion relations in non-diffusive and highly diffusive limits. Two types of instabilities
are identified: the inflectional and the inertial instabilities. The inflectional instability
is most unstable at finite streamwise wavenumber and zero vertical wavenumber, independently
of the stratification, rotation, and thermal diffusion. It is favored by stable stratification
but stabilized by thermal diffusion. The inertial instability is driven by rotation and the WKBJ
analysis reveals that the growth rate reaches its maximum in the inviscid limit: $\sqrt{f(1-f)}$
(where $f$ is the dimensionless Coriolis parameter). The inertial instability for finite vertical
wavenumber is stabilized as the stratification increases for non-diffusive fluids, while it becomes
independent of the stratification and stronger for fluids with high thermal diffusivity. Furthermore,
we found a self-similarity of the instabilities based on the rescaled parameter $PeN^{2}$ with
the P\'eclet number $Pe$ and the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency $N$.
