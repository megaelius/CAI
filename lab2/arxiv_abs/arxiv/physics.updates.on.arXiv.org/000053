This paper presents a new joint inversion approach to shape-based inverse problems. Given two sets
of data from distinct physical models, the main objective is to obtain a unified characterization
of inclusions within the spatial domain of the physical properties to be reconstructed. Although
our proposed method generally applies to many types of inversion problems, the main motivation
here is to characterize subsurface contaminant source-zones by processing down gradient hydrological
data and cross-gradient electrical resistance tomography (ERT) observations. Inspired by Newton's
method for multi-objective optimization, we present an iterative inversion scheme that suggests
taking descent steps that can simultaneously reduce both data-model misfit terms. Such an approach,
however, requires solving a non-smooth convex problem at every iteration, which is computationally
expensive for a pixel-based inversion over the whole domain. Instead, we employ a parametric level
set (PaLS) technique that substantially reduces the number of underlying parameters, making the
inversion computationally tractable. The performance of the technique is examined and discussed
through the reconstruction of source zone architectures that are representative of dense non-aqueous
phase liquid (DNAPL) contaminant release in a statistically homogenous sandy aquifer. In these
examples, the geometric configuration of the DNAPL mass is considered along with additional information
about its spatial variability within the contaminated zone, such as the identification of low and
high saturation regions. Comparison of the reconstructions with the true DNAPL architectures
highlights the superior performance of the model-based technique and joint inversion scheme.
