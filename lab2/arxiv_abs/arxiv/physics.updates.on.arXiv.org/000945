In high magnetic field calculations, anisotropic Gaussian type orbital (AGTO) basis functions
are capable of reconciling the competing demands of the spherically symmetric Coulombic interaction
and cylindrical magnetic ($B$ field) confinement. However, the best available {\it a priori} procedure
for composing highly accurate AGTO sets for atoms in a strong $B$ field [Phys.\ Rev. A {\bf 90}, 022504
(2014)] yields very large basis sets. Their size is problematical for use in any calculation with
unfavorable computational cost scaling. Here we provide an alternative constructive procedure.
It is based upon analysis of the underlying physics of atoms in $B$ fields that allows identification
of several principles for the construction of AGTO basis sets. Aided by numerical optimization
and parameter fitting, followed by fine tuning of fitting parameters, we devise formulae for generating
accurate AGTO basis sets in an arbitrary $B$ field. For the hydrogen iso-electronic sequence, a
set depends on $B$ field strength, nuclear charge, and upon orbital quantum numbers. For multi-electron
systems, the basis set formulae also include adjustment to account for orbital occupations. Tests
of the new basis sets for atoms H through C ($1 \le Z \le 6$), and ions Li$^+$, Be$^+$, and B$^+$, in a
wide $B$ field range ($0 \le B \le 2000$ a.u.), show an accuracy better than a few $\mu$H for single-electron
systems, and a few hundredths to a few mHs for multi-electron atoms. The relative errors are similar
for different atoms and ions in a large $B$ field range, from a few to a couple of tens of millionths,
thereby confirming rather uniform accuracy across the nuclear charge $Z$ and $B$ field strength
values. Residual basis set errors are two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic
correlation energies in muti-electron atoms ...
