Recently extended from the modern theory of electric polarization, quantized multipole topological
insulators (QMTIs) describe higher-order multipole moments, lying in nested Wilson loops, which
are inherently quantized by lattice symmetries. Overlooked in the past, QMTIs reveal new types
of gapped boundaries, which themselves represent lower-dimensional topological phases and host
topologically protected zero-dimensional (0D) corner states. Inspired by these pioneering theoretical
predictions, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the experimental observation of topological
quantized quadrupole phase in a variety of two dimensional (2D) metamaterials. However, due to
stringent requirements of anti-commuting reflection symmetries in crystals, it has been challenging
to achieve higher-order quantized multipole moments, such as octupole moments, in a realistic
three-dimensional (3D) structure. Here, we overcome these challenges, and experimentally realize
the acoustic analogue of a quantized octupole topological insulator (QOTIs) using negatively
coupled resonators. We confirm by first-principle studies that our design possesses a quantized
octupole topological phase, and experimentally demonstrate spectroscopic evidence of a topological
hierarchy of states in our metamaterial, observing 3rd order corner states, 2nd order hinge states
and 1st order surface states. Furthermore, we reveal topological phase transitions from higher-
to lower-order multipole moments in altered designs of acoustic TIs. Our work offers a new pathway
to explore higher-order topological states (HOTSs) in 3D classical platforms.
