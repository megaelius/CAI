We experimentally investigate the influence of alternating rough and smooth walls on bubbly drag
reduction (DR). We apply rough sandpaper bands of width $s$ between $48.4\,mm$ and $148.5\,mm$,
and roughness height $k = 695\,{\mu}m$, around the smooth inner cylinder (IC) of the Twente Turbulent
Taylor-Couette facility. Between sandpaper bands, the IC is left uncovered over similar width
$s$, resulting in alternating rough and smooth bands, a constant pattern in axial direction. We
measure the DR in water that originates from introducing air bubbles to the fluid at (shear) Reynolds
numbers $\textit{Re}_s$ ranging from $0.5 \times 10^6$ to $1.8 \times 10^6$. Results are compared
to bubbly DR measurements with a completely smooth IC and an IC that is completely covered with sandpaper
of the same roughness $k$. The outer cylinder is left smooth for all variations. Results are also
compared to bubbly DR measurements where a smooth outer cylinder is rotating in opposite direction
to the smooth IC. This counter rotation induces secondary flow structures that are very similar
to those observed when the IC is composed of alternating rough and smooth bands. For the measurements
with roughness, the bubbly DR is found to initially increase more strongly with $\textit{Re}_s$,
before levelling off to reach a value that no longer depends on $\textit{Re}_s$. This is attributed
to a better axial distribution of the air bubbles, resulting from the increased turbulence intensity
of the flow compared to flow over a completely smooth wall at the same $\textit{Re}_s$. The air bubbles
are seen to accumulate at the rough wall sections in the flow. Here, locally, the drag is largest and
so the drag reducing effect of the bubbles is felt strongest. Therefore, a larger maximum value of
bubbly DR is found for the alternating rough and smooth walls compared to the completely rough wall.
