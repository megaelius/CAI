We investigate the possibility of realizing a spintronic memristive device based on the dependence
of the tunnel conductance on the relative angle between the magnetization of the two magnetic electrodes
in in-plane magnetized tunnel junctions. For this, it is necessary to design a free layer whose magnetization
can be stabilized along several or even any in-plane direction between the parallel and the antiparallel
magnetic configurations. We experimentally show that this can be achieved by exploiting antiferromagnet-ferromagnet
exchange interactions in a regime where the antiferromagnet is thin enough to induce enhanced coercivity
and no exchange bias. The frustration of exchange interactions at the interfaces due to competing
ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions is at the origin of an isotropic dissipation mechanism
yielding isotropic coercivity. From a modeling point of view, it is shown that this isotropic dissipation
can be described by a dry friction term in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The influence
of this dry friction term on the magnetization dynamics of an in-plane magnetized layer submitted
to a rotating in-plane field is investigated both analytically and numerically. The possibility
to control the free layer magnetization orientation in an in-plane magnetized magnetic tunnel
junction by using the spin transfer torque from an additional perpendicular polarizer is also investigated
through macrospin simulation. It is shown that the memristor function can be achieved by the injection
of current pulses through the stack in the presence of an in-plane static field transverse to the
reference layer magnetization, the aim of which is to limit the magnetization rotation between
0{\deg} and 180{\deg}.
