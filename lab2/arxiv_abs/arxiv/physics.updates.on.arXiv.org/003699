An electrodynamical coupled cluster (CC) methodology starting from a covariant formalism and
an equal time approximation is presented here. It is based on the Dirac-Fock picture of the electron
and positron fields in Coulomb gauge. The formalism first leads to different physical interactions
from the use of an exponential cluster operator for radiative effects. Lamb, Breit and hyperfine
interactions are obtained. Next, relativistic many-body effects are determined using the matter
cluster in a way familiar from the nonrelativistic CC. This step can be nontrivial. By allowing the
matter cluster to deviate from its traditional excitation-only form, vacuum polarization effects
are generated using the pair part of Coulomb interaction. The resulting ground state correlation
energy includes both relativistic and QED corrections, the latter including contributions from
Lamb, Breit, hyperfine and vacuum polarization effects. The many-electron part of the theory is
explicitly formulated for closed shell species. The conservatism of the second step indicates
that extensions to multireference and state-specific cases are possible. To illustrate the CC
approach, expressions are derived for relativistic and QED corrections to the orbital energies,
configuration energies and the ground state correlation energy from a minimal basis calculation
on noninteracting H2 molecules without affecting size-consistency. Because spinors of nonzero
orbital angular momentum are absent, the spin-orbit interaction and Lamb shift corrections vanish
in this example. However, one finds the kinetic energy correction, Darwin terms and corrections
to the two-electron interaction in relativistic energy values through order mc2(fsc)4Z4, and
Breit interaction energy and hyperfine splitting of levels as QED effects through the same order.
Pair energies are explicitly shown through the lowest possible orders.
