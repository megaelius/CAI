Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are believed to be effective in producing shocks in the solar corona
and the interplanetary space. One of the important signatures of shocks and shock acceleration
are Type II solar radio bursts that drift with the shock speed and produce bands of plasma fundamental
and higher harmonic radio emission. An intriguing aspect of Type II radio bursts is the occasional
split of a harmonic band into thinner lanes, known as band-splitting. Here, we report a detailed
imaging and spectroscopic observation of a CME-driven shock producing band-splitting in a Type
II burst. Using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), we examine the spatial and temporal relation of
the Type II burst to the associated CME event, use source imaging to calculate the apparent coronal
density, and demonstrate how source imaging can be used to estimate projection effects. We consider
two widely accepted band-splitting models that make opposing predictions regarding the locations
of the true emission sources with respect to the shock front. Our observations suggest that the locations
of the upper and lower sub-band sources are spatially separated by $\sim 0.2 \pm 0.05 \, \mathrm{R_\odot}$.
However, we quantitatively show, for the first time, that such separation is consistent with radio-wave
scattering of plasma radio emission from a single region, implying that the split-band Type II sources
could originate from nearly co-spatial locations. Considering the effects of scattering, the
observations provide supporting evidence for the model that interprets the band-splitting as
emission originating in the upstream and downstream regions of the shock front, two virtually co-spatial
areas.
