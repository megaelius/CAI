Tungsten is the main candidate material for plasma-facing armour components in future fusion reactors.
In service, bombardment with energetic neutrons will create collision cascades that leave behind
lattice defects. Helium, injected from the plasma and produced by transmutation, strongly interacts
with these defects, modifying their behaviour and retention. Helium-ion-implantation provides
an effective tool for examining helium-defect interactions and their effect on the properties
of tungsten armour. We use nano-indentation to probe the mechanical properties of the shallow helium-ion-implanted
layer. Comparison of spherical indents in unimplanted and helium-implanted regions of the same
single crystal shows a large increase in hardness and substantial pile-up in the implanted material.
The complex lattice distortions beneath indents are probed non-destructively using 3D-resolved
synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction. Reduced lattice rotations and indentation-induced residual
strains in the ion-implanted material indicate a more confined plastic zone. This is confirmed
by HR-EBSD and TEM observations. Together our results suggest that dislocation motion is initially
obstructed by helium-induced defects. The obstacle strength of these defects is reduced by the
passage of dislocations, leading to a strain-softening and slip channel formation. A constitutive
law for 3D crystal plasticity finite element simulations is developed based on this hypothesis.
Simulations of the indentation process successfully capture the helium-implantation induced
changes in deformation behaviour observed in experiments. Importantly, the effects we observe
are markedly different from previous observations for self-ion-implanted tungsten, highlighting
that the exact nature of the implantation damage plays a critical role in determining mechanical
property change.
