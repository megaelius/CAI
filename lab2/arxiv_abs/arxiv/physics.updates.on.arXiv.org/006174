The settling behaviour of small inertial particles in turbulent convection is a fundamental problem
across several disciplines, from geophysics to metallurgy. In a geophysical context, the settling
of dense crystals controls the mode of solidification of magma chambers and planetary-scale magma
oceans, while rising of light bubbles of volatiles drives volcanic outgassing and the formation
of primordial atmospheres. Motivated by these geophysical systems, we perform a systematic numerical
study on the settling rate of particles in a rectangular two-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard system
with Rayleigh number up to 10^12 and Prandtl number from 10 to 50. Under the idealized condition of
spherically-shaped particles with small Reynolds number, two limiting behaviours exist for the
settling velocity. On the one hand, Stokes' law applies to particles with small but finite response
time, leading to a constant settling rate. On the other hand, particles with a vanishing response
time are expected to settle at an exponential rate. Based on our simulations, we present a new physical
model that bridges the gap between the above limiting behaviours by describing the sedimentation
of inertial particles as a random process with two key components: i) the transport of particles
from vigorously convecting regions into sluggish, low-velocity "piles" that naturally develop
at the horizontal boundaries of the system, and ii) the probability that particles escape such low-velocity
regions without settling at their base. In addition, we identify four distinct settling regimes
and analyze the horizontal distribution of sedimented particles. For two of these regimes settling
is particularly slow and the distribution is strongly non-uniform, with dense particles being
deposited preferentially below major clusters of upwellings.
