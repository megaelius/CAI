Turbulent boundary layers under adverse pressure gradients are studied using well-resolved large-eddy
simulations (LES) with the goal of assessing the influence of the streamwise pressure development.
Near-equilibrium boundary layers were identified with the Clauser parameter $\beta$. The pressure
gradient is imposed by prescribing the free-stream velocity. In order to fulfill the near-equilibrium
conditions, the free-stream velocity has to follow a power-law distribution. The turbulence statistics
pertaining to cases with a constant Clauser pressure-gradient parameter ? were compared with cases
with a non-constant pressure distribution at matched ? and friction Reynolds number Re_tau . It
was noticed that the non-constant cases appear to approach far downstream a certain state of the
boundary layer, which is uniquely characterised by beta? and Re_tau. The investigations on the
flat plate were extended to the flow around a wing section. Comparisons with the flat-plate cases
at matched Re_tau and ? revealed some interesting features: In turbulent boundary layers with strong
pressure gradients in the development history the energy-carrying structures in the outer region
are strongly enhanced, which can be detected by the pronounced wake in the mean velocity as well as
the large second peak in the Reynolds stresses. Furthermore, a scaling law suggested by Kitsios
et al. (2015), proposing the edge velocity and displacement thickness as scaling parameters, was
tested on a constant pressure gradient case. The mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles were
found to be dependent on the downstream development, indicating that their conclusion might be
the result of a too short constant pressure gradient region.
