The central theme of this work is that a stable levitation of a denser non-magnetizable liquid droplet,
against gravity, inside a relatively lighter ferrofluid -- a system barely considered in ferrohydrodynamics
-- is possible, and exhibits unique interfacial features; the stability of the levitation trajectory,
however, is subject to an appropriate magnetic field modulation. We explore the shapes and the temporal
dynamics of a plane non-magnetizable droplet levitating inside ferrofluid against gravity due
to a spatially complex, but systematically generated, magnetic field in two dimensions. The effect
of the viscosity ratio, the stability of the levitation path and the possibility of existence of
multiple-stable equilibrium states is investigated. We find, for certain conditions on the viscosity
ratio, that there can be developments of cusps and singularities at the droplet surface; this phenomenon
we also observe experimentally and compared with the simulations. Our simulations closely replicate
the singular projection on the surface of the levitating droplet. Finally, we present an dynamical
model for the vertical trajectory of the droplet. This model reveals a condition for the onset of
levitation and the relation for the equilibrium levitation height. The linearization of the model
around the steady state captures that the nature of the equilibrium point goes under a transition
from being a spiral to a node depending upon the control parameters, which essentially means that
the temporal route to the equilibrium can be either monotonic or undulating. The analytical model
for the droplet trajectory is in close agreement with the detailed simulations. (See draft for full
