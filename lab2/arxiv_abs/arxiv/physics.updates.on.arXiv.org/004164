A supersonic flow of magnetized plasma is produced by the application of a 1 MA-peak, 500 ns current
pulse to a cylindrical arrangement of parallel wires, known as an inverse wire array. The plasma
flow is produced by the JxB acceleration of the ablated wire material, and a magnetic field of several
Tesla is embedded at source by the driving current. This setup has been used for a variety of experiments
investigating the interactions of magnetized plasma flows. In experiments designed to investigate
magnetic reconnection, the collision of counter-streaming flows, carrying oppositely directed
magnetic fields, leads to the formation of a reconnection layer in which we observe ions reaching
temperatures much greater than predicted by classical heating mechanisms. The breakup of this
layer under the plasmoid instability is dependent on the properties of the inflowing plasma, which
can be controlled by the choice of the wire array material. In other experiments, magnetized shocks
were formed by placing obstacles in the path of the magnetized plasma flow. The pile-up of magnetic
flux in front of a conducting obstacle produces a magnetic precursor acting on upstream electrons
at the distance of the ion inertial length. This precursor subsequently develops into a steep density
transition via ion-electron fluid decoupling. Obstacles which possess a strong private magnetic
field affect the upstream flow over a much greater distance, providing an extended bow shock structure.
In the region surrounding the obstacle the magnetic pressure holds off the flow, forming a void of
plasma material, analogous to the magnetopause around planetary bodies with self-generated magnetic
fields.
