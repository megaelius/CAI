We study the topological optical states in one-dimensional (1D) dimerized ultracold atomic chains,
as an extension of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. By taking the fully retarded near-field
and far-field dipole-dipole interactions into account, we describe the system by an effective
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, vastly different from the Hermitian Hamiltonian of the conventional
SSH model. We analytically calculate the complex bandstructures for infinitely long chains, and
show that the topological invariant, i.e., the complex Zak phase, is still quantized and becomes
nontrivial when the dimerization parameter $\beta>0.5$, despite the broken chiral symmetry and
non-Hermiticity. We have verified the validity of the bulk-boundary correspondence for this non-Hermitian
system by further analyzing the eigenstate distributions along with their inverse participation
ratios (IPRs) for finite chains, where topologically protected edge states are unambiguously
identified. We also reveal that such topological edge states are robust under symmetry-breaking
disorders. For transverse eigenstates, we further discover the increase of localization length
of topological edge states with the increase of lattice period due to the presence of strong far-field
dipole-dipole interactions. Moreover, the ultra-strong scattering cross section and ultra-narrow
linewidth of a single cold atom allow us to observe in more detail about topological states than in
conventional systems, such as the frequency shift with respect to the single-atom resonance and
the largely tunable bandgap. We envisage these topological photonic states can provide an efficient
interface between light and matter.
