In this paper we leave the neighborhood of the singularity at the origin and turn to the singularity
at the horizon. Using nonlinear superdistributional geometry and supergeneralized functions
it seems possible to show that the horizon singularity is not only a coordinate singularity without
leaving Schwarzschild coordinates. However the Tolman formula for the total energy $E$ of a static
and asymptotically flat spacetime,gives $E=mc^2$, as it should be. New class Colombeau solutions
to Einstein field equations is obtained.New class Colombeau solutions to Einstein field equations
is obtained. The vacuum energy density of free scalar quantum field ${\Phi}$ with a distributional
background spacetime also is considered.It has been widely believed that, except in very extreme
situations, the influence of acceleration on quantum fields should amount to just small, sub-dominant
contributions. Here we argue that this belief is wrong by showing that in a Rindler distributional
background spacetime with distributional Levi-Civit\`a connection the vacuum energy of free
quantum fields is forced, by the very same background distributional space-time such a Rindler
distributional background space-time, to become dominant over any classical energy density component.This
semiclassical gravity effect finds its roots in the singular behavior of quantum fields on a Rindler
distributional space-times with distributional Levi-Civit\`a connection. In particular we
obtain that the vacuum fluctuations $<{\Phi}^2({\delta})>$ have a singular behavior at a Rindler
horizon $\delta = 0$.Therefore sufficiently strongly accelerated observer burns up near the Rindler
horizon. Thus Polchinski account does not violate of the Einstein equivalence principle.
