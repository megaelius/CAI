To better understand the inner workings of information spreading, network researchers often use
simple models to capture the spreading dynamics. But most models only highlight the effect of local
interactions on the global spreading of a single information wave, and ignore the effects of interactions
between multiple waves. Here we take into account the effect of multiple interacting waves by using
an agent-based model in which the interaction between information waves is based on their novelty.
We analyzed the global effects of such interactions and found that information that actually reaches
nodes reaches them faster. This effect is caused by selection between information waves: slow waves
die out and only fast waves survive. As a result, and in contrast to models with non-interacting information
dynamics, the access to information decays with the distance from the source. Moreover, when we
analyzed the model on various synthetic and real spatial road networks, we found that the decay rate
also depends on the path redundancy and the effective dimension of the system. In general, the decay
of the information wave frequency as a function of distance from the source follows a power law distribution
with an exponent between -0.2 for a two-dimensional system with high path redundancy and -0.5 for
a tree-like system with no path redundancy. We found that the real spatial networks provide an infrastructure
for information spreading that lies in between these two extremes. Finally, to better understand
the mechanics behind the scaling results, we provide analytic calculations of the scaling for a
one-dimensional system.
