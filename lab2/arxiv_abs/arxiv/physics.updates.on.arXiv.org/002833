We investigate the weakly nonlinear dynamics of transient gravity waves at infinite depth under
the influence of a shear current varying linearly with depth. An analytical solution is permitted
via integration of the Euler equations. Although similar problems were investigated in the 1960's
and 70's for special cases of resonance, this is to our knowledge the first general wave interaction
(mode coupling) solution derived to second order with a shear current present. Wave interactions
are integrable in a spectral convolution to yield the second order dynamics of initial value problems.
To second order, irrotational wave dynamics interacts with the background vorticity field in a
way that creates new vortex structures. A notable example is the large parallel vortices which drive
Langmuir circulation as oblique plane waves interact with an ocean current. We also investigate
the effect on wave pairs which are misaligned with the shear current. In contrast to a conjecture
by Leibovich (1983) we find similar, but skewed, vortex structures in every case except when the
mean wave direction is perpendicular to the direction of the current. Similar nonlinear wave-shear
interactions are found to also generate near-field vortex structures in the Cauchy-Poisson problem
with an initial surface elevation. These interactions create further groups of dispersive ring
waves in addition to those present in linear theory. The second order solution is derived in a general
manner which accommodates any initial condition through mode coupling over a continuous wave spectrum.
It is therefore applicable to a range of problems including special cases of resonance. As a by--product
of the general theory, a simple expression for the Stokes drift due to a monochromatic wave propagating
at oblique angle with a current of uniform vorticity is derived, for the first time to our knowledge.
