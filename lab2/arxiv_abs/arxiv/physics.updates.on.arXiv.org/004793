Chaotic whispering-gallery modes have significance both for optical applications and for our
understanding of the interplay between wave phenomena and the classical ray limit in the presence
of chaotic dynamics and openness. In strongly non-convex geometries, a theorem by Mather rules
out the existence of invariant curves in phase space corresponding to rays circulating in whispering-gallery
patterns, so that no corresponding modes of this type are expected. Here we discuss numerical computations
of the electromagnetic fields in planar dielectric cavities that are strongly non-convex becausethey
are coupled to waveguides. We find a family of special states which retains many features of the chaotic
whispering-gallery modes known from convex shapes: an intensity pattern corresponding to near-grazing
incidence along extended parts of the boundary, and comparatively high cavity Q factors. The modes
are folded into a figure-eight pattern, so overlap with the boundary is reduced in the region of self-intersection.
The periodic orbits describing grazing incidence at the boundary are unstable and do not lie on invariant
curves in phase space. However, no single periodic orbit can explain the observed intensity patterns.
The modes combine the phenomenology of chaotic whispering-gallery modes with an important technological
advantage: the ability to directly attach waveguides without spoiling the Q factor of the folded
mode. Using both a boundary-integral method and the FDTD technique, we explore the dependence of
the phenomenon on wavelength in relation to cavity size, refractive-index contrast to the surrounding
medium, and the degree of shape deformation. A novel feature that distinguishes folded from regular
whispering gallery modes is that a given shape will support high-Q folded chaotic whispering gallery
modes only in certain wavelength windows.
