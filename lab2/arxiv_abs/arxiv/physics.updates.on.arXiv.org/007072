Seeds have been packed in a dielectric barrier device where cold atmospheric plasma has been generated
to improve their germinative properties. A special attention has been paid on understanding the
resulting plasma electrical properties through an equivalent electrical model whose experimental
validity has been demonstrated here. In this model, the interelectrode gap is subdivided into 4
types of elementary domains, according to whether they contain electric charges (or not) and according
to their type of medium (gas, seed or insulator). The model enables to study the influence of seeds
on the plasma electrical properties by measuring and deducing several parameters (charge per filament,
gas capacitance, plasma power, ...) either in no-bed configuration (i.e. no seed in the reactor)
or in packed-bed configuration (seeds in the reactor). In that second case, we have investigated
how seeds can influence the plasma electrical parameters considering six specimens of seeds (beans,
radishes, corianders, lentils, sunflowers and corns). The influence of molecular oxygen (0-100
sccm) mixed with a continuous flow rate of helium (2 slm) is also investigated, especially through
filaments breakdown voltages, charge per filament and plasma power. It is demonstrated that such
bed-packing drives to an increase in the gas capacitance, to a decrease in the beta-parameter and
to variations of the filaments' breakdown voltages in a seed-dependent manner. Finally, we show
how the equivalent electrical model can be used to assess the total volume of the contact points,
the capacitance of the seeds in the packed-bed configuration and we demonstrate that germinative
effects can be induced by plasma on four of the six agronomical specimens.
