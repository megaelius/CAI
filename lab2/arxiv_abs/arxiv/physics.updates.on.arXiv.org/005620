The rapidly emerging technology of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) opens new opportunities
for the development of non-planar non-insulated HTS magnets. This type of HTS magnet offers attractive
features via its simplicity, robustness, and is well-suited for modest size steady-state applications
such as a mid-scale stellarator. In non-planar coil applications the HTS tape may be subject to severe
minor-axis bending strain ($\epsilon_{bend}$), torsional strains ($\epsilon_{tor}$) and transverse
magnetic field components ($B_\perp$), all of which can limit the magnet operating space. A novel
method of winding angle optimization is here presented to overcome these limitations. Essentially,
this method: 1) calculates the peak {\epsilon}bend and B\perp for arbitary winding angle along
an input coil filamentary trajectory, 2) defines a cost function including both, and then 3) uses
tensioned splines to define a winding angle that reduces $\epsilon$tor and optimizes the {\epsilon}bend
and $B_\perp$ cost function. As strain limits are present even without $B_\perp$, this optimization
is able to provide an assessment of the minimimum buildable size of an arbitrary non-planar non-insulating
HTS coil. This optimization finds that for standard 4 mm wide HTS tapes the minimum size coils of the
existing HSX, NCSX, and W7-X stellarator geometries are around 0.3 - 0.5 m in radius. For coils larger
than this size, permitting a finite (yet tolerable) strain allows reduction of $B_\perp$. This
enables a reduction of the HTS tape length required to achieve a given design magnetic field or equivalently
an increase in the achievable magnetic field for fixed HTS tape length. The distinct considerations
for optimizing a stellarator coilset to further ease compatibility with non-insulated HTS magnets
are also discussed.
