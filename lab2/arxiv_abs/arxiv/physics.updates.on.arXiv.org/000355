Precipitation seasonality of observational datasets and CMIP5 historical simulations are analyzed
using novel quantitative measures based on information theory. Two new indicators, the relative
entropy (RE) and the dimensionless seasonality index (DSI), together with the mean annual rainfall,
are evaluated on a global scale for recently updated precipitation gridded datasets and for historical
simulations from coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. The RE provides a measure
of how peaked the shape of the annual rainfall curve is whereas the DSI quantifies the intensity of
the rainfall during the wet season. The global monsoon regions feature the largest values of the
DSI. For precipitation regimes featuring one maximum in the monthly rain distribution the RE is
related to the duration of the wet season. We show that the RE and the DSI are measures of rainfall seasonality
fairly independent of the time resolution of the precipitation data, thereby allowing objective
metrics for model intercomparison and ranking. Regions with different precipitation regimes
are classified and characterized in terms of RE and DSI. We show that observational datasets may
differ substantially in their local representation of seasonality. Most of the models overestimate
the RE over a wide subtropical region ranging from western Sahara up to the Indus basin and over southern
Australia, and underestimate it in the Western African monsoon and Siberian region. It is shown
that the GCMs' positive RE bias is associated with an excessively peaked monthly rainfall distribution
whereas their negative bias is due to a positive precipitation bias before the start and after the
end of the wet season.
