Absolute gravimeters are used in geodesy, geophysics, and physics for a wide spectrum of applications.
Stable gravimetric measurements over timescales from several days to decades are required to provide
relevant insight into geophysical processes. Instrumental accuracy is established by the comparison
with a reference apparatus. However, since no reference gravimeter of higher-order accuracy currently
exists, absolute gravimeters participate in group comparisons led by the International Committee
for Weights and Measures. The construction of stationary, large scale atom interferometers paves
the way towards new absolute gravimetry references with a potential stability better than 1 nm/s$^2$
at 1 s integration time. At the Leibniz University Hannover, we are currently building such a very
long baseline atom interferometer with a 10 m long interaction zone. The knowledge of local gravity
and its gradient along and around the baseline is required to establish the instrument's accuracy
budget and enable transfers of gravimetric measurements to nearby devices for comparison and calibration
purposes. We therefore established a control network for relative gravimeters and repeatedly
measured its connections during the construction of the atom interferometer. We additionally
developed a 3D model of the host building and studied the impact of mass changes due to hydrology on
the gravity field around the reference instrument. The adjusted model fits the results of the latest
gravimetric measurement campaign with 95% confidence, opening the way for transfers of gravimetric
measurements beyond the 10 nm/s$^2$ level.
