Forced convection cooling is important in numerous technologies ranging from microprocessors
in data centers to turbines and engines; active cooling is essential in these situations. However,
active transfer of heat or thermal energy under a large temperature difference promptly destroys
the exergy, which is the free-energy component of thermal energy, and this issue has remained unaddressed.
Herein, we describe a thermoelectrochemical conversion to partially recover presently lost exergy
in forced convection cooling. We design a test cell in which an electrolyte liquid is forced through
a channel formed between two parallel electrodes and the hot-side electrode simulates an object
to be cooled. Our investigations show that the narrower interelectrode channels afford higher
cooling and power generation performances. The mass transfer resistance is the most dominant type
of resistance for all the conditions tested and the charge transfer kinetics is likely to be controlled
by viscosity. The dependence of the generated power on the flow rate is caused by the change in the
diffusion coefficient of redox species with temperature. As an evaluation measure for such forced-flow
thermocells, the gain (\Lambda) --defined as the ratio of the generated power to the hydrodynamic
pumping work required to force the liquid through the cell-- is introduced. \Lambda is above unity
in a certain flow rate region. This demonstrates that such a system can generate more electric power
than the pump work required to drive the liquid through the cell, suggesting its potential to partly
recover presently lost exergy of thermal energy as electricity.
