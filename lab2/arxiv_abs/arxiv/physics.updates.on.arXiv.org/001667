A novel approach is presented for group statistical analysis of diffusion weighted MRI datasets
through voxelwise Orientation Distribution Functions (ODF). Recent advances in MRI acquisition
make it possible to use high quality diffusion weighted protocols (multi-shell, large number of
gradient directions) for routine in vivo study of white matter architecture. The dimensionality
of these data sets is however often reduced to simplify statistical analysis. While these approaches
may detect large group differences, they do not fully capitalize on all acquired image volumes.
Incorporation of all available diffusion information in the analysis however risks biasing the
outcome by outliers. Here we propose a statistical analysis method operating on the ODF, either
the diffusion ODF or fiber ODF. To avoid outlier bias and reliably detect voxelwise group differences
and correlations with demographic or behavioral variables, we apply the Low-Rank plus Sparse (L
+ S) matrix decomposition on the voxelwise ODFs which separates the sparse individual variability
in the sparse matrix S whilst recovering the essential ODF features in the low-rank matrix L. We demonstrate
the performance of this ODF L + S approach by replicating the established negative association between
global white matter integrity and physical obesity in the Human Connectome dataset. The volume
of positive findings agrees with and expands on the volume found by TBSS, Connectivity based fixel
enhancement and Connectometry. In the same dataset we further localize the correlations of brain
structure with neurocognitive measures such as fluid intelligence and episodic memory. The presented
ODF L + S approach will aid in the full utilization of all acquired diffusion weightings leading to
the detection of smaller group differences in clinically relevant settings as well as in neuroscience
applications.
