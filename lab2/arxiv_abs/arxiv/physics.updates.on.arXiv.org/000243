We study numerically and analytically first- and second-order phase transitions in neuronal networks
stimulated by shot noise (a flow of random spikes bombarding neurons). Using an exactly solvable
cortical model of neuronal networks on classical random networks, we find critical phenomena accompanying
the transitions and their dependence on the shot noise intensity. We show that a pattern of spontaneous
neuronal activity near a critical point of a phase transition is a characteristic property that
can be used to identify the bifurcation mechanism of the transition. We demonstrate that bursts
and avalanches are precursors of a first-order phase transition, paroxysmal-like spikes of activity
precede a second-order phase transition caused by a saddle-node bifurcation, while irregular
spindle oscillations represent spontaneous activity near a second-order phase transition caused
by a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Our most interesting result is the observation of the paroxysmal-like
spikes. We show that a paroxysmal-like spike is a single nonlinear event that appears instantly
from a low background activity with a rapid onset, reaches a large amplitude, and ends up with an abrupt
return to lower activity. These spikes are similar to single paroxysmal spikes and sharp waves observed
in EEG measurements. Our analysis shows that above the saddle-node bifurcation, sustained network
oscillations appear with a large amplitude but a small frequency in contrast to network oscillations
near the Hopf bifurcation that have a small amplitude but a large frequency. We discuss an amazing
similarity between excitability of the cortical model stimulated by shot noise and excitability
of the Morris-Lecar neuron stimulated by an applied current.
