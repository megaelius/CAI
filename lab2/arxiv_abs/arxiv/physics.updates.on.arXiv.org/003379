Near-field scanning optical microscopy has been an indispensable tool for designing, characterizing
and understanding the functionalities of diverse nanoscale photonic devices. As the advances
in fabrication technology have driven the devices smaller and smaller, the demand has grown steadily
for improving its resolving power, which is determined mainly by the size of the probe attached to
the scanner. The use of a smaller probe has been a straightforward approach to increase the resolving
power, but it cannot be made arbitrarily small in practice due to the steep reduction of the collection
efficiency. Here, we develop a method to enhance the resolving power of near-field imaging beyond
the limit set by the physical size of the probe aperture. The main working principle is to unveil high-order
near-field eigenmodes invisible with conventional near-field microscopy. The destructive interference
of near-field waves is induced in these high-order eigenmodes by the locally varying phases, which
can reveal subaperture-scale fine structural details. To extract these eigenmodes, we construct
a self-interference near-field microscopy system and measure a fully phase-referenced far- to
near-field transmission matrix (FNTM) composed of near-field amplitude and phase maps recorded
for various angles of far-field illumination. By the singular value decomposition of the measured
FNTM, we could extract the antisymmetric mode, quadrupole mode, and other higher-order modes hidden
under the lowest-order symmetric mode. This enables us to resolve double and triple nano-slots
whose gap size (50 nm) is three times smaller than the diameter of the probe aperture (150 nm). The
subaperture near-field mode mapping by the FTNM can be potentially combined with various existing
near-field imaging modalities and promote their ability to interrogate local near-field optical
waves of nanoscale devices.
