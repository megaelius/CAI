Warm dense matter (WDM) -- an exotic state of highly compressed matter -- has attracted high interest
in recent years in astrophysics and for dense laboratory systems. At the same time, this state is
extremely difficult to treat theoretically. This is due to the simultaneous appearance of quantum
degeneracy, Coulomb correlations and thermal effects, as well as the overlap of plasma and condensed
phases. Recent breakthroughs are due to the successful application of density functional theory
(DFT) methods which, however, often lack the necessary accuracy and predictive capability for
WDM applications. The situation has changed with the availability of the first \textit{ab initio}
data for the exchange-correlation free energy of the warm dense uniform electron gas (UEG) that
were obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, for recent reviews, see Dornheim \textit{et
al.}, Phys. Plasmas \textbf{24}, 056303 (2017) and Phys. Rep. \textbf{744}, 1-86 (2018). In the
present article we review recent further progress in QMC simulations of the warm dense UEG: namely,
\textit{ab initio} results for the static local field correction $G(q)$ and for the dynamic structure
factor $S(q,\omega)$. These data are of key relevance for the comparison with x-ray scattering
experiments at free electron laser facilities and for the improvement of theoretical models. In
the second part of this paper we discuss simulations of WDM out of equilibrium. The theoretical approaches
include Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, quantum kinetic theory, time-dependent DFT and
hydrodynamics. Here we analyze strengths and limitations of these methods and argue that progress
in WDM simulations will require a suitable combination of all methods. A particular role might be
played by quantum hydrodynamics, and we concentrate on problems, recent progress, and possible
improvements of this method.
