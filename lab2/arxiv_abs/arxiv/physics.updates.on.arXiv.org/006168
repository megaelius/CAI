This paper presents the storm time comparative analysis of the performances of latest versions
of global ionospheric models: International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) 2016, NeQuick 2 (NeQ)
and the IRI extended to Plasmasphere (IRI-P) 2017 with respect to Navigation with Indian Constellation
(NavIC) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) derived ionospheric Total Electron Content
(TEC). The analysis is carried out under varying geomagnetic storm conditions during September
2017-November 2018, falling in the declining phase of solar cycle 24. TEC data from Indore, located
near the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) along with data obtained from
the International GNSS Service (IGS) stations at Lucknow, located beyond the anomaly crest; Hyderabad,
located between anomaly crest and magnetic equator and Bangalore, located near the magnetic equator
have been analysed. The models generally overestimated during the storm periods with the exception
of IRI-P, which matched (with an offset of about 3-5 TECU) with the enhancement observed on September
7, 2017 (during the strong storm of September 2017), from stations around the anomaly crest. No significant
match was observed by the other two models. This match of IRI-P is attributed to the plasmaspheric
contribution as well as the capability of assimilating measured TEC values into this model. In the
present study, to the best of our knowledge, first comparisons of the empirical model derived TEC
with NavIC and GNSS measurements from an anomaly crest location, combined with the IGS observations
from the magnetic equator to locations beyond the anomaly crest, are conducted during geomagnetically
disturbed conditions. Since NavIC satellites are at higher altitudes(~ 36000 km), the inclusion
of NavIC data to the existing model could give better ionospheric predictions over the Indian subcontinent.
