Avalanche phenomena leverage steeply nonlinear dynamics to generate disproportionately high
responses from small perturbations and are found in a multitude of events and materials, enabling
technologies including optical phase-conjugate imaging, infrared quantum counting, and efficient
upconverted lasing. However, the photon avalanching (PA) mechanism underlying these optical
innovations has been observed only in bulk materials and aggregates, and typically at cryogenic
temperatures, limiting its utility and impact. Here, we report the realization of PA at room temperature
in single nanostructures--small, Tm-doped upconverting nanocrystals--and demonstrate their
use in superresolution imaging at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths within spectral windows of
maximal biological transparency. Avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) can be pumped by continuous-wave
or pulsed lasers and exhibit all of the defining features of PA. These hallmarks include excitation
power thresholds, long rise time at threshold, and a dominant excited-state absorption that is
>13,000x larger than ground-state absorption. Beyond the avalanching threshold, ANP emission
scales nonlinearly with the 26th power of pump intensity. This enables the realization of photon-avalanche
single-beam superresolution imaging (PASSI), achieving sub-70 nm spatial resolution using only
simple scanning confocal microscopy and before any computational analysis. Pairing their steep
nonlinearity with existing superresolution techniques and computational methods, ANPs allow
for imaging with higher resolution and at ca. 100-fold lower excitation intensities than is possible
with other probes. The low PA threshold and exceptional photostability of ANPs also suggest their
utility in a diverse array of applications including sub-wavelength bioimaging, IR detection,
temperature and pressure transduction, neuromorphic computing, and quantum optics.
