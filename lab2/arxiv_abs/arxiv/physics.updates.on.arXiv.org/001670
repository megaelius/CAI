Purpose: A novel subspace-based reconstruction method for frequency-modulated balanced steady-state
free precession (fmSSFP) MRI is presented. In this work, suitable data acquisition schemes, subspace
sizes, and efficiencies for banding removal are investigated. Theory and Methods: By combining
a fmSSFP MRI sequence with a 3D stack-of-stars trajectory, scan efficiency is maximized as spectral
information is obtained without intermediate preparation phases. A memory-efficient reconstruction
routine is implemented by introducing the low-frequency Fourier transform as a subspace which
allows for the formulation of a convex reconstruction problem. The removal of banding artifacts
is investigated by comparing the proposed acquisition and reconstruction technique to phase-cycled
bSSFP MRI. Aliasing properties of different undersampling schemes are analyzed and water/fat
separation is demonstrated by reweighting the reconstructed subspace coefficients to generate
virtual spectral responses in a post-processing step. Results: A simple root-of-sum-of-squares
combination of the reconstructed subspace coefficients yields high-SNR images with the characteristic
bSSFP contrast but without banding artifacts. Compared to Golden-Angle trajectories, turn-based
sampling schemes were superior in minimizing aliasing across reconstructed subspace coefficients.
Water/fat separated images of the human knee were obtained by reweighting subspace coefficients.
Conclusion: The novel subspace-based fmSSFP MRI technique emerges as a time-efficient alternative
to phase-cycled bSFFP. The method does not need intermediate preparation phases, offers high SNR
and avoids banding artifacts. Reweighting of the reconstructed subspace coefficients allows
for generating virtual spectral responses with applications to water/fat separation.
