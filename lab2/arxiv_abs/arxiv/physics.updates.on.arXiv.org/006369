Simulations of a supersonic, premixed, reacting flow over a wedge were performed to investigate
the effect of a boundary layer on the wedge surface on ignition and stability of oblique detonation
waves (ODWs). Two computational domains were used: one containing a wedge of a single angle with
a straight after-body, and the other containing a double-angle wedge geometry. Both domains were
channels with a supersonic inflow of stoichiometric hydrogen-air and a nonreflecting outflow,
and the wedge was modeled using an immersed boundary method. The compressible reactive Navier-Stokes
equations were solved using a high-order numerical algorithm on an adapting grid. Inviscid and
viscous wedge surfaces were modeled using slip and no-slip adiabatic boundary conditions, respectively.
Inviscid wedge surface cases are presented for a range of inflow conditions and compared to previous
work outlining several different ODW structures. An ignition criterion is established as an accurate
method of predicting the formation of an ODW for a given inflow temperature, Mach number, wedge angle,
and length of the inviscid wedge surface. A viscous wedge surface is then considered for a Mach 5 inflow
at temperatures of 600 K, 700 K, and 800 K. The 600 K flow ignites in the boundary layer, but does not
detonate, while the 700 K and 800 K flows ignite and form ODWs. It was determined that ODW formation
depends on the degree of augmentation of the leading oblique shock wave by the burning boundary layer
and that ODW formation is therefore predictable based on the ignition criterion. The 700 K flow produces
a unique oscillatory mode of a receding ODW followed by a redetonation event occurring near the leading
edge. A mechanism for this cycle, which repeats indefinitely, is proposed.
