This work deals with exact solutions to the wave equations. We start by introducing the Non-Diffracting
Waves (NDW), and by a definition of NDWs. Afterwards we recall -besides ordinary waves (gaussian
beams, gaussian pulses)- the simplest non diffracting waves (Bessel beams, X-shaped pulses,...).
In Sec.2 we show how to eliminate any backward-traveling components, first in the case of ideal NDW
pulses, and then, in Sec.3, for realistic finite-energy NDW pulses. In particular, in subsec.3.1
we forward a general functional expression for any totally-forward non-diffracting pulses. Then,
in Sec.4 an efficient method is set forth for the analytic description of truncated beams, a byproduct
of its being the elimination of any need of lengthy numerical calculations. In Sec.5 we explore the
question of the subluminal NDWs, or bullets, in terms of two different methods, the second one allowing
the analytic description of non-diffracting waves with a static envelope ("Frozen Waves", FW),
in terms of continuous Bessel beam superpositions. The production of such Frozen Waves (experimentally
generated in recent time for Optics) is theoretically developed in Sec.6 also for the case of absorbing
media. Sec.7 discusses the role of Special Relativity and of Lorentz transformations, relevant
for the physical comprehension of the NDW issue. In Sec.8 we present further analytic solutions
to the wave equations, with use of higher-order Bessel beams. Next, Sec.9 deals in detail with an
application of NDWs to Optical Tweezers. In Sec.10 we show that "soliton-like" solutions can be
found also in the different case of the ordinary linear Schroedinger equation within standard Quantum
Mechanics. Some complementary issues are just mentioned in the last Section. This work also constitutes
a part of a much longer Review in preparation.
