Thin films of inorganic materials as Tin-doped indium oxide, titanium oxide, Niobium doped titanium
oxide, were deposited for comparison on glass and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates
with a DC sputtering method. These thin films have been characterized by different techniques:
Dektak Surface Profilometer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, (UV/Vis/NIR) spectrophotometer
and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The optical parameters of these films such as transmittance,
reflectance, refractive index, extinction coefficient, energy gap obtained with different electronic
transitions, real and imaginary ({\epsilon}_r,{\epsilon}_i) dielectric constants, were determined
in the wavelengths range of (200 - 2200) nm. The results were compared with SE measurements in the
ranges of (0.56- 6.19) eV by a new amorphous model with steps of 1 nm. SE measurements of optical constant
have been examined and confirm the accuracy of the (UV/Vis/NIR) results. The optical properties
indicate an excellent transmittance in the visible range of (400 - 800) nm. The average transmittance
of films on glass is about (86%, 91%, 85%) for (ITO, TiO2, TiO2:Nb (NTO)) respectively and decreases
to about (85%, 81%, 82%) for PET substrates. For all these materials the optical band gap for direct
transition was (3.53, 3.3, 3.6) eV on glass substrates and on PET substrates using two methods (UV
and SE). A comparison between optical constants and thickness of these ultrathin films observed
gives an excellent agreement with the UV results. The deposited films were also analyzed by XRD and
showed an amorphous structure. The structural morphology of these thin films has been investigated
and compared.
