Resistive Plate Chambers are used in the ATLAS experiment for the muon trigger and two coordinate
measurements in the central region. In preparation for the coming years of LHC running at higher
luminosity, besides the New Small Wheel project which is expected to complement the ATLAS muon spectrometer
in the endcap regions, a smaller size project, known as BIS78, is being developed with a foreseen
installation during the LHC Long Shutdown 2. The BIS78 project will reinforce the fake muon rejection
and the selectivity of the muon trigger in the transition region between the ATLAS barrel and end-caps
by adding 32 RPC triplets on the edges of the Inner Barrel even sectors (BIS7 and BIS8) as this region
is characterized by high rate due to secondary charged tracks generated by beam halo protons and
a lack of detector instrumentation. Due to the narrow available space, the project foresees to replace
the existing Monitored Drift Tubes, used for the precise position measurement in this area, with
muon stations formed by integrated smaller diameter tubes and a new generation of RPCs, capable
of withstanding the higher rates and provide a robust standalone muon confirmation. These new RPCs
are based on novel design of the gas volume with a thinner gas gap and resistive electrodes, a lower
operating voltage and new high gain front-end electronics with respect to the legacy RPCs. Besides
the use in Run-3 and onwards, this project is also of particular relevance as a pilot test for the HL-LHC
upgrade when an additional full layer of new RPC triplets is expected to complement the full barrel
region in the innermost plane. The core of the project is presented, together with a description
of the production and the test results. Details on the detector infrastructure and services along
with a roadmap towards the final installation and commissioning during the Long Shutdown 2 are also
discussed.
