A novel hybrid deep neural network architecture is designed to capture the spatial-temporal features
of unsteady flows around moving boundaries directly from high-dimensional unsteady flow fields
data. The hybrid deep neural network is constituted by the convolutional neural network (CNN),
improved convolutional Long-Short Term Memory neural network (ConvLSTM) and deconvolutional
neural network (DeCNN). Flow fields at future time step can be predicted through flow fields by previous
time steps and boundary positions at those steps by the novel hybrid deep neural network. Unsteady
wake flows around a forced oscillation cylinder with various amplitudes are calculated to establish
the datasets as training samples for training the hybrid deep neural networks. The trained hybrid
deep neural networks are then tested by predicting the unsteady flow fields around a forced oscillation
cylinder with new amplitude. The effect of neural network structure parameters on prediction accuracy
was analyzed. The hybrid deep neural network, constituted by the best parameter combination, is
used to predict the flow fields in the future time. The predicted flow fields are in good agreement
with those calculated directly by computational fluid dynamic solver, which means that this kind
of deep neural network can capture accurate spatial-temporal information from the spatial-temporal
series of unsteady flows around moving boundaries. The result shows the potential capability of
this kind novel hybrid deep neural network in flow control for vibrating cylinder, where the fast
calculation of high-dimensional nonlinear unsteady flow around moving boundaries is needed.
