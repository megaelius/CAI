The future proton-proton collider (FCC-hh) will deliver collisions at a center of mass energy up
to $\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV at an unprecedented instantaneous luminosity of $L=3~10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$,
resulting in extremely challenging radiation and luminosity conditions. By delivering an integrated
luminosity of few tens of ab$^{-1}$, the FCC-hh will provide an unrivalled discovery potential
for new physics. Requiring high sensitivity for resonant searches at masses up to tens of TeV imposes
strong constraints on the design of the calorimeters. Resonant searches in final states containing
jets, taus and electrons require both excellent energy resolution at multi-TeV energies as well
as outstanding ability to resolve highly collimated decay products resulting from extreme boosts.
In addition, the FCC-hh provides the unique opportunity to precisely measure the Higgs self-coupling
in the di-photon and b-jets channel. Excellent photon and jet energy resolution at low energies
as well as excellent angular resolution for pion background rejection are required in this challenging
environment. This report describes the calorimeter studies for a multi-purpose detector at the
FCC-hh. The calorimeter active components consist of Liquid Argon, scintillating plastic tiles
and Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors technologies. The technological choices, design considerations
and achieved performances in full Geant4 simulations are discussed and presented. The simulation
studies are focused on the evaluation of the concepts. Standalone studies under laboratory conditions
as well as first tests in realistic FCC-hh environment, including pileup rejection capabilities
by making use of fast signals and high granularity, have been performed. These studies have been
performed within the context of the preparation of the FCC conceptual design reports (CDRs).
