We report on electron removal calculations for 2.81 keV/amu Li$^{3+}$ and O$^{3+}$ ion collisions
with neon dimers. The target is described as two independent neon atoms fixed at the dimer's equilibrium
bond length, whose electrons are subjected to the time-dependent bare and screened Coulomb potentials
of the classically moving Li$^{3+}$ and O$^{3+}$ projectile ions, respectively. Three mutually
perpendicular orientations of the dimer with respect to the rectilinear projectile trajectories
are considered and collision events for the two ion-atom subsystems are combined in an impact parameter
by impact parameter fashion and are orientation-averaged to calculate probabilities and cross
sections for the ion-dimer system. The coupled-channel two-center basis generator method is used
to compute the ion-atom collision problems. We concentrate on one-electron and two-electron removal
processes resulting in the Ne$^+(2s^{-1})$ + Ne$^0$, Ne$^+(2p^{-1})$ + Ne$^+(2p^{-1})$, and
Ne$^+(2p^{-2})$ + Ne$^0$ channels right after the collision, which can be associated with interatomic
Coulomb decay, Coulomb explosion, and radiative charge transfer, respectively. We find that the
calculated relative yields are in fair agreement with recent experimental data for O$^{3+}$-Ne$_2$
collisions if we represent the projectile by a screened Coulomb potential, but disagree markedly
for a bare Coulomb potential, i.e., for Li$^{3+}$ impact. In particular, our calculations suggest
that interatomic Coulomb decay is a significant reaction channel in the former case only, since
capture of a Ne($2s$) electron to form hydrogenlike Li$^{2+}$ is unlikely.
