Cooperation is one of the behavioral traits that define human beings, however we are still trying
to understand why humans cooperate. Behavioral experiments have been largely conducted to shed
light into the mechanisms behind cooperation and other behavioral traits. However, most of these
experiments have been conducted in laboratories with highly controlled experimental protocols
but with varied limitations which limits the reproducibility and the generalization of the results
obtained. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, some experimental approaches have moved
human behavior experimentation from laboratories to public spaces, where behaviors occur naturally,
and have opened the participation to the general public within the citizen science framework. Given
the open nature of these environments, it is critical to establish the appropriate protocols to
maintain the same data quality that one can obtain in the laboratories. Here, we introduce Citizen
Social Lab, a software platform designed to be used in the wild using citizen science practices.
The platform allows researchers to collect data in a more realistic context while maintaining the
scientific rigour, and it is structured in a modular and scalable way so it can also be easily adapted
for online or brick-and-mortar experimental laboratories. Following citizen science guidelines,
the platform is designed to motivate a more general population into participation, but also to promote
engaging and learning of the scientific research process. We also review the main results of the
experiments performed using the platform up to now, and the set of games that each experiment includes.
Finally, we evaluate some properties of the platform, such as the heterogeneity of the samples of
the experiments and their satisfaction level, and the parameters that demonstrate the robustness
of the platform and the quality of the data collected.
