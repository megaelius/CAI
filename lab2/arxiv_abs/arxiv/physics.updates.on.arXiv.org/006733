Spontaneous symmetry breaking and formation of self-organized structures in nonlinear systems
are intriguing and important phenomena in nature. Advancing such research to new nonlinear optical
regimes is of much interest for both fundamental physics and practical applications. Here we propose
a scheme to realize optical pattern formation in a cold Rydberg atomic gas via electromagnetically
induced transparency. We show that, by coupling two Rydberg states with a microwave field (microwave
dressing), the nonlocal Kerr nonlinearity of the Rydberg gas can be enhanced significantly and
may be tuned actively. Based on such nonlocal Kerr nonlinearity, we demonstrate that a plane-wave
state of probe laser field can undergo a modulation instability (MI) and hence spontaneous symmetry
breaking, which may result in the emergence of various self-organized optical patterns. Especially,
we find that a hexagonal lattice pattern (which is the only optical pattern when the microwave dressing
is absent) may develop into several types of square lattice ones when the microwave dressing is applied;
moreover, as a outcome of the MI the formation of nonlocal optical solitons is also possible in the
system. Different from earlier studies, the optical patterns and nonlocal optical solitons found
here can be flexibly manipulated by adjusting the effective probe-field intensity, nonlocality
degree of the Kerr nonlinearity, and the strength of the microwave field. Our work opens a route for
versatile controls of self-organizations and structural phase transitions of laser light, which
may have potential applications in optical information processing and transmission.
