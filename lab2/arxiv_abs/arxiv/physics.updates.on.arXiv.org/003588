Alfven Eigenmodes and magneto-hydrodynamic modes are destabilized in DIII-D reverse magnetic
shear configurations and may limit the performance of the device. We use the reduced MHD equations
in a full 3D system, coupled with equations of density and parallel velocity moments for the energetic
particles (with gyro-fluid closures) as well as the geodesic acoustic wave dynamics. The aim of
the study consists in finding ways to avoid or minimize MHD and AE activity for different magnetic
field configurations and neutral beam injection operational regimes. The simulations show at
the beginning of the discharge, before the reverse shear region is formed, a plasma that is AE unstable
and marginally MHD stable. As soon as the reverse shear region appears, ideal MHD modes are destabilized
with a larger growth rate than the AEs. Both MHD modes and AEs coexist during the discharge, although
the MHD modes are more unstable as the reverse shear region deepens. The simulations indicate the
destabilization of Beta induced AE, Toroidal AE, Elliptical AE and Reverse Shear AE at different
phases of the discharges. A further analysis of the NBI operational regime indicates that the AE
stability can be improved if the NBI injection is off axis, because on-axis injection leads to AEs
with larger growth rate and frequency. In addition, decreasing the beam energy or increasing the
NBI relative density leads to AEs with larger growth rate and frequency, so an NBI operation in the
weakly resonant regime requires higher beam energies than in the experiment. The MHD linear stability
can be also improved if the reverse shear region and the q profile near the magnetic axis are in between
the rational surfaces q=2 and q=1, particularly if there is a region in the core with negative shear,
avoiding a flat q profile near the magnetic axis.
