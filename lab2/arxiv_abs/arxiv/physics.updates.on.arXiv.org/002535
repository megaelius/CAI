The goal of this study is to develop an efficient numerical algorithm applicable to a wide range of
compressible multicomponent flows. Although many highly efficient algorithms have been proposed
for simulating each type of the flows, the construction of a universal solver is known to be challenging.
Extreme cases, such as incompressible and highly compressible flows, or inviscid and highly viscous
flows, require different numerical treatments in order to maintain the efficiency, stability,
and accuracy of the method. Linearized block implicit (LBI) factored schemes are known to provide
an efficient way of solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations implicitly, allowing us
to avoid stability restrictions at low Mach number and high viscosity. However, the methods' splitting
error has been shown to grow and dominate physical fluxes as the Mach number goes to zero. In this paper,
a splitting error reduction technique is proposed to solve the issue. A novel finite element shock-capturing
algorithm, proposed by Guermond and Popov, is reformulated in terms of finite differences, extended
to the stiffened gas equation of state (SG EOS) and combined with the LBI factored scheme to stabilize
the method around flow discontinuities at high Mach numbers. A novel stabilization term is proposed
for low Mach number applications. The resulting algorithm is shown to be efficient in both low and
high Mach number regimes. The algorithm is extended to the multicomponent case using an interface
capturing strategy with surface tension as a continuous surface force. Numerical tests are presented
to verify the performance and stability properties for a wide range of flows.
