We propose using a directional time-varying (rotating) driving magnetic field to suppress magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor
(MRT) instability in dynamic Z-pinches. A rotational drive magnetic field is equivalent to two
magnetic-field components, {\Theta} and Z, that alternate in time, referred to as an alternate
Theta-Z-pinch configuration. We consider the finitely thick cylindrical liner configuration
in this paper. We numerically integrate the perturbation equation to stagnation time based on the
optimal background unperturbed trajectories. We assess the cumulative growth of the dominant
mode selected by some mechanism at the beginning of an implosion. The maximum e-folding number at
stagnation of the dominant mode of an optimized alternate Theta-Z-pinch is significantly lower
than that of the standard Theta- or Z-pinch. The directional rotation of the magnetic field contributes
to suppress the instabilities, independent of the finite thickness. The finite thickness effect
plays a role only when the orientation of the magnetic field varies in time whereas it does not appear
in the standard Theta- or Z-pinch. The rotating frequency of the magnetic field and the thickness
of liner are both having a monotonic effect on suppression. Their synergistic effect can enhance
the suppression on MRT instability. Because the MRT instability can be well suppressed in this way,
the alternate Theta-Z-pinch configuration has potential applications in liner inertial fusion.
