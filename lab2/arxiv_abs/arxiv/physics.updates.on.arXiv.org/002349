The Cluster mission, launched in 2000, has produced a large database of electron flux intensity
measurements in the Earths magnetosphere by the Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detector
(RAPID)/ Imaging Electron Spectrometer (IES) instrument. However, due to background contamination
of the data with high-energy electrons (>400 keV) and inner- zone protons (230-630 keV) in the radiation
belts and ring current, the data have been rarely used for inner-magnetospheric science. The current
paper presents two algorithms for background correction. The first algorithm is based on the empirical
contamination percentages by both protons and electrons. The second algorithm uses simultaneous
proton observations. The efficiencies of these algorithms are demonstrated by comparison of the
corrected Cluster/RAPID/IES data with Van Allen Probes/Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS)
measurements for 2012-2015. Both techniques improved the IES electron data in the radiation belts
and ring current.Yearly averaged flux intensities of the two missions show the ratio of measurements
close to 1. IES corrected measurements were also compared with Arase Medium-Energy Particle Experiments-Electron
Analyzer (MEP-e) electron data during two conjunction periods in 2017 and also exhibited ratio
close to 1. We demonstrate a scientific application of the corrected IES electron data analyzing
its evolution during solar cycle. Spin-averaged yearly mean IES electron intensities in the outer
belt for energies 40-400 keV at L-shell between 4 and 6 showed high positive correlation with AE index
and solar wind dynamic pressure during 2001- 2016. Relationship between solar wind dynamic pressure
and IES electron measurements in the outer radiation belt was derived as a uniform linear-logarithmic
equation.
