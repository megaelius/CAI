The surface ligands on colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) play an important role in the performance of
NCs based optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic cells, photodetectors and light emitting
diodes (LEDs). On one hand, the NC emission depends critically on the passivation of the surface
to minimize trap states that can provide non-radiative recombination channels. On the other hand,
the electrical properties of NC films are dominated by the ligands that constitute the barriers
for charge transport from one NC to its neighbor. Therefore, surface modifications via ligandexchange
have been employed to improve the conductance of NC films. However, in light emitting devices, such
surface modifications are more critical due to their possible detrimental effects on the emission
properties. In this work, we study the role of surface ligand modifications on the optical and electrical
properties of CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods (DiRs) in films, and investigate their performance in all-solution
processed LEDs. The DiR films maintain high PLQY, around 40-50%, and their electroluminescence
in the LED preserves the excellent color purity of the PL. In the LEDs, the ligand-exchange boosted
the luminance, reaching a four-fold increase from 2200 cd/m2 for native surfactants to 8500 cd/m2
for the exchanged aminoethanethiol ligands. Moreover, the efficiency roll-off, operational
stability, and shelf life are significantly improved, and the external quantum efficiency is modestly
increased from 5.1 % to 5.4 %. We relate these improvements to the increased conductivity of the emissive
layer, and to the better charge balance of the electrically injected carriers. In this respect,
we performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to obtain deeper insight in the band
alignment of the LED structure.
