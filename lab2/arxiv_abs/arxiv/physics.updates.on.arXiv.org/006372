It is tempting to treat frequency trends from the Google Books data sets as indicators of the "true"
popularity of various words and phrases. Doing so allows us to draw quantitatively strong conclusions
about the evolution of cultural perception of a given topic, such as time or gender. However, the
Google Books corpus suffers from a number of limitations which make it an obscure mask of cultural
popularity. A primary issue is that the corpus is in effect a library, containing one of each book.
A single, prolific author is thereby able to noticeably insert new phrases into the Google Books
lexicon, whether the author is widely read or not. With this understood, the Google Books corpus
remains an important data set to be considered more lexicon-like than text-like. Here, we show that
a distinct problematic feature arises from the inclusion of scientific texts, which have become
an increasingly substantive portion of the corpus throughout the 1900s. The result is a surge of
phrases typical to academic articles but less common in general, such as references to time in the
form of citations. We highlight these dynamics by examining and comparing major contributions
to the statistical divergence of English data sets between decades in the period 1800--2000. We
find that only the English Fiction data set from the second version of the corpus is not heavily affected
by professional texts, in clear contrast to the first version of the fiction data set and both unfiltered
English data sets. Our findings emphasize the need to fully characterize the dynamics of the Google
Books corpus before using these data sets to draw broad conclusions about cultural and linguistic
evolution.
