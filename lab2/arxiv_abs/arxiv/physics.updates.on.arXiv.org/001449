At this time, the design of the International Linear Collider (ILC) is optimized for e+e- collisions;
the photon collider (gamma-gamma and gamma-electron) is considered as an option. Unexpected discoveries,
such as the diphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the construction
of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision option, the ILC design should
be compatible with it from the very beginning. In this paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing
angle. In the ILC technical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough space
for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions, the crossing angle must
be larger because the low-energy electrons that result from multiple Compton scattering get large
disruption angles in collisions with the opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal
detector field. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad. In this paper,
we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as well as its minimum permissible value
that does not yet cause a considerable reduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that
the best solution is to increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \mum (which is optimal for
2E=500 GeV) to 2 \mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma luminosities at a crossing
angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable for e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation
of the e+e- luminosity and opens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same
tunnel (e.g., CLIC). Moreover, the 2 \mum wavelength is optimal for a 2E = 1 TeV collider, e.g., a possible
ILC energy upgrade. Please consider this paper an appeal to increase the ILC crossing angle from
14 to 20 mrad.
