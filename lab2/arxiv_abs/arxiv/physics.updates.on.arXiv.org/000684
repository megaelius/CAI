In the past decades, many efforts have been devoted to the temporal manipulation of waves, especially
focusing on slowing down their propagation. In electromagnetism, from microwave to optics, as
well as in acoustics or for elastic waves, slow wave propagation indeed largely benefits both applied
and fundamental physics. It is for instance essential in analog signal computing through the design
of components such as delay lines and buffers, and it is one of the prerequisite for increased wave/matter
interactions. Despite the interest of a broad community, researches have mostly been conducted
in optics along with the development of wavelength scaled structured composite media, that appear
promising candidates for compact slow light components. Yet their minimum structural scale prevents
them from being transposed to lower frequencies where wavelengths range from sub-millimeter to
meters. In this article, we propose to overcome this limitation thanks to the deep sub-wavelength
scale of locally resonant metamaterials. In our approach, implemented here in the microwave regime,
we show that introducing coupled resonant defects in such composite media allows the creation of
deep sub-wavelength waveguides. We experimentally demonstrate that waves, while propagating
in such waveguides, exhibit largely reduced group velocities. We qualitatively explain the mechanism
underlying this slow wave propagation and first experimentally demonstrate, then numerically
verify, how it can be taken advantage of to tune the velocity, achieving group indices ng as high as
227 over relatively large bandwidths. We conclude by highlighting the three beneficial consequences
of our line defect slow wave waveguides in locally resonant metamaterials: the deep sub-wavelength
scale, the very large group indices and the fact that slow wave propagation does not occur at the expense
of drastic bandwidth reductions.
