We present a numerical study of detonation propagation in unconfined explosive charges shaped
as an annular arc (rib). Steady detonation in a straight charge propagates at constant speed but
when it enters an annular section, it goes through a transition phase and eventually reaches a new
steady state of constant angular velocity. This study examines the speed of the detonation wave
along the annular charge during the transition phase and at steady state, as well as its dependence
on the dimensions of the annulus. The system is modeled using a recently proposed diffuse-interface
formulation which allows for the representation of a two-phase explosive and of an additional inert
material. The explosive considered is the polymer-bonded TATB-based LX-17 and is modeled using
two JWL equations of state and the Ignition and Growth reaction rate law. Results show that steady
state speeds are in good agreement with experiment. In the transition phase, the evolution of outer
detonation speed deviates from the exponential bounded growth function suggested by previous
studies. We propose a new description of the transition phase which consists of two regimes. The
first is caused by local effects at the outer edge of the annulus and leads to a dependence of outer
detonation speed on angular position along the arc. The second regime is induced by effects originating
from the inner edge of the annular charge and leads to the deceleration of the outer detonation until
steady state is reached. The study concludes with a parametric study where the dependence of the
steady state and the transition phase on the dimensions of the annulus is investigated.
