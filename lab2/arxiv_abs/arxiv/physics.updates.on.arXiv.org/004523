Human traffic along roads can be a major vector for infectious diseases and invasive species. Understanding
how many agents travel and which routes they choose is key to successful management of diseases and
invasions. Stochastic gravity models have been used to estimate the distribution of trips between
origins and destinations of agents. However, in large-scale systems it is hard to collect the data
required to fit these models, as the number of long-distance travellers is small and origins and
destinations can have multiple access points. Therefore, gravity models often provide only relative
measures of the agent flow. Furthermore, gravity models yield no insights into which roads agents
use. We develop a combined stochastic gravity and route choice model for road traffic. We introduce
this hybrid approach in general terms and demonstrate its benefits by applying it to the potential
invasion of zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) to the Canadian province British Columbia
(BC). The spread of these mussels is facilitated by traffic of boaters transporting propagules
from invaded to uninvaded lakes. The model allows absolute predictions of agent traffic and yields
insights into which roads agents use. Applying the approach, we identify the most significant sources
of potential mussel vectors and the waterbodies in BC that are threatened most. Furthermore, we
show the roads along which most boaters enter BC. The hybrid model can be fitted with survey data collected
at roads that are used by many long-distance travellers. This decreases the required sampling effort
so that more data are available to fit the model. As a consequence, the model yields accurate predictions
even in large-scale systems, and the model can be validated rigorously. The model's predictions
can be used to understand the spread and facilitate the management of infectious diseases and invasive
species.
