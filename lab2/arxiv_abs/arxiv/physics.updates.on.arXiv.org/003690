DNA supercoiling, the under or overwinding of DNA, is a key physical mechanism both participating
to compaction of bacterial genomes and making genomic sequences adopt various structural forms.
DNA supercoiling may lead to the formation of braided superstructures (plectonemes), or it may
locally destabilize canonical B-DNA to generate denaturation bubbles, left-handed Z-DNA and
other functional alternative forms. Prediction of the relative fraction of these structures has
been limited because of a lack of predictive polymer models that can capture the multiscale properties
of long DNA molecules. In this work, we address this issue by extending the self-avoiding rod-like
chain model of DNA so that every site of the chain is allocated with an additional structural degree
of freedom reflecting variations of DNA forms. Efficient simulations of the model reveal its relevancy
to capture multiscale properties of long chains (here up to 21 kb) as reported in magnetic tweezers
experiments. Well-controlled approximations further lead to accurate analytical estimations
of thermodynamic properties in the high force regime, providing, in combination with experiments,
a simple, yet powerful framework to infer physical parameters describing alternative forms. In
this regard, using simulated data, we find that extension curves at forces above 2 pN may lead, alone,
to erroneous parameter estimations as a consequence of an underdetermination problem. We thus
revisit published data in light of these findings and discuss the relevancy of previously proposed
sets of parameters for both denatured and left-handed DNA forms. Altogether, our work paves the
way for a scalable quantitative model of bacterial DNA.
