The scientific community has witnessed an exponential increase in the applications of graphene
and graphene-based materials in a wide range of fields. For what concerns neuroscience, the interest
raised by these materials is two-fold. On one side, nanosheets made of graphene or graphene derivatives
(graphene oxide, or its reduced form) can be used as carriers for drug delivery. Here, an important
aspect is to evaluate their toxicity, which strongly depends on flake composition, chemical functionalization
and dimensions. On the other side, graphene can be exploited as a substrate for tissue engineering.
In this case, conductivity is probably the most relevant amongst the various properties of the different
graphene materials, as it may allow to instruct and interrogate neural networks, as well as to drive
neural growth and differentiation. In this review, we try to give a comprehensive view of the accomplishments
and new challenges of the field, as well as which in our view are the most exciting directions to take
in the immediate future. These include the need to engineer multifunctional nanoparticles able
to cross the blood-brain-barrier to reach neural cells, and to achieve on-demand delivery of specific
drugs. We describe the state-of-the-art in the use of graphene materials to engineer three-dimensional
scaffolds to drive neuronal growth and regeneration in vivo, and the possibility of using graphene
as a component of hybrid composites/multi-layer organic electronics devices. Last but not least,
we address the need of an accurate theoretical modeling of the interface between graphene and biological
material, by modeling the interaction of graphene with proteins and cell membranes at the nanoscale,
and describing the physical mechanism(s) of charge transfer by which the various graphene materials
can influence the excitability and physiology of neural cells.
