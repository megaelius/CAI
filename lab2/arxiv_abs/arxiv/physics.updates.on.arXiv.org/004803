A technical note is given regarding our previous laboratory plasma-astrophysical studies [C.-S.
Jao et al., High Energy Density Physics 32, 31-43 (2019) and Y. Chen et al., Nucl. Instrum. Methods
Phys. Res., Sect. A 903, 119 (2018)]. In this note, an upgraded accelerator beamline design is proposed
based on a feasible experimental setup in a realistic laboratory environment. The improved design
aims to provide milliampere (mA) mega-electron-volt (MeV) quasi-continuous (cw) electron beams
for plasma-astrophysical applications. Such a design utilizes a so-called mixed-guiding-field
magnetic system right after the cut disk structure (CDS) booster cavity to provide a periodic longitudinal
focusing field. The transportation of the produced cw beam with large energy spread to the plasma
cell location is improved. The magnetic field serves as well as a seeding field in the plasma environment
for the growth of electromagnetic instabilities. In conjunction with the appliance of a circular
collimator at the exit of the CDS, the new design allows production of quasi-cw beams with a three
orders higher number density at the entrance of the plasma cell compared to the previous design for
a seeding magnetic field of about 50 mT while the locally enhanced electric field at the cathode is
up to 8 GV/m. The associated beam dynamics simulation results are presented. As proof of principle
studies, the produced electron beams are applied in nonlinear plasma-astrophysical simulations
for exploring the growth of the instabilities. The extracted parameters and/or distributions
from the generated electron beams in the laboratory environment are used in these particle-in-cell
simulations. The obtained results are presented and discussed.
