Biopolymer length regulation is a complex process that involves a large number of subprocesses
acting simultaneously across multiple spatial and temporal scales. An illustrative example important
for genomic stability is the length regulation of telomeres---nucleo-protein structures at the
ends of linear chromosomes. Maintenance of telomeres is often facilitated by the enzyme telomerase
but, particularly in telomerase-free systems, the maintenance of chromosomal termini depends
on alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanisms mediated by recombination. Various
linear and circular DNA structures were identified to participate in ALT, however, dynamics of
the whole process is still poorly understood. We propose a chemical kinetics model of ALT with kinetic
rates systematically derived from the biophysics of DNA diffusion and looping. The reaction system
is reduced to a coagulation-fragmentation system by quasi-steady state approximation. The detailed
treatment of kinetic rates yields explicit formulae for expected size distributions of telomeres
that demonstrate the key role played by the J-factor, a quantitative measure of bending of polymers.
The results are in agreement with experimental data and point out interesting phenomena: an appearance
of very long telomeric circles if the total telomere density exceeds a critical value (excess mass)
and a nonlinear response of the telomere size distributions to the amount of telomeric DNA in the
system. The results can be of general importance for understanding dynamics of telomeres in telomerase-independent
systems as this mode of telomere maintenance is similar to the situation in tumor cells lacking telomerase
activity. Furthermore, due to its universality, the model may also serve as a prototype of an interaction
between linear and circular DNA structures in various settings.
