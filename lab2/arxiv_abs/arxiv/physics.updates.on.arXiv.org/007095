Floquet-Bloch wave asymptotics is used to homogenize the in-plane mechanical response of a periodic
grillage of elastic Rayleigh rods, possessing a distributed mass density, together with rotational
inertia. The grid is subject to incremental time-harmonic dynamic motion, superimposed to a given
state of axial loading of arbitrary magnitude. In contrast to the quasi-static energy match (addressed
in Part I of the present study), the vibrational properties of the lattice are directly represented
by the acoustic tensor of the equivalent solid (without passing through the constitutive tensor).
The acoustic tensor is shown to be independent of the rods' rotational inertia and allows the analysis
of strong ellipticity of the equivalent continuum, evidencing coincidence with macro-bifurcation
in the lattice. On the other hand, micro-bifurcation corresponds to a vibration of vanishing frequency
of the lowest dispersion branch of the lattice, occurring at finite wavelength. Dynamic homogenization
reveals the structure of the acoustic branches close to ellipticity loss and the analysis of forced
vibrations (both in physical space and Fourier space) shows low-frequency wave localizations.
A comparison is presented between strain localization occurring near ellipticity loss and forced
vibration of the lattice, both corresponding to the application of a concentrated pulsating force.
The comparison shows that the homogenization technique allows an almost perfect representation
of the lattice, with the exception of cases where micro-bifurcation occurs, which is shown to leave
the equivalent solid unaffected. Therefore, the presented results pave the way for the design of
architected cellular materials to be used in applications where extreme deformations are involved.
