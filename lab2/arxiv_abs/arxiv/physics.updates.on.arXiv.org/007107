With rising shares of renewables and the need to properly assess trade-offs between transmission,
storage and sectoral integration as balancing options, building a bridge between energy system
models and detailed power flow studies becomes increasingly important, but is computationally
challenging. W compare approximations for two nonlinear phenomena, power flow and transmission
losses, in linear capacity expansion problems that co-optimise investments in generation, storage
and transmission infrastructure. We evaluate different flow representations discussing differences
in investment decisions, nodal prices, the deviation of optimised flows and losses from simulated
AC power flows, and the computational performance. By using the open European power system model
PyPSA-Eur we obtain detailed and reproducible results aiming at facilitating the selection of
a suitable power flow model. Given the differences in complexity, the optimal choice depends on
the application, the user's available computational resources, and the level of spatial detail
considered. Although the commonly used transport model can already identify key features of a cost-efficient
system while being computationally performant, deficiencies under high loading conditions arise
due to the lack of a physical grid representation. Moreover, disregarding transmission losses
overestimates optimal grid expansion by 20%. Adding a convex relaxation of quadratic losses with
two or three tangents to the linearised power flow equations and accounting for changing line impedances
as the network is reinforced suffices to represent power flows and losses adequately in design studies.
We show that the obtained investment and dispatch decisions are then sufficiently physical to be
used in more detailed nonlinear simulations of AC power flow in order to better assess their technical
feasibility.
