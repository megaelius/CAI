The aim of the experiment series was to test the influence of acceleration on time dilation by measuring
the relative spectral shift between the resonance spectra of a rotating Mossbauer absorber with
acceleration anti-parallel and parallel to the direction of the incident beam. Based on the experiences
and know-how acquired in our previous experiments, We collected data for rotation frequencies
up to 510Hz in both directions of rotation and also used different slits. For each run with high rotation,
we observed a stable statistically significant relative shift between the spectra of the two states
with opposite acceleration. This indicates the influence of acceleration on time dilation. However,
we found that this shift also depends on the choice of the slit, and on the direction of rotation. These
new unexpected findings, resulting from the loss of symmetry in obtaining the resonant lines in
the two states, could overshadow the relative shift due to acceleration. This loss of the symmetry
is caused by the deflection of the radiative decay due to the Nuclear Lighthouse effect from the rotating
Mossbauer absorber. We also found that it is impossible to keep the alignment (between the optical
and the dynamical rotor systems) with accuracy needed for such experiment, for long runs, which
resulted in the reduction of the accuracy of the observed relative shift. These prevent us to claim
with certainty the influence of acceleration on time dilation using the currently available technology.
An improved KB optics with focal spot of less than 1 micron to avoid the use of a slit and a more rigid
mounting of the rotor system, are necessary for the success of such experiment. Hopefully, these
findings together with the indispensable plan for a conclusive experiment presented in the paper,
will prove useful to future experimentalists wishing to pursue such an experiment.
