In VLSI physical design, many algorithms require the solution of difficult combinatorial optimization
problems such as max/min-cut, max-flow problems etc. Due to the vast number of elements typically
found in this problem domain, these problems are computationally intractable leading to the use
of approximate solutions. In this work, we explore the Ising spin glass model as a solution methodology
for hard combinatorial optimization problems using the general purpose GPU (GPGPU). The Ising
model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. Ising computing finds
a minimum energy state for the Ising model which essentially corresponds to the expected optimal
solution of the original problem. Many combinatorial optimization problems can be mapped into
the Ising model. In our work, we focus on the max-cut problem as it is relevant to many VLSI physical
design problems. Our method is inspired by the observation that Ising annealing process is very
amenable to fine-grain massive parallel GPU computing. We will illustrate how the natural randomness
of GPU thread scheduling can be exploited during the annealing process to create random update patterns
and allow better GPU resource utilization. Furthermore, the proposed GPU-based Ising computing
can handle any general Ising graph with arbitrary connections, which was shown to be difficult for
existing FPGA and other hardware based implementation methods. Numerical results show that the
proposed GPU Ising max-cut solver can deliver more than 2000X speedup over the CPU version of the
algorithm on some large examples, which shows huge performance improvement for addressing many
hard optimization algorithms for practical VLSI physical design.
