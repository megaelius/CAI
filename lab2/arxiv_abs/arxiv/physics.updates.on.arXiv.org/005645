Purpose: This work introduces a new lattice geometry library, egs_lattice, into the EGSnrc Monte
Carlo code, which can be used for both modeling very large (previously unfeasible) quantities of
geometries and establishing recursive boundary conditions. The reliability of egs_lattice,
as well as EGSnrc in general, is cross-validated and tested. Methods: New Bravais, cubic, and hexagonal
lattice geometries are defined in egs_lattice and their transport algorithms are described. Simulations
of cells and Gold NanoParticle (GNP) containing cavities are implemented to compare to published
Geant4-DNA and PENELOPE results. Recursive boundary conditions, implemented through a cubic
lattice, are used to perform electron Fano cavity tests. Results: Lattices are successfully implemented
in EGSnrc. EGSnrc calculated doses to cell cytoplasm and nucleus when irradiated by an internal
electron source with a median difference of 0.6% compared to Geant4-DNA. EGSnrc calculated the
ratio of dose to a microscopic cavity containing GNPs over dose to a cavity containing a homogeneous
mixture of gold, and results generally agree (within 1%) with PENELOPE. The Fano test is passed (sub-0.1%)
for all energies/ cells considered. Additionally, the recursive boundary conditions used for
the Fano test provided a factor of over a million increase in efficiency in some cases. Conclusions:
The egs_lattice geometry library, currently available as a pull request on the EGSnrc GitHub develop
branch, is now freely accessible as open-source code. Lattice geometry implementations cross-validated
with independent simulations in other MC codes and verified with the electron Fano cavity test demonstrate
not only the reliability of egs_lattice, but, by extension, EGSnrc's ability to simulate transport
in nanometer geometries and score in microscopic cavities.
