The topic of this paper is "gerrymandering", namely the curse of deliberate creations of district
maps with highly asymmetric electoral outcomes to disenfranchise voters, and it has a long legal
history. Measuring and eliminating gerrymandering has enormous implications to sustain the backbone
of democratic principles of a society. Although there is no dearth of legal briefs involving gerrymandering
over many years, it is only more recently that mathematicians and applied computational researchers
have started to investigate this topic. However, it has received relatively little attention so
far from the computational complexity researchers dealing with theoretical analysis of computational
complexity issues, such as computational hardness, approximability issues, etc. There could
be many reasons for this, such as descriptions of these problem non-CS non-math (often legal or political)
journals that theoretical CS (TCS) people usually do not follow, or the lack of coverage of these
topics in TCS publication venues. One of our modest goals in writing this article is to improve upon
this situation by stimulating further interactions between the gerrymandering and TCS researchers.
To this effect, our main contributions are twofold: (1) we provide formalization of several models,
related concepts, and corresponding problem statements using TCS frameworks from the descriptions
of these problems as available in existing non-TCS (perhaps legal) venues, and (2) we also provide
computational complexity analysis of some versions of these problems, leaving other versions
for future research. The goal of writing this article is not to have the final word on gerrymandering,
but to introduce a series of concepts, models and problems to the TCS community and to show that science
of gerrymandering involves an intriguing set of partitioning problems involving geometric and
combinatorial optimization.
