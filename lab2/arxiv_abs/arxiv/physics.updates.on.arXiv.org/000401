The GN-model has been proposed as an approximate but sufficiently accurate tool for predicting
uncompensated optical coherent transmission system performance, in realistic scenarios. For
this specific use, the GN-model has enjoyed substantial validation, both simulative and experimental.
Recently, however, it has been pointed out that its predictions, when used to obtain a detailed physical
picture of non-linear noise accumulation along a link, may be affected by substantial error. In
this paper we analyze in detail the GN-model errors and the analytical correction terms that have
been proposed to remove them. We extend such analytical results to cover single-channel non-linearity
as well, and provide integral formulas for single, cross, and multi-channel effects. Our findings
show that, when used for its original purpose of predicting system maximum reach and optimum launch
power in realistic scenarios, the GN-model provides rather reliable results, with 0.3 to 0.6 dB
error, always biased vs. being conservative. On the other hand, we also confirm prior findings that
the GN-model may substantially overestimate NLI noise when used instead to characterize NLI noise
accumulation along a link, especially in the first spans of the link. We show that previously proposed
formulas for correcting the GN-model tendency to overestimate NLI may actually substantially
underestimate it. We show why this happens and provide a new overall self-consistent analytical
model, that we call the enhanced GN-model (EGN model), which completely corrects for these problems.
We extensively validate it simulatively and discuss its computational complexity.
