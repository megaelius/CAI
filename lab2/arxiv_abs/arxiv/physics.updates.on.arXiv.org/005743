A method to quantitatively assess the consistency of power-counting proposals in Effective Field
Theories (EFT) which are non-perturbative at leading order is presented. The Renormalisation
Group evolution of an observable predicts the functional form of its residual cutoff dependence
on the breakdown scale of an EFT, on the low-momentum scales, and on the order of the calculation.
Passing this test is a necessary but not sufficient consistency criterion for a suggested power
counting whose exact nature is disputed. In Chiral Effective Field Theory (ChiEFT) with more than
one nucleon, a lack of universally accepted analytic solutions obfuscates the convergence pattern
in results. This led to proposals which predict different sets of Low Energy Coefficients (LECs)
at the same chiral order, and at times even predict a different ordering long-range contributions.
The method may independently check whether an observable is renormalised at a given order, and proves
estimates of both the breakdown scale and the momentum-dependent order-by-order convergence
pattern. Conversely, it helps identify those LECs (and long-range pieces) which ensure renormalised
observables at a given order. I also discuss assumptions and the relation to Wilson's Renormalisation
Group; useful observable and cutoff choices; the momentum window with likely best signals; its
dependence on the values and forms of cutoffs as well as on the EFT parameters; the impact of fitting
LECs to data; and caveats as well as limitations. Since the test is designed to minimise the use of
data, it quantitatively falsifies if the EFT has been renormalised consistently. This complements
other tests which quantify how an EFT compares to experiment. Its application in particular to the
3P0 and P2-3F2 partial waves of NN scattering in ChiEFT may elucidate persistent power-counting
issues.
