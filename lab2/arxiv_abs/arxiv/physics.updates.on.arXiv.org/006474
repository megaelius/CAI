The Cassini and Juno probes have revealed large coherent cyclonic vortices in the polar regions
of Saturn and Jupiter, a dramatic contrast from the east-west banded jet structure seen at lower
latitudes. Debate has centered on whether the jets are shallow, or extend to greater depths in the
planetary envelope. Recent experiments and observations have demonstrated the relevance of deep
convection models to a successful explanation of jet structure and cyclonic coherent vortices
away from the polar regions have been simulated recently including an additional stratified shallow
layer. Here we present new convective models able to produce long-lived polar vortices. Using simulation
parameters relevant for giant planet atmospheres we find flow regimes that are in agreement with
geostrophic turbulence (GT) theory in rotating convection for the formation of large scale coherent
structures via an upscale energy transfer fully three-dimensional. Our simulations generate
polar characteristics qualitatively similar to those seen by Juno and Cassini: they match the structure
of cyclonic vortices seen on Jupiter; or can account for the existence of a strong polar vortex extending
downwards to lower latitudes with a marked spiral morphology and the hexagonal pattern seen on Saturn.
Our findings indicate that these vortices can be generated deep in the planetary interior. A transition
differentiating these two polar flows regimes is described, interpreted in terms of different
force balances and compared with previous shallow atmospheric models which characterised polar
vortex dynamics in giant planets. In addition, the heat transport properties are investigated
confirming recent scaling laws obtained in the context of reduced models of GT.
