Design of microparticles which stabilize at the centerline of a channel flow when part of a dilute
suspension is examined numerically for moderate Reynolds numbers ($10 \le Re \le 80$). Stability
metrics for particles with arbitrary shapes are formulated based on linear-stability theory.
Particle shape is parametrized by a compact, Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS)-based representation.
Shape-design is posed as an optimization problem and solved using adaptive Bayesian optimization.
We focus on designing particles for maximal stability at the channel-centerline robust to perturbations.
Our results indicate that centerline-focusing particles are families of characteristic "fish"/"bottle"/"dumbbell"-like
shapes, exhibiting fore-aft asymmetry. A parametric exploration is then performed to identify
stable particle-designs at different k's (particle chord-to-channel width ratio) and Re's ($0.1
\le k \le 0.4, 10 \le Re \le 80$). Particles at high-k's and Re's are highly stabilized when compared
to those at low-k's and Re's. A comparison of the modified dumbbell designs from the current framework
also shows better performance to perturbations in Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) when compared
to the rod-disk model reported previously (Uspal & Doyle 2014) for low-Re Hele-Shaw flow. We identify
basins of attraction around the centerline, which span larger release-angle-ranges and lateral
locations (tending to the channel width) for narrower channels, which effectively standardizes
the notion of global focusing in such configurations using the current stability-paradigm. The
present framework is illustrated for 2D cases and is potentially generalizable to stability in
3D flow-fields. The current formulation is also agnostic to Re and particle/channel geometry which
indicates substantial potential for integration with imaging flow-cytometry tools and microfluidic
biosensing-assays.
