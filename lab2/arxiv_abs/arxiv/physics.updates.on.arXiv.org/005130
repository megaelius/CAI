The radiative cooling of objects during daytime under direct sunlight has recently been shown to
be significantly enhanced by utilizing nanophotonic coatings. Multilayer thin film stacks, 2D
photonic crystals, etc. as coating structures improved the thermal emission rate of a device in
the infrared atmospheric transparency window reducing considerably devices' temperature. Due
to the increased heating in photovoltaic (PV) devices, that has significant adverse consequences
on both their efficiency and life-time, and inspired by the recent advances in daytime radiative
cooling, we developed a coupled thermal-electrical modeling to examine the physical mechanisms
on how a radiative cooler affects the overall efficiency of commercial photovoltaic modules. Employing
this modeling, which takes into account all the major processes affected by the temperature variation
in a PV device, we evaluated the relative impact of the main radiative cooling approaches proposed
so far on the PV efficiency, and we established required conditions for optimized radiative cooling.
Moreover, we identified the validity regimes of the currently existing PV-cooling models which
treat the PV coolers as simple thermal emitters. Finally, we assessed some realistic photonic coolers
from the literature, compatible with photovoltaics, to implement the radiative cooling requirements,
and demonstrated their associated impact on the temperature reduction and PV efficiency. Providing
the physical mechanisms and requirements for cooling radiatively solar cells, our study provides
guidelines for utilizing suitable photonic structures as radiative coolers, enhancing the efficiency
and the lifetime of PV devices.
