We consider the control of a three-dimensional thin liquid film on a flat substrate, inclined at
a non-zero angle to the horizontal. Controls are applied via same-fluid blowing and suction through
the substrate surface. We consider both overlying and hanging films, where the liquid lies above
or below the substrate, respectively. We study the weakly nonlinear evolution of the system, which
is governed by a forced Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation in two space dimensions. The uncontrolled
problem exhibits three ranges of dynamics depending on the incline of the substrate: stable flat
film solution, bounded chaotic dynamics, or unbounded exponential growth of unstable transverse
modes. We proceed with the assumption that we may actuate at every point on the substrate. The main
focus is the optimal control problem, which we first study in the special case that the forcing may
only vary in the spanwise direction. The structure of the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation allows
the explicit construction of optimal controls in this case using the classical theory of linear
quadratic regulators. Such controls are employed to prevent the exponential growth of transverse
waves in the case of a hanging film, revealing complex dynamics for the streamwise and mixed modes.
We then consider the optimal control problem in full generality, and prove the existence of an optimal
control. For numerical simulations, we employ an iterative gradient descent algorithm. In the
final section, we consider the effects of transverse mode forcing on the chaotic dynamics present
in the streamwise and mixed modes for the case of a vertical film flow. Coupling through nonlinearity
allows us to reduce the average energy in solutions without directly forcing the linearly unstable
dominant modes.
