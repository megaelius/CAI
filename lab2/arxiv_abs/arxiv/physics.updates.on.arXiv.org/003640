We develop an approach to the theory of relativistic geometric flows and emergent gravity defined
by entropy functionals and related statistical/geometric thermodynamics models. There are considered
nonholonomic (subjected to non-integrable constraints) deformations of G. Perelman's functionals
when the W-entropy is used for deriving relativistic geometric evolution flow equations, which
(for self-similar configurations) describe generalized Ricci solitons via solutions being equivalent
to entropic modified Einstein equations. We analyse possible connections between relativistic
modifications of the Poincar\'{e}--Thurston conjecture for nonholonomic Ricci flows and the
E. Verlinde conjecture that gravity links to an entropic force as a spacetime 'elasticity'. We prove
that corresponding systems of nonlinear partial differential equations, PDEs, for entropic flows
and modified gravity posses certain general decoupling and integration properties. There are
constructed new classes of exact solutions for stationary and nonstationary configurations,
generalized black hole and locally anisotropic cosmological metrics in (entropic) modified gravity
theories, MGTs, and general relativity, GR. Such solutions describe scenarios of nonlinear geometric
evolution and/or gravitational and matter field dynamics with pattern-forming and quasiperiodic
structure and various space quasicrystal like and deformed spacetime crystal models. We analyse
new classes of generic off-diagonal solutions for entropic gravity theories and speculate how
certain physically important properties of such solutions can be used for explaining structure
formation in dark energy and dark matter physics. Finally, we speculate why the approaches with
Perelman--Lyapunov like functionals are more general or complementary to the constructions elaborated
using the concept of Bekenstein--Hawking entropy.
