The effects of volume exclusion and long-range intermolecular attraction are investigated by
the simplified kinetic model for surface-confined inhomogeneous fluids. Gas dynamics of the ideal
gas, the hard-sphere fluid and the real gas are simulated by the Boltzmann equation, the Enskog equation
and the simple kinetic equation, respectively. Only the Knudsen minimum appears for the ideal gas,
while both the Knudsen minimum and the Knudsen maximum occur for the hard-sphere fluid and the real
gas under certain confinements, beyond which the maximum and minimum may disappear. The Boltzmann
equation and the Enskog equation overestimates and underestimates the mass flow rate of the real
gas dynamics under confinement, respectively, where the volume exclusion and the long-range intermolecular
attractive potential among molecules are not ignorable. With the increase of the channel width,
gas dynamics of the hard-sphere fluid and the real gas tends to the Boltzmann prediction gradually.
The density inhomogeneity, which hinders the flow under confinement, is more obvious when the solid
fraction is larger. The anomalous slip occurs for real gas under constant confinement. The flow
at a smaller Knudsen number (larger solid fraction or channel width) contributes more practical
amount of mass transfer, although the rarefaction effects is more prominent at larger Knudsen numbers.
The temperature has no effect on density and velocity profiles of the ideal gas and the hard-sphere
fluid, but the energy parameter among the real gas molecules decreases with the increasing temperature
and the real gas dynamics tends to the hard-sphere ones consequently.
