We investigate the shock-induced turbulent mixing between a light and heavy gas, where a Richtmyer-Meshkov
instability (RMI) is initiated by a $Ma = 1.5$ shock wave. The prescribed initial conditions define
a deterministic multimode interface perturbation between light and heavy gas which can be exactly
imposed for different simulation codes and resolutions to allow for quantitative comparability.
Well-resolved Large-Eddy Simulations are performed using two different and independent numerical
methods with the objective of assessing turbulence structures, prediction uncertainties and
convergence behaviour. The two numerical methods differ fundamentally with respect to the employed
subgrid-scale regularisation, each representing state-of-the-art approaches to RMI. Unlike
previous studies the focus of the present investigation is to quantify uncertainties introduced
by the numerical method, as there is strong evidence that subgrid-scale regularisation and truncation
errors may have a significant effect on the linear and non-linear stages of the RMI evolution. Fourier
diagnostics reveal that the larger energy containing scales converge rapidly with increasing
mesh resolution and thus are in excellent agreement for the two numerical methods. Spectra of gradient
quantities, such as enstrophy and scalar dissipation rate, show stronger dependencies on the small-scale
flow field structures in consequence of truncation error effects. Spectra of density, turbulence
kinetic energy, scalar dissipation rate and enstrophy are presented and show excellent agreement
for the resolved scales. The established agreement for the large scales of the solution for two fundamentally
different numerical methods is unprecedented and serves to establish a reference data set for further
numerical analysis of the RMI evolution.
