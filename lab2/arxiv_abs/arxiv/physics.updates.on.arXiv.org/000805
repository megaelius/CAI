The vertical upwelling/diffusion model (VUDM) has historically played a key role in shaping our
ideas about how the heat balance is achieved in the ocean. Its has been and is still widely used in many
applications ranging from the estimation of transfer coefficients to the parameterisation of
ocean heat uptake in Simple Climate Models (SCMs). Its conceptual value as a realistic theoretical
model of the ocean heat balance has become increasingly unclear over the years however, because:
1) the different ways in which upwelling has been linked to high-latitude deep water formation and
downgradient diffusion linked to vertical/diapycnal mixing have remained imprecise and somewhat
ad-hoc so far; 2) other effects such as isopycnal mixing, density-compensated temperature anomalies,
meso-scale eddy-induced advection and the depth-varying ocean area have all be demonstrated to
affect actual ocean heat uptake as well, but their incorporation into existing VUDM frameworks
has been problematic. In this paper, a new process-based vertical advection/diffusion theoretical
model of ocean heat uptake is constructed that resolve all above difficulties. This new model is
obtained by coarse-graining the full three-dimensional advection/diffusion for potential temperature
carried by ocean climate models, by using the same isopycnal analysis as in the theory of ocean water
masses. The resulting model describes the temporal evolution of the isopycnally-averaged thickness-weighted
potential temperature in terms of an effective velocity that depends uniquely on the surface heating
conditionally integrated in density classes, an effective diapycnal diffusivity controlled
by isoneutral and dianeutral mixing, and an additional term linked to the meridional transport
of density-compensated temperature anomalies by the diabatic residual overturning circulation.
