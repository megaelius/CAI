Many countries face challenges like impending retirement waves, negative population growth,
or a suboptimal distribution of resources across medical sectors and fields in supplying their
healthcare systems with adequate staffing. An increasing number of countries therefore employs
quantitative approaches in health workforce supply forecasting. However, these models are often
of limited usability as they either require extensive individual-level data or become too simplistic
to capture key demographic or epidemiological factors. We propose a novel population-dynamical
and stock-flow-consistent approach to health workforce supply forecasting complex enough to
address dynamically changing behaviors while requiring only publicly available timeseries data
for complete calibration. We apply the model to 21 European countries to forecast the supply of generalist
and specialist physicians until 2040. Compared to staffing levels required to keep the physician
density constant at 2016 levels, in many countries we find a significant trend toward decreasing
density for generalist physicians at the expense of increasing densities for specialists. These
trends are exacerbated in many Southern and Eastern European countries by expectations of negative
population growth. For the example of Austria we generalize our approach to a multi-professional,
multi-regional and multi-sectoral model and find a suboptimal distribution in the supply of contracted
versus non-contracted physicians. It is of the utmost importance to devise tools for decision makers
to influence the allocation and supply of physicians across fields and sectors to combat imbalances.
