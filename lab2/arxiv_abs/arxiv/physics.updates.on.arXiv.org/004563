Geophysical fluid flows are predominantly turbulent and often strongly affected by the Earth's
rotation, as well as by stable density stratification. Using direct numerical simulations of forced
Boussinesq equations, we study the influence of these effects on the motion of fluid particles,
focusing on cases where the frequencies associated with rotation and stratification (RaS), N and
f respectively, are held at a fixed ratio $N/f=5$. As the intensity of RaS increases, a sharp transition
is observed between a regime dominated by eddies to a regime dominated by waves, which can also be
seemingly described by simply comparing the time scale 1/N and $\tau_\eta$ (the Kolmogorov time
scale). We perform a detailed study of Lagrangian statistics of acceleration, velocity and related
quantities in the two regimes. The flow anisotropy induces a clear difference between particle
motion in the horizontal and vertical directions. In the regime $N\tau_\eta < 1$, acceleration
statistics in both horizontal and vertical directions, exhibit well known characteristics of
isotropic turbulence. In contrast for $N\tau_\eta > 1$, they are directly influenced by imposed
RaS. The Lagrangian velocity statistics exhibit visible anisotropy for all runs; nevertheless
the degree of anisotropy becomes very strong in the regime $N\tau_\eta > 1$. We find that in the regime
$N\tau_\eta < 1$, rotation enhances the mean displacement of particles in horizontal planes at
short times, but inhibits them at longer times. This inhibition of horizontal displacement becomes
stronger for $N\tau_\eta>1$, with no clear diffusive behavior. Displacements in the vertical
direction are always inhibited. The inhibition becomes extremely strong when $N\tau_\eta>1$,
with the particles almost being trapped horizontally.
