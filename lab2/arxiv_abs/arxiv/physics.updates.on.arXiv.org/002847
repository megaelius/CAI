The 2D hydrodynamic model for a dust cloud confined in an axisymmetric toroidal system volumetrically
driven by an unbounded streaming plasma is further extended systematically for different aspect-ratio
of the bounded dust domain and a wide range of the kinematic viscosity. This work has demonstrated
the interplay between inertial and diffusive transport processes for the structural changes of
steady dust flow from symmetric into asymmetric nature in higher Reynolds number (Re) regimes where
flow streamlines turn more circular and the structural bifurcation takes place through a threshold
parameter. In agreement with many experimental observations, the steady vortex structure in highly
nonlinear (i.e., high Re) regime is characterized by the critical transition into a new self-similar
multiple co-rotating vortices, along with circular core region of single characteristics size
and surrounded by strongly sheared layers filled with weak vortices near the boundaries. It is further
revealed that the core region persists for a wide range of system parameters in the nonlinear regime
and its characteristic size is mainly determined by the smallest distance between the confining
boundaries. The threshold parameter, the vortex size, the strength, and the number of the self-similar
co-rotating vortices mainly depend on the aspect-ratio of the bounded dust domain. These nonlinear
solutions provide insight into the phenomena of the structural transition and coexistence of self-similar
steady co-rotating vortices in dusty plasma experiments as well as many relevant complex driven-dissipative
natural flow systems.
