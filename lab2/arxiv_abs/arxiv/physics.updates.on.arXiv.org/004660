Quantifying spinal motion during functional activities may contribute to a better understanding
of common pathologies such as spinal disorders. Therefore, the current study aimed at the comparative
evaluation of the Epionics SPINE system, a portable and cost-effective device for measuring sagittal
lumbar movement during functional activities. Twenty healthy participants were therefore evaluated
with the Epionics SPINE and a Vicon motion analysis system in two identical separate research visits.
They performed the following activities: standing, sitting, chair rising, box lifting, walking,
running and a counter movement jump (CMJ). Sagittal plane lumbar spine angles were extracted as
continuous values as well as average and range of motion (ROM) parameters. Agreement between the
systems was evaluated using Bland-Altman analyses, whereas within- and between-session reliability
were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and minimal detectable changes
(MDC). The analysis showed excellent agreement between the systems for chair rising, box lifting
and CMJ with a systematic underestimation of lumbar lordosis angles during walking and running.
Reliability was moderate to high for all continuous and discrete parameters (ICC>=0.62), except
for ROM during running (ICC=0.29). MDC values were generally below 15{\deg}, except for CMJ (peak
values up to 20{\deg} within and 25{\deg} between the sessions). The Epionics SPINE system performed
similarly to a Vicon motion capture system for measuring lumbar lordosis angles during functional
activities and showed high consistency within and between measurement sessions. These findings
can serve researchers and clinicians as a bench mark for future investigations using the system
in populations with spinal pathologies.
