In this work, we investigate an original strategy in order to derive a statistical modeling of the
interface in gas-liquid two-phase flows through geometrical variables. The con- tribution is
two-fold. First it participates in the theoretical design of a unified reduced- order model for
the description of two regimes: a disperse phase in a carrier fluid and two separated phases. The
first idea is to propose a statistical description of the in- terface relying on geometrical properties
such as the mean and Gauss curvatures and define a Surface Density Function (SDF). The second main
idea consists in using such a formalism in the disperse case, where a clear link is proposed between
local statistics of the interface and the statistics on objects, such as the number density function
in Williams-Boltzmann equation for droplets. This makes essential the use of topolog- ical invariants
in geometry through the Gauss-Bonnet formula and allows to include the works conducted on sprays
of spherical droplets. It yields a statistical treatment of populations of non-spherical objects
such as ligaments, as long as they are home- omorphic to a sphere. Second, it provides an original
angle and algorithm in order to build statistics from DNS data of interfacial flows. From the theoretical
approach, we identify a kernel for the spatial averaging of geometrical quantities preserving
the topological invariants. Coupled to a new algorithm for the evaluation of curvatures and surface
that preserves these invariants, we analyze two sets of DNS results conducted with the ARCHER code
from CORIA with and without topological changes and assess the approach.
