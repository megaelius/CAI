MXenes are 2D transition metal carbides with high potential for overcoming limitations of conventional
two-dimensional electronics. In this context, various MXenes have shown magnetic properties
suitable for applications in spintronics, yet the number of MXenes reported so far is far smaller
than their parental MAX phases. Therefore, we have studied the structural, electronic and magnetic
properties of bimetallic and vacancy-ordered MXenes derived from a new $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2AlC
$ MAX phase to assess whether MXene exfoliation would return stable magnetic materials. In particular,
we have investigated the properties of pristine and surface-functionalized $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CX_2$
bimetallic and $(V_{2/3} \square_{1/3})_2CX2$ vacancy-ordered MXenes with X = O, F and OH. Our
density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that modifying the MXene stoichiometry and/or
MXene surface functionalization changes MXene properties. After testing all possible combinations
of metallic motifs and functionalization, we identified $V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CX_2$, $(V_{2/3}\square_{1/3})_2CF_2$
and $(V_{2/3}\square_{1/3})_2C(OH)_2$ as stable structures. Among them, $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CO_2$
MXene is predicted to be an FM intrinsic half-semiconductor with a remarkably high Curie temperature
($T_C$)) of 270 K. The $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2C(OH)_2$ MXene exhibits a rather low work function
(WF) (1.37 eV) and is thus a promising candidate for ultra-low work function electron emitters.
Conversely, the $(V_{2/3}\square_{1/3})_2CF_2$ MXene has a rather high WF and hence can be used
as a hole injector for Schottky-barrier-free contact applications. Overall, our proof-of-concept
study shows that theoretical predictions of MXene exfoliation and properties support further
experimental research towards developing spintronics devices.
