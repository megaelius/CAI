Partial derivatives are used in a variety of different ways within physics. Most notably, thermodynamics
uses partial derivatives in ways that students often find confusing. As part of a collaboration
with mathematics faculty, we are at the beginning of a study of the teaching of partial derivatives,
a goal of better aligning the teaching of multivariable calculus with the needs of students in STEM
disciplines. As a part of this project, we have performed a pilot study of expert understanding of
partial derivatives across three disciplines: physics, engineering and mathematics. Our interviews
made use of the Partial Derivative Machine (PDM), which is a mechanical system featuring four observable
and controllable properties, of which any two are independent. Using the PDM, we probed expert understanding
of partial derivatives in an experimental context in which there is not a known functional form.
Through these three interviews, we found that the mathematicians exhibited a striking difference
in their understanding of derivatives relative to the other groups. The physicists and engineers
were quick to use measurements to find a numeric approximation for a derivative. In contrast, the
mathematicians repeatedly returned to speculation as to the functional form, and although they
were comfortable drawing qualitative conclusions about the system from measurements, were reluctant
to approximate the derivative through measurement. This pilot study led us to further questions.
How do fields differ in their experts' concept image of partial derivatives? What representations
of partial derivatives are preferred by experts? We plan to address these questions by means of further
interviews with a wider range of disciplinary experts.
