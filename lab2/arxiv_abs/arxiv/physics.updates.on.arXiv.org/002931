Understanding how stochastic gene expression is regulated in biological systems using snapshots
of single-cell transcripts requires state-of-the-art methods of computational analysis and
statistical inference. A Bayesian approach to statistical inference is the most complete method
for model selection and uncertainty quantification of kinetic parameters from single-cell data.
This approach is impractical because current numerical algorithms are too slow to handle typical
models of gene expression. To solve this problem, we first show that time-dependent mRNA distributions
of discrete-state models of gene expression are dynamic Poisson mixtures, whose mixing kernels
are characterized by a piece-wise deterministic Markov process. We combined this analytical result
with a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to create a hybrid numerical method that accelerates the calculation
of time-dependent mRNA distributions by 1000-fold compared to current methods. We then integrated
the hybrid algorithm into an existing Monte Carlo sampler to estimate the Bayesian posterior distribution
of many different, competing models in a reasonable amount of time. We validated our method of accelerated
Bayesian inference on several synthetic data sets. Our results show that kinetic parameters can
be reasonably constrained for modestly sampled data sets, if the model is known \textit{a priori}.
If the model is unknown,the Bayesian evidence can be used to rigorously quantify the likelihood
of a model relative to other models from the data. We demonstrate that Bayesian evidence selects
the true model and outperforms approximate metrics, e.g., Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), often used for model selection.
