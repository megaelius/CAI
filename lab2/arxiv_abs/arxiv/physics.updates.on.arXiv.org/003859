The probability to record a twisted photon produced by a cold relativistic particle bunch of charged
particles is derived. The radiation of twisted photons by such particle bunches in stationary electromagnetic
fields and in propagating electromagnetic waves is investigated. It is shown that the incoherent
radiation by bunches of particles traversing normally an isotropic dispersive medium (the edge,
transition, and Vavilov-Cherenkov radiations) and by bunches moving in a helical undulator does
not depend on the azimuthal distribution of particles in the bunch and is the same as for round bunches.
As for planar undulators, the incoherent radiation by particle bunches is the same as for the bunches
symmetric under reflection with respect to the axis of a twisted photon detector. At high energies
of recorded twisted photons, this property is universal and holds for the forward incoherent radiation
by any cold relativistic particle bunch. The coherent radiation of twisted photons by such particle
bunches obeys the property that we call the addition rule. This rule provides a simple means to describe
the properties of coherent radiation of twisted photons. Furthermore, the strong addition rule
is established for the coherent radiation by sufficiently long helical bunches. The use of this
rule allows one to elaborate superradiant pure sources of twisted photons. The coherent radiation
by helical bunches is considered for the edge, transition, and Vavilov-Cherenkov processes and
for particles moving in undulators and plane laser waves with circular polarization. In these cases,
the sum rules are deduced for the total probability to record a twisted photon and for the projection
of the total angular momentum per photon. The explicit expressions for both incoherent and coherent
interference factors are derived for several simple bunch profiles.
