Two earlier studies demonstrated that students' behavior in a sequence of online learning modules
can be analyzed to measure the students' ability to transfer their learning from solving one physics
problem to a similar new problem. In addition, adding an on-ramp module that develops problem solving
skills improved students' transfer ability. In the current study, we improved the accuracy of the
transfer measurement by identifying and excluding students who interacted with the learning modules
differently from what was expected, and examined two possible mechanisms by which the on-ramp module
could improve student transfer. Based on a two by two framework of self-regulated learning, we hypothesized
that students with a performance-avoidance goal orientation are likely to guess on their initial
attempts, leaving a distinctive pattern in the log data. We argue that including those students
in the sample could result in an underestimation of students' actual transfer ability. We divided
the remaining student sample according to whether they passed the on-ramp module before or after
accessing the instructional materials, and compared their performance to a propensity score-matched
sample from a previous semester. We found improvement in transfer ability primarily occurred among
students who passed the on-ramp before learning. A possible explanation is that the on-ramp module
served as an effective reminder, lowering cognitive load for retrieving existing knowledge, but
may be insufficient to develop the essential skills for those who were learning it for the first time.
Our results suggest that online learning modules can be an accurate and flexible tool in assessing
students' transfer ability, but more importantly demonstrated that analysis of online learning
data can produce accurate and insightful results when taking into account details of student learning
behavior and learning strategy.
