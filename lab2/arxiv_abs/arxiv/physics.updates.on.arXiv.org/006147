A series of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of lean methane/air flames was conducted in order
to investigate the enhancement of the turbulent flame speed and modifications to the reaction layer
structure associated with the systematic increase of the integral scale of turbulence $l$ while
the Karlovitz number and the Kolmogorov scale are kept constant. Four turbulent slot jet flames
are simulated at increasing Reynolds number and up to $Re \approx 22000$, defined based on the bulk
velocity, slot width, and the reactants' properties. The turbulent flame speed $S_T$ is evaluated
locally at select streamwise locations and it is observed to increase both in the streamwise direction
for each flame and across flames for increasing Reynolds number, in line with a corresponding increase
of the turbulent integral scale. In particular, the turbulent flame speed $S_T$ increases exponentially
with the integral scale for $l$ up to about 6 laminar flame thicknesses, while the scaling becomes
a power-law for larger values of $l$. These trends cannot be ascribed completely to the increase
in the flame surface, since the turbulent flame speed looses its proportionality to the flame area
as the integral scale increases; in particular, it is found that the ratio of turbulent flame speed
to area attains a power-law scaling $l^{0.2}$. This is caused by an overall broadening of the reaction
layer for increasing integral scale, which is not associated with a corresponding decrease of the
reaction rate, causing a net enhancement of the overall burning rate. This observation is significant
since it suggests that a continuous increase in the size of the largest scales of turbulence might
be responsible for progressively stronger modifications of the flame's inner layers even if the
smallest scales, i.e., the Karlovitz number, are kept constant.
