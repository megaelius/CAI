The results of two-fluid simulations in single-null configurations are used to investigate the
processes determining the turbulent transport in the tokamak edge. Three turbulent transport
regimes are identified: (i) a developed transport regime with turbulence driven by an interchange
instability, which shares a number of features with the standard L-mode of tokamak operation, (ii)
a suppressed transport regime, characterized by a higher value of the energy confinement time,
low-amplitude relative fluctuations driven by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, a strong E x B sheared
flow, and the formation of a transport barrier, which recalls the H-mode, and (iii) a degraded confinement
regime, characterized by a catastrophically large interchange-driven turbulent transport,
which reminds the crossing of the Greenwald density limit.We derive an analytical expression of
the pressure gradient length in the three regimes. The transition from the developed to the suppressed
transport regime is obtained by increasing the heat source or decreasing the collisionality and
vice versa for the transition from the developed transport regime to the degraded confinement regime.
An analytical expression of the power threshold to access the suppressed transport regime, linked
to the power threshold for H-mode access, as well as the maximum density achievable before entering
the degraded confinement regime, related to the Greenwald density, are also derived. The experimental
dependencies of the power threshold for H-mode access on density, tokamak major radius, and isotope
mass are retrieved. The analytical estimate of the density limit contains the correct dependence
on the plasma current and on the tokamak minor radius.
