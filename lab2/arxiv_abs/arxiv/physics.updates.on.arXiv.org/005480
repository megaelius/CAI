The human dosimetry for electromagnetic field exposure is an essential task to develop exposure
guidelines/standards for human safety as well as product safety assessment. At frequencies from
a few hundred Hz to 10 MHz, the adverse effect to be protected is the stimulation of the peripheral
nervous system. The in situ electric field in the skin is used as a surrogate of nerve activation.
In the low-frequency dosimetry, a high but inaccurate in situ electric field has been reported at
positions where a skin-to-skin contact exists, whose relation to the stimulation is controversial.
One of the reasons for high electric fields may be attributable to the current resolution of anatomical
models. In this study, we first evaluate the stimulation threshold at postures of skin-to-skin
contact experimentally for different hand/finger positions to represent skin touching/non-touching
scenarios. We confirm that the skin-to-skin contact does not lower the threshold current of magnetic
stimulation devices needed to induce pain. Second, a new method is proposed for hand modeling to
configure different finger positions using static hand models with similar postures to the experiments.
We compute the in situ electric field at skin-to-skin contact for the different hand posture scenarios
that indicate an excessive raise of the electric field in skin-to-skin regions that is not justified
by the experiments. The comparison suggests that a high in situ electric field in the skin would be
caused by poor modeling of the skin layers, which is not enough to represent in a resolution of the
order of a millimeter. This skin-to-skin contact should not be considered to set the restriction
in the international exposure guidelines/standards as well as product safety assessment.
