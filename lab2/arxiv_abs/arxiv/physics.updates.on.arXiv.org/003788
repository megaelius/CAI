Conditioning of a metal structure in a high-voltage system is the progressive development of resistance
to vacuum arcing over the operational life of the system. This is, for instance, seen during the initial
operation of radio frequency (rf) cavities in particle accelerators. It is a relevant topic for
any technology where breakdown limits performance, and where conditioning continues for a significant
duration of system runtime. Projected future linear accelerators require structures with accelerating
gradients of up to 100 MV/m. Currently, this performance level is only achievable after a multi-month
conditioning period. In this work, a pulsed DC system applying voltage pulses over parallel disk
electrodes was used to study the conditioning process, with the objective of obtaining insight
into its underlying mechanics, and ultimately, to find ways to shorten the conditioning process.
Two kinds of copper electrodes were tested: As-prepared machine-turned electrodes ("hard" copper),
and electrodes that additionally had been subjected to high temperature treatments ("soft" copper).
The conditioning behaviour of the soft electrodes was found to be similar to that of comparably treated
accelerating structures, indicating a similar conditioning process. The hard electrodes reached
the same ultimate performance as the soft electrodes much faster, with a difference of more than
an order of magnitude in the number of applied voltage pulses. Two distinctly different distributions
of breakdown locations were observed on the two types of electrodes. Considered together, our results
support the crystal structure dislocation theory of breakdown, and suggest that the conditioning
of copper in high field systems such as rf accelerating structures is dominated by material hardening.
