Attractive colloidal dispersions, suspensions of fine particles which aggregate and frequently
form a space spanning elastic gel are ubiquitous materials in society with a wide range of applications.
The colloidal networks in these materials can exist in a mode of free settling when the network weight
exceeds its compressive yield stress. An equivalent state occurs when the network is held fixed
in place and used as a filter through which the suspending fluid is pumped. In either scenario, hydrodynamic
instabilities leading to loss of network integrity occur. Experimental observations have shown
that the loss of integrity is associated with the formation of eroded channels, so-called streamers,
through which the fluid flows rapidly. However, the dynamics of growth and subsequent mechanism
of collapse remain poorly understood. Here, a phenomenological model is presented that describes
dynamically the radial growth of a streamer due to erosion of the network by rapid fluid back flow.
The model exhibits a finite-time blowup -- the onset of catastrophic failure in the gel -- due to activated
breaking of the inter-colloid bonds. Brownian dynamics simulations of hydrodynamically interacting
and settling colloids in dilute gels are employed to examine the initiation and propagation of this
instability, which is in good agreement with the theory. The model dynamics are also shown to accurately
replicate measurements of streamer growth in two different experimental systems. The predictive
capabilities and future improvements of the model are discussed and a stability-state diagram
is presented providing insight into engineering strategies for avoiding settling instabilities
in networks meant to have long shelf lives.
