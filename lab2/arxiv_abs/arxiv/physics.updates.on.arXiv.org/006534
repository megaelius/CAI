Ultrawide-angle electromagnetic wave absorbers with excellent mechanical properties are required
in many diverse applications such as sensing, and stealth technologies. Here, a novel 3D reconfigurable
metamaterial absorber (MMA) consisting of honeycomb and VO2 films is proposed. The proposed MMA
exhibits a strong absorptivity above 90\% in the widest incident angle up to $87^\circ$ for TM- and
TE- polarized oblique incidences for THz wave propagating in yoz-plane. According to simulation
results, under normal incidence, when VO2 films are in the insulating state, the proposed absorber
exhibits high absorptivity in the frequency band of 1-4 THz. By increasing the temperature of the
whole structure, the structural transformation of VO2 occurs and turns into the metallic phase.
We have shown that under oblique incidence, the ohmic losses of VO2 films especially those parallel
to the direction of the incident electric field are the most important absorption principles of
the proposed MMA. Furthermore, to understand the physical mechanism of absorption, the induced
electric field as well as the power loss density of the proposed structure are investigated. In addition,
it is shown that the presented VO2 based honeycomb absorber retains its full-coverage incident
angle characteristics for TM-polarized incidences propagating in the xoz-plane. Due to the ultra
wide-angle absorption (angular stability) and mechanical performance, it is expected that the
presented MMA may find potential applications, such as camouflage technologies, electromagnetic
interference, imaging, and sensing. To the best knowledge of authors, the proposed MMA configuration
exhibits the absorptivity in the widest incident angle ever reported.
