Simultaneous two-phase particle image/tracking velocimetry (PIV/PTV) measurement is conducted
on particle-laden turbulent boundary layer (TBL) over a horizontal smooth-flat-plate. The relatively
high Reynolds number (Re{\tau}=5500 based on friction velocity u{\tau} and boundary layer thickness
{\delta}) wind-sand TBL with large field-of-view (FOV) is experimentally explored. With four
high-resolution CCD cameras arranged along the flow direction, this experiment can resolve a wide
range of the spectrum ranging from small-scale energetic eddies to large-scale motions (LSMs)
in TBL. Dilute desert sand grains with median diameter of 203{\mu}m and bulk volume fraction of O(10-5)
are used as discrete phase. Improved phase separation and discrete particle matching method are
developed for two-phase velocity measurement. The results presented here provide new information
concerning the effect of high-inertia particles with dilute concentration on wall-bounded turbulence,
especially at high Re. The presence of sand grains attenuate turbulence fluctuation by suppressing
small-scale sweep-ejection cycle in the near-wall region, and this suppression effect intensifies
as the particle concentration increases. A critical layer (y/{\delta}=0.12 or y+=670) is found
to partition the streamwise evolution of both the local concentration and the streamwise mean velocity
of the sand grains into a spatial developing near-wall region and a quasi-parallel outer region.
In addition, at this layer a balance of the strength and probability between the sweep and ejection
events of sand grains is reached. Such a critical layer might be a good indicator of the upper bound
of the particle saltation process, in which LSMs are believed to play a significant role.
