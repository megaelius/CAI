Computational biomechanics plays an important role in biomedical engineering: using modeling
to understand pathophysiology, treatment and device design. While experimental evidence indicates
that the mechanical response of most tissues is viscoelasticity, current biomechanical models
in the computation community often assume only hyperelasticity. Fractional viscoelastic constitutive
models have been successfully used in literature to capture the material response. However, the
translation of these models into computational platforms remains limited. Many experimentally
derived viscoelastic constitutive models are not suitable for three-dimensional simulations.
Furthermore, the use of fractional derivatives can be computationally prohibitive, with a number
of current numerical approximations having a computational cost that is $ \mathcal{O} ( N_T^2)
$ and a storage cost that is $ \mathcal{O}(N_T) $ ($ N_T $ denotes the number of time steps). In this
paper, we present a novel numerical approximation to the Caputo derivative which exploits a recurrence
relation similar to those used to discretize classic temporal derivatives, giving a computational
cost that is $ \mathcal{O} (N) $ and a storage cost that is fixed over time. The approximation is optimized
for numerical applications, and the error estimate is presented to demonstrate efficacy of the
method. The method is shown to be unconditionally stable in the linear viscoelastic case. It was
then integrated into a computational biomechanical framework, with several numerical examples
verifying accuracy and computational efficiency of the method, including in an analytic test,
in an analytic fractional differential equation, as well as in a computational biomechanical model
problem.
