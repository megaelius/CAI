Established image recovery methods in fast ultrasound imaging, e.g. delay-and-sum, trade the
image quality for the high frame rate. Cutting-edge inverse scattering methods based on compressed
sensing (CS) disrupt this tradeoff via a priori information. They iteratively recover a high-quality
image from only a few sequential pulse-echo measurements or less echo signals, if (i) a known dictionary
of structural building blocks represents the image almost sparsely, and (ii) their individual
pulse echoes, which are predicted by a linear model, are sufficiently uncorrelated. The exclusive
modeling of the incident waves as steered plane waves or cylindrical waves, however, has so far limited
the convergence speed, the image quality, and the potential to meet condition (ii). Motivated by
the benefits of randomness in CS, a novel method for the fast compressed acquisition and the subsequent
recovery of images is proposed to overcome these limitations. It recovers the spatial compressibility
fluctuations in weakly-scattering soft tissue structures, where an orthonormal basis meets condition
(i), by a sparsity-promoting $\ell_{q}$-minimization method, $q \in [0; 1]$. A realistic $d$-dimensional
model, $d \in \{2, 3\}$, accounting for diffraction, single monopole scattering, the combination
of power-law absorption and dispersion, and the specifications of a planar transducer array, predicts
the pulse echoes of the individual basis functions. Three innovative types of incident waves, whose
syntheses leverage random apodization weights, time delays, or combinations thereof, aid in meeting
condition (ii). In two-dimensional numerical simulations, single realizations of these waves
outperform the prevalent quasi-plane wave for both the canonical and the Fourier bases. They significantly
reduce the full extents at half maximum of the point spread functions by up to 73.7 %.
