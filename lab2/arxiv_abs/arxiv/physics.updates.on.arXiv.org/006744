Understanding magnetic-field generation and amplification in turbulent plasma is essential
to account for observations of magnetic fields in the universe. A theoretical framework attributing
the origin and sustainment of these fields to the so-called fluctuation dynamo was recently validated
by experiments on laser facilities in low-magnetic-Prandtl-number plasmas ($\mathrm{Pm} < 1$).
However, the same framework proposes that the fluctuation dynamo should operate differently when
$\mathrm{Pm} \gtrsim 1$, the regime relevant to many astrophysical environments such as the intracluster
medium of galaxy clusters. This paper reports a new experiment that creates a laboratory $\mathrm{Pm}
\gtrsim 1$ plasma dynamo for the first time. We provide a time-resolved characterization of the
plasma's evolution, measuring temperatures, densities, flow velocities and magnetic fields,
which allows us to explore various stages of the fluctuation dynamo's operation. The magnetic energy
in structures with characteristic scales close to the driving scale of the stochastic motions is
found to increase by almost three orders of magnitude from its initial value and saturate dynamically.
It is shown that the growth of these fields occurs exponentially at a rate that is much greater than
the turnover rate of the driving-scale stochastic motions. Our results point to the possibility
that plasma turbulence produced by strong shear can generate fields more efficiently at the driving
scale than anticipated by idealized MHD simulations of the nonhelical fluctuation dynamo; this
finding could help explain the large-scale fields inferred from observations of astrophysical
systems.
