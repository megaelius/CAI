The emerging autonomous vehicles (AV) can either supplement the public transportation (PT) system
or be a competitor with it. This paper focuses on this competition in a hypothetical scenario--"if
both AV and PT operators are profit-oriented," and uses an ABM to quantitatively evaluate the system
performance in this competition from the perspectives of four stakeholders--AV operator, PT operator,
passengers, and public authority. In our model, AV operator updates its supply by changing fleet
sizes while PT by adjusting headways, and both use heuristic approaches to update supply in order
to increase profits. We implement the model in the first-mile scenario in Tampines. In four regulation
scenarios--two by two combinations regarding whether AV and PT are allowed to change supplies--we
find that since AV can release the bus operator from low-demand routes, the competition can lead
to higher profits of both, and higher system efficiency, simultaneously, rather than a one-sided
loss-gain result. For PT, after supply updates, spatially the services are concentrated to short
feeder routes directly to the subway station, and temporally concentrated to peak hours. For passengers,
the competition reduces their travel time but increases their travel costs. Nonetheless, the generalized
travel cost is still reduced when counting the value of time. For system efficiency and sustainability,
bus supply adjustment can increase the bus average load and reduce total PCE, while the AV supply
adjustment shows the opposite effect. For policy implications, the paper suggests that PT should
be allowed to optimize its supply strategies under specific operation goal constraints, and AV
operation should be regulated to relieve its externality on the system, including limiting the
number of licenses, operation time, and service areas, which makes AV operate like a complementary
mode to PT.
