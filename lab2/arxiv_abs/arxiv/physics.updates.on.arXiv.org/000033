This paper extends our earlier studies of free energy functions of density and crystalline order
parameters for models of supercooled water, which allows us to examine the possibility of two distinct
metastable liquid phases [J. Chem. Phys. 135, 134503 (2011) and arXiv:1107.0337v2 ]. Low-temperature
reversible free energy surfaces of several different atomistic models are computed: mW water,
TIP4P/2005 water, SW silicon and ST2 water, the last of these comparing three different treatments
of long-ranged forces. In each case, we show that there is one stable or metastable liquid phase,
and there is an ice-like crystal phase. The time scales for crystallization in these systems far
exceed those of structural relaxation in the supercooled metastable liquid. We show how this wide
separation in time scales produces an illusion of a low-temperature liquid-liquid transition.
The phenomenon suggesting metastability of two distinct liquid phases is actually coarsening
of the ordered ice-like phase, which we elucidate using both analytical theory and computer simulation.
For the latter, we describe robust methods for computing reversible free energy surfaces, and we
consider effects of electrostatic boundary conditions. We show that sensible alterations of models
and boundary conditions produce no qualitative changes in low-temperature phase behaviors of
these systems, only marginal changes in equations of state. On the other hand, we show that altering
sampling time scales can produce large and qualitative nonequilibrium effects. Recent reports
of evidence of a liquid-liquid critical point in computer simulations of supercooled water are
considered in this light.
