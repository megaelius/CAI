Carbon dioxide (CO2) increase has been well documented, and global net primary production is of
importance to a variety of ecological topics. Since CO2 increases primary production in laboratory
experiments, the global effects of increasing CO2 on global primary production are of interest
in both climate science and ecology. Various studies have considered increases in primary production
over different regions and time scales, but the global effects of increased atmospheric CO2 and
primary production remain unquantified. This study aims to compare these two variables globally
to assist in determining the potential for increases in primary production to contribute to carbon
sequestration, possibly slowing increases in atmospheric CO2 resulting from fossil fuel emissions.
Monthly CO2 concentration data from 1985 through 2015 in distinct latitude bands (every 10 degrees)
was retrieved from the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory for a total of 18 datasets. As a proxy
to quantify net primary production, the magnitude of annual CO2 cycling was computed for each dataset
through Fourier analysis. Relative increases were then calculated for both CO2 increase and amplitude
increase to compare the pace of carbon cycling with the pace of increases in atmospheric CO2. Globally,
the increase in primary production determined by using annual CO2 cycling as a proxy was 3.75% (+/-
1.82%) per decade over the time interval studied. In contrast, the measured increase in CO2 abundance
was 4.75% (+/- 0.02%) per decade. Increases in carbon cycling appear to be slightly smaller than
increases in CO2 globally and in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, but the uncertainties
in the estimate for increases in carbon cycling are too large to draw that conclusion with statistical
confidence.
