Fluid flow in the transonic regime finds relevance in aerospace engineering, particularly in the
design of commercial air transportation vehicles. Computational fluid dynamics models of transonic
flow for aerospace applications are computationally expensive to solve because of the high degrees
of freedom as well as the coupled nature of the conservation laws. While these issues pose a bottleneck
for the use of such models in aerospace design, computational costs can be significantly minimized
by constructing special, structure-preserving surrogate models called reduced-order models.
Such models are known to incur huge off-line costs, however, which can sometimes outweigh their
potential benefits. Furthermore, their prediction accuracy is known to be poor under transonic
flow conditions. In this work, we propose a machine learning method to construct reduced-order
models via deep neural networks, and we demonstrate its ability to preserve accuracy with significantly
lower offline and online costs. In addition, our machine learning methodology is physics-informed
and constrained through the utilization of an interpretable encoding by way of proper orthogonal
decomposition. Application to the inviscid transonic flow past the RAE2822 airfoil under varying
freestream Mach numbers and angles of attack, as well as airfoil shape parameters with a deforming
mesh, shows that the proposed approach adapts to high-dimensional parameter variation well. Notably,
the proposed framework precludes knowledge of numerical operators utilized in the data generation
phase, thereby demonstrating its potential utility in fast exploration of design space for diverse
engineering applications.
