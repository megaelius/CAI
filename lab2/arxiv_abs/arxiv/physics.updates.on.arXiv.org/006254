This paper introduces two subcycling algorithms for particle orbits in variational, geometric
particle-in-cell methods addressing the Vlasov--Maxwell system in magnetized plasmas. The purpose
of subcycling is to allow different time steps for different particle species and ideally time steps
longer than the electron gyroperiod for the global field solves while sampling the local cyclotron
orbits accurately. Both our algorithms retain the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the discrete
action, guaranteeing a local charge conservation law, and the variational approach provides a
bounded long-time energy behavior. In the first algorithm, the global field solves are explicit
and the local particle push implicit for each particle individually. The requirement for gauge
invariance, however, leads to a peculiarity in the particle push: the magnetic field is orbit-averaged
but the effect of the electric field is evaluated only once during the subcycling period. Numerical
tests then indicate a possibility of artificial oscillations if the relative electric field impulse
on the particles grows large. The second algorithm is proposed to remedy the possible issues of the
first algorithm. It is observed that both the magnetic and electric impulses on particle motion
can be orbit-averaged if also the electrostatic part of the field-particle interaction term in
the discrete action is line-integrated. In numerical experiments, the artificial oscillations
are observed to vanish but, at the same time, the algorithm implicitly couples the electric field
and the particle push. It remains to be seen whether properly orbit-averaged, yet explicit subcycling
algorithms exist within the variational geometric particle-in-cell framework.
