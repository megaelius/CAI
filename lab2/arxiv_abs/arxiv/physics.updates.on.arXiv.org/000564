The sensitivity of climate models to increasing CO2 concentration and the climate response at decadal
time scales are still major factors of uncertainty for the assessment of the long and short term effects
of anthropogenic climate change. While the relative slow progress on these issues is partly due
to the inherent inaccuracies of numerical climate models, this also hints at the need for stronger
theoretical foundations to the problem of studying climate sensitivity and performing climate
change predictions with numerical models. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to use Ruelle's
response theory to predict the impact of an arbitrary CO2 forcing scenario on the global surface
temperature of a general circulation model. Response theory puts the concept of climate sensitivity
on firm theoretical grounds, and addresses rigorously the problem of predictability at different
time scales. Conceptually, our results show that performing climate change experiments with general
circulation models is a well defined problem from a physical and mathematical point of view. Practically,
our results show that considering one single CO2 forcing scenario is enough to construct operators
able to predict the response of climatic observables to any other CO2 forcing scenario, without
the need to perform additional numerical simulations. We also introduce a general relationship
between climate sensitivity and climate response at different time scales, thus providing an explicit
definition of the inertia of the system at different time scales. While what we report here refers
to the linear response, the general theory allows for treating nonlinear effects as well. Our results
pave the way for redesigning and interpreting climate change experiments from a radically new perspective.
