Numerical models are increasingly used for non-invasive diagnosis and treatment planning in coronary
artery disease, where service-based technologies have proven successful in identifying hemodynamically
significant and hence potentially dangerous vascular anomalies. Despite recent progress towards
clinical adoption, many results in the field are still based on a deterministic characterization
of blood flow, with no quantitative assessment of the variability of simulation outputs due to uncertainty
from multiple sources. In this study, we focus on parameters that are essential to construct accurate
patient-specific representations of the coronary circulation, such as aortic pressure waveform,
intramyocardial pressure and quantify how their uncertainty affects clinically relevant model
outputs. We construct a deformable model of the left coronary artery subject to a prescribed inlet
pressure and with open-loop outlet boundary conditions, treating fluid-structure interaction
through an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian frame of reference. Random input uncertainty is estimated
directly from repeated clinical measurements from intra-coronary catheterization and complemented
by literature data. We also achieve significant computational cost reductions in uncertainty
propagation thanks to multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators of the outputs of interest, leveraging
the ability to generate, at practically no cost, one- and zero-dimensional low-fidelity representations
of left coronary artery flow, with appropriate boundary conditions. The results demonstrate how
the use of multi-fidelity control variate estimators leads to significant reductions in variance
and accuracy improvements with respect to traditional Monte-Carlo.
