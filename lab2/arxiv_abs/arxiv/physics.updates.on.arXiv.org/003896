The Newtonian constant of gravitation, $G$, stands out in the landscape of the most common fundamental
constants owing to its surprisingly large relative uncertainty, which is attributable mostly
to the dispersion of the values measured for it in different experiments. This study focuses on a
set of measurements of $G$ that are mutually inconsistent, in the sense that the dispersion of the
measured values is significantly larger than what their reported uncertainties suggest that it
should be. Furthermore, there is a loosely defined group of measured values that lie fairly close
to a consensus value that may be derived from all the measurement results, and then there are one or
more groups with measured values farther away from the consensus value, some higher, others lower.
This same general pattern is often observed in many interlaboratory studies and meta-analyses.
In the conventional treatments of such data, the mutual inconsistency is addressed by inflating
the reported uncertainties, either multiplicatively, or by the addition of random effects, both
reflecting the presence of dark uncertainty. The former approach is often used by CODATA and by the
Particle Data Group, and the latter is common in medical meta-analysis and in metrology. We propose
a new procedure for consensus building that models the results using latent clusters with different
shades of dark uncertainty, which assigns a customized amount of dark uncertainty to each measured
value, as a mixture of those shades, and does so taking into account both the placement of the measured
values relative to the consensus value, and the reported uncertainties. We demonstrate this procedure
by deriving a new estimate for $G$, as a consensus value $G = 6.67408 \times 10^{-11} \,\text{m}^{-3}
\, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}$, with $u(G) = 0.00024 \times 10^{-11} \,\text{m}^{-3} \,
\text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}$.
