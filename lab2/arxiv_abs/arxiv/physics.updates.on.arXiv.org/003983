Among Super-Mirror (SM) polarizers, solid-state devices have many advantages. The most relevant
is 5-10 times smaller length compared to air-gap polarizers allowing to apply stronger magnetic
fields. An important condition for a good SM polarizer is the matching of the substrate SLD (Scattering
Length Density) with the SM coating SLD for spin-down neutrons. For traditional Fe/Si SM on Si substrate,
this SLD step is positive when a neutron goes from the substrate to the SM, which leads to a significant
loss of the polarizer performance at small Q. Instead, we use single-crystal Sapphire/Quartz substrates.
The latter show a negative SLD step for spin-down neutrons at the interface with Fe and, therefore,
avoid the total reflection regime at small Q. To optimize the polarizer performance, we formulate
the concept of Sapphire V-bender, perform ray-tracing simulations of Sapphire V-bender, compare
results with those for traditional C-bender on Si, and study experimentally V-bender prototypes
with different substrates. Our results show that the choice of substrate material, polarizer geometry
and the strength and quality of magnetizing field have dramatic effect. In particular, we compare
the performance of polarizer for the applied magnetic field strength of $50 mT$ and $300 mT$. Only
the large field strength provides an excellent agreement between the simulated and measured polarization
values. For the double-collision configuration, a record polarization $>0.999$ was obtained
in the neutron wavelength band of $0.3-1.2 nm$ with only $1\%$ decrease at $2 nm$. Without any collimation,
the polarization averaged over the full outgoing capture spectrum, $0.997$, was found to be equal
to the value obtained previously only using a double polarizer in the "crossed" (X-SM) geometry.
These results are applied in a full-scale polarizer for the PF1B instrument.
