Multifractals are self-similar hierarchies with cascade structure, which can be associated with
complex networks. Urban traffic networks have been proved to be complex systems with fractal structure.
However, previous studies mainly focused on monofractal networks. This paper is devoted to exploring
the multifractal scaling in the street network of 12 Chinese cities. The city clustering algorithm
(CCA) is employed to identify urban boundaries and define street systems in a consistent manner.
Then, box-counting method and the direct determination method based on miu-weight are utilized
to estimate global and local multifractal parameters. The basic algorithm of parameter estimation
is the ordinary least squares method. The results displayed multifractal structure of urban street
networks. The global multifractal dimension spectrum is an inverse S-shaped curve, while the local
singularity spectrum is an asymmetric unimodal curve. If the moment order q approaches negative
infinity, the generalized correlation dimension will seriously exceed the embedding space dimension
2, and the local fractal dimension curve displays an abnormal decrease for most cities. The scaling
relations of local dimension gradually break if the q value is too high. Despite this, the different
levels of the network always keep the scaling relations reflecting singularity exponent. The main
conclusions can be reached as follows. First, urban street networks follow multifractal scaling
law, and scaling precedes local fractal structure. Second, the patterns of traffic network take
on characteristics of spatial concentration, but it also shows contradictory signs of the spatial
deconcentration. Third, the development space of central area and high-density area is limited,
while the fringe zone and low-density area have the phenomena of disordered evolution.
