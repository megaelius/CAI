The journey of mammalian spermatozoa in nature is well-known to be reliant on their individual motility.
Often swimming in crowded microenvironments, the progress of any single swimmer is likely dependent
on their interactions with other nearby swimmers. Whilst the complex dynamics of lone spermatozoa
have been well-studied, the detailed effects of hydrodynamic interactions between neighbors
remain unclear, with inherent nonlinearity in the governing hydrodynamics and potential dependence
on the details of swimmer morphology. In this study we will attempt to elucidate the pairwise swimming
behaviors of virtual spermatozoa, forming a computational representation of an unbound swimming
pair and evaluating the details of their interactions via a high-accuracy boundary element method.
We have explored extensive regions of parameter space to determine the pairwise interactions of
synchronized spermatozoa, with synchronized swimmers often being noted in experimental observations,
and have found that two-dimensional reduced autonomous dynamical systems capture the anisotropic
nature of the swimming speed and stability arising from near-field hydrodynamic interactions.
Focusing on two configurations of spermatozoa, namely those with swimmers located side-by-side
or above and below one another, we have found that side-by-side cells attract each other, and the
trajectories in the phase plane are well captured by a recently-proposed coarse-graining method
of microswimmer dynamics via superposed regularised Stokeslets. In contrast, the above-below
pair exhibit a remarkable stable pairwise swimming behavior, corresponding to a stable configuration
of the plane autonomous system with swimmers lying approximately parallel to one another....
