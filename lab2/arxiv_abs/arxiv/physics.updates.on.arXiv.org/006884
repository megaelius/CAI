Super-resolutive 3D tracking, such as PSF engineering or evanescent field imaging has long been
used to track microparticles and to enhance the throughput of single molecules force spectroscopic
measurements. However, current methods present two drawbacks. First, they lack precision compared
with optical tweezers or AFM. Second, the dependence of their signal upon the position is complex
creating the need for a time-consuming calibration step. Here, we introduce a new optical technique
that circumvents both issues and allows for a simple, versatile and efficient 3D tracking of diluted
particles while offering a sub-nanometer frame-to-frame precision in all three spatial directions.
The principle is to combine stereoscopy and interferometry, such that the z (axial) position is
measured through the distance between two interferometric fringe patterns. The linearity of this
stereoscopy technique alleviates the need for lookup tables while the structured interferometric
pattern enhances precision. On the other hand, the extended spatial footprint of this PSF maximizes
the number of photons detected per frame without the need of fancy cameras, nor the need for complex
hardware. Hence, thanks to its simplicity and versatility, we believe that SDI (Stereo Darkfield
Interferometry) technology has the potential to significantly enhance the spreading of 3D tracking.
We demonstrate the efficiency of this technique on various single-molecule measurements thanks
to magnetic tweezers. In particular we demonstrate the precise quantification of two-state dynamics
involving axial steps as short as 1 nm. We then show that SDI can be directly embedded in a commercial
objective providing a means to track multiple single cells in 3D .
