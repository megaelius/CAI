A light-driven molecular motor system is investigated using a multi-state Brownian ratchet model
described by a single effective coordinate with multiple electronic states in a dissipative environment.
The rotational motion of the motor system is investigated on the basis of wavepacket dynamics. A
current determined from the interplay between a fast photochemical isomerization (photoisomerization)
process triggered by pulses and a slow thermal isomerization (thermalization) process arising
from an overdamped environment is numerically evaluated. For this purpose, we employ the multi-state
low-temperature quantum Smoluchowski equations that allow us to simulate the fast quantum electronic
dynamics in the overdamped environment. We analyze the motor efficiency by numerically integrating
the equations of motion for a rotator system driven by repeatedly impulsive excitations. When the
timescales of the pulse repetition, photoisomerization, and thermalization processes are separated,
the average rotational speed of the motor is determined by the timescale of thermalization. In this
regime, the average rotational current can be described by a simple equation derived from a rate
equation for the thermalization process. When laser pulses are applied repeatedly and the timescales
of the photoisomerization and pulse repetition are close, the details of the photoisomerization
process become important to analyze the entire rotational process. We examine the possibility
of observing the photoisomerization and the thermalization processes associated with stationary
rotating dynamics of the motor system by spectroscopic means, e.g.pump-probe, transient absorption,
and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy techniques.
