An exponential horn geometry is introduced in order to establish cellular detonations with a constant
mean lateral mass divergence, propagating at quasi-steady speeds below the Chapman-Jouguet value.
Experiments and simulations demonstrated that such quasi-steady state detonations can be realized,
hence permitting to obtain the relations between the detonation speed and mean lateral flow divergence
for cellular detonations in an unambiguous manner. The experimentally obtained speed ($D$) dependencies
on divergence ($K$) were compared with the predictions for steady detonations with lateral flow
divergence obtained with the real thermo-chemical data of the mixtures. For the 2C$_2$H$_2$+5O$_2$+21Ar
system, reasonable agreement was found between the experiments and steady wave prediction, particularly
for the critical divergence leading to failure. Observations of the reaction zone structure in
these detonations indicated that all the gas reacted very close to the front, as the transverse waves
were reactive. The experiments obtained in the much more unstable detonations in C$_3$H$_8$+5O$_2$
showed significant differences between the experimentally derived $D(K)$ curve and the prediction
of steady wave propagation. The latter was found to significantly under-predict the detonability
of cellular detonations. The transverse waves in this mixture were found to be non-reactive, hence
permitting to shed off non-reacted pockets, which burn via turbulent flames on their surface. It
is believed that the large differences between experiment and the inviscid model in this class of
cellular structures is due to the importance of diffusive processes in the burn-out of the non-reacted
pockets.
