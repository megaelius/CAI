Data-driven research in mobility has prospered in recent years, providing solutions to real-world
challenges including forecasting epidemics and planning transportation. These advancements
were facilitated by computational tools enabling the analysis of large-scale data-sets of digital
traces. One of the challenges when pre-processing spatial trajectories is the so-called stop location
detection, that entails the reduction of raw time series to sequences of destinations where an individual
was stationary. The most widely adopted solution to this problem was proposed by Hariharan and Toyama
(2004) and involves filtering out non-stationary measurements, then applying agglomerative
clustering on the stationary points. This state-of-the-art solution, however, suffers of two
limitations: (i) frequently visited places located very close (such as adjacent buildings) are
likely to be merged into a unique location, due to inherent measurement noise, (ii) traces for multiple
users can not be analysed simultaneously, thus the definition of destination is not shared across
users. In this paper, we describe the Infostop algorithm that overcomes the limitations of the state-of-the-art
solution by leveraging the flow-based network community detection algorithm Infomap. We test
Infostop for a population of $\sim 1000$ individuals with highly overlapping mobility. We show
that the size of locations detected by Infostop saturates for increasing number of users and that
time complexity grows slower than for previous solutions. We demonstrate that Infostop can be used
to easily infer social meetings. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of Infostop,
written in Python and C++, that has a simple API and can be used both for labeling time-ordered coordinate
sequences (GPS or otherwise), and unordered sets of spatial points.
