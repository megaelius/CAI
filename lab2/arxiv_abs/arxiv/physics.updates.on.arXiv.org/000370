We complete the literature on the statistical mechanics of point vortices in two-dimensional hydrodynamics.
Using a maximum entropy principle, we determine the multi-species Boltzmann-Poisson equation
and establish a form of virial theorem. Using a maximum entropy production principle (MEPP), we
derive a set of relaxation equations towards statistical equilibrium. These relaxation equations
can be used as a numerical algorithm to compute the maximum entropy state. We mention the analogies
with the Fokker-Planck equations derived by Debye and H\"uckel for electrolytes. We then consider
the limit of strong mixing (or low energy). To leading order, the relationship between the vorticity
and the stream function at equilibrium is linear and the maximization of the entropy becomes equivalent
to the minimization of the enstrophy. This expansion is similar to the Debye-H\"uckel approximation
for electrolytes, except that the temperature is negative instead of positive so that the effective
interaction between like-sign vortices is attractive instead of repulsive. This leads to an organization
at large scales presenting geometry-induced phase transitions, instead of Debye shielding. We
compare the results obtained with point vortices to those obtained in the context of the statistical
mechanics of continuous vorticity fields described by the Miller-Robert-Sommeria (MRS) theory.
At linear order, we get the same results but differences appear at the next order. In particular,
the MRS theory predicts a transition between sinh and tanh-like \omega-\psi relationships depending
on the sign of Ku-3 (where Ku is the Kurtosis) while there is no such transition for point vortices
which always show a sinh-like \omega-\psi relationship. We derive the form of the relaxation equations
in the strong mixing limit and show that the enstrophy plays the role of a Lyapunov functional.
