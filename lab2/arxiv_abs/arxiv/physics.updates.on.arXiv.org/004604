The paper provides a new understanding of light propagation and light-matter interactions by examining
the physical implications of group velocity, electromagnetic (EM) power flow, Poynting theorem,
energy conservation law, and Fermat's principle. A criterion is set up to identify the justification
of the group velocity definition, and a modified definition is proposed to remove the flaws that
the classical definition has. It is reasonably argued that energy conservation law and Fermat's
principle are physical postulates independent of Maxwell equations. A ``superluminal power flow''
is constructed to show that Poynting theorem cannot uniquely define the EM power flow if the energy
conservation law or Fermat's principle is not taken into account. As an application, associated
basic concepts in textbooks and experimental observations reported in recent research works are
also reviewed, including: why the traditional formulation of Fermat's principle has a limited
application; how the Fermat's principle is formulated for a plane wave; why the Fermat's principle
is consistent with Maxwell EM theory; what the significant difference is between Poynting theorem
and energy conservation law; why Poynting vector as EM power flow may break energy conservation
law and Fermat's principle in an anisotropic medium; why the physical explanations for ``spatially
structured'' photons in Giovannini-coworkers experiments are not consistent with the principle
of relativity; why the traditionally-argued invariance of information velocity contradicts
Maxwell equations; and why the superluminal light pulse propagation claimed in Wang-Kuzmich-Dogariu
experiments voilates Einstein causality.
