In the case of multi-parameter full-waveform inversion, the computation of the additional Hessian
terms that contain derivatives with respect to more than one type of parameter is necessary. If a
simple gradient-based minimization is used, different choices of parameterization can be interpreted
as different preconditioners that change the condition number of the Hessian. If the non-linear
inverse problem is well-posed, then the inversion should converge to a band-limited version of
the true solution irrespective of the parameterization choice, provided we start sufficiently
close to the global minimum. However, the choice of parameterization will affect the rate of convergence
to the exact solution and the best choice of parameterization is the one with the fastest rate. In
this paper, we search for the best choice for acoustic multi-parameter full-waveform inversion,
where 1. anomalies with a size less than a quarter of the dominant wavelength have to be estimated
without the risk of converging to a local minimum; 2. the scattered wavefield is recorded at all the
scattering angles; 3. a steepest-descent minimization scheme is used. Our examples suggest that
the best choice of parameterization depends on the contrast of the subsurface scatterer that the
inversion tries to estimate. Based on the results, we observe that there is no best parameterization
choice for full-waveform inversion. We also observe that a parameterization using the acoustic
impedance and mass density has the worst convergence rate. Finally, we also show that the parameterization
analysis during a hierarchical inversion, where the data have limited scattering angles, only
helps to select a subspace for mono-parameter inversion. For multi-parameter hierarchical inversion,
the search for the best parameterization in terms of the convergence speed might be obfuscated by
non-uniqueness problems.
