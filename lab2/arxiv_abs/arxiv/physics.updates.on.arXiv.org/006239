Most polymers are long-lasting and produced from monomers derived from fossil fuel sources. Bio-based
and/or biodegradable plastics have been proposed as a sustainable alternative. Amongst those
available, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) shows great potential across a large variety of applications
but is currently limited to packaging, cosmetics and tissue engineering due to its relatively poor
physical properties. An expansion of its uses can be accomplished by developing nanocomposites
where PHAs are used as the polymer matrix. Herein, a PHA biopolyester was melt blended with graphene
nanoplatelets (GNPs) or with a 1:1 hybrid mixture of GNPs and carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The resulting
nanocomposites exhibited enhanced thermal stability while their Young's modulus roughly doubled
compared to pure PHA. The hybrid nanocomposites percolated electrically at lower nanofiller loadings
compared to the GNP-PHA system. The electrical conductivity at 15 wt.% loading was ~ 6 times higher
than the GNP-based sample. As a result, the electromagnetic interference shielding performance
of the hybrid material was around 50% better than the pure GNPs nanocomposites, exhibiting shielding
effectiveness above 20 dB, which is the threshold for common commercial applications. The thermal
conductivity increased significantly for both types of bio-nanocomposites and reached values
around 5 W K-1 m-1 with the hybrid-based material displaying the best performance. Considering
the solvent-free and industrially compatible production method, the proposed multifunctional
materials are promising to expand the range of application of PHAs and increase the environmental
sustainability of the plastic and plastic electronics industry.
