In this paper, we propose practicable GLHUA invisible cloaks, our cloak absorb the incident wave
and create outgoing wave that make them to be invisible cloaks and analytical electromagnetic (EM)
wave without exceeding light speed propagation. Discoveries and creations are reported. 1. New
GLHUA-i,i=1,2,3 annular layer EM invisible cloak with relative refractive index large or equal
to 1. 2. Analytical EM wave solution of EM wave equation with the GLHUA 1-3 cloak materials are found,
In GLHUA-1 cloak, $\varepsilon_r = \mu_r = \frac{{R_2 ^2 }}{{r^2 }}$, $\varepsilon_\theta = \varepsilon_\phi
= \mu_\theta = \mu_\phi = \frac{{R_2 - R_1 }}{{r - R_1 }}$, In GLHUA-2 cloak, $\varepsilon _r = \mu
_r = \frac{1}{{r^2 }}\frac{{(R_1 (r - R_1 ) + (R_2 - R_1 )^2 )^2 }}{{(R_2 - R_1 )^2 }}$,. 3. A GLHUA expansion
method and an exact analytical EM wave propagation in the GLHUA-i,i=1,2,3 cloak without exceeding
light speed propagation that are propsed. 4.Novel negative space is proposed. 5. GLHUANP-i, i=2,3
transformation are proposed, which maps $ - \infty $ to $R_1$ and $-R_2$ to $R_2$. 6. The GLHUANP-i,
i=2,3 transformation creates GLHUA-2 and GLHUA-3 cloaks. 7. GLHUA-i, i=1,2,3 cloaks absorb the
incident wave and create outgoing wave that make them invisible cloak and analytical EM wave through
them. 8. GLHUAF transformation and .GLHUAF invisible cloak with double negative materials is created.
9. The relative parameters of the GLHUA-1 are large than 1, radial parameter in GLHUA-2 cloak is large
than positive number, refractive index of the GLHUA 1-3 cloak are large than 1. 10. Two wave fronts
in GLHUA cloaks one front is absorbing incoming incident, other front is created wave by cloak materials.
