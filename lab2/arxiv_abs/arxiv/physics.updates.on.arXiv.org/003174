It is shown, using quantum field theory in curved spacetime, how the expansion of the universe during
inflation produces an aggregate of particles and inflaton vacuum fluctuations at a temperature
of 5x10^17GeV and dense enough to make reheating unnecessary. The standard calculation that predicts
the Hubble parameter has to be way smaller than the Planck energy is shown to be fallacious: it applies
the conservation of the perturbative curvature R to a single inflaton fluctuation when it should
be applied to the energy density contrast of an aggregate. The quantum inflaton fluctuations varphi
are with respect to the classical value phi_0 of the inflaton field phi=phi_0+varphi. Fluctuations
varphi that have grown to the size of the horizon, or a pair of virtual particles that are separated
by a distance the length of the horizon, are forced to become real and take energy from the potential
V(phi_0). The slowing down of inflation is due to the eventual domination of the continuously being
created radiation over the decreasing inflaton potential V(phi_0). It is not necessary at all for
the potential V(phi_0) to go to zero. Since there is no need for reheating the inflaton field phi does
not couple to matter (except gravitationally). After inflation, the fluctuations varphi quickly
cool down and can be described as dark matter. Now the inverse process begins to occur. Inflaton fluctuations
varphi that exited the horizon during inflation begin reentering it after inflation's end. Then
they are again causally connected and have a probability of undergoing the inverse of the quantum
process they underwent before and give their energy back to the potential V(phi_0). The varphi fluctuations
are turning into V(phi_0), which acts as dark energy and accelerates again the expansion of the universe.
The disintegration of a perturbation is a quantum jump of cosmological size.
