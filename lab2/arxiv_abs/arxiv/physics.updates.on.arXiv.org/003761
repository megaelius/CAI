A fair assignment of credit for multi-authored publications is a long-standing issue in scientometrics.
In the calculation of the $h$-index, for instance, all co-authors receive equal credit for a given
publication, independent of a given author's contribution to the work or of the total number of co-authors.
Several attempts have been made to distribute the credit in a more appropriate manner. In a recent
paper, Hirsch has suggested a new way of credit assignment that is fundamentally different from
the previous ones: All credit for a multi-author paper goes to a single author, the called ``$\alpha$-author'',
defined as the person with the highest current $h$-index not the highest $h$-index at the time of
the paper's publication) (J. E. Hirsch, Scientometrics 118, 673 (2019)). The collection of papers
this author has received credit for as $\alpha$-author is then used to calculate a new index, $h_{\alpha}$,
following the same recipe as for the usual $h$ index. The objective of this new assignment is not a
fairer distribution of credit, but rather the determination of an altogether different property,
the degree of a person's scientific leadership. We show that given the complex time dependence of
$h$ for individual scientists, the approach of using the current $h$ value instead of the historic
one is problematic, and we argue that it would be feasible to determine the $\alpha$-author at the
time of the paper's publication instead. On the other hand, there are other practical considerations
that make the calculation of the proposed $h_{\alpha}$ very difficult. As an alternative, we explore
other ways of crediting papers to a single author in order to test early career achievement or scientific
leadership.
