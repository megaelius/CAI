The Short Baseline Near Detector (SBND) is one of three liquid argon (LAr) neutrino detectors sitting
in the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab as part of the Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program.
The detector is in a cryostat holding 260-ton of LAr and consists of four 2.5 m (L) $\times$ 4 m (W) Anode
Plane Assembles (APAs) and two Cathode Plane Assemblies (CPAs), which leads to 11,264 Time Projection
Chamber (TPC) readout channels and two separate 2 m long drift regions. As an enabling technology,
Cold Electronics (CE) developed for cryogenic temperature operation makes possible an optimum
balance among various design and performance requirements for such large sized detectors. Brookhaven
National Laboratory (BNL) has been leading the R&D and implementation of the entire front-end CE
system for LAr TPC readout in collaboration with other SBND institutes. The front-end readout electronics
system includes the cold front-end electronics placed close to the wire electrodes, which detects
and digitizes the charge signal in LAr, as well as the warm interface electronics placed on the signal
feed-through flange outside of the cryostat, which further organizes and transmits the digitized
signal to the DAQ system. An extensive study of electronics suitable for 77 K - 300 K, including the
custom designed front-end ASIC and commercial components, e.g. ADC and FPGA, has been made to meet
requirements such as low noise, low power consumption, high reliability and long lifetime. Furthermore,
an integral design concept of APA, CE, feed-through, warm interface electronics with local diagnostics,
grounding and isolation rules has been practiced with vertical slice test stands to make projection
of the CE performance in the SBND detector.
