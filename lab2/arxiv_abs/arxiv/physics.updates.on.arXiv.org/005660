In the last decade, solid state nanopores nanogaps have attracted significant interest in the rapid
detection of DNA nucleotides. However, reducing the noise through the controlled translocating
of the DNA nucleobases is a central issue for the developing nanogap nanopore based DNA sequencing
to achieve single nucleobase resolution. Furthermore, the high reactivity of the graphene pores
gaps exhibits clogging of the pore gap, leading to the blockage of the pores gaps, yielding sticking,
and irreversible pore closure. To address the prospective of functionalization of carbon nanostructure
and for accomplishing this objective, herein, we have studied the performance of functionalized
closed end cap carbon nanotube CNT nanogap embedded electrodes which can improve the coupling through
nonbonding electrons and may provide the possibility of N and O and H pi interaction with nucleotides,
as single stranded DNA is transmigrated across. We have investigated the effect of functionalizing
the closed end cap CNT6,6 electrodes with purine adenine, guanine and pyrimidine thymine, cytosine
molecules. Weak hydrogen bonds formed between the probe molecule and target DNA nucleobase enhance
the electronic coupling and temporarily stabilize the translocating nucleobase against the orientational
fluctuations, which may reduce noise in the current signal during experimental measurements.
The findings of our density functional theory and non equilibrium Greens function based study indicates
that this modeled setup could allow DNA nucleotide sequencing with a better and reliable yield,
giving current traces that differ by at least 1 order of current magnitude for all four target nucleotides.
Thus, we feel that functionalized CNT nanogap embedded electrodes may be utilized for controlled
DNA sequencing.
