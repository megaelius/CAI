Aims: Nonpharmaceutical interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany included the
cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of schools and child day care facilities (from
March 16) as well as a "lockdown" (from March 23). This study attempts to assess the effectiveness
of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Methods: Dates
of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period
and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers
were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. Results: A significant
decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI
[7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations
are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19 (CI [18, 20]),
but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction
numbers fluctuate on a level below one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020
can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional
effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures did not
induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains
questionable. Moreover, assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection
dates and the influence of test volume.
