Visco-elasticity is the essential ingredient for quantitative seismic imaging and geological
interpretation in a number of contexts, such as in the presence of gas clouds. Decades of developments
of numerical simulation of visco-elastic wave equations in seismology are mainly based on constant
Q model, leading to numerous different forms of time-domain visco-elastic wave equations. Based
on rheological models, Emmerich and Korn (1987) adopted the Generalized Maxwell body (GMB) to implement
visco-elastic wave equations in time domain. Carcione, Kosloff, and Kosloff (1988a) incorporated
the Generalized Zener body (GZB) into the time-domain visco-elastic wave equation. Moczo and Kristek
(2005) proved that visco-elastic complex modulus based on GMB and GZB are equivalent. However,
from the rheological point of view, this formalism can not incorporate the fractional visco-elastic
wave equations based on the constant Q model (Kjartansson, 1979). Mainardi (2010) first mentioned
that the constant Q model is based on a fractional Scott-Blair model. The stress-strain relationship
of the Scott-Blair model is between a spring and a dashpot. Therefore, we review the various visco-elastic
wave equations in the text of seismology. Based on the stress-strain constitutive law of rheological
models, we propose a unification way to describe the existed visco-elastic wave equations. The
unification formalism indicates that each kind of visco-elastic wave equation is composed by the
combination of basic rheological elements, e.g., GMB, GZB. In this paper, we gather knowledge usually
available in separated papers in the fields of fractional calculus, rheology, mechanics, and seismology.
By unification formalism, we can establish more clearly links between different approaches used
in seismology.
