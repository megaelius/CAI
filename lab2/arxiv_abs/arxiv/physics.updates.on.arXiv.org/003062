The one dimensional (1D) driven quantum coupled pseudoforce system governing the dynamics of collective
Langmuir electron oscillations is used in order to investigate the effects of variety of space charge
distributions on plasmon excitations of a nearly free electron gas with arbitrary degree of degeneracy
and electron fluid temperature. A generalized closed form analytic expression for the grand wavefunction
of collective excitations in presence of an arbitrary space charge distribution is presented based
on the stationary solutions of the driven coupled pseudoforce system which has been derived from
the Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson model. The wavefunction and electrostatic potential profiles for
some especial cases such as the Heaviside charge distribution, Dirac charge sheet, impurity charge
sheet in 1D plasmonic lattice and the Kroning-Penney Dirac charge distributions with particular
applications in plasmonics and condensed matter physics is investigated in this paper. It is remarkably
found that two parallel Dirac charged sheets completely shield all interior plasmon excitations
with any given energy value from outside electrostatic fields and charge densities. It is also found
that the presence of even a weakly charged impurity layer within a perfect 1D plasmonic crystal profoundly
destroys the periodic electrostatic field of the crystal lattice, hence, the Bloch character of
the wavefunction considered in band gap theory of solids. Current investigation of electron excitations
in arbitrary degenerate electron gas in the presence of static charge distributions may be used
to develop analytic models for a variety of real physical situations. It also helps in further developments
of the rapidly growing fields of nanotechnology and plasmonics.
