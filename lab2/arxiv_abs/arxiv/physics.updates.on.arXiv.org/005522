The 3D quasi-static particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm is a very efficient method for modeling short-pulse
laser or relativistic charged particle beam-plasma interactions. In this algorithm, the plasma
response to a non-evolving laser or particle beam is calculated using Maxwell's equations based
on the quasi-static approximate equations that exclude radiation. The plasma fields are then used
to advance the laser or beam forward using a large time step. The algorithm is many orders of magnitude
faster than a 3D fully explicit relativistic electromagnetic PIC algorithm. It has been shown to
be capable to accurately model the evolution of lasers and particle beams in a variety of scenarios.
At the same time, an algorithm in which the fields, currents and Maxwell equations are decomposed
into azimuthal harmonics has been shown to reduce the complexity of a 3D explicit PIC algorithm to
that of a 2D algorithm when the expansion is truncated while maintaining accuracy for problems with
near azimuthal symmetry. This hybrid algorithm uses a PIC description in r-z and a gridless description
in $\phi$. We describe a novel method that combines the quasi-static and hybrid PIC methods. This
algorithm expands the fields, charge and current density into azimuthal harmonics. A set of the
quasi-static field equations are derived for each harmonic. The complex amplitudes of the fields
are then solved using the finite difference method. The beam and plasma particles are advanced in
Cartesian coordinates using the total fields. Details on how this algorithm was implemented using
a similar workflow to an existing quasi-static code, QuickPIC, are presented. The new code is called
QPAD for QuickPIC with Azimuthal Decomposition. Benchmarks and comparisons between a fully 3D
explicit PIC code, a full 3D quasi-static code, and the new quasi-static PIC code with azimuthal
decomposition are also presented.
