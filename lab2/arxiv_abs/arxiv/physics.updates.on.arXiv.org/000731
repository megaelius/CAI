For the first time the exact vortex solution of the Cauchy problem in unbounded space is obtained
for the three-dimensional Euler-Helmholtz (EH) equation in the case of a nonzero-divergence velocity
field for an ideal compressible medium. The solution obtained describes the inertial vortex motion
and coincides with the exact solution to the three-dimensional Riemann-Hopf (RH) equation which
simulates turbulence without pressure [Chefranov, 1991]. A necessary and sufficient condition
of the onset of a singularity in the evolution of the enstrophy in finite time t=t0 is obtained for
this solution when its continuation is possible in times t>=t0 in the Sobolev space H^0(R^3) but
cannot be made in H^1(R^3). A closed description of the evolution of the enstrophy and the all other
moments of the velocity and vortex fields is given, i.e., the main problem of theory of turbulence
is solved exactly. The possibility of continuation of the obtained smooth solution to the EH an RH
equations in the Sobolev space H^q(R^3) is also demonstrated for any q>=1 and t>=t0 due to introduction
of a fairly large homogeneous friction or by introducing an arbitrary small effective volume viscosity.
A new analytic solution of the Cauchy problem for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) equation
is obtained. This solution coincides with the above-mentioned smooth solution to the EH and RH equations,
which take into account the viscosity effect of a compressible medium and also the sufficient condition
of positive definiteness of the growth rate of the entropy in the form of a linear relation between
the pressure and the divergence of the velocity field. This gives the positive solution to the generalization
of the Millennium Prize Problem on the compressible Navier-Stokes equation where only the modification
of viscous force is used (by introduction of homogeneous friction and etc.).
