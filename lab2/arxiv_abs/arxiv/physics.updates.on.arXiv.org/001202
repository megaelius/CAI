Intraocular pressure, resulting from the balance of aqueous humor (AH) production and drainage,
is the only approved treatable risk factor in glaucoma. AH production is determined by the concurrent
function of ionic pumps and aquaporins in the ciliary processes but their individual contribution
is difficult to characterize experimentally. In this work, we propose a novel unified modeling
and computational framework for the finite element simulation of the role of the main ionic pumps
involved in AH secretion, namely, the sodium potassium pump, the calcium-sodium pump, the anion
channel and the hydrogenate-sodium pump. The theoretical model is developed at the cellular scale
and is based on the coupling between electrochemical and fluid-dynamical transmembrane mechanisms
characterized by a novel description of the electric pressure exerted by the ions on the intrachannel
fluid that includes electrochemical and osmotic corrections. Considering a realistic geometry
of the ionic pumps, the proposed model is demonstrated to correctly predict their functionality
as a function of (1) the permanent electric charge density over the channel pump surface; (2) the
osmotic gradient coefficient; (3) the stoichiometric ratio between the ionic pump currents enforced
at the inlet and outlet sections of the channel. In particular, theoretical predictions of the transepithelial
membrane potential for each simulated pump/channel allow us to perform a first significant model
comparison with experimental data for monkeys. This is a significant step for future multidisciplinary
studies on the action of molecules on AH production.
