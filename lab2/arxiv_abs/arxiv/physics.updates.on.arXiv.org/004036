In this research, we investigate in-depth the nonlinear energy transmission phenomenon in a metastable
modular metastructure and develop efficient tools for the design of such systems. Previous studies
on a one-dimensional (1D) reconfigurable metastable modular chain uncover that when the driving
frequency is within the stopband of the periodic structure, there exists a threshold input amplitude,
beyond which sudden increase in the energy transmission can be observed. This onset of transmission
is caused by nonlinear instability and is known as supratransmission. Due to spatial asymmetry
of strategically configured constituents, such transmission thresholds could shift considerably
when the structure is excited from different ends and therefore enabling the non-reciprocal energy
transmission. This one-way propagation characteristic can be adaptable via reconfiguring the
metastable modular system. In this new study, we build upon these findings and advance the state
of the art by (a) exploring the different mechanisms that are able to activate the onset of supratransmission
and their implications on wave energy transmission potential, and (b) developing an effective
design tool - a localized nonlinear-linear model combined with harmonic balancing and transfer
matrix analyses to analytically and efficiently predict the critical threshold amplitude of the
metastable modular chain. These investigations provide important new understandings of the rich
and intricate dynamics achievable by nonlinearity, asymmetry, and metastability, and create
opportunities to accomplish adaptable non-reciprocal wave energy transmission
