With the observation of the gravitational wave event of August 17th 2017 and then with those of the
extragalactic neutrino of September 22nd, the multi messenger astronomy era has definitely begun.
With the opening of this new panorama, it is necessary to have a perfect coordination of the several
observatories. Crystal Eye is an experiment aimed at the exploration of the electromagnetic counterpart
of the gravitational wave events. Such events generated by neutron stars collision (or mergers)
are associated with gamma-ray bursts. It has actually been observed in the event GW170817 that there
is an X-ray counterpart associated with the GW consistent with a short gamma-ray burst viewed off-axis.
These X-ray emissions represent the missing observational link between short gamma-ray bursts
and gravitational waves from neutron-star mergers. The experiment we propose is a wide field of
view observatory (2{\pi} of local observation) in the energy range from tens of keV to few MeV designed
to fly with International Space Station (ISS). The motion along the ISS orbit will allow the experiment
to scan the sky at 4? in 90 minutes. The Crystal Eye objectives will be: to alert the community about
events containing X-rays and low energy gamma-rays, to monitor long-term variabilities of X-ray
sources, to stimulate multi-wavelength observations of variable objects, and to observe diffuse
cosmic X-ray emissions. With its characteristics, Crystal Eye will provide the continuous exploration
and monitoring of the Universe after a Gravitational Wave event with a better resolution than Fermi
GBM. Thanks to its large field of view and its design, it has the potentiality to be the trigger for
those present X ray-astronomy missions (Chandra, Swift, Integral XMM Newton) that are based on
high angular resolution pointing experiment but that have unfortunately a very small field of view.
