Photosensitive proteins embedded in the cell membrane (about 5 nm thickness) act as photoactivated
proton pumps, ion gates, enzymes, or more generally, as initiators of stimuli for the cell activity.
They are composed of a protein backbone and a covalently bound cofactor (e.g. the retinal chromophore
in bacteriorhodopsin (BR), channel rhodopsin, and other opsins). The light-induced conformational
changes of both the cofactor and the protein are at the basis of the physiological functions of photosensitive
proteins. Despite the dramatic development of microscopy techniques, investigating conformational
changes of proteins at the membrane monolayer level is still a big challenge. Techniques based on
atomic force microscopy (AFM) can detect electric currents through protein monolayers and even
molecular binding forces in single-protein molecules but not the conformational changes. For
the latter, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) using difference-spectroscopy
mode is typically employed, but it is performed on macroscopic liquid suspensions or thick films
containing large amounts of purified photosensitive proteins. In this work, we develop AFM-assisted,
tip-enhanced infrared difference-nanospectroscopy to investigate light-induced conformational
changes of the bacteriorhodopsin mutant D96N in single submicrometric native purple membrane
patches. We obtain a significant improvement compared with the signal-to-noise ratio of standard
IR nanospectroscopy techniques by exploiting the field enhancement in the plasmonic nanogap that
forms between a gold-coated AFM probe tip and an ultraflat gold surface, as further supported by
electromagnetic and thermal simulations. IR difference-spectra in the 1450-1800 cm^{-1} range
are recorded from individual patches as thin as 10 nm, with a diameter of less than 500 nm, well beyond
the diffraction limit for FTIR microspectroscopy...
