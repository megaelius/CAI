Geometrical cues are known to play a very important role in neuronal growth and the formation of neuronal
networks. Here, we present a detailed analysis of axonal growth and dynamics for neuronal cells
cultured on patterned polydimethylsiloxane surfaces. We use fluorescence microscopy to image
neurons, quantify their dynamics, and demonstrate that the substrate geometrical patterns cause
strong directional alignment of axons. We quantify axonal growth and report a general stochastic
approach that quantitatively describes the motion of growth cones. The growth cone dynamics is
described by Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations with both deterministic and stochastic contributions.
We show that the deterministic terms contain both the angular and speed dependence of axonal growth,
and that these two contributions can be separated. Growth alignment is determined by surface geometry,
and it is quantified by the deterministic part of the Langevin equation. We combine experimental
data with theoretical analysis to measure the key parameters of the growth cone motion: speed and
angular distributions, correlation functions, diffusion coefficients, characteristics speeds
and damping coefficients. We demonstrate that axonal dynamics displays a cross-over from Brownian
motion (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) at earlier times to anomalous dynamics (superdiffusion)
at later times. The superdiffusive regime is characterized by non-Gaussian speed distributions
and power law dependence of the axonal mean square length and the velocity correlation functions.
These results demonstrate the importance of geometrical cues in guiding axonal growth, and could
lead to new methods for bioengineering novel substrates for controlling neuronal growth and regeneration.
