The LiDAR Statistical Barnes Objective Analysis (LiSBOA), presented in Letizia et al., is a procedure
for the optimal design of LiDAR scans and calculation over a Cartesian grid of the statistical moments
of the velocity field. The LiSBOA is applied to LiDAR data collected in the wake of wind turbines to
reconstruct mean and turbulence intensity of the wind velocity field. The proposed procedure is
firstly tested for a numerical dataset obtained by means of the virtual LiDAR technique applied
to the data obtained from a large eddy simulation (LES). The optimal sampling parameters for a scanning
Doppler pulsed wind LiDAR are retrieved from the LiSBOA, then the estimated statistics are calculated
showing a maximum error of about 4% for both the normalized mean velocity and the turbulence intensity.
Subsequently, LiDAR data collected during a field campaign conducted at a wind farm in complex terrain
are analyzed through the LiSBOA for two different configurations. In the first case, the wake velocity
fields of four utility-scale turbines are reconstructed on a 3D grid, showing the capability of
the LiSBOA to capture complex flow features, such as high-speed jet around the nacelle and the wake
turbulent shear layers. For the second case, the statistics of the wakes generated by four interacting
turbines are calculated over a 2D Cartesian grid and compared to the measurements provided by the
nacelle-mounted anemometers. Maximum discrepancies as low as 3% for the normalized mean velocity
and turbulence intensity endorse the application of the LiSBOA for LiDAR-based wind resource assessment
and diagnostic surveys for wind farms.
