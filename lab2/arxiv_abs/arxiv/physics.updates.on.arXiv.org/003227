Geodetic earthquake early warning (EEW) algorithms complement point-source seismic systems
by estimating fault-finiteness and unsaturated moment magnitude for the largest, most damaging
earthquakes. Because such earthquakes are rare, it has been difficult to demonstrate that geodetic
warnings improve ground motion estimation significantly. Here, we quantify and compare timeliness
and accuracy of magnitude and ground motion estimates in simulated real time from seismic and geodetic
observations for a suite of globally-distributed, large earthquakes. Magnitude solutions saturate
for the seismic EEW algorithm (we use ElarmS) while the ElarmS-triggered Geodetic Alarm System
(G-larmS) reduces the error even for its first solutions. Shaking intensity (MMI) time series calculated
for each station and each event are assessed based on MMI-threshold crossings, allowing us to accurately
characterize warning times per-station. We classify alerts and find that MMI 4 thresholds result
in only 12.3% true positive (TP) alerts with a median warning time of 16.3 +- 20.9 s for ElarmS, but
44.4% TP alerts with a longer median warning time of 50.2 +- 49.8 s for G-larmS. The geodetic EEW system
reduces the number of missed alerts for thresholds of MMI 3 and 4 by over 30%. If G-larmS was triggered
instantaneously at the earthquake origin time, the performance statistics are similar, with slightly
longer warning times and slightly more accurate magnitudes. By quantifying increased accuracy
in magnitude, ground motion estimation, and alert timeliness; we demonstrate that geodetic algorithms
add significant value, including better cost savings performance, to EEW systems.
