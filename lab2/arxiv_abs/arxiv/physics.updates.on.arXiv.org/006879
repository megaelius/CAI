We propose a novel type of bi-anisotropic hybrid metal-dielectric structure comprising dielectric
and metallic cylindrical wedges wherein the composite meta-cylinder enables advanced control
of electric, magnetic and magnetoelectric resonances. We establish a theoretical framework in
which the electromagnetic response of this meta-atom is described through the electric and magneticmultipole
moments. The complete dynamic polarizability tensor, expressed in a compact form, is derived as
a function of the Mie scattering coefficients. Flexibility in the design makes the proposed meta-cylinder
a viable candidate for various applications in the microscopic (single meta-atom) and macroscopic
(metasurface) levels. We show that the highly versatile bi-anisotropic meta-atom is amenable
to being designed for the desired electromagnetic response, such as electric dipole-free and zero/near-zero
(backward and forward) scattering at the microscopic level. In addition, we show that the azimuthal
asymmetry gives rise to normal polarizability components which are vital elements in synthesizing
asymmetric Optical Transfer Function (OTF) at the macroscopic level.We conduct a precise inspection,
from the microscopic to the macroscopic level, of the metasurface synthesis for emphasizing on
the role of normal polarizability components for spatial optical signal processing. It is shown
that this simple two-dimensional asymmetric meta-atom can perform first-order differentiation
and edge detection at normal illumination.The results reported herein contribute toward improving
the physical understanding of wave interaction with artificial materials composed of asymmetric
elongated metal-dielectric inclusions and open the potential of its application in spatial signal
and image processing.
