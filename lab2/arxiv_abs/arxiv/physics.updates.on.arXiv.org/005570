Magmatic volatiles can be considered as the surface fingerprint of active volcanic systems, both
during periods of quiescent and eruptive volcanic activity. The spatial variability of gas emissions
at Earths surface is a proxy for structural discontinuities in the subsurface of volcanic systems.
We conducted extensive and regular spaced soil gas surveys within the Los Humeros geothermal field
to improve the understanding of the structural control on fluid flow. Surveys at different scales
were performed with the aim to identify areas of increased gas emissions on reservoir scale, their
relation to unknown/knows volcano-tectonic structures on fault scale favoring fluid flow, and
determine the origin of gas emissions. Herein, we show results from a carbon dioxide efflux scouting
survey, which was performed across the main geothermal production zone together with soil temperature
measurements. We identified five areas with increased carbon dioxide emissions, where further
sampling was performed with denser sampling grids to understand the fault zone architecture and
local variations in gas emissions. We show that a systematic sampling approach on reservoir scale
is necessary for the identification and assessment of major permeable fault segments. The combined
processing of CO2 efflux and carbon/helium isotopes facilitated the detection of permeable structural
segments with a connection to the deep, high-temperature geothermal reservoir, also in areas with
low to intermediate carbon dioxide emissions. The results of this study complement existing geophysical
datasets and define further promising areas for future exploration activities in the north- and
southwestern sector of the production field.
