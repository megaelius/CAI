A novel lattice Boltzmann (LB) model with self-tuning equation of state (EOS) is developed in this
work for simulating coupled thermo-hydrodynamic flows. The velocity field is solved by the recently
developed multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) LB equation for density distribution function (DF),
by which a self-tuning EOS can be recovered. As to the temperature field, a novel MRT LB equation for
total energy DF is directly developed at the discrete level. By introducing a density-DF-related
term into this LB equation and devising the equilibrium moment function for total energy DF, the
viscous dissipation and compression work are consistently considered, and by modifying the collision
matrix, the targeted energy conservation equation is recovered without deviation term. The full
coupling of thermo-hydrodynamic effects is achieved via the self-tuning EOS and the viscous dissipation
and compression work. The present LB model is developed on the basis of the standard lattice, and
various EOSs can be adopted in real applications. Moreover, both the Prandtl number and specific
heat ratio can be arbitrarily adjusted. Furthermore, boundary condition treatment is also proposed
on the basis of the judicious decomposition of DF into its equilibrium, force (source), and nonequilibrium
parts. The local conservation of mass, momentum, and energy can be strictly satisfied at the boundary
node. Numerical simulations of thermal Poiseuille and Couette flows are carried out with three
different EOSs, and the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical solutions.
Then, natural convection in a square cavity with a large temperature difference is simulated for
the Rayleigh number from $10^3$ up to $10^8$. Good agreement between the present and previous numerical
results is observed, which further validates the present LB model for coupled thermo-hydrodynamic
flows.
