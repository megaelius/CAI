In this experimental study on a laboratory-scale turbulent annular combustor with sixteen swirl-stabilized
burners, we study the flame-flame interactions and the resulting flame synchronization during
different dynamical states of combustor operation. We simultaneously measure the acoustic pressure
and CH* chemiluminescence emission of the flame using high-speed camera. Upon changing the equivalence
ratio, the combustor undergoes the following sequence of transition: combustion noise (CN) to
low amplitude thermoacoustic instability (TAI) through the state of intermittency (INT), and
from low amplitude to high amplitude TAI through a secondary bifurcation. Secondary bifurcation
has been predicted in a numerical study and shown in a laminar burner. We report the evidence of secondary
bifurcation from low amplitude TAI to high amplitude TAI for a turbulent thermoacoustic system.
We find a significant difference in the dynamics of the flame interactions during the periodic part
of intermittency, low and high amplitude TAI. Specifically, during the periodic part of intermittency,
the phase difference between various burners show significant phase slips in time. During low amplitude
TAI, there are fewer phase slips among the burners which result in a state of weak synchronization
among the flames. During high amplitude TAI, we find that the flames are in perfect synchrony amongst
themselves and with the pressure fluctuations. We then quantify the degree of temporal and spatial
synchronization between different flames, and flames and pressure fluctuations using the Kuramoto
order parameter and phase-locking value. We show that synchronization theory can be conveniently
used to characterize and quantify the flame interactions.
