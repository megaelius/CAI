Purpose: To investigate deep learning electrical properties tomography (EPT) for application
on different simulated and in-vivo datasets including pathologies for obtaining quantitative
brain conductivity maps. Methods: 3D patch-based convolutional neural networks were trained
to predict conductivity maps from B1 transceive phase data. To compare the performance of DLEPT
networks on different datasets, three datasets were used throughout this work, one from simulations
and two from in-vivo measurements from healthy volunteers and cancer patients, respectively.
At first, networks trained on simulations are tested on all datasets with different levels of homogeneous
Gaussian noise introduced in training and testing. Secondly, to investigate potential robustness
towards systematical differences between simulated and measured phase maps, in-vivo data with
conductivity labels from conventional EPT is used for training. Results: High quality of reconstructions
from networks trained on simulations with and without noise confirms the potential of deep learning
for EPT. However, artifact encumbered results in this work uncover challenges in application of
DLEPT to in-vivo data. Training DLEPT networks on conductivity labels from conventional EPT improves
quality of results. This is argued to be caused by robustness to artifacts from image acquisition.
Conclusions: Networks trained on simulations with added homogeneous Gaussian noise yield reconstruction
artifacts when applied to in-vivo data. Training with realistic phase data and conductivity labels
from conventional EPT allows for severely reducing these artifacts.
