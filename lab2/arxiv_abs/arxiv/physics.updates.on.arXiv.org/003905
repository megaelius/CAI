It is a challenge to obtain an accurate model of the state-to-state dynamics of a complex biological
system from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Typically, biologically relevant processes
occur at time scales on the order of milliseconds while the all-atom MD integration time step is on
the order of femtoseconds. In recent years, Markov State Models have gained immense popularity
for computing long-time dynamics from a pool of short MD simulations. However, the assumption that
the underlying dynamics on the reduced space is Markovian induces a systematic bias in the model,
especially in biomolecular systems with complicated energy landscapes. To address this problem,
we have devised a new approach we call quasi-stationary distribution kinetic Monte Carlo (QSD-KMC)
that gives accurate long time dynamics while retaining the entire time resolution even when the
dynamics is highly non-Markovian. The proposed method is a kinetic Monte Carlo approach that takes
advantage of two concepts: (i) the quasi-stationary distribution and (ii) dynamical corrections
theory. With these two components, the QSD-KMC model produces state-to-state trajectories that
are statistically indistinguishable from an MD trajectory mapped onto the discrete set of states,
for an arbitrary choice of state decomposition. Furthermore, the aforementioned concepts can
be used to construct a Monte Carlo approach to optimize the state boundaries regardless of the initial
choice of state decomposition. Furthermore, the aforementioned concepts can be used to construct
a Monte Carlo approach to optimize the state boundaries regardless of the initial choice of states.
We demonstrate the QSD-KMC method on two one-dimensional model systems, one of which is a driven
nonequilibrium system, and on two well-characterized biomolecular systems.
