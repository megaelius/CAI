Measurements are reported of electromagnetic emission close to the cyclotron frequency of energetic
ions in JET plasmas heated by waves in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF). Hydrogen was
the majority ion species in all of these plasmas. The measurements were obtained using a sub-harmonic
arc detection (SHAD) system in the transmission lines of one of the ICRF antennas. The measured ion
cyclotron emission (ICE) spectra were strongly filtered by the antenna system, and typically contained
sub-structure, consisting of sets of peaks with a separation of a few kHz, suggesting the excitation
of compressional Alfven eigenmodes (CAEs) closely spaced in frequency. In most cases the energetic
ions can be clearly identified as ICRF-accelerated He-3 minority ions, although in two pulses the
emission may have been produced by energetic He-4 ions, originating from third harmonic ICRF wave
acceleration. It is proposed that the emission close to the He-3 cyclotron frequency was produced
by energetic ions of this species undergoing drift orbit excursions to the outer midplane plasma
edge. Particle-in-cell and hybrid (kinetic ion, fluid electron) simulations using plasma parameters
corresponding to edge plasma conditions in these JET pulses, and energetic particle parameters
inferred from the cyclotron resonance location, indicate strong excitation of waves at He-3 cyclotron
harmonics, including the fundamental, which is identified with the observed emission. These results
underline the potential importance of ICE measurements as a method of studying confined fast particles
that are strongly suprathermal but have insufficient energies or are not present in sufficient
numbers to excite detectable levels of gamma-ray emission or other collective instabilities.
