Wavelength-dispersive spectrometers (WDS) are often used in synchrotron and FEL applications
where high energy resolution (in the order of eV) is important. Increasing WDS energy resolution
requires increasing spatial resolution of the detectors in the dispersion direction. The common
approaches with strip detectors or small pixel detectors are not ideal. We present a novel approach,
with a sensor using rectangular pixels with a high aspect ratio (between strips and pixels, further
called "strixels"), and strixel redistribution to match the square pixel arrays of typical ASICs
while avoiding the considerable effort of redesigning ASICs. This results in a sensor area of 17.4
mm x 77 mm, with a fine pitch of 25 $\mu$m in the horizontal direction resulting in 3072 columns and
176 rows. The sensors use ePix100 readout ASICs, leveraging their low noise (43 e$^-$, or 180 eV rms).
We present results obtained with a Hammerhead ePix100 camera, showing that the small pitch (25 $\mu$m)
in the dispersion direction maximizes performance for both high and low photon occupancies, resulting
in optimal WDS energy resolution. The low noise level at high photon occupancy allows precise photon
counting, while at low occupancy, both the energy and the subpixel position can be reconstructed
for every photon, allowing an ultrahigh resolution (in the order of 1 $\mu$m) in the dispersion direction
and rejection of scattered beam and harmonics. Using strixel sensors with redistribution and flip-chip
bonding to standard ePix readout ASICs results in ultrahigh position resolution ($\sim$1 $\mu$m)
and low noise in WDS applications, leveraging the advantages of hybrid pixel detectors (high production
yield, good availability, relatively inexpensive) while minimizing development complexity
through sharing the ASIC, hardware, software and DAQ development with existing versions of ePix
cameras.
