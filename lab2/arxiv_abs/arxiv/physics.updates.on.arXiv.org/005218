High frequency signals propagate along the edges of conductors. If the conductors are electroplated,
then the seed layer forms at least one edge, so care must be taken to insure the electrical quality
of these layers. In this work, we study the initial quality of SAM-based seed layers that are compatible
with complex surfaces including through-silicon vias (TSVs), as are used in via-last three-dimensional
semiconductor device packaging. The conformal and electrical quality of the seed metal is very
important. Also important for a multifunction seed layer is its ability as a barrier layer, which
protects the substrate from high temperature diffusion of the deposited metal. Thus, the barrier
layer must be robust enough to withstand diffusion, yet thin enough to provide a conformal surface
that allows metal seed layer deposition. Standard barrier layer deposition methods such as evaporation
or sputtering require either a line of sight from the source or aspect ratios large enough to provide
scattering from the background gas within the structure to coat all surfaces. Electrochemical
and chemical vapor deposition provide alternatives, but concerns arise about contamination and
compatibility with radio frequency or high-speed digital signals. We propose a barrier layer based
on an aromatic self-assembled monolayer (SAM) for use in electroless copper seed layer deposition.
The viability of the SAM barrier layer is determined by the quality of the deposited copper seed film,
judged quantitatively by thin film resistivity and qualitatively by surface adhesion and morphological
properties such as cracks and bubbles. Insights to the origins of problems and an optimal scheme
are described. Extensions for use as a photolithographic resist layer are suggested. Our SAM approach
for TSV applications yields a 'smart' seed layer that can be used with a 'simple,' scalloped, easy
to fabricate, via hole.
