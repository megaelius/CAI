The discovery of topological phases has recently led to a paradigm shift in condensed matter physics,
and facilitated breakthroughs in engineered photonics and acoustic metamaterials. Topological
insulators (TIs) enable the generation of electronic, photonic, and acoustic modes exhibiting
wave propagation that is resilient to disorder, irrespective of manufacturing precision or unpredictable
defects induced by the operational environment, known as topological protection. While originally
limited to a dimensionality of the protected states that is one dimension lower than the host TI material,
the recent discovery of higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) provides the potential to
overcome this dimensionality limitations by offering topological protection over an extended
range of dimensionalities. Here we demonstrate 2D photonic HOTI (PHOTI) with topological states
two dimensions lower than the one of the host system. We consider a photonic metacrystal of distorted
Kagome lattice geometry that exhibits topological bulk polarization, leading to the emergence
of 1D topological edge states and of higher order 0D states confined to the corners of the structure.
Interestingly, in addition to corner states due to the nearest neighbour interactions and protected
by generalized chiral symmetry 1, we discover and take advantage of a new class of topological corner
states sustained by long-range interactions, available in wave-based systems, such as in photonics.
Our findings demonstrate that photonic HOTIs possess richer physics compared to their condensed
matter counterparts, offering opportunities for engineering novel designer electromagnetic
states with unique topological robustness.
