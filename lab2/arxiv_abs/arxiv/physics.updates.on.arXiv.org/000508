This paper demonstrates that type Ia supernova observations which appear to provide strong support
for time dilation (and thus for an expanding universe) are equally consistent with a model for a static
universe. An important consideration is the Phillips relation, a correlation between the peak
luminosity and the width of type 1a supernovae, which is common to both cosmological models. The
estimation of the fiducial constant, a quantity which is the same for all supernovae, requires a
combined fit over global constants and the properties of each type 1a supernova. This estimate which
incorporates the Phillips relation is composed of peak magnitude and width (of the light curve)
for each supernova such that the combination is the same for both models but the values of the individual
components are different. Because the static model has a different distance modulus, which changes
the absolute magnitudes, this change alters the value of the widths so that the contribution from
each supernova to each fiducial estimate is essentially the same. The major result of this paper
is to show that the increase of widths of type Ia supernovae with redshift is what would be expected
if an expansion model analysis were applied to data from a static universe. In particular this paper
shows that the estimation of widths as well as magnitudes is affected by the use of a different distance
modulus in conjunction with the Phillips relation. It is argued that the photometric-redshift
relation is really a photometric-width relation that is consistent with a static universe. Similarly,
observations of spectroscopic ages are a measure of the light curve width and are consistent with
a static universe. Furthermore as a separate but related issue it is shown that in a static model the
density distribution of type Ia supernovae as a function of redshift agrees with the observations.
