Solid state convection can take place in the rocky or icy mantles of planetary objects and these mantles
can be surrounded above or below or both by molten layers of similar composition. A flow toward the
interface can proceed through it by changing phase. This behaviour is modeled by a boundary condition
taking into account the competition between viscous stress in the solid, that builds topography
of the interface with a timescale $\tau_\eta$, and convective transfer of the latent heat in the
liquid from places of the boundary where freezing occurs to places of melting, which acts to erase
topography, with a timescale $\tau_\phi$. The ratio $\Phi=\tau_\phi/\tau_\eta$ controls whether
the boundary condition is the classical non-penetrative one ($\Phi\rightarrow \infty$) or allows
for a finite flow through the boundary (small $\Phi$). We study Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in
a plane layer subject to this boundary condition at either or both its boundaries using linear and
weakly non-linear analyses. When both boundaries are phase change interfaces with equal values
of $\Phi$, a non-deforming translation mode is possible with a critical Rayleigh number equal to
$24\Phi$. At small values of $\Phi$, this mode competes with a weakly deforming mode having a slightly
lower critical Rayleigh number and a very long wavelength, $\lambda_c\sim 8\sqrt{2}\pi/ 3\sqrt{\Phi}$.
Both modes lead to very efficient heat transfer, as expressed by the relationship between the Nusselt
and Rayleigh numbers. When only one boundary is subject to a phase change condition, the critical
Rayleigh number is $\Ray_c=153$ and the critical wavelength is $\lambda_c=5$. The Nusselt number
increases about twice faster with Rayleigh number than in the classical case with non-penetrative
conditions when the bottom boundary is a phase change interface.
