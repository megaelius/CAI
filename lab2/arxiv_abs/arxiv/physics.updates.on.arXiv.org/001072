The impedance/admittance measurements of a piezoelectric transducer bonded to or embedded in
a host structure can be used as damage indicator. When a credible model of the healthy structure,
such as the finite element model, is available, using the impedance/admittance change information
as input, it is possible to identify both the location and severity of damage. The inverse analysis,
however, may be under-determined as the number of unknowns in high-frequency analysis is usually
large while available input information is limited. The fundamental challenge thus is how to find
a small set of solutions that cover the true damage scenario. In this research we cast the damage identification
problem into a multi-objective optimization framework to tackle this challenge. With damage locations
and severities as unknown variables, one of the objective functions is the difference between impedance-based
model prediction in the parametric space and the actual measurements. Considering that damage
occurrence generally affects only a small number of elements, we choose the sparsity of the unknown
variables as another objective function, deliberately, the l0 norm. Subsequently, a multi-objective
Dividing RECTangles (DIRECT) algorithm is developed to facilitate the inverse analysis where
the sparsity is further emphasized by sigmoid transformation. As a deterministic technique, this
approach yields results that are repeatable and conclusive. In addition, only one algorithmic
parameter, the number of function evaluations, is needed. Numerical and experimental case studies
demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of obtaining high-quality damage identification
solutions with limited measurement information.
