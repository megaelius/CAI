Fluid-structure systems occur in a range of scientific and engineering applications. The immersed
boundary(IB) method is a widely recognized and effective modeling paradigm for simulating fluid-structure
interaction(FSI) in such systems, but a difficulty of the IB formulation is that the pressure and
viscous stress are generally discontinuous at the interface. The conventional IB method regularizes
these discontinuities, which typically yields low-order accuracy at these interfaces. The immersed
interface method(IIM) is an IB-like approach to FSI that sharply imposes stress jump conditions,
enabling higher-order accuracy, but prior applications of the IIM have been largely restricted
to methods that rely on smooth representations of the interface geometry. This paper introduces
an IIM that uses only a C0 representation of the interface,such as those provided by standard nodal
Lagrangian FE methods. Verification examples for models with prescribed motion demonstrate that
the method sharply resolves stress discontinuities along the IB while avoiding the need for analytic
information of the interface geometry. We demonstrate that only the lowest-order jump conditions
for the pressure and velocity gradient are required to realize global 2nd-order accuracy. Specifically,we
show 2nd-order global convergence rate along with nearly 2nd-order local convergence in the Eulerian
velocity, and between 1st-and 2nd-order global convergence rates along with 1st-order local convergence
for the Eulerian pressure. We also show 2nd-order local convergence in the interfacial displacement
and velocity along with 1st-order local convergence in the fluid traction. As a demonstration of
the method's ability to tackle complex geometries,this approach is also used to simulate flow in
an anatomical model of the inferior vena cava.
