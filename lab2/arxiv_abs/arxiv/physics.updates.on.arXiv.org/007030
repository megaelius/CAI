Purpose: Acquisition timing and B$_1$ calibration are two key factors that affect the quality and
accuracy of hyperpolarized $^{13}$C MRI. The goal of this project was to develop a new approach using
regional bolus tracking to trigger Bloch-Siegert B$_1$ mapping and real-time B$_1$ calibration
based on regional B$_1$ measurements, followed by dynamic imaging of hyperpolarized $^{13}C$
metabolites in vivo. Methods: The proposed approach was implemented on a system which allows real-time
data processing and real-time control on the sequence. Real-time center frequency calibration
upon the bolus arrival was also added. The feasibility of applying the proposed framework for in
vivo hyperpolarized $^{13}$C imaging was tested on healthy rats, tumor-bearing mice and a healthy
volunteer on a clinical 3T scanner following hyperpolarized [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate injection.
Multichannel receive coils were used in the human study. Results: Automatic acquisition timing
based on either regional bolus peak or bolus arrival was achieved with the proposed framework. Reduced
blurring artifacts in real-time reconstructed images were observed with real-time center frequency
calibration. Real-time computed B$_1$ scaling factors agreed with real-time acquired B$_1$ maps.
Flip angle correction using B$_1$ maps results in a more consistent quantification of metabolic
activity (i.e, pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, k$_{PL}$). Experiment recordings are provided
to demonstrate the real-time actions during the experiment. Conclusion: The proposed method was
successfully demonstrated on animals and a human volunteer, and is anticipated to improve the efficient
use of the hyperpolarized signal as well as the accuracy and robustness of hyperpolarized $^{13}$C
imaging.
