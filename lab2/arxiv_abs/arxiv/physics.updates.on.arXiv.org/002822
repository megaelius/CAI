Understanding the molecular vibrations underlying each of the unknown infrared emission (UIE)
bands (such as those found at 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 6.2, 6.9, 7.7, 11.3, 15.8, 16.4, 18.9 mm) observed in or
towards astronomical objects is a vital link to uncover the molecular identity of their carriers.
This is usually done by customary classifications of normal mode frequencies such as stretching,
deformation, rocking, wagging, skeletal mode, etc. A large literature on this subject exists and
since 1952 ambiguities in classifications of normal modes via this empirical approach were pointed
out by Morino and Kuchitsu [1]. New ways of interpretation and analyzing vibrational spectra were
sought within the theoretical framework of quantum chemistry [2,3]. Many of these methods cannot
easily be applied [3] to the large, complex molecular systems which are one of the key research interests
of astrochemistry. In considering this demand, a simple and new method of analyzing and classifying
the normal mode vibrational motions of molecular systems was introduced [4]. This approach is a
fully quantitative method of analysis of normal mode displacement vector matrices and classification
of the characteristic frequencies (fundamentals) underlying the observed IR bands. Outcomes
of applying such an approach show some overlap with customary empirical classifications, usually
at short wavelengths. It provides a quantitative breakdown of a complex vibration (at longer wavelengths)
into the contributed fragments like their aromatic or aliphatic components. In addition, in molecular
systems outside the classical models of chemical bonds and structures where the empirical approach
cannot be applied, this quantitative method enables an interpretation of vibrational motion(s)
underlying the IR bands.
