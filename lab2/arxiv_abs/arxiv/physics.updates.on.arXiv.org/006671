Purpose: To separate the effects of magnetic susceptibility and chemical shift/exchange in a phantom
with isotropic magnetic susceptibility. To generate a chemical shift/exchange-corrected quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) result. Theory and Methods: Magnetic susceptibility and chemical
shift/exchange are the properties of a material. Both are known to induce the resonance frequency
shift in MRI. In current QSM, the susceptibility is reconstructed from the frequency shift, ignoring
the contribution of the chemical shift/exchange. In this work, a simple geometric approach, which
averages the frequency shift maps from three orthogonal B0 directions to generate a chemical shift/exchange
map, is developed using the fact that the average nullifies the (isotropic) susceptibility effects.
The resulting chemical shift/exchange map is subtracted from the total frequency shift, producing
a frequency shift map solely from susceptibility. Finally, this frequency shift map is reconstructed
to a susceptibility map using a QSM algorithm. The proposed method is validated in numerical simulations
and applied to phantom experiments with olive oil, bovine serum albumin, ferritin, and iron oxide
solutions. Results: Both simulations and experiments confirm that the method successfully separates
the contributions of the susceptibility and chemical shift/exchange, reporting the susceptibility
and chemical shift/exchange of olive oil (susceptibility: 0.62 ppm, chemical shift: -3.60 ppm),
bovine serum albumin (susceptibility: -0.059 ppm, chemical shift: 0.008 ppm), ferritin (susceptibility:
0.125 ppm, chemical shift: -0.005 ppm), and iron oxide (susceptibility: 0.30 ppm, chemical shift:
-0.039 ppm) solutions. Conclusion: The proposed method successfully separates the susceptibility
and chemical shift/exchange in phantoms with isotropic magnetic susceptibility.
