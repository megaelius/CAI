The steep climbing of victims caused by the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout
the planet is sparking an unprecedented effort to identify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle
the pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding
of one of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus,
the spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and antiviral drugs. A novel
method has been recently described by some of the authors to pharmacologically downregulate the
expression of target proteins at the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational
advancements in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block protein expression by
targeting folding intermediates, hence hampering the folding process. Here, we report the all-atom
simulations of the entire sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data revealed
the existence of a folding intermediate showing two druggable pockets hidden in the native conformation.
Both pockets were targeted by a virtual screening repurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying
drugs capable to decrease the expression of ACE2. We identified four compounds (the atypical antipsychotic
Ziprasidone, the antihistamine Buclizine, the antiviral Beclabuvir and the antimalaric Artefenomel)
as capable of lowering ACE2 expression in Vero cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Importantly,
these molecules potently inhibited the entry into cells of a pseudotyped retrovirus exposing the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results indicate that these drugs could act against SARS-CoV-2 by
altering the folding pathway of its receptor ACE2. Ongoing studies are directly evaluating the
possibility of repurposing these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
