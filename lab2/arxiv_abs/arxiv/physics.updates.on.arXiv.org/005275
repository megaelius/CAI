A discontinuous Galerkin computational fluid dynamics code was used to perform highly resolved
simulations of ramjet-mode combustion in the University of Virginia Supersonic Combustion Facility
cavity flameholder at a flight enthalpy of Mach 5. The primary goal of the work is to enhance our understanding
of the effects of turbulence on fully premixed ramjet combustion with a hydrocarbon fuel. Prior
experiments measured a freestream turbulence intensity at the inflow to the cavity ranging from
10 - 15%. A synthetic turbulence inflow generator was implemented for the simulations in this work
to reproduce the turbulence at the inflow to the cavity. This reduced computational expense, as
the turbulent, non-reacting flow upstream of the cavity was generated by a boundary condition rather
than requiring the modeling of the entire upstream domain. Velocity perturbations and turbulence
intensity generated by the turbulent inflow boundary condition are shown to match those values
measured in the facility using particle induced velocimetry. Simulations were performed both
with and without inflow turbulence to study the effect of turbulence on flame stability and structure.
In both cases, a cavity-stabilized flame was achieved. The inflow turbulence promoted more robust
combustion, causing the flame to propagate further from the cavity into the core flow, broadening
the flame angle with respect to the axial flow direction. The flame angle captured in the simulation
agrees with experimental results and theoretical prediction. The effect of spatial resolution
on the simulations is discussed through a comparison of cases using second-order and third-order
accurate discontinuous Galerkin finite elements.
