A very low ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of 0.1-0.5 was previously reported in the Orion Bar photon-dominated
region (PDR), based on observations of two optically thin $\mathrm{H_2^{18}O}$ lines which were
analyzed by using a single-slab large velocity gradient model. The corresponding spin temperature
does not coincide with the kinetic temperature of the molecular gas in this UV-illuminated region.
This was interpreted as an indication of water molecules being formed on cold icy grains which were
subsequently released by UV photodesorption. A more complete set of water observations in the Orion
Bar, including seven $\mathrm{H_2^{16}O}$ lines and one $\mathrm{H_2^{18}O}$ line, carried
out using Herschel/HIFI instrument, was reanalyzed using the Meudon PDR code to derive gas-phase
water abundance and the OPR, taking into account the steep density and temperature gradients present
in the region. The model line intensities are in good agreement with the observations assuming that
water molecules formed with an OPR corresponding to thermal equilibrium conditions at the local
kinetic temperature of the gas and when solely considering gas-phase chemistry and water gas-grain
exchanges through adsorption and desorption. Gas-phase water is predicted to arise from a region
deep into the cloud, corresponding to a visual extinction of $A_{\mathrm{V}} \sim 9$, with a $\mathrm{H_2^{16}O}$
fractional abundance of $\sim 2\times 10^{-7}$ and column density of $(1.4 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{15}$
cm$^{-2}$ for a total cloud depth of $A_{\mathrm{V}}=15$. A line-of-sight average ortho-to-para
ratio of $2.8 \pm 0.1$ is derived. The observational data are consistent with a nuclear spin isomer
repartition corresponding to the thermal equilibrium at a temperature of $35 \pm 2$ K, much higher
than the spin temperature previously reported for this region and close to the gas kinetic temperature
in the water-emitting gas.
