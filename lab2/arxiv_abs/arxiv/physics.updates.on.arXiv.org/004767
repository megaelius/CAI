Uncertainties of snowpack models and of their meteorological forcings limit their use by avalanche
hazard forecasters, or for glaciological and hydrological studies. The spatialized simulations
currently available for avalanche hazard forecasting are only assimilating sparse meteorological
observations. As suggested by recent studies, their forecasting skills could be significantly
improved by assimilating satellite data such as snow reflectances from satellites in the visible
and the near-infrared spectra. Indeed, these data can help constrain the microstructural properties
of surface snow and light absorbing impurities content, which in turn affect the surface energy
and mass budgets. This paper investigates the prerequisites of satellite data assimilation into
a detailed snowpack model. An ensemble version of Meteo-France operational snowpack forecasting
system (named S2M) was built for this study. This operational system runs on topographic classes
instead of grid points, so-called semi-distributed approach. Each class corresponds to one of
the 23 mountain massifs of the French Alps (about 1000km^{2} each), an altitudinal range (by step
of 300m) and aspect (by step of 45{\deg}). We assess the feasability of satellite data assimilation
in such a semi-distributed geometry. Ensemble simulations are compared with satellite observations
from MODIS and Sentinel-2, and with in-situ reflectance observations. The study focuses on the
2013-2014 and 2016-2017 winters in the Grandes-Rousses massif. Substantial Pearson R^{2} correlations
(0.75-0.90) of MODIS observations with simulations are found over the domain. This suggests that
assimilating it could have an impact on the spatialized snowpack forecasting system. However,
observations contain significant biases (0.1-0.2 in reflectance) which prevent their direct
assimilation. MODIS spectral band ratios seem to be much less biased.
