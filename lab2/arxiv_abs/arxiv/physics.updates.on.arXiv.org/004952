Galaxy imaging surveys enable us to map the cosmic matter density field through weak gravitational
lensing analysis. The density reconstruction is compromised by a variety of noise originating
from observational conditions, galaxy number density fluctuations, and intrinsic galaxy properties.
We propose a deep-learning approach based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to reduce
the noise in the weak lensing map under realistic conditions. We perform image-to-image translation
using conditional GANs in order to produce noiseless lensing maps using the first-year data of the
Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. We train the conditional GANs by using 30000 sets of mock
HSC catalogs that directly incorporate observational effects. We show that an ensemble learning
method with GANs can reproduce the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) of the lensing
convergence map within a $0.5-1\sigma$ level. We use the reconstructed PDFs to estimate a cosmological
parameter $S_{8} = \sigma_{8}\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m0}/0.3}$, where $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ and $\sigma_{8}$
represent the mean and the scatter in the cosmic matter density. The reconstructed PDFs place tighter
constraint, with the statistical uncertainty in $S_8$ reduced by a factor of $2$ compared to the
noisy PDF. This is equivalent to increasing the survey area by $4$ without denoising by GANs. Finally,
we apply our denoising method to the first-year HSC data, to place $2\sigma$-level cosmological
constraints of $S_{8} < 0.777 \, ({\rm stat}) + 0.105 \, ({\rm sys})$ and $S_{8} < 0.633 \, ({\rm stat})
+ 0.114 \, ({\rm sys})$ for the noisy and denoised data, respectively.
