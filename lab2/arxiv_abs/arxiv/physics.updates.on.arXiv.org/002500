PyPSA-Eur, the first open model dataset of the European power system at the transmission network
level to cover the full ENTSO-E area, is presented. It contains 6001 lines (alternating current
lines at and above 220 kV voltage level and all high voltage direct current lines), 3657 substations,
a new open database of conventional power plants, time series for electrical demand and variable
renewable generator availability, and geographic potentials for the expansion of wind and solar
power. The model is suitable both for operational studies and generation and transmission expansion
planning studies. The continental scope and highly resolved spatial scale enables a proper description
of the long-range smoothing effects for renewable power generation and their varying resource
availability. The restriction to freely available and open data encourages the open exchange of
model data developments and eases the comparison of model results. A further novelty of the dataset
is the publication of the full, automated software pipeline to assemble the load-flow-ready model
from the original datasets, which enables easy replacement and improvement of the individual parts.
This paper focuses on the description of the network topology, the compilation of a European power
plant database and a top-down load time-series regionalisation. It summarises the derivation
of renewable wind and solar availability time-series from re-analysis weather datasets and the
estimation of renewable capacity potentials restricted by land-use. Finally, validations of
the dataset are presented, including a new methodology to compare geo-referenced network datasets
to one another.
