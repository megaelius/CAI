For an accurate description of electromagneto-thermomechanical systems, electromagnetic fields
need to be described in a Eulerian frame, whereby the thermomechanics is solved in a Lagrangean frame.
It is possible to map the Eulerian frame to the current placement of the matter and the Lagrangean
frame to a reference placement. We present a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent derivation
of governing equations for fully coupled electromagneto-thermomechanical systems properly
handling finite deformations. A clear separation of the different frames is necessary. There are
various attempts to formulate electromagnetism in the Lagrangean frame, or even to compute all
fields in the current placement. Both formulations are challenging and heavily discussed in the
literature. In this work, we propose another solution scheme that exploits the capabilities of
advanced computational tools. Instead of amending the formulation, we can solve thermomechanics
in the Lagrangean frame and electromagnetism in the Eulerian frame and manage the interaction between
the fields. The approach is similar to its analog in fluid structure interaction, but more challenging
because the field equations in electromagnetism must also be solved within the solid body while
following their own different set of transformation rules. We additionally present a mesh-morphing
algorithm necessary to accommodate finite deformations to solve the electromagnetic fields outside
of the material body. We illustrate the use of the new formulation by developing an open-source implementation
using the FEniCS package and applying this implementation to several engineering problems in electromagnetic
structure interaction undergoing large deformations.
