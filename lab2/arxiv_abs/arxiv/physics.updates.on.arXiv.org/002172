Disorder-induced Anderson localization in quasiparticle transport is a challenging problem
to address, even more so in the presence of dissipation as the symptoms of disorder-induced localization
are very closely simulated by the absorption in a system. Following up on recent experimental studies,
we numerically study the occurrence of Anderson localization in plasmonic systems at terahertz
frequencies. The low losses in the material at these frequencies allow us to separately quantify
the localization length and the loss length in the system. We measure a non-monotonic variation
of loss length as a function of disorder, and attribute it to the participation ratio of the localized
modes and resulting light occupancy in the metal. Next, we identify a unique behavior of the gap state
frequencies and the density of states under disorder. We observe that the maximally displaced gap
state frequencies have a propensity to remain pinned to the frequency of the gap center. Even under
strong disorder, the gap does not close, and density of states profile continues to remain peaked
in the gap, unlike in conventionally studied disordered systems. The origins of this behavior are
traced to the nature of the quasiparticle dispersion. In our case, the quasiparticles are identified
to be hybrid plasmons generated due to the hybridization of surface plasmon polaritons at a metal-dielectric
interface and cavity resonances at sub-wavelength apertures thereon. This situation is akin to
the Kondo systems, where dispersive conduction electrons hybridise with a localized impurity
state opening a hybridization gap. Our results provide new insights on the elusive problem of the
interplay of loss and localization, and underlines interesting physics at the hybridisation gap
in hybrid plasmonic systems.
