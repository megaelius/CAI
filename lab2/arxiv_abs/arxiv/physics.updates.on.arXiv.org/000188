The unifying theory of scaling in thermal convection (Grossmann & Lohse (2000)) (henceforth
the GL theory) suggests that there are no pure power laws for the Nusselt and Reynolds numbers as function
of the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers in the experimentally accessible parameter regime. In Grossmann
& Lohse (2001) the dimensionless parameters of the theory were fitted to 155 experimental data
points by Ahlers & Xu (2001) in the regime $3\times 10^7 \le Ra \le 3 \times 10^{9}$ and $4\le Pr
\le 34$ and Grossmann & Lohse (2002) used the experimental data point from Qiu & Tong (2001)
and the fact that Nu(Ra,Pr) is independent of the parameter a, which relates the dimensionless kinetic
boundary thickness with the square root of the wind Reynolds number, to fix the Reynolds number dependence.
Meanwhile the theory is on one hand well confirmed through various new experiments and numerical
simulations. On the other hand these new data points provide the basis for an updated fit in a much
larger parameter space. Here we pick four well established (and sufficiently distant) Nu(Ra,Pr)
data points and show that the resulting Nu(Ra,Pr) function is in agreement with almost all established
experimental and numerical data up to the ultimate regime of thermal convection, whose onset also
follows from the theory. One extra Re(Ra,Pr) data point is used to fix Re(Ra,Pr). As Re can depend
on the definition and the aspect ratio the transformation properties of the GL equations are discussed
in order to show how the GL coefficients can easily be adapted to new Reynolds number data while keeping
Nu(Ra,Pr) unchanged.
