One essential component of operational space weather forecasting is the prediction of solar flares.
With a multitude of flare forecasting methods now available online it is still unclear which of these
methods performs best, and none are substantially better than climatological forecasts. Space
weather researchers are increasingly looking towards methods used by the terrestrial weather
community to improve current forecasting techniques. Ensemble forecasting has been used in numerical
weather prediction for many years as a way to combine different predictions in order to obtain a more
accurate result. Here we construct ensemble forecasts for major solar flares by linearly combining
the full-disk probabilistic forecasts from a group of operational forecasting methods (ASAP,
ASSA, MAG4, MOSWOC, NOAA, and MCSTAT). Forecasts from each method are weighted by a factor that accounts
for the method's ability to predict previous events, and several performance metrics (both probabilistic
and categorical) are considered. It is found that most ensembles achieve a better skill metric (between
5\% and 15\%) than any of the members alone. Moreover, over 90\% of ensembles perform better (as measured
by forecast attributes) than a simple equal-weights average. Finally, ensemble uncertainties
are highly dependent on the internal metric being optimized and they are estimated to be less than
20\% for probabilities greater than 0.2. This simple multi-model, linear ensemble technique can
provide operational space weather centres with the basis for constructing a versatile ensemble
forecasting system -- an improved starting point to their forecasts that can be tailored to different
end-user needs.
