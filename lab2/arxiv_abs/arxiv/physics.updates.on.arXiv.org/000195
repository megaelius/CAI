A new method for the localization of the regions where small scale turbulent fluctuations are present
in hypersonic flows is applied to the large-eddy simulation (LES) of a compressible turbulent jet
with an initial Mach number equal to 5. The localization method used is called selective LES and is
based on the exploitation of a scalar probe function $f$ which represents the magnitude of the stretching-tilting
term of the vorticity equation normalized with the enstrophy (Tordella et al. 2007). For a fully
developed turbulent field of fluctuations, statistical analysis shows that the probability that
$f$ is larger than 2 is almost zero, and, for any given threshold, it is larger if the flow is under-resolved.
By computing the spatial field of $f$ in each instantaneous realization of the simulation it is possible
to locate the regions where the magnitude of the normalized vortical stretching-tilting is anomalously
high. The sub-grid model is then introduced into the governing equations in such regions only. The
results of the selective LES simulation are compared with those of a standard LES, where the sub-grid
terms are used in the whole domain, and with those of a standard Euler simulation with the same resolution.
The comparison is carried out by assuming as reference field a higher resolution Euler simulation
of the same jet. It is shown that the selective LES modifies the dynamic properties of the flow to a
lesser extent with respect to the classical LES. In particular, the prediction of the enstrophy,
mean velocity and density distributions and of the energy and density spectra are substantially
improved.
