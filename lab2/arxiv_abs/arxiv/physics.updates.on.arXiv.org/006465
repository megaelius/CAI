Muon radiography, also known as muography, is a non-destructive geophysical technique for the
study of the internal structure of large objects such as volcanoes. This is possible by constructing
an image based on the differential absorption of the directional flux of high-energy atmospheric
muons produced during the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. So this no other source
of radiation is required for this technique. Many muon telescopes are being built with crossed scintillator
bars and so, the resolution of each panel is essentially given by the total surface of the bar crossings.
Enhancing the resolution may require covering the same area with smaller scintillator bars, which
adds costs and build complexity as more scintillators and fibers are required. More channels also
require more acquisition electronics which have to be synchronized, increasing the complexity
of the system, with associated operating issues, and the final cost. In this work, we propose a novel
analysis approach to obtain reliable sub-pixel resolution, by measuring and comparing the average
signals measured at each end of the scintillation bar. This analysis approach achieves sub-pixel
resolutions, augmenting the spatial resolutions of existing designs. To study the feasibility
of this technique we designed a laboratory setup, to emulate muon light pulses with a pulsed laser
light located at different points on optical wavelength shifter fiber. By doing this we measured
an increase on the spatial resolution when compared with traditional systems. These results enable
the design of a new prototype for muography of natural and artificial structures of strategic interest.
