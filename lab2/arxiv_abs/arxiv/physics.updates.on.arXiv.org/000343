The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a concept for a future $e^{+}e^{-}$ linear collider with a
center-of-mass energy of up to 3 TeV. The design of a CLIC experiment is driven by the requirements
related to the physics goals, as well as by the experimental conditions. For example, the short time
between two bunch crossings of 0.5 ns and the backgrounds due to beamstrahlung have direct impact
on the design of a CLIC experiment. The Silicon Detector (SiD) is one of the concepts currently being
discussed as a possible detector for the International Linear Collider (ILC). In this thesis we
develop a modified version of the SiD simulation model for CLIC, taking into account the specific
experimental conditions. In addition, we developed a software tool to investigate the impact of
beam-related backgrounds on the detector by overlaying events from different simulated event
samples. Moreover, we present full simulation studies, determining the performance of the calorimeter
and tracking systems. We show that the track reconstruction in the all-silicon tracker of SiD is
robust in the presence of the backgrounds at CLIC. Furthermore, we investigate tungsten as a dense
absorber material for the hadronic calorimeter, which allows for the construction of a compact
hadronic calorimeter that fulfills the requirements on the energy resolution and shower containment
without a significant increase of the coil radius. Finally, the measurement of the decays of light
Higgs bosons into two muons is studied in full simulation. We find that with an integrated luminosity
of 2 ab$^{-1}$, corresponding to 4 years of data taking at CLIC, the respective Higgs branching ratio
can be determined with a statistical uncertainty of approximately 15%.
