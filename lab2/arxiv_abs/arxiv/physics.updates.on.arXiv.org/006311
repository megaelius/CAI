Most models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly
assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread
in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the
individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others.
Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important
quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the
joint distribution of in- and out-degrees ("risk" and "spread"), including their heterogeneity
and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate
why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis
of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and
some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among
types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate
significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy
implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions
designed to prevent super spreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and
backward version of the classic "friendship paradox" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals
with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination
of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent
future cascades of infection.
