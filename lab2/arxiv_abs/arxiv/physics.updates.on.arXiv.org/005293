The hierarchy of classical Chinese poetry has been broadly acknowledged by a number of studies in
Chinese literature. However, quantitative investigations about the evolutionary linkages of
classical Chinese poetry are limited. The primary goal of this study is to provide quantitative
evidence of the evolutionary linkages, with emphasis on character usage, among different period
genres of classical Chinese poetry. Specifically, various statistical analyses are performed
to find and compare the patterns of character usage in the poems of nine period genres, including
shi jing, chu ci, Han shi , Jin shi, Tang shi, Song shi, Yuan shi, Ming shi, and Qing shi. The result of
analysis indicates that each of nine period genres has unique patterns of character usage, with
some Chinese characters that are preferably used in the poems of a particular period genre. The analysis
on the general pattern of character preference implies a decreasing trend in the use of Chinese characters
that rarely occur in modern Chinese literature along the timeline of dynastic types of classical
Chinese poetry. The phylogenetic analysis based on the distance matrix suggests that the evolutionary
linkages of different types of classical Chinese poetry are congruent with their chronological
order, suggesting that character frequencies contain phylogenetic information that is useful
for inferring evolutionary linkages among various types of classical Chinese poetry. The estimated
phylogenetic tree identifies four groups (shi jing, chu ci), (Han shi, Jin shi), (Tang shi, Song
shi, Yuan shi), and (Ming shi, Qing shi). The statistical analyses conducted in this study can be
generalized to analyze the data sets of general Chinese literature. Such analyses can provide quantitative
insights about the evolutionary linkages of general Chinese literature.
