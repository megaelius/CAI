We propose to homogenize a periodic (along one direction) structure, first in order to verify the
quasi-static prediction of its response to an acoustic wave arising from mixing theory, then to
address the question of what becomes of this prediction at higher frequencies. This homogenization
is treated as an inverse (parameter retrieval) problem, i.e., by which we: (1) generate far-field
(i.e., specular reflection and transmission coefficients) response data for the given periodic
structure, (2) replace (initially by thought) this (inhomgoeneous) structure by a homogeneous
(surrogate) layer, (3) compute the response of the surrogate layer response for various trial constitutive
properties, (4) search for the global minimum of the discrepancy between the response data of the
given structure and the various trial parameter responses (5) attribute the homogenized properties
of the surrogate layer for which the minimum of the discrepancy is attained. The result is that: (i)
at low frequencies and/or large filling factors, the effective constitutive properties are close
to their static equivalents, i.e., the effective mass density is the product of a factor related
to the given structure filling factor with the mass density of a generic substructure of the given
structure and the effective velocity is equal to the velocity in the said generic substructure,
2) at higher frequencies and/or smaller city filling factors, the effective constitutive properties
are dispersive and do not take on a simple mathematical form, with this dispersion compensating
for the discordance between the ways the inhomogeneous given structure and the homogeneous surrogate
layer respond to the acoustic wave.
