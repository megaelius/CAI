When shallow water flows over uneven bathymetry, the water surface is modulated. This type of problem
has been revisited numerous times since it was first studied by Lord Kelvin in 1886. Our study analytically
examines currents whose unperturbed velocity profile $U(z)$ follows a power-law $z^q$, flowing
over a three-dimensional uneven bed. This particular form of $U$, which can model a miscellany of
realistic flows, allows explicit analytical solutions. Arbitrary bed shapes can readily be imposed
via Fourier's theorem provided their steepness is moderate. Three-dimensional vorticity-bathymetry
interaction effects are evident when the flow makes an oblique angle with, a sinusoidally corrugated
bed. Streamlines are found to twist and the fluid particle drift is redirected away from the direction
of the unperturbed current. Furthermore, a perturbation technique is developed which satisfies
the bottom boundary condition to arbitrary order also for large-amplitude obstructions which
penetrate well into the current profile. This introduces higher-order harmonics of the bathymetry
amplitude. States of resonance for first and higher order harmonics are readily calculated. Although
the method is theoretically restricted to bathymetries of moderate inclination, a wide variety
of steeper obstructions are satisfactorily represented by the method, even provoking occurrences
of recirculation. All expressions are analytically explicit and sequential fast Fourier transformations
ensure quick and easy computation for arbitrary three-dimensional bathymetries. A method for
separating near and far fields ensures computational convergence under the appropriate radiation
condition.
