Objective: Surface electromyogram (EMG) signals have typically been assumed to follow a Gaussian
distribution. However, the presence of non-Gaussian signals associated with muscle activity
has been reported in recent studies, and there is no general model of the distribution of EMG signals
that can explain both non-Gaussian and Gaussian distributions within a unified scheme. Methods:
In this paper, we describe the formulation of a non-Gaussian EMG model based on a scale mixture distribution.
In the model, an EMG signal at a certain time follows a Gaussian distribution, and its variance is
handled as a random variable that follows an inverse gamma distribution. Accordingly, the probability
distribution of EMG signals is assumed to be a mixture of Gaussians with the same mean but different
variances. The EMG variance distribution is estimated via marginal likelihood maximization.
Results: Experiments involving nine participants revealed that the proposed model provides a
better fit to recorded EMG signals than conventional EMG models. It was also shown that variance
distribution parameters may reflect underlying motor unit activity. Conclusion: This study proposed
a scale mixture distribution-based stochastic EMG model capable of representing changes in non-Gaussianity
associated with muscle activity. A series of experiments demonstrated the validity of the model
and highlighted the relationship between the variance distribution and muscle force. Significance:
The proposed model helps to clarify conventional wisdom regarding the probability distribution
of surface EMG signals within a unified scheme.
