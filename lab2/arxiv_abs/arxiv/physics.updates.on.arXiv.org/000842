Surfactant solutions exhibit multilamellar surfactant vesicles (MLVs) under flow conditions
and in concentration ranges which are found in a large number of industrial applications. MLVs are
typically formed from a lamellar phase and play an important role in determining the rheological
properties of surfactant solutions. Despite the wide literature on the collective dynamics of
flowing MLVs, investigations on the flow behavior of single MLVs are scarce. In this work, we investigate
a concentrated aqueous solution of linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acid (HLAS), characterized by
MLVs dispersed in an isotropic micellar phase. Rheological tests show that the HLAS solution is
a shear-thinning fluid with a power law index dependent on the shear rate. Pressure-driven shear
flow of the HLAS solution in glass capillaries is investigated by high-speed video microscopy and
image analysis. The so obtained velocity profiles provide evidence of a power-law fluid behaviour
of the HLAS solution and images show a flow-focusing effect of the lamellar phase in the central core
of the capillary. The flow behavior of individual MLVs shows analogies with that of unilamellar
vesicles and emulsion droplets. Deformed MLVs exhibit typical shapes of unilamellar vesicles,
such as parachute and bullet-like. Furthermore, MLV velocity follows the classical Hetsroni theory
for droplets provided that the power law shear dependent viscosity of the HLAS solution is taken
into account. The results of this work are relevant for the processing of surfactant-based systems
in which the final properties depend on flow-induced morphology, such as cosmetic formulations
and food products.
