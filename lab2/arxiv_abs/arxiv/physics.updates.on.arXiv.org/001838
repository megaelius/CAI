The diffraction contrast modalities accessible by X-ray grating interferometers are not imaged
directly but have to be inferred from sine like signal variations occurring in a series of images
acquired at varying relative positions of the interferometer's gratings. The absolute spatial
translations involved in the acquisition of these phase stepping series usually lie in the range
of only a few hundred nanometers, wherefore positioning errors as small as 10nm will already translate
into signal uncertainties of one to ten percent in the final images if not accounted for. Classically,
the relative grating positions in the phase stepping series are considered input parameters to
the analysis and are, for the Fast Fourier Transform that is typically employed, required to be equidistantly
distributed over multiples of the gratings' period. More general optimization based approaches
with relaxed requirements on the sampling positions are often deemed too time consuming in contrast.
In the following, a fast converging optimization scheme is presented simultaneously determining
the phase stepping curves' parameters as well as the actually performed motions of the stepped grating,
including also erroneous rotational motions which are commonly neglected. While the correction
of solely the translational errors along the stepping direction is found to be sufficient with regard
to the reduction of image artifacts, the possibility to also detect minute rotations about all axes
proves to be a valuable tool for system calibration and monitoring. The simplicity of the provided
algorithm, in particular when only considering translational errors, makes it well suitable as
a standard evaluation procedure also for large image series.
