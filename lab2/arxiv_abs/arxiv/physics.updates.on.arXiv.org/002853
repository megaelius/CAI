Phosphorylation is one of the most important protein modifications, and electron-transfer dissociation
tandem mass spectrometry (ETD-MS/MS) is a potentially useful method for the sequencing of phosphopeptides,
including determination of the phosphorylation site. Notably, ETD-MS/MS typically provides
useful information when the precursor contains more than three positive charges. It is not yet used
as an analysis method for large-scale phosphopeptide production due to difficulties occurring
in the production of acidic phosphopeptides having more than three positive charges. To increase
the charge state of phosphopeptides, we used dinuclear metal complexes, which selectively bind
to the phosphate group in phosphopeptides with the addition of positive charge(s). Dinuclear copper,
zinc, and gallium complexes were tested and it was found that the type of metal present in the complex
strongly affected the affinity of the phosphorylated compounds and their ETD fragmentation. The
dinuclear copper complex interacted weakly with the phosphate groups and ETD-induced peptide
fragmentation was largely suppressed by the presence of Cu2+, which worked as an electron trap.
The dinuclear gallium complex was strongly bound to a phosphate group. However, the ligand binding
to gallium acted as an electron trap and the presence of dinuclear gallium complex in the precursor
for ETD-MS/MS hampered the sequencing of the phosphopeptides, as in the case of dinuclear copper
complexes. In contrast, dinuclear zinc complexes efficiently bind to phosphopeptides with an
increase in the charge state, facilitating phosphopeptide sequencing by ETD-MS/MS. The fragmentation
of the ligand and peptide backbone in the dinuclear zinc--phosphopeptide complex were competitively
induced by ETD. These processes are influenced by the ligand structure and so the detailed ETD fragmentation
pathways were investigated using density functional theory calculations.
