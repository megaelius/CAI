Visual inspections for identifying focusing points in inertial microfluidic flows are prone to
misinterpreting stable locations and focusing shifts in the case of non-trivial focusing patterns.
We develop and deploy an approach for automating the calculation of focusing patterns for a general
channel geometry, and thereby reduce the dependence on empirical/visual procedures to confirm
the presence of stable locations. We utilize concepts from interpolation theory (to represent
continuous force-fields using discrete points), and stability theory to identify "basins of attraction"
and quantitatively identify stable equilibrium points. Our computational experiments reveal
that predicting equilibrium points accurately requires upto $\times$10-20 times more refined
force-maps that conventionally used, which highlights the spatial resolution required for an
accurate representation of cross-sectional forces. These focusing patterns are validated using
experimental results for a rectangular channel, and triangular channel with an apex angle of $90^\circ$.
We then apply the approach to predict and explain focusing patterns and shifts for a $90^\circ$-isosceles
triangular channel across a range of Reynolds numbers for $\frac{a}{H} = 0.4$ (particle-to-channel
size ratio). We observe that the predicted focusing patterns match experiments well. The force-maps
also reveal certain "clouds" of localized stable points, which aid in explaining the onset of bifurcation
observed in experiments. The current algorithm is agnostic to channel cross-sections and straight/curved
channels, which could pave way to generating a library of focusing patterns as a function of channel
geometry, and $Re$, to assist in design of novel devices for tailored particle-streams.
