Purpose: To study placental function - both perfusion and an oxygenation surrogate (T2*)-simultaneously
and quantitatively in-vivo. Methods: 15 pregnant women were scanned on a 3T MR scanner. For perfusion
measurements, a velocity selective arterial spin labelling preparation module was placed before
a multi-echo gradient echo EPI readout to integrate T2* and perfusion measurements in one joint
perfusion-oxygenation (PERFOX) acquisition. Joint motion correction and quantification were
performed to evaluate changes in T2* and perfusion over GA. Results: The optimised integrated PERFOX
protocol and post-processing allowed successful visualization and quantification of perfusion
and T2* in all subjects. Areas of high T2* and high perfusion appear to correspond to placental sub-units
and show a systematic offset in location along the maternal-fetal axis. The areas of highest perfusion
are consistently closer to the maternal basal plate and the areas of highest T2* closer to the fetal
chorionic plate. Quantitative results show a strong negative correlation of gestational age with
T2* and weak negative correlation with perfusion. Conclusion: A strength of the joint sequence
is that it provides truly simultaneous and co-registered estimates of local T2* and perfusion,
however, to achieve this, the time per slice is prolonged compared to a perfusion only scan which
can potentially limit coverage. The achieved interlocking can be particularly useful when quantifying
transient physiological effects such as uterine contractions. PERFOX opens a new avenue to elucidate
the relationship between maternal supply and oxygen uptake, both of which are central to placental
function and dysfunction.
