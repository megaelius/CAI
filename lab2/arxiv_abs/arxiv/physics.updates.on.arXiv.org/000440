The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early Universe, the dynamics of the supernova
bursts that produced the heavy elements necessary for life and whether protons eventually decay
--- these mysteries at the forefront of particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding
the early evolution of our Universe, its current state and its eventual fate. The Long-Baseline
Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developed plan for a world-class experiment
dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNE is conceived around three central components: (1)
a new, high-intensity neutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstream of the source, and
(3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployed as a far detector deep underground
at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake
Mine in Lead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source at Fermilab -- a distance
(baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrino charge-parity symmetry violation and
mass ordering effects. This ambitious yet cost-effective design incorporates scalability and
flexibility and can accommodate a variety of upgrades and contributions. With its exceptional
combination of experimental configuration, technical capabilities, and potential for transformative
discoveries, LBNE promises to be a vital facility for the field of particle physics worldwide, providing
physicists from around the globe with opportunities to collaborate in a twenty to thirty year program
of exciting science. In this document we provide a comprehensive overview of LBNE's scientific
objectives, its place in the landscape of neutrino physics worldwide, the technologies it will
incorporate and the capabilities it will possess.
