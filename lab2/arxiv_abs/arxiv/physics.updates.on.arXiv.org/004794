Tsunamis are amongst the most devastating and destructive consequences of earthquakes \cite{bryant2008tsunami,synolakis2005}.
They have been known to predominantly occur due to subduction zone earthquakes such as the 2011 $M_{w}$
$9.0$ Tohoku-Oki earthquake in Japan. However, the 2018 $M_{w}$ 7.5 Palu, Sulawesi strike-slip
earthquake generated an unexpected tsunami with disastrous and deadly effects \cite{mai2019,fritz2018}.
Since such strike-slip earthquakes are not expected to generate large tsunamis, the latter's origin
remains much debated. A key notable feature of this earthquake is that it ruptured at supershear
speed \cite{bao2019,socquet2019}, i.e., with a rupture speed greater than the shear wave speed
of the host medium. Such supershear ruptures produce two shock fronts (or Mach fronts) corresponding
to an exceedance of shear and Rayleigh wave speeds \cite{dunham2008a}. These Mach fronts carry
significant, and minimally attenuated, particle velocities to large distances. In this study
we confirm that the Palu earthquake attained supershear speed by providing the first evidence of
a supershear rupture recorded by a high-rate GPS station. We then couple the ground motion produced
by such an earthquake to a 1D non-linear shallow water wave equation that accounts for both the time-dependent
bathymetric displacement as well as its velocity. Using the local bathymetric profile of Palu bay
around the Pantoloan harbor tidal gauge, we have been able to clearly reproduce the observed tsunami
with minimal tuning of parameters. We conclude that the Mach fronts, generated by a supershear earthquake,
interacted with the Palu bay geometry to cause the tsunami. Our results suggest that the speed of
the rupture should also be included in rapid assessment of tsunami hazard.
