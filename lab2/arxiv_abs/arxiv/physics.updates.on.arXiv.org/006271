PyRoss is an open-source Python library that offers an integrated platform for inference, prediction
and optimisation of NPIs in age- and contact-structured epidemiological compartment models.
This report outlines the rationale and functionality of the PyRoss library, with various illustrations
and examples focusing on well-mixed, age-structured populations. The PyRoss library supports
arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as master equations) or deterministically
(as ODEs) and allows mid-run transitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental
subdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and allows medical stages
such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and forecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting
to epidemiological data, as available, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing
models can be weighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact of
idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological data, model choice,
parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to optimize time-dependent NPI scenarios
against user-defined cost functions are included. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment
framework for well-mixed populations will in future reports be extended to include compartments
structured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes relevant to assessing
disease spread and the impact of NPIs. We argue that such compartment models, by allowing social
data of arbitrary granularity to be combined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known
disease variables, could enable more powerful and robust prediction than other approaches to detailed
epidemic modelling. We invite others to use the PyRoss library for research to address today's COVID-19
crisis, and to plan for future pandemics.
