Detecting communities or the modular structure of real-life networks (e.g. a social network or
a product purchase network) is an important task because the way a network functions is often determined
by its communities. Traditional approaches to community detection involve modularity-based
algorithms, which generally speaking, construct partitions based on heuristics that seek to maximize
the ratio of the edges within the partitions to those between them. On the other hand, node embedding
approaches represent each node in a graph as a real-valued vector and is thereby able to transform
the problem of community detection in a graph to that of clustering a set of vectors. Existing node
embedding approaches are primarily based on, first, initiating random walks from each node to construct
a context of a node, and then make the vector representation of a node close to its context. However,
standard node embedding approaches do not directly take into account the community structure of
a network while constructing the context around each node. To alleviate this, we explore two different
threads of work. First, we investigate the use of maximum entropy-based random walks to obtain more
centrality preserving embedding of nodes, which may lead to more effective clusters in the embedded
space. Second, we propose a community structure-aware node embedding approach, where we incorporate
modularity-based partitioning heuristics into the objective function of node embedding. We demonstrate
that our proposed combination of the combinatorial and the embedding approaches for community
detection outperforms a number of modularity-based baselines and K-means clustering on a standard
node-embedded (node2vec) vector space on a wide range of real-life and synthetic networks of different
sizes and densities.
