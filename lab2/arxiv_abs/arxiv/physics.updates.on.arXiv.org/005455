Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) is responsible for the provision of aerial radiometric surveys
in the event of a radiological or nuclear emergency in Canada. Manned aerial surveys are an essential
element of the planned consequence management operation, as demonstrated by the recovery work
following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, and their effects in Fukushima, Japan. Flying
lower and slower than manned aircraft, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can provide improved spatial
resolution. In particular, hot spot activity can be underestimated in manned survey results as
the higher flight altitude and wider line spacing effectively average the hot spot over a larger
area. Moreover, a UAV can enter an area which is hazardous for humans. NRCan has been investigating
the inclusion of UAV-borne radiation survey spectrometers into its aerial survey response procedures.
The Advanced Radiation Detector for UAV Operations (ARDUO) was developed to exploit the flight
and lift capabilities available in the under 25kg class of UAVs. The detector features eight 2.8cm
x 2.8cm x 5.6cm CsI(Tl) crystals in a self-shielding configuration, read out with silicon photomultipliers
and digitized using miniaturized custom electronics. The ARDUO is flown on a main- and tail-rotor
UAV called Responder which has a 6kg lift capacity and up to 40min. endurance. The performance of
the ARDUO-Responder UAV system was characterized in both lab and outdoor trials. Outdoor trials
consisted of aerial surveys over sealed point sources and over a distributed source. Results show
how the directional response of the ARDUO can provide an indication in real time of source location
for in-flight guidance. As well, the results show how use of the directional information in post-acquisition
processing can result in improved spatial resolution of radiation features for both point and distributed
sources.
