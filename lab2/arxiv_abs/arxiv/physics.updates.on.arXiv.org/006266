To be able to resolve molecular-clusters it is crucial to access vital informations (such as, molecule
density and cluster-size) that are key to understand disease progression and the underlying mechanism.
Traditional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques use molecules of variable
sizes (as determined by its localization precisions (LPs)) to reconstruct super-resolution map.
This results in an image with overlapping and superimposing PSFs (due to a wide size-spectrum of
single molecules) that degrade image resolution. Ideally it should be possible to identify the
brightest molecules (also termed as, fortunate molecules) to reconstruct ultra-superresolution
map, provided sufficient statistics is available from the recorded data. POSSIBLE microscopy
explores this possibility by introducing narrow probability size-distribution of single molecules
(narrow size-spectrum about a predefined mean-size). The reconstruction begins by presetting
the mean and variance of the narrow distribution function (Gaussian function). Subsequently,
the dataset is processed and single molecule filtering is carried out by the Gaussian distribution
function to filter out unfortunate molecules. The fortunate molecules thus retained are then mapped
to reconstruct ultra-superresolution map. In-principle, the POSSIBLE microscopy technique
is capable of infinite resolution (resolution of the order of actual single molecule size) provided
enough fortunate molecules are experimentally detected. In short, bright molecules (with large
emissivity) holds the key. Here, we demonstrate the POSSIBLE microscopy technique and reconstruct
single molecule images with an average PSF sizes of 15 nm, 30 nm and 50 nm. Results show better-resolved
Dendra2-HA clusters with large cluster-density in transfected NIH3T3 fibroblast cells as compared
to the traditional SMLM techniques.
