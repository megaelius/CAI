We study the problem of spectrum estimation from transmission data of a known phantom. The goal is
to reconstruct an x-ray spectrum that can accurately model the x-ray transmission curves and reflects
a realistic shape of the typical energy spectra of the CT system. To this end, spectrum estimation
is posed as an optimization problem with x-ray spectrum as unknown variables, and a Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence constraint is employed to incorporate prior knowledge of the spectrum and enhance
numerical stability of the estimation process. The formulated constrained optimization problem
is convex and can be solved efficiently by use of the exponentiated-gradient (EG) algorithm. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the simulated and experimental data.
The comparison to the expectation-maximization (EM) method is also discussed. In simulations,
the proposed algorithm is seen to yield x-ray spectra that closely match the ground truth and represent
the attenuation process of x-ray photons in materials, both included and not included in the estimation
process. In experiments, the calculated transmission curve is in good agreement with the measured
transmission curve, and the estimated spectra exhibits physically realistic looking shapes.
The results further show the comparable performance between the proposed optimization-based
approach and EM. In conclusion, our formulation of a constrained optimization provides an interpretable
and flexible framework for spectrum estimation. Moreover, a KL-divergence constraint can include
a prior spectrum and appears to capture important features of x-ray spectrum, allowing accurate
and robust estimation of x-ray spectrum in CT imaging.
