In view of the tracking detector application to the ATLAS High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade,
we have developed a new generation of High Voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic pixel-sensor prototypes
featuring the AMS aH18 (180 nm) commercial CMOS technology. By fully integrating both analog and
digital readout-circuitry on the same particle-detecting substrate, current challenges of hybrid
sensor technologies, i.e., larger readout input-capacitance, lower production-yield, and higher
production and integration cost, can be downscaled. The large electrode design using high-resistivity
substrates actively helps to mitigate the charge-trapping effects, making these chips radiation
hard. The surface and bulk damage induced in high irradiation environment change the effective
doping concentration of the device, which modulates high electric fields as the reverse-bias voltage
increases. This effect can cause high leakage current and premature electrical breakdown, driven
by impact ionization. To assess the characteristics of heavily irradiated samples, we have carried
out dedicated campaigns on ATLASPix1 chips that included irradiations of neutrons and protons,
made at different facilities. Here, we report on the electrical characterization of the irradiated
samples at different ambient conditions, also in comparison to their pre-irradiation properties.
Results demonstrate that hadron irradiated devices can be safely operated at a voltage high enough
to allow for high efficiency, up to the fluence of 2E15 neq/cm2, beyond the radiation levels (TID
and NIEL) expected in the outermost pixel layers of the new ATLAS tracker for HL-LHC.
