The physics aims at the proposed future CLIC high-energy linear $e^+ e^-$ collider pose challenging
demands on the performance of the detector system. In particular the vertex and tracking detectors
have to combine precision measurements with robustness against the expected high rates of beam-induced
backgrounds. A spatial resolution of a few microns and a material budget down to 0.2\% of a radiation
length per vertex-detector layer have to be achieved together with a few nanoseconds time stamping
accuracy. These requirements are addressed with innovative technologies in an ambitious detector
R\&D programme, comprising hardware developments as well as detailed device and Monte Carlo simulations
based on TCAD, Geant4 and Allpix-Squared. Various fine pitch hybrid silicon pixel detector technologies
are under investigation for the CLIC vertex detector. The CLICpix and CLICpix2 readout ASICs with
\SI{25}{\micro\meter} pixel pitch have been produced in a \SI{65}{\nano\meter} commercial CMOS
process and bump-bonded to planar active edge sensors as well as capacitively coupled to High-Voltage
(HV) CMOS sensors. Monolithic silicon tracking detectors are foreseen for the large surface ($\approx$
\SI{140}{\meter\squared}) CLIC tracker. Fully monolithic prototypes are currently under development
in High-Resistivity (HR) CMOS, HV-CMOS and Silicon on Insulator (SOI) technologies. The laboratory
and beam tests of all recent prototypes profit from the development of the CaRIBou universal readout
system. This talk presents an overview of the CLIC pixel-detector R\&D programme, focusing on recent
test-beam and simulation results.
