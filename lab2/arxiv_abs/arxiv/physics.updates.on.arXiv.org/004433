Neutrinoless double beta decay ($\beta\beta0\nu$) is a putative nuclear decay that can occur if,
and only if, neutrinos are their own antiparticles. Due to the smallness of neutrino masses, the
lifetime of $\beta\beta0\nu$ is expected to be larger than $10^{26}$ yr, and the tiny expected signals
are deeply buried in backgrounds associated with the natural radioactive chains, whose characteristic
lifetime is sixteen orders of magnitude faster. Future experiments aiming to explore lifetimes
several orders of magnitude larger will require the development of new experimental techniques
to suppress those backgrounds. Since no known background processes converts xenon to barium, detection
of the daughter ion in candidate decay events effectively eliminates backgrounds. It has been recently
proposed that a xenon gas time projection chamber could unambiguously tag the $\beta\beta0\nu$
decay $Xe^{136} \rightarrow Ba^{2+} + 2e^- (+2 \nu)$ by detecting the resulting $Ba^{2+}$ ion in
a single-atom sensor made of a monolayer of molecular indicators. The $Ba^{2+}$ would be captured
by one of the molecules in the sensor, and the presence of the single chelated indicator would be subsequently
revealed by a strong fluorescent response from repeated interrogation with a suitable laser system.
Here we describe a fluorescent bicolor indicator that binds strongly to $Ba^{2+}$ and shines very
brightly, shifting its emission colour from green to blue when chelated in dry medium, thus providing
a discrimination factor with respect to the unchelated species in excess of $10^4$, three orders
of magnitude larger than that found with existing indicators. This allow us to demonstrate the feasibility
of a new sensor for $Ba^{2+}$ tagging based on a monolayer of this bicolor indicator and two-photon
absorption microscopy. Such a sensor could be the basis of a background-free $\beta\beta0\nu$
experiment.
