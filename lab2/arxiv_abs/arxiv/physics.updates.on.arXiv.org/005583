Based on the SEIR model and the modeling of urban transportation networks, a general-purpose simulator
for the spread of epidemics in Chinese cities is built. The Chinese public transportation system
between over 340 prefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with
layers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail routes and buses),
and nodes divided into two categories (central cities, peripheral cities). At each city, an open-system
SEIR model tracks the local spread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with
the overlying transportation network. The model accounts for (1) different transmissivities
of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the transit of inbound flow at cities, (3)
cross-infection on public transportation vehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations
that (4) the infected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the recovered population
are not subject to repeated infections. The model could be used to simulate the city-level spread
in China (and potentially other countries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic
reproduction number, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from
any Chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective government interventions
are implemented. Flowmaps are input into the system to trigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different
flow strength, determined from empirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions
of nodes. The model is used to simulate the 2019 Coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan; it shows that the framework
is robust and reliable, and simulated results match public city-level datasets to an extraordinary
extent.
