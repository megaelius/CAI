We study coupled unstaggered-staggered soliton pairs emergent from a system of two coupled discrete
nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (DNLS) equations with the self-attractive on-site self-phase-modulation
nonlinearity, coupled by the repulsive cross-phase-modulation interaction, on 1D and 2D lattice
domains. These mixed modes are of a "symbiotic" type, as each component in isolation may only carry
ordinary unstaggered solitons. While most work on DNLS systems addressed symmetric on-site-centered
fundamental solitons, these models give rise to a variety of other excited states, which may also
be stable. The simplest among them are antisymmetric states in the form of discrete twisted solitons,
which have no counterparts in the continuum limit. In the extension to 2D lattice domains, a natural
counterpart of the twisted states are vortical solitons. We first introduce a variational approximation
(VA) for the solitons, and then correct it numerically to construct exact stationary solutions,
which are then used as initial conditions for simulations to check if the stationary states persist
under time evolution. Two-component solutions obtained include (i) 1D fundamental-twisted and
twisted-twisted soliton pairs, (ii) 2D fundamental-fundamental soliton pairs, and (iii) 2D vortical-vortical
soliton pairs. We also highlight a variety of other transient dynamical regimes, such as breathers
and amplitude death. The findings apply to modeling binary Bose-Einstein condensates, loaded
in a deep lattice potential, with identical or different atomic masses of the two components, and
arrays of bimodal optical waveguides.
