The electronic band structure of Ga(PAsN) with a few percent of nitrogen is calculated in the whole
composition of Ga(PAs) host using the state-of-the-art density functional methods including
the modified Becke-Johnson functional to correctly reproduce the band gap, and band unfolding
to reveal the character of the bands within the entire Brillouin zone. As expected, relatively small
amounts of nitrogen introduced to Ga(PAs) lead to formation of an intermediate band below the conduction
band which is consistent with the band anticrossing model, widely used to describe the electronic
band structure of dilute nitrides. However, in this study calculations are performed in the whole
Brillouin zone and reveal the significance of correct description of the band structure near the
edges of Brillouin zone, especially for indirect band gap P-rich host alloy, which may not be properly
captured with simpler models. The theoretical results are compared with experimental studies,
confirming their reliability. The influence of nitrogen on the band structure is discussed in terms
of application of Ga(PAsN) in optoelectronic devices such as intermediate band solar cells and
light emitters. It is found that Ga(PAsN) with low N and As concentration has a band structure suitable
for integration in Si tandem solar cells, since the lattice mismatch between Si and Ga(PAsN) is small
in this case. Moreover, it is concluded that P-rich Ga(PAsN) alloys with low N concentration have
a promising band structure for two colour emitters. Additionally, the effect of nitrogen incorporation
on the carrier localization is studied and discussed.
