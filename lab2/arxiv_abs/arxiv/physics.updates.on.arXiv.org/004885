Accurate representation of vertical turbulent fluxes is crucial for numerical ocean modelling,
both in global and coastal applications. The state-of-the-art approach is to use two-equation
turbulence closure models which introduces two dynamic equations to the system. Solving these
equations numerically, however, is challenging due to the strict requirement of positivity of
the turbulent quantities (e.g. turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation rate), and the non-linear
source terms that may render the numerical system unstable. In this paper, we present a Discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) finite element discretization of the Generic Length Scale (GLS) equations designed
to be incorporated in a DG coastal ocean model, Thetis. To ensure numerical stability, the function
space for turbulent quantities must be chosen carefully. In this work, we propose to use zeroth degree
elements for the turbulent quantities and linear discontinuous elements for the tracers and velocity.
The spatial discretization is completed with a positivity preserving semi-implicit time integration
scheme. We validate the implementation with standard turbulence closure model benchmarks and
an idealized estuary simulation. Finally, we use the full three-dimensional model to simulate
the Columbia River plume. The results confirm that the coupled model generates realistic vertical
mixing, and remains stable under strongly stratified conditions and strong tidal forcing. Estuarine
circulation and river plume characteristics are well captured. Overall, numerical mixing of the
model is found to be small resulting in a highly dynamic river plume.
