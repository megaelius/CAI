In engineering applications snow often undergoes large and fast deformations. During these deformations
the snow transforms from a sintered porous material into a granular material. In order to capture
the fundamental mechanical behavior of this process a discrete element (DE) model is the physically
most appropriate. It explicitly includes all the relevant components: the snow microstructure,
consisting of bonded grains, the breaking of the bonds and the following rearrangement and interaction
of the loose grains. We developed and calibrated a DE snow model based on the open source DE code liggghts.
In the model snow grains are represented by randomly distributed elastic spheres connected by elastic-brittle
bonds. This bonded structure corresponds to sintered snow. After applying external forces, the
stresses in the bonds might exceed their strength, the bonds break, and we obtain loose particles,
corresponding to granular snow. Model parameters can be divided into temperature dependent material
parameters and snow type dependent microstructure parameters. The model was calibrated by angle
of repose experiments and several high strain rate mechanical tests, performed in a cold laboratory.
We demonstrate the performance of the DE snow model by the simulation of a combined compression and
shear deformation of different snow types with large strains. The model successfully reproduces
the experiments. Most characteristics of the mechanical snow behavior are captured by the model,
like the fracture behavior, the differences between low and high density snow, the granular shear
flow or the densification of low density snow. The model is promising to simulate arbitrary high
strain rate processes for a wide range of snow types, and thus seems useful to be applied to different
snow engineering problems.
