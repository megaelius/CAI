This paper is a small step towards the goal of constructing a coherent theory of physic and mathematics
together. It is based on two ideas, the localization of mathematical systems in space or space time,
and the separation of the concepts of number from number value. The separation of number from number
value along with the freedom of choice of number values at different points of space or space time
enables the introduction of a space or space time dependent number valuation field. The presence
of a location dependent number value field affects theoretical descriptions of many physical and
geometric quantities. A simple geometric example is worked out in detail, that of the length of a
path. The localization of mathematical systems and the separation of number from number value or
meaning both emphasize the role of observers. The separation of number from number value shows the
role of observers in that value or meaning are conscious observer related concepts. Nothing, including
numbers, has value or meaning to an unconscious observer. The localization of mathematical systems
also shows the role of observers in that the mathematics that is potentially available to an observer
is that at the same position as is the observer. This represents the mathematical knowledge that
can reside in an observers brain. As an observer moves in space or space time, the mathematical knowledge
potentially available to the observer is the collection of mathematical systems at the same location
as the observer. It is hoped that this work, which was begun in 2010, will lead to a better understanding
of the relation between the foundations of mathematics and physics, and the role that observers
play in this relation.
