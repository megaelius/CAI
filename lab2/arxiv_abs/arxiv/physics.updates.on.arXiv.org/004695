In this work, we present an analysis of dune migration and volume change of the Garopaba dune field,
southern Brazil, based on Airborne LiDAR (ALS - 2010) and Structure from Motion-Multi View Stereo
(SfM-MVS - 2019). The accuracy of the SfM-MVS reconstruction was validated by a comparison between
Terrestrial LiDAR (TLS) and SfM-MVS DEMs. Elevation differences of 2000 random points resulted
in RMSE of 0.16m and MAE of 0.13m, with SfM-MVS elevations slightly higher than the TLS ones. Although
sand dunes are commonly regarded as a challenge to traditional photogrammetry due their homogeneous
texture and spectral response, in this research image matching was successful in all areas of the
survey due the presence of superficial features (footprints and sandboard tracks) and visibility
of the sedimentary stratification, highlighted by heavy minerals. Displacement of dune crest
lines from the ALS and SfM-MVS DEMs resulted in a migration rate of ~5m/year between 2010 and 2019,
in good agreement with rates derived from satellite images and historical aerial photographs of
the same area. Sand volume change in the same period showed an increase of only 0.5%, which can be related
to the installation of sand fences to promote dune stabilization and sand removal from the front
of the dune field to keep a road open to vehicles. ALS can cover large areas in little time but its high
cost still remains a barrier to wider usage, especially by researchers in developing countries.
TLS has an intermediate cost but demands more fieldwork and more processing time. In our case we needed
3 days for the TLS survey and around 3 weeks to produce a DEM of ~80400m2. On the other hand, we were able
to cover ~740900m2 with 6 flight missions in under 3 hours, with ~13 hours processing time. This makes
SfM-MVS a low-cost solution with fast and reliable results for 3D modelling and continuous monitoring
of coastal dunes.
