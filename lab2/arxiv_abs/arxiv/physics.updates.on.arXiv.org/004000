The aim of this study is to analyze the destabilization of Alfven Eigenmodes (AE) by multiple energetic
particles (EP) species in DIII-D and LHD discharges. We use the reduced MHD equations to describe
the linear evolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal component of the vorticity in a full 3D
system, coupled with equations of density and parallel velocity moments for the energetic particles
species, including the effect of the acoustic modes, diamagnetic currents and helical couplings.
We add the Landau damping and resonant destabilization effects using a closure relation. The simulations
with multiple NBI lines show three different regimes: the non damped regime where the multi beam
AEs growth rate is larger compared to the growth rate of the AEs destabilized by the individual NBI
lines, the interaction regime where the multi beam AEs growth rate is smaller than the single NBI
AEs and the damped regime where the AEs are suppressed. Operations in the damped regime requires
EP species with different density profile flatness or gradient locations. In addition, the AEs
growth rate in the interaction regime is further reduced if the combined NBI lines have similar beam
temperatures and the beta of the NBI line with flatter EP density profile increases. Then, optimization
trends are identified in DIII-D high poloidal beta and LHD low density / magnetic field discharges
with multiple NBI lines as well as the configuration requirements to operate in the damped and interaction
regimes. DIII-D simulations show a decrease of the n=2 to 6 AEs growth rate and n=1 AE are stabilized
in the LHD case. The helical coupling effects in LHD simulations lead to a transition from the interaction
to the damped regime of the n=2,-8,12 helical family.
