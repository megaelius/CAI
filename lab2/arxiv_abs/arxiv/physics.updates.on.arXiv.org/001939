Nonclassical states, having no classical analogue, promise advantage in the performance in several
fields of technology, such as computation, communication, sensing. This led to an escalated interest
in the recent years for the generation and characterization of nonclassical states in various physical
systems of interest. Keeping this in mind, we examined generation of various lower- and higher-order
nonclassical states in both codirectional and contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical
couplers operating under second harmonic generation with the help of moments-based criteria.
Using another such system (a symmetric nonlinear optical coupler), we have also established the
possibility of observing quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects and further reduced the obtained results
to yield the corresponding expressions for the asymmetric coupler. These studies have been accomplished
using a complete quantum description of the system considering all the field modes as weak. Further,
characterization of nonclassicality in spin systems using quasiprobability distributions has
been performed, which has also provided us the dynamics of the amount of nonclassicality (using
nonclassical volume). As the reconstruction of quasiprobability distributions is possible with
the help of tomograms accessible in the experiments, tomograms are computed here for both finite
and infinite dimensional systems. Finally, a set of controlled quantum communication (both insecure
and secure) schemes with minimum number of entangled qubits has been proposed, which is also analyzed
over Markovian channels. The optimized controlled secure quantum communication scheme is observed
to be reducible to several cryptographic tasks. Using this interesting observation, we obtained
the performance of a set of cryptographic schemes over non-Markovian channels, too.
