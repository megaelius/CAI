The description, interpretation and imagery of cloud sciences by remote sensing datasets from
Earth-orbiting satellites have become a great debate for several decades. Presently, there are
many models for cloud detection and its classifications have been reported. However, none of the
existing models can efficiently detect the clouds within the small band of shortwave upwelling
radiative wavelength flux (SWupRF) band. Therefore, in order to detect the clouds more efficiently
a method known as the radiance enhancement (RE) can be implemented (Siddiqui, R. et al. 2015; Siddiqui,
R., 2017b). Satellite remote sensing database is one of the most essential parts of research for
monitoring different atmospheric changes. This article proposes a new approach how with RE and
SWupRF to distinguish cloud and non-cloud scenes by space orbiting Argus 1000 spectrometer utilizing
the GENSPECT line-by-line radiative transfer simulation tool for space data retrieval and analysis
(Quine, B. M. et al., 2002; Jagpal, R.K. et al. 2010, 2011; Siddiqui, R. et al. 2015; Siddiqui, R.et
al. 2017a, 2017b). This approach may be used within the selected wavelength band of Argus 1000 spectrometer
in the range from 1100 nm to 1700 nm to calculate the integrated SWupRF synthetic spectral datasets.
We used the collected Argus observations starting from 2009 to investigate the radiative flux and
its correlation with cloud and non-cloud scenes (Siddiqui, R. et al. 2015). Our results show that
the both, RE and SWupRF model, are capable of identifying most of the cloudy scenes except for some
thin clouds that cannot be identified reasonably with high confidence due to complexity of the atmospheric
system. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the relative correlation between SWupRF and RE within
a small wavelength band can be a promising technique for estimating the solar and thermal energy
balance involving cloud layers.
