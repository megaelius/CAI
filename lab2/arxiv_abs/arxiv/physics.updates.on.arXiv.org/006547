In this work, we consider alternative discretizations for PDEs which use expansions involving
integral operators to approximate spatial derivatives. These constructions use explicit information
within the integral terms, but treat boundary data implicitly, which contributes to the overall
speed of the method. This approach is provably unconditionally stable for linear problems and stability
has been demonstrated experimentally for nonlinear problems. Additionally, it is matrix-free
in the sense that it is not necessary to invert linear systems and iteration is not required for nonlinear
terms. Moreover, the scheme employs a fast summation algorithm that yields a method with a computational
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, where $N$ is the number of mesh points along a direction. While
much work has been done to explore the theory behind these methods, their practicality in large scale
computing environments is a largely unexplored topic. In this work, we explore the performance
of these methods by developing a domain decomposition algorithm suitable for distributed memory
systems along with shared memory algorithms. As a first pass, we derive an artificial CFL condition
that enforces a nearest-neighbor communication pattern and briefly discuss possible generalizations.
We also analyze several approaches for implementing the parallel algorithms by optimizing predominant
loop structures and maximizing data reuse. Using a hybrid design that employs MPI and Kokkos for
the distributed and shared memory components of the algorithms, respectively, we show that our
methods are efficient and can sustain an update rate $> 1\times10^8$ DOF/node/s. We provide results
that demonstrate the scalability and versatility of our algorithms using several different PDE
test problems, including a nonlinear example, which employs an adaptive time-stepping rule.
