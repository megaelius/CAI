We propose a novel laser configuration that can output 3.5-$\mu$m nanosecond laser pulses based
on a simple and monolithic fiber structure. Cascade-gain-switching, which converts the wavelength
of nanosecond pulses from 1.55 $\mu$m to 3.5 $\mu$m by two successive gain-switching processes.
Instead of using expensive pump sources at special wavelengths and bulky active or passive modulation
elements for Q-switching or mode-locking, the cascade gain-switching only requires the pumping
of an electric-modulated 1.55-$\mu$m pulsed laser and two continuous-wave (CW) 975-nm laser diodes.
They are all standard products for fiber optic communication applications, which can greatly lower
the cost of mid-infrared laser pulse generation. To investigate the feasibility of this configuration,
we numerically simulated the cascade-gain-switching processes by comprehensive rate-equation
models. In single-shot regime, for stable 3.5-$\mu$m pulsed lasing, the CW 975-nm pump should be
turned on at least $\sim500$ $\mu$s ahead of the 1.55-$\mu$m pulsed pump. It shows that the pulse
width of the 1.55-$\mu$m pump has major impact on the temporal shape of the intermediate 1.97-$\mu$m
pulse while has neglected influence on the generated 3.5-$\mu$m pulse. On the other hand, increasing
the CW pump power can significantly improve the output peak power and shorten the pulse when the pump
power is less than $\sim4$ W. In the repetitive-pulse regime, we found the 3.5-$\mu$m pulse train
can be stably outputted when the repetition rate is $<=100$ kHz. As the repetition rate increases,
the duration of reaching the stable operation increases. When the repetition rate is large than
100 kHz, the stable operation cannot be established because the rate of consuming the population
on the $^4I_{11/2}$ level of $Er^{3+}$ ions is faster than the rate of building the population.
