Energetic electrons from the magnetosphere deposit their energy in the atmosphere and lead to production
of nitric oxide (NO) in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. We study the atmospheric NO response
to a geomagnetic storm in April 2010 with WACCM (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model). Modeled
NO is compared to observations by Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment/Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere
at 72-82$^{\circ}$S latitudes. We investigate the modeled NOs sensitivity to changes in energy
and chemistry. The electron energy model input is either a parameterization of auroral electrons
or a full range energy spectrum (1-750 keV) from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Polar
Orbiting Environmental Satellites and European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological
Satellites/Meteorological Operational satellites. To study the importance of ion chemistry
for the production of NO, WACCM-D, which has more complex ion chemistry, is used. Both standard WACCM
and WACCM-D underestimate the storm time NO increase in the main production region (90-110 km),
using both electron energy inputs. At and below 80 km, including medium-energy electrons ($>$30
keV) is important both for NO directly produced at this altitude region and for NO transported from
other regions (indirect effect). By using WACCM-D the direct NO production is improved, while the
indirect effects on NO suffer from the downward propagating deficiency above. In conclusion, both
a full range energy spectrum and ion chemistry is needed throughout the mesosphere and lower thermosphere
region to increase the direct and indirect contribution from electrons on NO.
