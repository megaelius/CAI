Modification and control over the vaporization kinetics of microfluidic droplets may have strong
utilitarian implications in several scientific and technological applications. The article
reports the control over the vaporization kinetics of pendent droplets under the influence of competing
internal electrohydrodynamic and ferrohydrodynamic advection. Experimental and theoretical
studies are performed and the morphing of vaporization kinetics of electrically conducting and
paramagnetic fluid droplets using orthogonal electric and magnetic stimuli is established. Analysis
of the observations reveals that the electric field has a domineering influence compared to the
magnetic field. While the magnetic field is noted to aid the vaporization rates, the electric field
is observed to decelerate the same. Neither the vapour diffusion dominated kinetics nor the field
induced modified surface tension can explain the observed vaporization behaviours. Velocimetry
within the droplet shows largely modified internal ferro and electrohydrodynamic advection,
which is noted to be the crux of the mechanism towards modified vaporization rates. A mathematical
treatment is proposed and takes into account the roles played by the governing Hartmann, electrohydrodynamic,
interaction, the thermal and solutal Marangoni, and the electro and magneto Prandtl and Schmidt
numbers. It is observed that the morphing of the thermal and solutal Marangoni numbers by the electromagnetic
interaction number plays the dominant role towards morphing the advection dynamics. The model
is able to predict the internal advection velocities accurately. The findings may hold significant
promise towards smart control and tuning of vaporization kinetics in microhydrodynamics transport
paradigms.
