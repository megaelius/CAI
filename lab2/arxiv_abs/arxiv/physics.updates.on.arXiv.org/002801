Dissipative solitons are localized solutions in non-integrable and non-conservative nonlinear
system, due to a balance of nonlinearity, dispersion, filtering, and loss/gain. Different from
conventional soliton, they exhibit extremely complex and striking dynamics, and are more universal
in the far-from-equilibrium natural system. Taking advantage of dispersive Fourier transform
and time lens, the spatio-temporal transient dynamics of dissipative solitons have been characterized
with both amplitude and phase. Yet, a full avenue of the buildup process of dissipative soliton is
full of debris for the lack of the polarization evolution information. Here, we characterize the
probabilistic polarization distributions in the buildup of dissipative soliton in a net-normal
dispersion fiber laser system mode-locked by single-wall carbon nanotubes. The lasing system
operates from random amplified spontaneous emission to stable dissipative soliton when the cavity
gain is increasing, and state of polarization of each wavelength convergence exponentially towards
a fixed point. To reveal the invariant polarization relationship among various wavelengths, the
phase diagram of the ellipticity angle and spherical orientation angle is introduced. We find that
the polarization of each filtered wavelength in the central region of the dissipative soliton is
linearly spaced, while those in the two fronts are spatially varying. Increasing cavity gain leads
to spectrum broadening, meanwhile, the polarizations of the new generated frequencies are extending
to scatter. Further increasing pump power results into dissipative soliton explosion, during
which a kind of polarization optical rogue waves is identified. Those experimental results provide
more information for deeper insights into the transient dynamics of dissipative soliton fiber
laser.
