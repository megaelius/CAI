Results from direct numerical simulations of vertical natural convection at Rayleigh numbers
$1.0\times 10^5$-$1.0\times 10^9$ and Prandtl number $0.709$ support a generalised applicability
of the Grossmann-Lohse (GL) theory, which was originally developed for horizontal natural (Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard)
convection. In accordance with the GL theory, it is shown that the boundary-layer thicknesses of
the velocity and temperature fields in vertical natural convection obey laminar-like Prandtl-Blasius-Pohlhausen
scaling. Specifically, the normalised mean boundary-layer thicknesses scale with the $-1/2$-power
of a wind-based Reynolds number, where the "wind" of the GL theory is interpreted as the maximum mean
velocity. Away from the walls, the dissipation of the turbulent fluctuations, which can be interpreted
as the "bulk" or "background" dissipation of the GL theory, is found to obey the Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin
scaling for fully developed turbulence. In contrast to Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection, the direction
of gravity in vertical natural convection is parallel to the mean flow. The orientation of this flow
presents an added challenge because there no longer exists an exact relation that links the normalised
global dissipations to the Nusselt, Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. Nevertheless, we show that the
unclosed term, namely the global-averaged buoyancy flux that produces the kinetic energy, also
exhibits both laminar and turbulent scaling behaviours, consistent with the GL theory. The present
results suggest that, similar to Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection, a pure power-law relationship
between the Nusselt, Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers is not the best description for vertical natural
convection and existing empirical relationships should be recalibrated to better reflect the
underlying physics.
