Alfven Eigenmodes (AE) can be destabilized during ITER discharges driven by neutral beam injection
(NBI) energetic particles (EP) and alpha particles. The aim of the present study is to analyze the
AE stability of different ITER operation scenarios considering multiple energetic particle species.
We use the reduced magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations to describe the linear evolution of the
poloidal flux and the toroidal component of the vorticity in a full 3D system, coupled with equations
of density and parallel velocity moments for the energetic particles species including the effect
of the acoustic modes. The AEs driven by the NBI EP and alpha particles are stable in the configurations
analyzed, only MHD-like modes with large toroidal couplings are unstable, although both can be
destabilized if the EP beta increases above a threshold. The threshold is two times the model beta
value for the NBI EP and alpha particles in the reverse shear case, leading to the destabilization
of Beta induced AE (BAE) near the magnetic axis with a frequency of 25-35 kHz and Toroidal or Elliptical
AE (TAE/EAE) in the reverse shear region with a frequency of 125-175 kHz, respectively. On the other
hand, the hybrid and steady state configurations show a threshold 3 times larger with respect to
the model beta for the alpha particle and 40 times for the NBI EP, also destabilizing BAE and TAE between
the inner and middle plasma region. In addition, a extended analysis of the reverse shear scenario
where the beta of both alpha particles and NBI EP are above the AE threshold, multiple EP damping effects
are also identified as well as optimization trends regarding the resonance properties of the alpha
particle and NBI EP with the bulk plasma.
