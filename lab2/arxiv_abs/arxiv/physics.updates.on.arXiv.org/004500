Neutrinoless double-beta decay is a key process in particle physics. Its experimental investigation
is the only viable method that can establish the Majorana nature of neutrinos, providing at the same
time a sensitive inclusive test of lepton number violation. CROSS (Cryogenic Rare-event Observatory
with Surface Sensitivity) aims at developing and testing a new bolometric technology to be applied
to future large-scale experiments searching for neutrinoless double-beta decay of the promising
nuclei $^{100}$Mo and $^{130}$Te. The limiting factor in large-scale bolometric searches for
this rare process is the background induced by surface radioactive contamination, as shown by the
results of the CUORE experiment. The basic concept of CROSS consists of rejecting this challenging
background component by pulse-shape discrimination, assisted by a proper coating of the faces
of the crystal containing the isotope of interest and serving as energy absorber of the bolometric
detector. In this paper, we demonstrate that ultra-pure superconductive Al films deposited on
the crystal surfaces act successfully as pulse-shape modifiers, both with fast and slow phonon
sensors. Rejection factors higher than 99.9% of $\alpha$ surface radioactivity have been demonstrated
in a series of prototypes based on crystals of Li$_2$MoO$_4$ and TeO$_2$. We have also shown that
point-like energy depositions can be identified up to a distance of $\sim 1$ mm from the coated surface.
The present program envisions an intermediate experiment to be installed underground in the Canfranc
laboratory (Spain) in a CROSS-dedicated facility. This experiment, comprising $\sim 3\times
10^{25}$ nuclei of $^{100}$Mo, will be a general test of the CROSS technology as well as a worldwide
competitive search for neutrinoless double-beta decay, with sensitivity to the effective Majorana
mass down to 70 meV in the most favorable conditions.
