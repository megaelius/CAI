The physics model of a next-generation spallation-driven high-current ultracold neutron (UCN)
source capable of delivering an extracted UCN rate of around an-order-of-magnitude higher than
the strongest proposed sources, and around three-orders-of-magnitude higher than existing sources,
is presented. This UCN-current-optimized source would dramatically improve cutting-edge UCN
measurements that are currently statistically limited. A novel "Inverse Geometry" design is used
with 40 L of superfluid $^4$He (He-II), which acts as a converter of cold neutrons (CNs) to UCNs, cooled
with state-of-the-art sub-cooled cryogenic technology to $\sim$1.6 K. Our design is optimized
for a 100 W maximum heat load constraint on the He-II and its vessel. In our geometry, the spallation
target is wrapped symmetrically around the UCN converter to permit raster scanning the proton beam
over a relatively large volume of tungsten spallation target to reduce the demand on the cooling
requirements, which makes it reasonable to assume that water edge-cooling only is sufficient.
Our design is refined in several steps to reach $P_{UCN}=2.1\times10^9\,/$s under our other restriction
of 1 MW maximum available proton beam power. We then study effects of the He-II scattering kernel
as well as reductions in $P_{UCN}$ due to pressurization to reach $P_{UCN}=1.8\times10^9\,/$s.
Finally, we provide a design for the UCN extraction system that takes into account the required He-II
heat transport properties and implementation of a He-II containment foil that allows UCN transmission.
We estimate a total useful UCN current from our source of $R_{use}=5\times10^8\,/$s from a 18 cm
diameter guide 5 m from the source. Under a conservative "no return" approximation, this rate can
produce an extracted density of $>1\times10^4\,/$cm$^3$ in $<$1000~L external experimental
volumes with a $^{58}$Ni (335 neV) cut-off potential.
