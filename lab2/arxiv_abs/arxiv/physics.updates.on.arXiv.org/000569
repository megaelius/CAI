In building studies dealing about energy efficiency and comfort, simulation software need relevant
weather files with optimal time steps. Few tools generate extreme and mean values of simultaneous
hourly data including correlation between the climatic parameters. This paper presents the C++
Runeole software based on typical weather sequences analysis. It runs an analysis process of a stochastic
continuous multivariable phenomenon with frequencies properties applied to a climatic database.
The database analysis associates basic statistics, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and automatic
classifications. Different ways of applying these methods will be presented. All the results are
stored in the Runeole internal database that allows an easy selection of weather sequences. The
extreme sequences are used for system and building sizing and the mean sequences are used for the
determination of the annual cooling loads as proposed by Audrier-Cros (Audrier-Cros, 1984). This
weather analysis was tested with the database of the French weather forecast utility Meteo France.
Reunion Island experiences a lot of different micro-climates due to the high altitude (3069m),
specific relief, and geographic situation (Tropic of Capricorn). Furthermore Reunion Island
has the densest meteorological network in France and is an ideal place to validate the methodology
with different climates. To test the efficiency of such analysis, simulations using the resulting
weather sequences were carried out with the building simulation software CODYRUN. This analysis
is the first step of a more global research concerning weather data generation. Future work will
permit whole hourly typical meteorological year generation using neural networks.
