Contrary to intuition, resonant laser excitation of bound electrons can decrease the temperature
of a system, with electronic relaxation times as fast as nanoseconds allowing for rapid cooling
to far below ambient temperature. Although laser cooling of atoms is routine owing to their relatively
simple internal structure, laser cooling of molecular translational speeds, vibrations, or rotations
is challenging because a different laser frequency is required to electronically excite each populated
vibrational and rotational state. Here, we show that molecules with decoupled vibrational and
electronic modes can be rotationally cooled using a single spectrally filtered broadband laser
to simultaneously address many rotational states. We optically cool AlH$^+$ ions held in a room-temperature
radiofrequency Paul trap to collect 96% of the population in the ground quantum state, corresponding
to a rotational temperature of 4 K. In our current implementation, parity-preserving electronic
cycling cools to the two lowest rotational levels with a timescale set by repeated electronic relaxation,
and collection into the lowest level utilizes a slower vibrational relaxation event setting the
overall cooling timescale to 100 ms; straightforward modifications could allow vibrationless
cooling to the ground state in 10 $\mu$s. We anticipate that the ability to quickly cool trapped molecular
rotors and to repeatedly reset their quantum state will impact several areas of research, including
quantum information processing, ultracold chemistry, precision tests of fundamental symmetries,
and search for time-varying constants.
