Flows over remarkably long distances are crucial to the functioning of many organisms, across all
kingdoms of life. Coordinated flows are fundamental to power deformations, required for migration
or development, or to spread resources and signals. A ubiquitous mechanism to generate flows, particularly
prominent in animals and amoeba, is acto-myosin cortex driven mechanical deformations that pump
the fluid enclosed by the cortex. Yet, it is unclear how cortex dynamics can self-organize to give
rise to coordinated flows across the largely varying scales of biological systems. Here, we develop
a mechanochemical model of acto-myosin cortex mechanics coupled to a contraction-triggering,
soluble chemical. The chemical itself is advected with the flows generated by the cortex driven
deformations of the tubular-shaped cell. The theoretical model predicts a dynamic instability
giving rise to stable patterns of cortex contraction waves and oscillatory flows. Surprisingly,
simulated patterns extend beyond the intrinsic length scale of the dynamic instability - scaling
with system size instead. Patterns appear randomly but can be robustly generated in a growing system
or by flow-generating boundary conditions. We identify oscillatory flows as the key for the scaling
of contraction waves with system size. Our work shows the importance of active flows in biophysical
models of patterning, not only as a regulating input or an emergent output, but rather as a full part
of a self-organized machinery. Contractions and fluid flows are observed in all kinds of organisms,
so this concept is likely to be relevant for a broad class of systems.
