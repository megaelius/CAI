Purpose: To reconstruct artifact-free images from measured k-space data, when the actual k-space
trajectory deviates from the nominal trajectory due to gradient imperfections. Methods: Trajectory
errors arising from eddy currents and gradient delays introduce phase inconsistencies in several
fast scanning MR pulse sequences, resulting in image artifacts. The proposed algorithm provides
a novel framework to compensate for this phase distortion. The algorithm relies on the construction
of a multi-block Hankel matrix, where each block is constructed from k-space segments with the same
phase distortion. In the presence of spatially smooth phase distortions between the segments,
the complete block-Hankel matrix is known to be highly low-rank. Since each k-space segment is only
acquiring part of the k-space data, the reconstruction of the phase compensated image from their
partially parallel measurements is posed as a structured low-rank matrix optimization problem,
assuming the coil sensitivities to be known. Results: The proposed formulation is tested on radial
acquisitions in several settings including partial Fourier and golden-angle acquisitions. The
experiments demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to successfully remove the artifacts arising
from the trajectory errors, without the need for trajectory or phase calibration. The quality of
the reconstruction was comparable to corrections achieved using the Trajectory Auto-Corrected
Image Reconstruction (TrACR) for radial acquisitions. Conclusion: The proposed method provides
a general framework for the recovery of artifact-free images from radial trajectories without
the need for trajectory calibration.
