Since the 1920s, when the three oscillations ENSO, NAO and NPO were found and defined, the theory
of ocean-atmosphere coupling is particularly important in explaining the phenomena of atmospheric
physics, then defined more than ten climate indexes, such as SOI, AO, AAO and Nino monitoring area
and so on, the indexes usually adopt standardized sea level pressure (SLP) difference or standardized
sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) difference definitions. The survey is carried out with
seventy stations runoff of major rivers in the world shows that the correlation coefficient between
these indexes and runoff is very low, most of which is between 0.1-0.2, the impact of the index on the
hydrologic climate cannot be truly reflected, which has led to doubts about the clear physical mechanism
and even questions of teleological authenticity. This is due to the fact that standardization is
a nonlinear process, which changes the structure of the original data, causing the correlation
coefficient to be low. Using sea surface temperature difference (SSTD) to define these climate
indexes, the correlation coefficient is significantly improved, the Hankou station of Yangtze
river, Darband station of Ind, Hope station of Fraser, Bangui station of Oubangui generally exceeds
0.8 strong degree, which prove that these relevant elements have a high resonance effect, there
must be a common driving physical quantity. We find that the sun-earth distance has a very strong
resonance effect, it is the earth's rotational orbit that determines their common activity intensity
and cycle characteristics. The sun-earth distance can accurately calculate the tens and hundreds
years of SST and SSTD, if using the SST or SSTD as the climate indicators, which express physical process
of various ocean-atmosphere coupling, we can thoroughly solve long-term ultra-long-term forecast
of international difficulty problems.
