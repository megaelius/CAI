The principle of equivalence postulating that an acceleration is indistinguishable from gravity
by any experiment, is valid within families of particles having the same passive gravitational
to inertial mass ratio $m_p/m_i$. Presently experimental observations indicate that we live in
a universe with one single family for which $m_p/m_i=1$, but if we consider the imaginary case of
a universe with several particle families having different $m_p/m_i$, the principle of equivalence
would still apply to each one of them. On the basis of this generalized formulation of the equivalence
principle, which becomes relative to sets of particles, and that we designate as the \textit{single-particle
equivalence principle}, one demonstrates that inertial frames can also be implemented for sets
of electrically charged particles, with the same charge-to-mass ratio $q/m_i$, accelerating
in homogeneous electric and / or magnetic fields (by analogy with the case of particles in free fall
in a homogeneous gravitational field). Experimental evidences in support of the proposed extension
of the principle of equivalence to electric fields are presented. These consist in the Witteborn-Fairbank
experiment which revealed that electrons do not fall in the Earth gravitational field, and the well
know fact that electric charges do not radiate either when in free fall in a homogeneous gravitational
field, or when being accelerated by a homogeneous electric field. The London moment in rotating
superconductors is also supporting the proposed extension of the equivalence principle. Prospects
for the future exploration of the consequences of the proposed theoretical scheme to unify electromagnetism
with gravitation in the paradigm of curved space-time, are also briefly suggested.
