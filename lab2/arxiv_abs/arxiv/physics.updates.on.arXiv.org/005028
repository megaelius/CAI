We report the application of machine learning methods for predicting the effective diffusivity
(De) of two-dimensional porous media from images of their structures. Pore structures are built
using reconstruction methods and represented as images, and their effective diffusivity is computed
by lattice Boltzmann (LBM) simulations. The datasets thus generated are used to train convolutional
neural network (CNN) models and evaluate their performance. The trained model predicts the effective
diffusivity of porous structures with computational cost orders of magnitude lower than LBM simulations.
The optimized model performs well on porous media with realistic topology, large variation of porosity
(0.28-0.98), and effective diffusivity spanning more than one order of magnitude (), e.g., >95%
of predicted De have truncated relative error of <10% when the true De is larger than 0.2. The CNN model
provides better prediction than the empirical Bruggeman equation, especially for porous structure
with small diffusivity. The relative error of CNN predictions, however, is rather high for structures
with De < 0.1. To address this issue, the porosity of porous structures is encoded directly into the
neural network but the performance is enhanced marginally. Further improvement, i.e., 70% of the
CNN predictions for structures with true De < 0.1 have relative error <30%, is achieved by removing
trapped regions and dead-end pathways using a simple algorithm. These results suggest that deep
learning augmented by field knowledge can be a powerful technique for predicting the transport
properties of porous media. Directions for future research of machine learning in porous media
are discussed based on detailed analysis of the performance of CNN models in the present work.
