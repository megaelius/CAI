The study reports the aspects of postimpact hydrodynamics of ferrofluid droplets on superhydrophobic
SH surfaces in the presence of a horizontal magnetic field. A wide gamut of dynamics was observed
by varying the impact Weber number We, the Hartmann number Ha and the magnetic field strength manifested
through the magnetic Bond number Bom. For a fixed We 60, we observed that at moderately low Bom 300,
droplet rebound off the SH surface is suppressed. The noted We is chosen to observe various impact
outcomes and to reveal the consequent ferrohydrodynamic mechanisms. We also show that ferrohydrodynamic
interactions leads to asymmetric spreading, and the droplet spreads preferentially in a direction
orthogonal to the magnetic field lines. We show analytically that during the retraction regime,
the kinetic energy of the droplet is distributed unequally in the transverse and longitudinal directions
due to the Lorentz force. This ultimately leads to suppression of droplet rebound. We study the role
of Bom at fixed We 60, and observed that the liquid lamella becomes unstable at the onset of retraction
phase, through nucleation of holes, their proliferation and rupture after reaching a critical
thickness only on SH surfaces, but is absent on hydrophilic surfaces. We propose an analytical model
to predict the onset of instability at a critical Bom. The analytical model shows that the critical
Bom is a function of the impact We, and the critical Bom decreases with increasing We. We illustrate
a phase map encompassing all the post impact ferrohydrodynamic phenomena on SH surfaces for a wide
range of We and Bom.
