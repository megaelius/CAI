Fermions with the internal degrees of freedom described in Clifford space carry in any dimension
a half integer spin. There are two kinds of spins in Clifford space. The spin-charge-family theory,assuming
even d=13+1, uses one kind of spins to describe in d=3+1 spins and charges of quarks and leptons and
antiquarks and antileptons, while the other kind is used to describe families. The new way of second
quantization, suggested by the spin-charge-family theory, is presented. It is shown that the creation
and annihilation operators of 1-fermion states, written as products of nilpotents and projectors
of an odd Clifford character, fulfill the anticommutation relations as required in the second quantization
procedure for fermions: 1-fermion states are in Clifford space already second quantized, the creation
operators for any n-fermion second quantized vectors are products of one fermion creation operators,
operating on the empty vacuum state. It is demonstrated that also in Grassmann space there exist
the creation and annihilation operators of an odd Grassmann character, generating "fermions",
which fulfill as well the anticommutation relations for fermions, representing correspondingly
the second quantized 1-"fermion" states, in this case with integer spins. Grassmann space offers
no families. We discuss the new second quantization procedure of the fields in both spaces. For the
Grassmann case we present the action, basic states, solutions of the Weyl equation for free massless
"fermions" and discrete symmetry operators. A short overview of the achievements of the spin-charge-family
theory is done, and open problems of this theory still waiting to be solved are presented. The Grassmann
and the Clifford case are compared in order to better understand open questions in physics of elementary
fermion and boson fields and in cosmology.
