Quantifying synchronization phenomena based on the timing of events has recently attracted a great
deal of interest in various disciplines such as neuroscience or climatology. A multitude of similarity
measures has been proposed for this purpose, including Event Synchronization (ES) and Event Coincidence
Analysis (ECA) as two widely applicable examples. While ES defines synchrony in a data adaptive
local way that does not distinguish between different time scales, ECA requires selecting a specific
scale for analysis. In this paper, we use slightly modified versions of both ES and ECA that address
previous issues with respect to proper normalization and boundary treatment, which are particularly
relevant for short time series with low temporal resolution. By numerically studying threshold
crossing events in coupled autoregressive processes, we identify a practical limitation of ES
when attempting to study synchrony between serially dependent event sequences exhibiting event
clustering in time. Practical implications of this observation are demonstrated for the case of
functional network representations of climate extremes based on both ES and ECA, while no marked
differences between both measures are observed for the case of epileptic electroencephalogram
(EEG) data. Our findings suggest that careful event detection along with diligent preprocessing
is recommended when applying ES while less crucial for ECA. Despite the lack of a general modus operandi
for both event definition and detection of synchronization, we suggest ECA as a widely robust method,
especially for time resolved synchronization analyses of event time series from various disciplines.
