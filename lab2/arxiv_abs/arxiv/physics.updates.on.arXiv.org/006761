Understanding extreme space weather events is of paramount importance in efforts to protect technological
systems in space and on the ground. Particularly in the thermosphere, the subsequent extreme magnetic
storms can pose serious threats to low-Earth orbit (LEO) spacecraft by intensifying errors in orbit
predictions. Extreme magnetic storms (minimum Dst $\leq$ --250 nT) are extremely rare: only 7 events
occurred during the era of spacecraft with high-level accelerometers such as CHAMP (CHAllenge
Mini-satellite Payload) and GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate experiment), and none with minimum
Dst $\leq$ --500 nT, here termed magnetic superstorms. Therefore, current knowledge of thermospheric
mass density response to superstorms is very limited. Thus, in order to advance this knowledge,
four known magnetic superstorms in history, i.e., events occurring before CHAMP's and GRACE's
commission times, with complete datasets, are used to empirically estimate density enhancements
and subsequent orbital drag. The November 2003 magnetic storm (minimum Dst = --422 nT), the most
extreme event observed by both satellites, is used as the benchmark event. Results show that, as
expected, orbital degradation is more severe for the most intense storms. Additionally, results
clearly point out that the time duration of the storm is strongly associated with storm-time orbital
drag effects, being as important as or even more important than storm intensity itself. The most
extreme storm-time decays during CHAMP/GRACE-like sample satellite orbits estimated for the
March 1989 magnetic superstorm show that long-lasting superstorms can have highly detrimental
consequences for the orbital dynamics of satellites in LEO.
