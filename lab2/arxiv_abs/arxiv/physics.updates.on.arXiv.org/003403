The development Open Source Software fundamentally depends on the participation and commitment
of volunteer developers to progress. Several works have presented strategies to increase the on-boarding
and engagement of new contributors, but little is known on how these diverse groups of developers
self-organise to work together. To understand this, one must consider that, on one hand, platforms
like GitHub provide a virtually unlimited development framework: any number of actors can potentially
join to contribute in a decentralised, distributed, remote, and asynchronous manner. On the other,
however, it seems reasonable that some sort of hierarchy and division of labour must be in place to
meet human biological and cognitive limits, and also to achieve some level of efficiency. These
latter features (hierarchy and division of labour) should translate into recognisable structural
arrangements when projects are represented as developer-file bipartite networks. In this paper
we analyse a set of popular open source projects from GitHub, placing the accent on three key properties:
nestedness, modularity and in-block nestedness -which typify the emergence of heterogeneities
among contributors, the emergence of subgroups of developers working on specific subgroups of
files, and a mixture of the two previous, respectively. These analyses show that indeed projects
evolve into internally organised blocks. Furthermore, the distribution of sizes of such blocks
is bounded, connecting our results to the celebrated Dunbar number both in off- and on-line environments.
Our analyses create a link between bio-cognitive constraints, group formation and online working
environments, opening up a rich scenario for future research on (online) work team assembly.
