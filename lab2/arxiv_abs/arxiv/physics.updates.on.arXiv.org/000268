A numerical and dimensional correlation supported by literature reported experimental evidence
(Homes, Harshman along with Voyager, EGRET, FERMI, WMAP and Planck space platforms and other spacecraft)
is presented which indicates that superconductivity is congruent with the Charge Conjugation,
Parity Change and Time Reversal (CPT) theorem and scalable with Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker
(FLRW) cosmology within the concept of Schwinger pair production and the de Broglie hypothesis.
This momentum and energy conserving (elastic) CPT resonant structural lattice is scalable over
15 orders of magnitude from nuclear to universe dimensions, from the universe Big Bang event to present
and is consistent with nuclear (quark) weak and strong forces, electromagnetic and gravitational
forces being mediated by a particle of constant mass (110.123 x electron mass or 56 MeV/c2) related
to the Higgs mass. This isotropic homogeneous CPT structure filling the space vacuum presently
defines an extremely cold dark energy condition that dictates an equally extremely cold baryonic
dark matter. The model predicts a deceleration value consistent with flat galactic rotation curves
and with observed Pioneer 10 and 11 deep space translational and rotational deceleration and is
generally consistent with the notion that: An object moving through momentum space will decelerate.
This deceleration concept allows Type 1A supernovae universe accelerated expansion data to be
interpreted as if the local universe is slowing down with respect to the rest. The entire concept
focuses towards engineering a critical optical volume energy (COVE) as a possible energy source.
