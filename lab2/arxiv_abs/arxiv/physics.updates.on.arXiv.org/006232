The replacement of the existing endcap calorimeter in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector
for the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), scheduled for 2027, will be a high granularity calorimeter.
It will provide detailed position, energy, and timing information on electromagnetic and hadronic
showers in the immense pileup of the HL-LHC. The High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) will use 120-,
200-, and 300-$\mu\textrm{m}$ thick silicon (Si) pad sensors as the main active material and will
sustain 1-MeV neutron equivalent fluences up to about $10^{16}~\textrm{n}_\textrm{eq}\textrm{cm}^{-2}$.
In order to address the performance degradation of the Si detectors caused by the intense radiation
environment, irradiation campaigns of test diode samples from 8-inch and 6-inch wafers were performed
in two reactors. Characterization of the electrical and charge collection properties after irradiation
involved both bulk polarities for the three sensor thicknesses. Since the Si sensors will be operated
at -30 $^\circ$C to reduce increasing bulk leakage current with fluence, the charge collection
investigation of 30 irradiated samples was carried out with the infrared-TCT setup at -30 $^\circ$C.
TCAD simulation results at the lower fluences are in close agreement with the experimental results
and provide predictions of sensor performance for the fluence regions not covered by the experimental
study. All investigated sensors display 60$\%$ or higher charge collection efficiency at their
respective highest lifetime fluences when operated at 800 V, and display above 90$\%$ at the lowest
fluence, at 600 V. The collected charge close to the fluence of $10^{16}~\textrm{n}_\textrm{eq}\textrm{cm}^{-2}$
exceeds 1 fC at voltages beyond 800 V.
