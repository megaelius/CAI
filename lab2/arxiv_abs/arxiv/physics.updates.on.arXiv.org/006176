Severe local storm (SLS) activity is known to occur within specific thermodynamic and kinematic
environments. These environments are commonly associated with key synoptic-scale features--including
southerly Great Plains low-level jets, drylines, elevated mixed layers, and extratropical cyclones--that
link the large-scale climate to SLS environments. This work analyzes spatiotemporal distributions
of both the environmental parameters and synoptic-scale features in ERA5 reanalysis and in Community
Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) during 1980--2014 over North America. Compared to radiosondes,
ERA5 successfully reproduces SLS environments, with strong spatiotemporal correlations and
low biases, especially over the Great Plains. Both ERA5 and CAM6 reproduce the climatology of SLS
environments over the central United States as well as its strong seasonal and diurnal cycles. ERA5
and CAM6 also reproduce the climatological occurrence of the synoptic-scale features, with the
distribution pattern similar to that of SLS environments. Compared to ERA5, CAM6 exhibits a high
bias in Convective Available Potential Energy over the eastern United States primarily due to a
high bias in surface moisture, and to a lesser extent, storm-relative helicity due to enhanced low-level
winds. Composite analysis indicates consistent synoptic anomaly patterns favorable for significant
SLS environments over much of the eastern half of the United States in both ERA5 and CAM6, though the
pattern differs for the southeastern United States. Overall, results indicate that both ERA5 and
CAM6 are capable of reproducing SLS environments as well as the synoptic-scale features and transient
events that generate them.
