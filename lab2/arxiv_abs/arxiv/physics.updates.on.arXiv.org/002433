Quadratic optical parametric processes form the foundation for a variety of applications related
to classical and quantum frequency conversion, which have attracted significant interest recently
in on-chip implementation. These processes rely on phase matching among the interacting guided
modes, and refractive index engineering has been a primary approach for this purpose. Unfortunately,
the modal phase matching approaches developed so far only produce parametric generation with fairly
low efficiencies, due to the intrinsic modal mismatch of spatial symmetries. Here we propose a universal
design and operation principle for highly efficient optical parametric generation on integrated
photonic platforms. By introducing spatial symmetry breaking into the optical nonlinearity of
the device, we are able to dramatically enhance the nonlinear parametric interaction to realize
an extremely high efficiency. We employ this approach to design and fabricate a heterogeneous titanium
oxide/lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguide that is able to offer second-harmonic generation
with a theoretical conversion efficiency as high as 2900% W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$, which enables us
to experimentally achieve a conversion efficiency of 36.0% W$^{-1}$ in a waveguide only 2.35 mm
long, corresponding to a recorded normalized efficiency of 650% W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ that is significantly
beyond the reach of conventional modal phase matching approaches. Unlike nonlinearity domain
engineering that is material selective, the proposed operation principle can be flexibly applied
to any other on-chip quadratic nonlinear platform to support ultra-highly efficient optical parametric
interactions, thus opening up a great avenue towards extreme nonlinear and quantum optics with
great potentials for broad applications in energy efficient nonlinear and quantum photonic signal
processing.
