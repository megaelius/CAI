An introduction to the use of projection-operator methods for the derivation of classical fluid
transport equations for weakly coupled, magnetized plasmas is given. In the present work, linear
response is addressed. In the Schr\"odinger representation, projection onto the hydrodynamic
subspace leads to the conventional Braginskii fluid equations, while the orthogonal projection
leads to an alternative derivation of the Braginskii correction equations for the nonhydrodynamic
part of the distribution function f. Although ultimately mathematically equivalent to Braginskii's
calculations, the projection-operator approach provides a usefully intuitive way of discussing
the derivation of transport equations and interpreting the significance of the various parts of
the perturbed distribution function; it is also technically more concise. A special case of the
Weinhold metric is used to provide a covariant representation of the formalism; this allows a succinct
demonstration of the Onsager symmetries for classical transport. The Heisenberg representation
is used to derive a generalized Langevin system whose mean recovers the Braginskii equations but
that also includes fluctuating forces. Transport coefficients are simply related to the two-time
correlation functions of those forces, and physical pictures of the various transport processes
are naturally couched in terms of them. A number of appendices review the traditional Chapman-Enskog
procedure; record results about the linearized Landau collision operator; discuss the covariant
representation of the hydrodynamic projection; provide an example of the calculation of some transport
effects; describe the decomposition of the stress tensor for magnetized plasma; introduce the
linear eigenmodes of the Braginskii equations; and, with the aid of several examples, mention some
caveats for the use of projection operators.
