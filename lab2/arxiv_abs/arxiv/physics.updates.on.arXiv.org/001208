We study the spatiotemporal solitary modes that propagate in a hollow twisted cylinder waveguide
pipe with a self-focusing Kerr nonlinearity. Three generic solitary modes, one belonging to the
zero-harmonic (0H) and the other two belonging to the first-harmonic (1H), are found in the first
rotational Brillouin zone. The 0H solitary modes can be termed as a quasi-1D (one-dimensional)
temporal soliton. Their characteristics depend only on the energy flow. The 1H solitary mode can
be termed a quasi-2D (two-dimensional) bullet, whose width is much narrower than the angular domain
of the waveguide. In contrast to the 0H mode, the characteristics of the 1H solitary mode depend on
both their energy flow and the rotating speed of the waveguide. We demonstrate numerically that
the 1H solitary modes are stable when their energy flow is smaller than the threshold norm of the \emph{Townes
soliton}. The boundaries of the bistable area for these two types of solitary modes are predicted
by the analyses via two-mode approximation. This prediction is in accordance with the numerical
findings. We also demonstrate analytically that the 1H solitary mode of this system can be applied
to emulate the nonlinear dynamics of solitary modes with 1D Rashba spin-orbit (SO) coupling by optics.
Two degenerated states of the 1H solitary mode, semi-dipole and mixed mode, are found from this setting
via the mechanism of SO coupling. Collisions between the pair of these two types of solitary modes
are also discussed in the paper. The pair of the 0H solitary mode features only the elastic collision,
whereas the pair of 1H solitary modes can feature both elastic and inelastic collision when the total
energy flow of the two modes are smaller or close to the threshold norm of the \emph{Townes soliton}.
