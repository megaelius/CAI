Decades of research show that students learn more in classes that utilize active learning than they
do in traditional, lecture-only classes. Active learning also reduces the achievement gaps that
are often present between various demographic groups. Given these well-established results,
instructors of upper-division astronomy courses may decide to search the astronomy education
research literature in hopes of finding some guidance on common student difficulties, as well as
research-validated and research-based active learning curricula. But their search will be in
vain. The current literature on upper-division astronomy is essentially non-existent. This is
a shame,since many upper-division astronomy students will experience conceptual and problem-solving
difficulties with the quantitative problems they encounter. These difficulties may exist even
if students have a strong background in mathematics. This is because we often hide multiple ideas
and intellectual steps in the problem statement and in the few brief lines of mathematics that are
frequently considered sufficient for a complete solution. In this paper, I examine one quantitative
problem that is representative of those that upper-division astronomy students are expected to
solve. I list many of the subtle pieces of information that students need to understand in order to
advance toward a solution and I describe how such a list can be used to generate Peer Instruction (PI)
questions. I also provide guidelines for instructors who wish to develop and implement their own
PI questions. These PI questions can be used to increase the amount of active learning that occurs
in an upper-division astronomy course. They help develop students' understandings of symbolic,
mathematical representations and they help improve students' problem-solving skills.
