Automated analyses of the outcome of a simulation have been an important part of atomistic modeling
since the early days, addressing the need of linking the behavior of individual atoms and the collective
properties that are usually the final quantity of interest. Methods such as clustering and dimensionality
reduction have been used to provide a simplified, coarse-grained representation of the structure
and dynamics of complex systems, from proteins to nanoparticles. In recent years, the rise of machine
learning has led to an even more widespread use of these algorithms in atomistic modeling, and to
consider different classification and inference techniques as part of a coherent toolbox of data-driven
approaches. This perspective briefly reviews some of the unsupervised machine-learning methods
-- that are geared towards classification and coarse-graining of molecular simulations -- seen
in relation to the fundamental mathematical concepts that underlie all machine-learning techniques.
It discusses the importance of using concise yet complete representations of atomic structures
as the starting point of the analyses, and highlights the risk of introducing preconceived biases
when using machine learning to rationalize and understand structure-property relations. Supervised
machine-learning techniques, that explicitly attempt to predict the properties of a material
given its structure, are less susceptible to such biases. Current developments in the field suggest
that using these two classes of approaches side-by-side and in a fully integrated mode, while keeping
in mind the relations between the data analysis framework and the fundamental physical principles,
will be key for realizing the full potential of machine learning to help understanding the behavior
of complex molecules and materials.
