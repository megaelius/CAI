While our natural intuition suggests us that we live in 3D space evolving in time, modern physics
presents fundamentally different picture: 4D spacetime in which we travel in the thermodynamically
emphasized direction, called the arrow of time. Arguments for this nonintuitive and nonlocal living
in kind of "4D jello" come among others from Lagrangian mechanics we use from QFT to GR which one of
equivalent formulations is that the history between fixed past and future situation is the one optimizing
the action, or the special relativity saying that different velocity observers have different
3D hypersurface of the present and time direction. Accepting such nonintuitive living in spacetime:
with present moment being in equilibrium between past and future (minimizing tension as action
of Lagrangian) leads to crucial surprising differences comparing to the "evolving 3D" picture
suggested by our natural intuition, in which we for example wrongly require fulfilment of the Bell
inequalities. Specifically, particle in spacetime becomes own trajectory: 1D submanifold, making
that statistical physics should consider for example Boltzmann distribution among entire paths,
what leads to quantum behavior as we know from Feynman's Euclidean path integrals or close Maximal
Entropy Random Walk (MERW), which brings natural intuitions e.g for the Born rule with squares from
quantum formalism, which lead to violation of Bell inequalities. Specifically, quantum amplitude
turns out to describe situation at the end of half-spacetime from a given moment toward both past
and future, to randomly get some value of measurement we need to "draw it" from both time directions,
getting the squares. Tension in both time directions is also suggested in quantum experiments like
Wheeler's or Delayed Choice Quantum Erasure, we will argue that it is also crucial in quantum algorithms
like Shor's.
