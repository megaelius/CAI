This paper presents the first experimental analysis of polarized synchrotron emission from relativistic
runaway electrons (REs) in a tokamak plasma. Importantly, we show that the polarization information
of synchrotron radiation can be used to diagnose spatially-localized RE pitch angle distributions.
Synchrotron-producing REs were generated during low density, Ohmic, diverted plasma discharges
in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. The ten-channel Motional Stark Effect diagnostic was used to measure
spatial profiles of the polarization angle $\theta_{\mathrm{pol}}$ and the fraction $\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{pol}}$
of detected light that was linearly-polarized. Spatial transitions in $\theta_{\mathrm{pol}}$
of 90$\deg$---from horizontal to vertical polarization and vice versa---are observed in experimental
data and are well-explained by the gyro-motion of REs and high directionality of synchrotron radiation.
Polarized synchrotron emission is modeled with the synthetic diagnostic SOFT; its output Green's
(or detector response) functions reveal a critical RE pitch angle at which $\theta_{\mathrm{pol}}$
flips by 90$\deg$ and $\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{pol}}$ is minimal. Using SOFT, we determine the dominant
RE pitch angle which reproduces measured $\theta_{\mathrm{pol}}$ and $\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{pol}}$
values. The spatiotemporal evolutions of $\theta_{\mathrm{pol}}$ and $\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{pol}}$
are explored in detail for one C-Mod discharge. For channels viewing REs near the magnetic axis and
flux surfaces $q$ = 1 and 4/3, disagreements between synthetic and experimental signals suggest
that the sawtooth instability may be influencing RE dynamics. Furthermore, other sources of pitch
angle scattering, not considered in this analysis, could help explain discrepancies between simulation
and experiment.
