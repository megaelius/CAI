Moisture in the form of humidity has a significant impact on the operation of photovoltaic (PV) cells
and panels. Moisture is often diffuse through the encapsulant film (Ethylene Vynil Acetate (EVA),
PVB, PVF, PMMA) or the breathable back-sheet. Moisture is known to accelerate the degradation and
reduce the performance of a PV while operating in a wet environment. SCAPS 1 D is widely used to simulate
and estimate the operation of PV. In this work, we showed the effect of moisture on the operation and
performance of a PV, made from monocrystalline silicon. Namely, the influence of defects and impurities
generated by moisture was investigated. We studied the simultaneous effects of Silanlols (Si-OH),
Hydrogen ions H$^+$, and the metallic ions generated from the corrosion of contacts, encapsulant
and transparent conducting oxide (TCO) when there is production of acid (Al$^{3+}$; Zn$^{2+}$),
or from dust (Fe$^{3+}$). The numerical simulation showed that : starting with PV cells without
moisture, the Fill Factor (FF) and the Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) drop respectively from
82.80 $\%$ to 81.78 $\%$ and 18.57 $\%$ to 11.46 $\%$ , when there is moisture in the cell and PVB used
as encapsulant. Further degradation of parameters was observed, when the moisture leads to the
production of acetic acid on the EVA, or when there is dust having iron (Fe). FF and PCE were further
dropped to 79.20 $\%$ and 7.04 $\%$ respectively, using the same initial photovoltaic cells. Furthermore,
a net decrease in key electrical parameters of the PV was observed throughout the study, with maximal
power ( P$_{max}$), the short circuit current ( J$_{SC}$), the current density at maximum power
J$_{MP}$ reducing by more than 50\%. This study paves the way for the improvement of performance,
and the understanding of degradation process in panels used in wet environments and tropical area.
