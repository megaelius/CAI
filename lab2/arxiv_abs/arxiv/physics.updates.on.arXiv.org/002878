The self-potential (SP) method is a passive geophysical method that relies on the measurement of
naturally occurring electrical field. One of the contributions to the SP signal is the streaming
potential, which is of particular interest in hydrogeophysics as it is directly related to both
the water flow and porous medium properties. The streaming current is generated by the relative
displacement of an excess of electrical charges located in the electrical double layer surrounding
the minerals of the porous media. In this study, we develop a physically based analytical model to
estimate the effective excess charge density dragged by the water flow under partially saturated
conditions. The proposed model is based on the assumption that the porous media can be represented
by a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes with a fractal pore size distribution. The excess charge
that is effectively dragged by the water flow is estimated using a flux averaging approach. Under
these hypotheses, this new model describes the effective excess charge density as a function of
saturation and relative permeability while also depending on the chemical and interface properties,
and on petrophysical parameters of the media. The expression of the model has an analytical single
closed-form which is consistent with a previous model developed from a different approach. The
performance of the proposed model is then tested against previous models and different sets of laboratory
and field data from the literature. The predictions of the proposed model fits fairly well the experimental
data and shows improvements to estimate the magnitude of the effective excess charge density over
the previous models. This new model proposes a simple and efficient way to model the streaming current
generation for partially saturated porous media.
