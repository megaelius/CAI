The free energy plays a fundamental role in descriptions of many systems in continuum physics. Notably,
in multiphysics applications, it encodes thermodynamic coupling between different fields. It
thereby gives rise to driving forces on the dynamics of interaction between the constituent phenomena.
In mechano-chemically interacting materials systems, even consideration of only compositions,
order parameters and strains can render the free energy to be reasonably high-dimensional. In proposing
the free energy as a paradigm for scale bridging, we have previously exploited neural networks for
their representation of such high-dimensional functions. Specifically, we have developed an
integrable deep neural network (IDNN) that can be trained to free energy derivative data obtained
from atomic scale models and statistical mechanics, then analytically integrated to recover a
free energy density function. The motivation comes from the statistical mechanics formalism,
in which certain free energy derivatives are accessible for control of the system, rather than the
free energy itself. Our current work combines the IDNN with an active learning workflow to improve
sampling of the free energy derivative data in a high-dimensional input space. Treated as input-output
maps, machine learning accommodates role reversals between independent and dependent quantities
as the mathematical descriptions change with scale bridging. As a prototypical system we focus
on Ni-Al. Phase field simulations using the resulting IDNN representation for the free energy density
of Ni-Al demonstrate that the appropriate physics of the material have been learned. To the best
of our knowledge, this represents the most complete treatment of scale bridging, using the free
energy for a practical materials system, that starts with electronic structure calculations and
proceeds through statistical mechanics to continuum physics.
