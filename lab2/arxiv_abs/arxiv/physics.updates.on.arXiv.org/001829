The Sequential Fully Implicit (SFI) method was proposed to simulate coupled immiscible multiphase
fluid flow in porous media. Later, it was extended to the black-oil model, whereby the gas component
is allowed to dissolve in the oil phase. Most recently, the SFI approach was extended to fully compositional
isothermal displacements. SFI schemes solve the fully coupled system in two steps: (1) Construct
and solve the pressure equation (flow problem). (2) Solve the coupled species transport equations
for the phase saturations and phase compositions. Experience indicates that complex interphase
mass transfer behaviors often lead to large numbers of SFI outer iterations compared with the Fully
Implicit (FI) method. Here, we demonstrate that the convergence difficulties are directly related
to the treatment of the coupling between the flow and transport problems, and we propose a new SFI
variant based on a nonlinear overall-volume balance equation. The first step consists of forming
and solving a nonlinear pressure equation, which is a weighted sum of all the component mass conservation
equations. The second step of the new SFI scheme entails introducing the overall-mass density as
a degree-of-freedom, and solving the full set of component conservation equations cast in the natural-variables
form. During the second step, the pressure and the total-velocity fields are fixed. We analyze the
`splitting errors' associated with the compositional SFI scheme, and we show how to control these
errors in order to converge to the same solution as the Fully Implicit (FI) method. This robust sequential-implicit
solution scheme allows for designing numerical methods and linear solvers that are optimized for
the sub-problems of flow and transport.
