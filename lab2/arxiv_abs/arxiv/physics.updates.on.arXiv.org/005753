Higher-order dispersion can lead to intriguing dynamics that are becoming a focus of modern hydrodynamics
research. Such systems occur naturally, for example in shallow water waves and nonlinear optics,
for which several types of novel dispersive shocks structures have been identified. Here we introduce
ultracold atoms as a tunable quantum simulations platform for higher-order systems. Degenerate
quantum gases are well controlled model systems for the experimental study of dispersive hydrodynamics
in superfluids and have been used to investigate phenomena such as vortices, solitons, dispersive
shock waves and quantum turbulence. With the advent of Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling, the
dispersion of a dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensate can be modified in a flexible way, allowing
for detailed investigations of higher-order dispersion dynamics. Here we present a combined experimental
and theoretical study of shock structures generated in such a system. The breaking of Galilean invariance
by the spin-orbit coupling allows two different types of shock structures to emerge simultaneously
in a single system. Numerical simulations suggest that the behavior of these shock structures is
affected by interactions with vortices in a manner reminiscent of emerging viscous hydrodynamics
due to an underlying quantum turbulence in the system. This result suggests that spin-orbit coupling
can be used as a powerful means to tun the effective viscosity in cold-atom experiments serving as
quantum simulators of turbulent hydrodynamics, with applications from condensed matter and optics
to quantum simulations of neutron stars.
