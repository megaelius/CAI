Recently, the field of Metal-Insulator-Transition (MIT) materials has emerged as an unconventional
solution for novel energy efficient electronic functions, such as steep slope subthermionic switches,
neuromorphic hardware, reconfigurable radiofrequency functions, new types of sensors, teraherz
and optoelectronic devices. Designing radiofrequency (RF) electronic circuits with a MIT material
like vanadium dioxide, VO2, requires the understanding of its physics and appropriate models and
tools, with predictive capability over large range of frequency (1-100GHz). Here, we develop 3D
Smith charts for devices and circuits having complex frequency dependences, like the ones resulting
by the use of MIT materials. The novel foundation of a 3D Smith chart involves here the geometrical
fundamental notions of oriented curvature and variable homothety in order to clarify first theoretical
inconsistencies in Foster and Non Foster circuits, where the driving point impedances exhibit
mixed clockwise and counter-clockwise frequency dependent paths on the Smith chart as frequency
increases. We show here the unique visualization capability of a 3D Smith chart, which allows to
quantify orientation over variable frequency. The new 3D Smith chart is applied as a 3D multi-parameter
modelling and design environment for the complex case of Metal-Insulator-Transition (MIT) materials
where their permittivity is dependent on the frequency. In this work, we apply 3D Smith charts to
on Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) reconfigurable Peano inductors. We report fabricated inductors with
record quality factors using VO2 phase transition to program multiple tuning states, operating
in the range 4 GHz to 10 GHz. Finally, we fabricate new Peano curves filters used to extract the frequency-dependent
dielectric constant of VO2 within 1 GHz-50 GHz for the accurate design of RF electronic applications
