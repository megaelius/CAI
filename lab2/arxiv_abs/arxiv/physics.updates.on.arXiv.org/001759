We advocate the idea that the nanoflares conjectured by Parker long ago to resolve the corona heating
problem, may also trigger the larger solar flares. The arguments are based on the model where emission
of extreme ultra violet (EUV) radiation and soft x-rays from the Sun are powered externally by incident
dark matter particles within the Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) Dark Matter Model. The corresponding
annihilation events of the AQNs with the solar material are identified with nanoflares. This model
was originally invented as a natural explanation of the observed ratio $\Omega_{\rm dark} \sim
\Omega_{\rm visible}$ when the DM and visible matter densities assume the same order of magnitude
values. When the same nuggets enter the regions with high magnetic field they serve as the triggers
igniting the magnetic reconnections which eventually may lead to much larger flares. Technically,
the magnetic reconnection is ignited due to the shock wave which inevitably develops when the dark
matter nuggets enter the solar atmosphere with velocity $v_{\rm AQN}\sim ~10^3 {\rm km/s}$ which
is much higher than the speed of sound $c_s$, such that the Mach number $M=v_{\rm AQN}/c_s\gg 1$.
These shock waves generate very strong and very short impulses expressed in terms of pressure $\Delta
p/p\sim M^2$ and temperature $\Delta T/T\sim M^2$ in vicinity of (would be) magnetic reconnection
area. We find that this mechanism is consistent with x -ray observations as well as with observed
jet like morphology of the initial stage of the flares. The mechanism is also consistent with the
observed scaling of the flare distribution $dN\sim W^{-\alpha}dW$ as a function of the flare's
energy $W$. We also speculate that the same nuggets may trigger the sunquakes which are known to be
correlated with large flares.
