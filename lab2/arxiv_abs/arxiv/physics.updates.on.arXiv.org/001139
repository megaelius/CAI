An approach for analytical description of thermal processes in harmonic lattices is presented.
We cover longitudinal and transverse vibrations of chains and out-of-plane vibrations of two-dimensional
lattices with interactions of an arbitrary number of neighbors. Motion of each particle is governed
by a single scalar equation and therefore the notion "scalar lattice" is used. Evolution of initial
temperature field in an infinite lattice is investigated. An exact equation describing the evolution
is derived. Continualization of this equation with respect to spatial coordinates is carried out.
The resulting continuum equation is solved analytically. The solution shows that the kinetic temperature
is represented as the sum of two terms, one describing short time behavior, the other large time behavior.
At short times, the temperature performs high-frequency oscillations caused by redistribution
of energy among kinetic and potential forms (fast process). Characteristic time of this process
is of order of ten periods of atomic vibrations. At large times, changes of the temperature are caused
by ballistic heat transfer (slow process). The temperature field is represented as a superposition
of waves having the shape of initial temperature distribution and propagating with group velocities
dependent on the wave vector. Expressions describing fast and slow processes are invariant with
respect to substitution $t$ by $-t$. However examples considered in the paper demonstrate that
these processes are irreversible. Numerical simulations show that presented theory describes
the evolution of temperature field at short and large time scales with high accuracy.
