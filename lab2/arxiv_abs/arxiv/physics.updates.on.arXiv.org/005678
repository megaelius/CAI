Most studies of near-zero-carbon power systems consider Europe and the United States. In this paper,
we focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), where weather conditions, especially for solar,
differ substantially from those in Europe. We use a green-field linear capacity expansion model
with over-night investment to assess the effect on system cost of (i) limiting/expanding the amount
of land available for wind and solar farms, (ii) allowing for nuclear power and (iii) disallowing
for international transmission. This is done under three different cost regimes for solar PV and
battery storage. We find that: - The amount of available land for wind and solar farms can have a great
impact on the system cost. We found a cost increase of 0-50% as a result of reduced available land.
In MENA, the impact on system cost is greatly influenced by the PV and battery cost regime, which is
not the case in Europe. - Allowing for nuclear has nearly no effect in MENA, while it can decrease system
costs in Europe by up to 23%. In Europe, the effect on system cost of whether nuclear power is allowed
is highly dependent on the PV and battery cost regime, which is not the case in MENA. - Disallowing
for international transmission increases costs by up to around 25% in both Europe and MENA. The cost
increase depends on cost regime for PV and batteries. The impact on system cost off these three controversial
parts of a decarbonized power system thus plays out differently, depending on (i) the region and
(ii) uncertain future costs for solar PV and storage. We conclude that a renewable power system in
MENA, is less costly than in Europe irrespective of the cost regime. In MENA, the system costs vary
between 37 and 83 euro/MWh. In Europe, the system costs vary between 43 and 89 euro/MWh.
