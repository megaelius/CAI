It is often intriguing experimentally to take stock of how conformational changes in the device
configuration may impact the overall charge transport behavior of single-molecule junctions.
Based on the allied approach of density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function
formalism, we explore here the effect of junction heterogeneity on inelastic charge transport
in various metal-string based single-molecule devices. The constituent active elements being
sensitive to the resonant levels, transition metal centers are found to influence stretching,
bending, and torsional excitation modes, while rocking and scissoring modes are controlled largely
by the axial ligands. For certain molecular conformations and electrode orientations, phonon-assisted
quantum interference effect may crop up, leading to the suppression of higher wavenumber vibrational
modes. The resulting inelastic spectra are likely to take the shape of dominant Fano resonance or
anti-resonance, depending on whether phonons are emitted or absorbed. Such nanoscale quantum
interference effect is manifested especially in those metal-string molecular junctions for which
the energy gap (between localized and delocalized virtual states) lies well within the optical
phonon energies ($\Delta{E}_{|HOMO-LUMO|} <$ 40 meV). It also turns out that single molecular
shot noise can exhibit nearly Poissonian behavior if the inter-channel tunneling through frontier
orbitals is accompanied by phonon absorption or emission following a slow relaxation process.
Our results thus suggest that charge transport properties across metal-string complexes can be
potentially tuned by selective architecture of the metal centers and also, by preferred orientation
of nanoscale electrodes in a bid to build up molecular devices with desirable controllability.
