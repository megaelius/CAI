The wetting properties of immiscible two-phase systems are crucial in a wide range of applications,
from lab-on-a-chip devices to field-scale oil recovery. It has long been known that effective wetting
properties can be altered by the application of an electric field; a phenomenon coined as electrowetting.
Here, we consider theoretically and numerically a single droplet sitting on an (insulated) conductor,
i.e., within a capacitor. The droplet consists of a pure phase without solutes, while the surrounding
fluid contains a symmetric monovalent electrolyte, and the interface between them is impermeable.
Using nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann theory, we present a theoretical prediction of the dependency
of the apparent contact angle on the applied electric potential. We then present well-resolved
dynamic simulations of electrowetting using a phase-field model, where the entire two-phase electrokinetic
problem, including the electric double layers (EDLs), is resolved. The simulations show that,
while the contact angle on scales smaller than the EDL is unaffected by the application of an electric
field, an apparent contact angle forms on scales beyond the EDL. This contact angle relaxes in time
towards a saturated apparent contact angle. The dependency of the contact angle upon applied electric
potential is in good compliance with the theoretical prediction. The only phenomenological parameter
in the prediction is shown to only depend on the permeability ratio between the two phases. Based
on the resulting unified description, we obtain an effective expression of the contact angle which
can be used in more macroscopic numerical simulations, i.e. where the electrokinetic problem is
not fully resolved.
