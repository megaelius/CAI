We study the time correlation functions of coupled linear Langevin dynamics without and with inertia
effects, both analytically and numerically. The model equation represents the physical behavior
of a harmonic oscillator in two or three dimensions in the presence of friction, noise, and an external
field with both rotational and deformational components. This simple model plays pivotal roles
in understanding more complicated processes. The presented analytical solution serves as a test
of numerical integration schemes, its derivation is presented in a fashion that allows to be repeated
directly in a classroom. While the results in the absence of fields (equilibrium) or confinement
(free particle) are omnipresent in the literature, we write down, apparently for the first time,
the full nonequilibrium results that may correspond, e.g., to a Hookean dumbbell embedded in a macroscopically
homogeneous shear or mixed flow field. We demonstrate how the inertia results reduce to their noninertia
counterparts in the nontrivial limit of vanishing mass. While the results are derived using basic
integrations over Dirac delta distributions, we mention its relationship with alternative approaches
involving (i) Fourier transforms, that seems advantageous only if the measured quantities also
reside in Fourier space, and (ii) a Fokker--Planck equation and the moments of the probability distribution.
The results, verified by numerical experiments, provide additional means of measuring the performance
of numerical methods for such systems. It should be emphasized that this manuscript provides specific
details regarding the derivations of the time correlation functions as well as the implementations
of various numerical methods, so that it can serve as a standalone piece as part of education in the
framework of stochastic differential equations and calculus.
