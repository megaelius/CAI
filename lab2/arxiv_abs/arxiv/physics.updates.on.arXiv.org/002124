The RD51 Collaboration, in charge of the development and dissemination of MicroPattern Gaseous
Detectors (MPGD) since 2008, proposes to extend its activity, after 2018, for a further five-year
term. Since the RD51 initial years, the community of MPGD developers and users has grown considerably.
It is reflected by the many MPGD-based applications in high energy and nuclear physics experiments
as well as in other basic and applied-research fields. They rely on the parallel progress of detector
concepts and associated technologies. The cultural, infrastructure and networking support offered
by RD51 has been essential in this process. The rich portfolio of MPGD projects, under constant expansion,
is accompanied by novel ideas on further developments and applications. The proposed next term
of RD51 activities aims at bringing a number of detector concepts to maturity, initiating new projects
and continuing the support to the community. Among leading proposed projects are ultrafast, high-rate
MPGDs; discharge-free, high-resolution imaging detectors with resistive elements and high-granularity
integrated electronics; novel noble-liquid detector concepts, including electroluminescence
in gas bubbles; studies of environment-friendly counting gases and long-term sealed-mode operation;
optical-readout detectors with radiation-hard imagers for fundamental research experiments,
radiography and other domains. The proposed R&D program is also expected to enrich our basic knowledge
in detector physics, to form a generation of young detector experts - paving the way to new detector
concepts and applications. The vast R&D program requires acquiring additional, up-to-date expertise
in advanced technologies.
