Radiotherapy is sensitive to executional and preparational uncertainties that propagate to uncertainty
in dose and plan quality indicators like dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Current approaches to
quantify and mitigate such uncertainties rely on explicitly computed error scenarios and are thus
subject to statistical uncertainty and limitations regarding the underlying uncertainty model.
Here we present an alternative, analytical method to approximate moments of the probability distribution
of DVH-points and evaluate its accuracy on patient data. We use analytical probabilistic modeling
(APM) to derive those moments for individual DVH-points based on the probability distribution
over dose. Further we use the computed moments to parameterize distinct probability distributions
over DVH-points (here normal or beta distributions) to compute percentiles/$\alpha$-DVHs. The
model is then evaluated on three patient cases in 30- and single-fraction scenarios by assuming
the dose to follow a multivariate normal distribution obtained from APM. The results are compared
to a sampling benchmark. The evaluation of the new probabilistic model against the sampling benchmark
proves its correctness under perfect assumptions as well as good agreement in realistic conditions.
Ca. 90% of all computed expected DVH-points and their standard deviations agree within 1% volume
with their empirical counterpart from sampling, for both fractionated and single fraction treatments.
$\alpha$-DVHs achieve better agreement with empirical percentiles when assuming a beta instead
of a normal distribution: While in both cases probabilities show large local deviations (up to $\pm$0.2),
the respective $\alpha$-DVH only showed small deviations (up to $\pm$5% volume for a normal, and
up to 2% for a beta distribution). A previously published model by different authors did not yield
reasonable $\alpha$-DVHs.
