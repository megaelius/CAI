This is the first complete English translation of Oratio De Meteoris Vi Electrica Ortis - seminal
work of the great Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov (1711-1765). It was presented at the public
meeting of the St.Petersburg Academy of Sciences in November 1753 and is traditionally listed among
Lomonosov's most important scientific accomplishments. In the Discourse, Lomonosov presents
an original theory of generation of electricity in the air and lightning, many elements of which
are profoundly correct even by present day understanding of the phenomenon. The theory is based
on experimental observations and measurements and supported by some mathematical estimates.
The basis of the Lomonosov theory is the idea of vertical air movements as the main cause of atmospheric
electricity - the immersion of the cold upper strata of the atmosphere into the lower (warmer) layers
causes mechanical friction of miniscular particles in the air against each other, that results
in generation of atmospheric electricity. Miniscular particles of two types are required: those
of water (vapors) capable of accumulation of the electricity, and organic compounds/fatty particles
in the air which are involved in production of the electricity via friction. Electrically charged
droplets are assumed to be spread throughout the entire volume of the cloud. The transfer of charges
from individual fatty particles to droplets of water in the clouds via countless collisions leads
to formation in atmosphere, in clouds of strong electric fields, which are the cause of the appearance
of lightning. At the end of Discourse Lomonosov suggests explanations of the Northern lights (aurora
borealis) and comet tails as purely electrical phenomena originating from the down- and updrafts
in the atmospheres, like in his theory of lightning,and expanding beyond them into the surrounding
ether.
