A theory of an eroding "hairpin" vortex dipole structure in three dimensions is developed, extending
our previous study of an axisymmetric eroding dipole without swirl. The hairpin is here similarly
proposed as a model to produce large "self-stretching" of vorticity, with the possibility of finite-time
blow-up. We derive a system of partial differential equations of "generalized" form, involving
contour averaging of a locally two-dimensional Euler flow. We do not attempt here to solve the system
exactly, but point out that non-existence of physically acceptable solutions would most probably
be a result of the axial flow. Because of the axial flow the vorticity distribution within the dipole
eddies is no longer of the simple Sadovskii type (vorticity constant over a cross-section) obtained
in the axisymmetric problem. Thus the solution of the system depends upon the existence of a larger
class of propagating two-dimensional dipoles. The hairpin model is obtained by formal asymptotic
analysis. As in the axisymmetric problem a local transformation to "shrinking" coordinates is
introduced, but now in a self-similar form appropriate to the study of a possible finite-time singularity.
We discuss some properties of the model, including a study of the helicity and a first step in iterating
toward a solution from the Sadovskii structure. We also present examples of two-dimensional propagating
dipoles not previously studied, which have a vorticity profile consistent with our model. Although
no rigorous results can be given, and analysis of the system is only partial, the formal calculations
are consistent with the possibility of a finite time blowup of vorticity at a point of vanishing circulation
of the dipole eddies, but depending upon the existence of the necessary two-dimensional propagating
dipole.
