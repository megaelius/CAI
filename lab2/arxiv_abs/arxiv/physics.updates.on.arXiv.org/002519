In this work we have theoretically investigated how the action potential generation and its associated
intrinsic properties are affected in presence of ion channel blockers by adapting Gillepie's stochastic
simulation technique on a very basic neuron of Hodgkin-Huxley type. With a simple extension of the
Hodgkin-Huxley Markov model we have mainly investigated three types of drug blocking mechanisms
and showed that the major experimental and physiological observations such as ionic currents,
spiking frequency trends, change in action potential shape and duration, altered gating dynamics
etc due to the presence of ion channel blockers can be well reproduced. The nature of action potential
termination process in presence of sodium and potassium channel blockers are distinct and physiologically
very different from each other. Channel blockers have distinct signatures on ionic currents. In
presence of only sodium channel blockers the frequency of action potential generation falls off
exponentially with increasing drug affinity, whereas in contrast, for only potassium channel
blockers initially an enhanced spiking activity of action potential is found followed by a gradual
decrease of the spiking frequency as the drug affinity increases. In case of dual type blockers with
equal sodium and potassium channel binding affinity, the spiking frequency passes through maxima
and minima due to the competition between channel number fluctuation and overall sodium and potassium
conductances. We have found that sodium channel blockers shorten the duration of action potential
while the potassium channel blockers delay it. We have also shown how the ion channel blockers alter
the gating dynamics. Some experimental results of ion channel blocking in diverse systems have
been validated through our site selected binding scheme.
