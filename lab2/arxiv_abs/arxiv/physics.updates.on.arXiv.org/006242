This paper selects the NARX neural network as the method through literature review, and constructs
specific NARX neural networks under application scenarios involving macroeconomic forecasting,
national goal setting and global competitiveness assessment. Through case studies on China, US
and Eurozone, this study explores how those limited & partial exogenous inputs or abundant & comprehensive
exogenous inputs, a small set of most relevant exogenous inputs or a large set of exogenous inputs
covering all major aspects of the macro economy, whole area related exogenous inputs or both whole
area and subdivision area related exogenous inputs specifically affect the forecasting performance
of NARX neural networks for specific macroeconomic indicators or indices. Through the case study
on Russia this paper explores how the limited & most relevant exogenous inputs set or the abundant
& comprehensive exogenous inputs set specifically influences the prediction performance of those
specific NARX neural networks for national goal setting. Finally, comparative studies on the application
of NARX neural networks for the forecasts of Global Competitiveness Indices (GCIs) of various economies
are conducted, in order to explore whether the specific NARX neural network trained on the basis
of the GCI related data of some economies can make sufficiently accurate predictions about GCIs
of other economies, and whether the specific NARX neural network trained on the basis of the data
of some type of economies can give more accurate predictions about GCIs of the same type of economies
than those of different type of economies. Based on all of the above successful application, this
paper provides policy recommendations on applying fully trained NARX neural networks that are
assessed as qualified to assist or even replace the deductive and inductive abilities of the human
brain in a variety of appropriate tasks.
