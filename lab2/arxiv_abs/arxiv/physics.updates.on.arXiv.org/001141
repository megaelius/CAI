Influenza remains a significant burden on health systems. Effective responses rely on the timely
understanding of the magnitude and the evolution of an outbreak. For monitoring purposes, data
on severe cases of influenza in England are reported weekly to Public Health England. These data
are both readily available and have the potential to provide valuable information to estimate and
predict the key transmission features of seasonal and pandemic influenza. We propose an epidemic
model that links the underlying unobserved influenza transmission process to data on severe influenza
cases. Within a Bayesian framework, we infer retrospectively the parameters of the epidemic model
for each seasonal outbreak from 2012 to 2015, including: the effective reproduction number; the
initial susceptibility; the probability of admission to intensive care given infection; and the
effect of school closure on transmission. The model is also implemented in real time to assess whether
early forecasting of the number of admission to intensive care is possible. Our model of admissions
data allows reconstruction of the underlying transmission dynamics revealing: increased transmission
during the season 2013/14 and a noticeable effect of Christmas school holiday on disease spread
during season 2012/13 and 2014/15. When information on the initial immunity of the population is
available, forecasts of the number of admissions to intensive care can be substantially improved.
Readily available severe case data can be effectively used to estimate epidemiological characteristics
and to predict the evolution of an epidemic, crucially allowing real-time monitoring of the transmission
and severity of the outbreak.
