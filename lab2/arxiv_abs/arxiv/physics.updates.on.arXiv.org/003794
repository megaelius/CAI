Using a multiscale blood flow solver, the complete diffusion tensor of nanoparticle (NP) in sheared
cellular blood flow is calculated over a wide range of shear rate and haematocrit. In the short-time
regime, NPs exhibit anomalous dispersive behaviors under high shear and high haematocrit due to
the transient elongation and alignment of the red blood cells (RBCs). In the long-time regime, the
NP diffusion tensor features high anisotropy. Particularly, there exists a critical shear rate
($\sim$100 $s^{-1}$) around which the shear-rate dependence of the diffusivity tensor changes
from linear to nonlinear scale. Above the critical shear rate, the cross-stream diffusivity terms
vary sublinearly with shear rate, while the longitudinal term varies superlinearly. The dependence
on haematocrit is linear in general except at high shear rates, where a sublinear scale is found for
the vorticity term and a quadratic scale for the longitudinal term. Through analysis of the suspension
microstructure and numerical experiments, the nonlinear hemorheological dependence of the NP
diffusion tensor is attributed to the streamwise elongation and cross-stream contraction of RBCs
under high shear, quantified by a Capillary number. The RBC size is shown to be the characteristic
length scale affecting the RBC-enhanced shear-induced diffusion (RESID), while the NP size at
submicron exhibits negligible influence on the RESID. Based on the observed scaling behaviors,
empirical correlations are proposed to bridge the NP diffusion tensor to specific shear rate and
haematocrit. The characterized NP diffusion tensor provides a constitutive relation that can
lead to more effective continuum models to tackle large-scale NP biotransport applications.
