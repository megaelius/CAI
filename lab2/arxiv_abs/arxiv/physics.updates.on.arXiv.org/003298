In view of the tracking detectors application to the ATLAS High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade,
we have developed a new generation of High Voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic pixel-sensor prototypes
featuring the AMS aH18 (180 nm) commercial CMOS technology. By fully integrating both analog and
digital readout-circuitry on the same particle-detecting substrate, current challenges of hybrid
sensor technologies: larger readout input-capacitance, lower production-yield, and higher
production and integration cost can be downscaled. The large electrode design using high resistivity
substrates strongly helps to mitigate the charge-trapping effects, making these chips radiation
hard. The surface and bulk damage induced at the highly irradiative environment change the effective
doping concentration of the device that modulates the high electric fields as the substrate-bias
voltage is increased can cause an increased leakage current and premature electrical breakdown
due to impact ionization. In order to assess the characteristics of heavily irradiated samples,
using ATLASPix1 HV-CMOS chip as test vehicles, we have carried out a dedicated campaign that included
irradiations of neutrons and protons, made at different facilities. Here, we report on the electrical
characterization of the irradiated samples at different ambient conditions, also in comparison
to their pre-irradiation properties. Results demonstrate that hadron irradiated devices can
be safely operated at a voltage high enough to allow for high efficiency, up to the fluence of 2E15
neq/cm2, beyond the radiation levels (TID and NIEL) expected in the outer barrel region of Inner
Tracker (ITk).
