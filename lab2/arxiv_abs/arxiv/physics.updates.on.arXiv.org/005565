On small scales, the tropical atmosphere tends to be either moist or very dry. This defines two states
that, on large scales, are separated by a sharp margin, well-identified by the anti-mode of the bimodal
tropical column water vapor distribution. Despite recent progress in understanding physical
processes governing the spatio-temporal variability of tropical water vapor, the behavior of
this margin remains elusive, and we lack a simple framework to understand the bimodality of tropical
water vapor in observations. Motivated by the success of coarsening theory in explaining bimodal
distributions, we leverage its methodology to relate the moisture field's spatial organization
to its time-evolution. This results in a new diagnostic framework for the bimodality of tropical
water vapor, from which we argue that the length of the margin separating moist from dry regions should
evolve towards a minimum in equilibrium. As the spatial organization of moisture is closely related
to the organization of tropical convection, we hereby introduce a new organization index (BLW)
measuring the ratio of the margin's length to the circumference of a well-defined equilibrium shape.
Using BLW, we assess the evolution of self-aggregation in idealized cloud-resolving simulations
of radiative-convective equilibrium and contrast it to the time-evolution of the Atlantic Inter-Tropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the ERA5 meteorological re-analysis product. We find that BLW successfully
captures aspects of convective organization ignored by more traditional metrics, while offering
a new perpective on the seasonal cycle of convective organization in the Atlantic ITCZ.
