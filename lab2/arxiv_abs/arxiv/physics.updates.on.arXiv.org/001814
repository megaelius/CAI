Smoluchowski's model for diffusion-influenced reactions (A+B -> C) can be formulated within two
frameworks: the probabilistic-based approach for a pair A,B of reacting particles; and the concentration-based
approach for systems in contact with a bath that generates a concentration gradient of B particles
that interact with A. Although these two approaches are mathematically similar, it is not straightforward
to establish a precise mathematical relationship between them. Determining this relationship
is essential to derive particle-based numerical methods that are quantitatively consistent with
bulk concentration dynamics. In this work, we determine the relationship between the two approaches
by introducing the grand canonical Smoluchowski master equation (GC-SME), which consists of a
continuous-time Markov chain that models an arbitrary number of B particles, each one of them following
Smoluchowski's probabilistic dynamics. We show the GC-SME recovers the concentration-based
approach by taking either the hydrodynamic or the large copy number limit, resembling Kurtz's limiting
behavior for the chemical master equation. In addition, we show the GC-SME provides a clear statistical
mechanical interpretation of the concentration-based approach and yields an emergent chemical
potential for nonequilibrium, spatially inhomogeneous reaction processes. We further exploit
the GC-SME robust framework to accurately derive multiscale/hybrid numerical methods that couple
particle-based reaction-diffusion simulations with bulk concentration descriptions, as described
in detail through two computational implementations.
