Three-dimensional laminar flow structures with mixing, chemical reaction, normal strain, and
shear strain qualitatively representative of turbulent combustion at the small scales are analyzed.
A mixing layer is subjected to counterflow in the transverse y- and z-directions. Both non-reactive
and reactive flows are examined. Reduction of the three-dimensional boundary-layer equations
to a one-dimensional similar form is obtained allowing for heat and mass diffusion with variations
in density and properties. In steady configurations, a set of ODEs governs the three velocity components
as well as the scalar-field variables. A flamelet model for individual diffusion flames with combined
shear and normal strain is developed. Another model with solution in similar form is obtained for
a configuration with a dominant diffusion flame and a weaker fuel-rich premixed flame. Results
for the velocity and scalar fields are found for ranges of Damkohler number Da, normal strain rate
due to the counterflow, streamwise-velocity ratio across the mixing layer, Prandtl number, and
Mach number. For the flamelet model, a conserved scalar is cast as the independent variable to give
an alternative description of the results. The imposed normal strain decreases mixing-layer thickness
and increases scalar gradients and transport rates. There is indication of diffusion control for
partially premixed flames in the multi-branched flame situation. The enhancement of the mixing
and combustion rates by imposed normal strain on a shear layer can be very substantial. Also, the
imposition of shear strain and thereby vorticity on the counterflow can be substantial indicating
the need for flamelet models with both shear strain and normal strain.
