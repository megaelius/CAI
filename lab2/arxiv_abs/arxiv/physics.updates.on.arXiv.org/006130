We show how to evaluate mobility profiles, characterizing the transport of confined fluids under
a perturbation, from equilibrium molecular simulations. The correlation functions derived with
the Green-Kubo formalism are difficult to sample accurately and we consider two complementary
strategies: improving the spacial sampling thanks to a new estimator of the local fluxes involving
the forces acting on the particles in addition to their positions and velocities, and improving
temporal sampling thanks to the Einstein-Helfand approach instead of the Green-Kubo one. We illustrate
this method on the case of a binary mixture confined between parallel walls, under a pressure or chemical
potential gradient. All equilibrium methods are compared to standard non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics (NEMD) and provide the correct mobility profiles. We recover quantitatively fluid viscosity
and diffusio-osmostic mobility in the bulk part of the pore. Interestingly, the matrix of mobility
profiles for local fluxes is not symmetric, unlike the Onsager matrix for the total fluxes. Even
the most computationally efficient equilibrium method (Einstein-Helfand combined with the force-based
estimator) remains less efficient than NEMD to determine a single mobility profile. However, the
equilibrium approach provides all responses to all perturbations simultaneously, whereas NEMD
requires the simulation of several types of perturbations to determine the various responses,
each with different magnitudes to check the validity of the linear regime. While NEMD seems more
competitive for the present example, the balance should be different for more complex systems,
in particular for electrolyte solutions for the responses to pressure, salt concentration and
electric potential gradients.
