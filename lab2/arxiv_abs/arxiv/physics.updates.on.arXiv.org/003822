The geodynamo features a broad separation between the large scale at which Earth's magnetic field
is sustained against ohmic dissipation and the small scales of the turbulent and electrically conducting
underlying fluid flow in the outer core. Here, the properties of this scale separation are analysed
using high-resolution numerical simulations that approach closer to Earth's core conditions
than earlier models. The new simulations are obtained by increasing the resolution and gradually
relaxing the hyperdiffusive approximation of previously published low-resolution cases. This
upsizing process does not perturb the previously obtained large-scale, leading-order quasi-geostrophic
(QG), and first-order magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) force balances. As Earth's core conditions
are approached in the upsized simulations, kinetic energy spectra feature a gradually broadening
self-similar, power-law spectral range extending over more than a decade in length scale. In this
range, the spectral energy density profile of vorticity is shown to be approximately flat between
the large scale at which the magnetic field draws its energy from convection through the QG-MAC force
balance and the small scale at which this energy is dissipated. The resulting velocity and density
anomaly planforms in the physical space consist in large-scale columnar sheets and plumes, respectively
co-existing with small-scale vorticity filaments and density anomaly ramifications. In contrast,
magnetic field planforms keep their large-scale structure after upsizing. The diagnostic outputs
of the upsized simulations are more consistent with the asymptotic QG-MAC theory than those of the
low-resolution cases that they originate from, but still feature small residual deviations that
may call for further theoretical refinements to account for the structuring constraints of the
magnetic field on the flow.
