The first model independent results obtained by the DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 experiment are presented.
The data have been collected over 6 annual cycles corresponding to a total exposure of 1.13 ton $\times$
yr, deep underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) of the I.N.F.N. The DAMA/LIBRA-phase2
apparatus, $\simeq$ 250 kg highly radio-pure NaI(Tl), profits from a second generation high quantum
efficiency photomultipliers and of new electronics with respect to DAMA/LIBRA-phase1. The improved
experimental configuration has also allowed to lower the software energy threshold. New data analysis
strategies are presented. The DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 data confirm the evidence of a signal that meets
all the requirements of the model independent Dark Matter (DM) annual modulation signature, at
9.5 $\sigma$ C.L. in the energy region (1-6) keV. In the energy region between 2 and 6 keV, where data
are also available from DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 (exposure $1.33$ ton $\times$ yr, collected
over 14 annual cycles), the achieved C.L. for the full exposure (2.46 ton $\times$ yr) is 12.9 $\sigma$;
the modulation amplitude of the single-hit scintillation events is: $(0.0103 \pm 0.0008)$ cpd/kg/keV,
the measured phase is $(145 \pm 5)$ days and the measured period is $(0.999 \pm 0.001)$ yr, all these
values are well in agreement with those expected for DM particles. No systematics or side reaction
able to mimic the exploited DM signature (i.e. to account for the whole measured modulation amplitude
and to simultaneously satisfy all the requirements of the signature), has been found or suggested
by anyone throughout some decades thus far.
