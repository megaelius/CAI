The multi-scale nature of architectured materials raises the need for advanced experimental methods
suitable for the identification of their effective properties, especially when their size is finite
and they undergo extreme deformations. The present work demonstrates that state-of-the art image
processing methods combined with numerical and analytical models provide a comprehensive quantitative
description of these solids and their global behaviour, including the influence of the boundary
conditions, of the manufacturing process, and of geometric and constitutive non-linearities.
To this end, an adapted multi-scale digital image correlation analysis is used to track both elongations
and rotations of particular features of the unit cell at the local and global (homogenized) scale
of the material. This permits to observe with unprecedented clarity the strains for various unit
cells in the structure and to detect global deformation patterns and heterogeneities of the homogenized
strain distribution. This method is here demonstrated on elastic sheets undergoing extreme longitudinal
and shear deformations. These experimental results are compared to non-linear finite element
simulations, which are also used to evaluate the effects of manufacturing imperfections on the
response. A skeletal representation of the architectured solid is then extracted from the experiments
and used to create a purely-kinematic truss-hinge model that can accurately capture its behaviour.
The analysis proposed in this work can be extended to guide the design of two-dimensional architectured
solids featuring other regular, quasi-regular or graded patterns, and subjected to other types
of loads.
