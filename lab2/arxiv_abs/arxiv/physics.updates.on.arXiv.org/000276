We examine the structure of the turbulence boundary of a temporal plane jet at $Re=5000$ using statistics
conditioned on the enstrophy. The data is obtained by direct numerical simulation and threshold
values span 24 orders of magnitude, ranging from essentially irrotational fluid outside the jet
to fully turbulent fluid in the jet core. We use two independent estimators for the local entrainment
velocity $v_n$ based on the enstrophy budget. The data show clear evidence for the existence of a
viscous superlayer (VSL) that envelopes the turbulence. The VSL is a nearly one-dimensional layer
with low surface curvature. We find that both its area and viscous transport velocity adjust to the
imposed rate so that the integral entrainment flux is independent of threshold, although low-Reynolds-number
effects play a role for the case under consideration. This threshold independence is consistent
with the inviscid nature of the integral rate of entrainment. A theoretical model of the VSL is developed
that is in reasonably good agreement with the data and predicts that the contribution of viscous
transport and dissipation to interface propagation have magnitude $2 v_n$ and $-v_n$, respectively.
We further identify a turbulent core region (TC) which is a region that shrinks over time and a buffer
region connecting the VSL and the TC that grows in time and where the inviscid enstrophy production
is important. The BR shows many similarities with the turbulent-nonturbulent interface (TNTI),
although the TNTI seems to extend into the TC. The average distance between the TC and the VSL, i.e.\
the BR thickness is about 10 Kolmogorov length scales or half a Taylor length scale, indicating that
intense turbulent flow regions and viscosity-dominated regions are in close proximity.
