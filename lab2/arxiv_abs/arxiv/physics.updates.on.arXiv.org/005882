Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are the first truly two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor,
providing an excellent platform to investigate light-matter interaction in the 2D limit. Apart
from fundamental scientific exploration, this material system has attracted active research
interest in the nanophotonic devices community for its unique optoelectronic properties. The
inherently strong excitonic response in monolayer TMDs can be further enhanced by exploiting the
temporal confinement of light in nanophotonic structures. Dielectric metasurfaces are one such
two-dimensional nanophotonic structures, which have recently demonstrated strong potential
to not only miniaturize existing optical components, but also to create completely new class of
designer optics. Going beyond passive optical elements, researchers are now exploring active
metasurfaces using emerging materials and the utility of metasurfaces to enhance the light-matter
interaction. Here, we demonstrate a 2D exciton-polariton system by strongly coupling atomically
thin tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayer to a silicon nitride (SiN) metasurface. Via energy-momentum
spectroscopy of the WSe2-metasurface system, we observed the characteristic anti-crossing of
the polariton dispersion both in the reflection and photoluminescence spectrum. A Rabi splitting
of 18 meV was observed which matched well with our numerical simulation. The diffraction effects
of the nano-patterned metasurface also resulted in a highly directional polariton emission. Finally,
we showed that the Rabi splitting, the polariton dispersion and the far-field emission pattern
could be tailored with subwavelength-scale engineering of the optical meta-atoms. Our platform
thus opens the door for the future development of novel, exotic exciton-polariton devices by advanced
meta-optical engineering.
