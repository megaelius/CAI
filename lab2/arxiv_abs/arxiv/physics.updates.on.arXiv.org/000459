As of today, string theory appears to be one of the most promising physical models unifying the fundamental
interactions in nature, such as electromagnetic (gauge) interactions and the gravity. While the
perturbative theory of strings appears to be well explored by now, we still lack an adequate formulation
of string-theoretic formalism in the non-perturbative, or strongly coupled regime. One of the
approaches, allowing us to explore the non-perturbative dynamics of strings (as well as of other
physical theories with gauge degrees of freedom) is the formalism of ghost cohomologies, studied
in this thesis. This approach is based on the fact that virtually all the crucial information on non-perturbative
physics of gauge theories,but not manifestly gauge-invariant. Typically, these operators belong
to a very special sector of the Hilbert space of gauge theories, where the matter and the ghost degrees
of freedom are mixed. These physical operators are defined as elements of ghost cohomologies, studied
in this thesis. In this work, we explore the formalism of ghost cohomologies on the example of supersymmetric
c = 1 model which is one of the simplist models of superstrings, with elegant and transparent structure
of the spectrum of physical states (vertex operators). We show how the presence of the ghost cohomologies
enlarges the spectrum of states and leads to new intriguing symmetries of the theory and points to
possible nontrivial relations of two-dimensional supergravity to physical theories in higher
dimensions. We also develop general prescription for constructing BRST -invariant and nontrivial
vertex operators.
