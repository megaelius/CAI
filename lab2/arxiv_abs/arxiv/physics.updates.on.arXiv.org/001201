Motivated by identifying the origin of the bias dependence of tension propagation we investigate
methods for measuring tension propagation quantitatively in computer simulations of driven polymer
translocation. Here the motion of flexible polymer chains through a narrow pore is simulated using
Langevin dynamics. We measure tension forces, bead velocities, bead distances, and bond angles
along the polymer at all stages of translocation with unprecedented precision. Measurements are
done at a standard temperature used in simulations and at zero temperature to pin down the effect
of fluctuations. The measured quantities were found to give qualitatively similar characteristics,
but the bias dependence could be determined only using tension force. We find that in the scaling
relation $\tau \sim N^\beta f_d^\alpha$ for translocation time $\tau$, the polymer length $N$,
and the bias force $f_d$ the increase of the exponent $\beta$ with bias is caused by center-of-mass
diffusion of the polymer toward the pore on the \textit{cis} side. We find that this diffusion also
causes the exponent $\alpha$ to deviate from the ideal value $-1$. The bias dependence of $\beta$
was found to result from combination of diffusion and pore friction and so be relevant for polymers
that are too short to be considered asymptotically long. The effect is relevant in experiments all
of which are made using polymers whose lengths are far below the asymptotic limit. Thereby our results
also corroborate the theoretical prediction by Sakaue's theory [Polymers 8(12), 424 (2016)] that
there should not be bias dependence of $\beta$ for asymptotically long polymers. By excluding fluctuations
we also show that monomer crowding at the pore exit cannot have a measurable effect on translocation
dynamics under realistic conditions.
