Water wave attenuation by grease ice is a key mechanism for the polar regions, as waves in ice influence
many phenomena such as ice drift, ice breaking, and ice formation. However, the models presented
so far in the literature are limited in a number of regards, and more insights are required from either
laboratory experiments or fieldwork for these models to be validated and improved. Unfortunately,
performing detailed measurements of wave propagation in grease ice, either on the field or in the
laboratory, is challenging. As a consequence, laboratory data are relatively scarce, and often
consist of only a couple of wave elevation measurements along the length of the wave tank. We present
combined measurements of wave elevation using an array of ultrasonic probes, and water kinematics
using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), in a small-scale wave tank experiment. Experiments are
performed over a wider frequency range than what has been previously investigated. The wave elevation
measurements are used to compute the wave number and exponential damping coefficient. By contrast
with a previous study in grease ice, we find that the wave number is consistent with the mass loading
model, i.e. it increases compared with the open water case. Wave attenuation is compared with a series
of one-layer models, and we show that they satisfactorily describe the viscous damping that is taking
place. PIV data are also consistent with exponential wave amplitude attenuation, and a POD analysis
reveals the existence of mean flows under the ice that are a consequence of the displacement and packing
of the ice induced by the gradient in the wave-induced stress. Finally, we show that the dynamics
of grease ice can generate eddy structures that inject eddy viscosity in the water under the grease
ice, which would lead to enhanced mixing and participating in energy dissipation.
