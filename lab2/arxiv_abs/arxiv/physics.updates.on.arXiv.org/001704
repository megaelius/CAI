Electrical properties (EPs) of tissues, conductivity and permittivity, are modulated by the ionic
and water content, which change in presence of pathologies. Information on tissues EPs can be used
e.g. as an endogenous biomarker in oncology. MR-Electrical Properties Tomography (MR-EPT) aims
to reconstruct tissue EPs by solving an electromagnetic inverse problem relating MR measurements
of the transmit radiofrequency RF field to the EPs. However, MR-EPT reconstructions highly suffer
from noise in the RF field maps, which limits the clinical applicability. Instead of employing electromagnetic
models posing strict requirements on the measured quantities, we propose a data driven approach
where the inverse transformation is learned by means of a neural network. Supervised training of
a conditional generative adversarial neural network was performed using simulated realistic
RF field maps and realistic human head dielectric models. Deep learning EPT (DL-EPT) reconstructions
are presented for in-silica MR data and MR measurements at 3 Tesla on phantoms and human brains. DL-EPT
shows high quality EP maps, demonstrating good accuracy and greatly improved precision compared
to conventional MR-EPT. Moreover, DL-EPT allows permittivity reconstructions at 3 Tesla, which
is not possible with state-of-art MR-EPT techniques. The supervised learning-based approach
leverages the strength of tailored electromagnetic simulations, allowing inclusion of a priori
information (e.g. coil setup) and circumvention of inaccessible MR electromagnetic quantities.
Since DL-EPT is highly noise-robust, the requirements for MRI data acquisitions can be relaxed,
allowing faster acquisitions and higher resolutions. We believe that DL-EPT greatly improves
the quality and applicability of EPT opening a new window for an endogenous biomarker in MRI diagnostics
that reflects differences in ionic tissue content.
