Self-seeding is a promising approach to significantly narrow the SASE bandwidth of XFELs to produce
nearly transform-limited pulses. The implementation of this method in the soft X-ray wavelength
range necessarily involves gratings as dispersive elements. We study a very compact self-seeding
scheme with a grating monochromator originally designed at SLAC, which can be straightforwardly
installed in the SASE3 type undulator beamline at the European XFEL. The monochromator design is
based on a toroidal VLS grating working at a fixed incidence angle mounting without entrance slit.
It covers the spectral range from 300 eV to 1000 eV. The optical system was studied using wave optics
method (in comparison with ray tracing) to evaluate the performance of the self-seeding scheme.
Our wave optics analysis takes into account the actual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent
FEL source, third order aberrations, and errors from each optical element. Wave optics is the only
method available, in combination with FEL simulations, for the design of a self-seeding monochromator
without exit slit. We show that, without exit slit, the self-seeding scheme is distinguished by
the much needed experimental simplicity, and can practically give the same resolving power (about
7000) as with an exit slit. Wave optics is also naturally applicable to calculations of the self-seeding
scheme efficiency, which include the monochromator transmittance and the effect of the mismatching
between seed beam and electron beam. Simulations show that the FEL power reaches 1 TW and that the
spectral density for a TW pulse is about two orders of magnitude higher than that for the SASE pulse
at saturation.
