We previously developed a system for projection-based magnetic particle imaging (MPI) with a field-free-line
(FFL) encoding scheme. In the projection-based MPI, projection data are given by the convolution
between the system function in the spatial domain and the line integral of the concentration of magnetic
nanoparticles (MNPs) through the FFL. Thus, it is important to estimate the system functions and
to investigate the factors affecting them for enhancing the quantitative property of the projection-based
MPI. The purpose of this study was to present a method for generating the system function maps in projection-based
MPI. In the simulation studies, the MPI signals induced by MNPs in a receiving coil were calculated
using a lock-in-amplifier model under the assumption that the magnetization and particle size
distribution of MNPs obey the Langevin theory of paramagnetism and a log-normal distribution,
respectively. The system function maps were generated by calculating the MPI signals at various
distances from the FFL and angles between the axis of the receiving coil and the selection magnetic
field. The effects of the particle size of MNPs, the viscosity of the suspending medium, the amplitude
of the drive magnetic field, and the gradient strength of the selection magnetic field on the system
function were investigated. The spatial distributions of the system functions could be well understood
from their maps generated by our method and were largely affected by the parameters described above.
Our method will be useful for improved understanding, optimization, and development of projection-based
MPI.
