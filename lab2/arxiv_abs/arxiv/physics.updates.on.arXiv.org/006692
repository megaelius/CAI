The question of how quantum coherence facilitates energy transfer has been intensively debated
in the scientific community. Since natural and artificial light-harvesting units operate under
the stationary condition, we address this question via a non-equilibrium steady-state analysis
of a molecular dimer irradiated by incoherent sunlight and then generalize the key predictions
to arbitrarily-complex exciton networks. The central result of the steady-state analysis is the
coherence-flux-efficiency relation:$\eta=c\sum_{i\neq j}F_{ij}\kappa_j=2c\sum_{i\neq
j}J_{ij}{\rm Im}[{\rho}_{ij}]\kappa_j$ with $c$ the normalization constant. In this relation,
the first equality indicates that energy transfer efficiency $\eta$ is uniquely determined by
the trapping flux, which is the product of flux $F$ and branching ratio $\kappa$ for trapping at the
reaction centers, and the second equality indicates that the energy transfer flux $F$ is equivalent
to quantum coherence measured by the imaginary part of the off-diagonal density matrix, i.e., $F_{ij}=2J_{ij}{\rm
Im}[{\rho}_{ij}]$. Consequently, maximal steady-state coherence gives rise to optimal efficiency.
The coherence-flux-efficiency relation holds rigorously and generally for any exciton networks
of arbitrary connectivity under the stationary condition and is not limited to incoherent radiation
or incoherent pumping. For light-harvesting systems under incoherent light, non-equilibrium
energy transfer flux (i.e. steady-state coherence) is driven by the breakdown of detailed balance
and by the quantum interference of light-excitations and leads to the optimization of energy transfer
efficiency. It should be noted that the steady-state coherence or, equivalently, efficiency is
the combined result of light-induced transient coherence, inhomogeneous depletion, and system-bath
correlation, and is thus not necessarily correlated with quantum beatings.
