Distributed models to forecast the spatial and temporal occurrence of rainfall-induced shallow
landslides are based on deterministic laws. These models extend spatially the static stability
models adopted in geotechnical engineering, and adopt an infinite-slope geometry to balance the
resisting and the driving forces acting on the sliding mass. An infiltration model is used to determine
how rainfall changes pore-water conditions, modulating the local stability/instability conditions.
A problem with the operation of the existing models lays in the difficulty in obtaining accurate
values for the several variables that describe the material properties of the slopes. The problem
is particularly severe when the models are applied over large areas, for which sufficient information
on the geotechnical and hydrological conditions of the slopes is not generally available. To help
solve the problem, we propose a probabilistic Monte Carlo approach to the distributed modeling
of rainfall-induced shallow landslides. For the purpose, we have modified the Transient Rainfall
Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability Analysis (TRIGRS) code. The new code (TRIGRS-P)
adopts a probabilistic approach to compute, on a cell-by-cell basis, transient pore-pressure
changes and related changes in the factor of safety due to rainfall infiltration. Infiltration
is modeled using analytical solutions of partial differential equations describing one-dimensional
vertical flow in isotropic, homogeneous materials. Both saturated and unsaturated soil conditions
can be considered. TRIGRS-P copes with the natural variability inherent to the mechanical and hydrological
properties of the slope materials by allowing values of the TRIGRS model input parameters to be sampled
randomly from a given probability distribution. [..]
