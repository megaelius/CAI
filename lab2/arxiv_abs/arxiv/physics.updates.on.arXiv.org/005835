Most present-day resonant systems, throughout physics and engineering, are characterized by
a strict time-reversal symmetry between the rates of energy coupled in and out of the system, which
leads to a trade-off between how long a wave can be stored in the system and the system bandwidth. Any
attempt to reduce the losses of the resonant system, and hence store a (mechanical, acoustic, electronic,
optical, atomic, or of any other nature) wave for more time, will inevitably also reduce the bandwidth
of the system. Until recently, this time-bandwidth limit has been considered fundamental, arising
from basic Fourier reciprocity. A recent theory suggested that it might in fact be overcome by breaking
Lorentz reciprocity in the resonant system, reinvigorated a debate about whether (or not) this
was indeed the case. Here, we report an experimental realization of a cavity where, inducing nonreciprocity
by breaking the time invariance, we do overcome the fundamental time-bandwidth limit of ordinary
resonant systems by a factor of 30, in full agreement with accompanying numerical simulations.
We show that, although in practice experimental constraints limit our scheme, the time bandwidth
product can be arbitrarily large, simply dictated by the finesse of the cavity. Our experimental
realization uses a simple macroscopic, time-variant, fiber-optic cavity, where we break Lorentz
reciprocity by non-adiabatically opening the cavity, injecting a pulse of large bandwidth, and
then closing the cavity, storing the pulse which can be released on-demand at a later time. Our results
open the path for designing resonant systems, ubiquitous in physics and engineering, that can simultaneously
be broadband (i.e., ultrafast) and possessing long storage times, thereby unleashing fundamentally
new functionalities in wave physics and wave-matter interactions.
