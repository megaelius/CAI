The Lagrangian probability-density-function model, proposed in Part I for dense particle-laden
turbulent flows, is validated here against Eulerian-Lagrangian direct numerical simulation
(EL) data for different homogeneous flows, namely statistically steady and decaying homogeneous
isotropic turbulence, homogeneous-shear flow and cluster-induced turbulence (CIT). We consider
the general model developed in Part I adapted to the homogeneous case together with a simplified
version in which the decomposition of the phase-averaged (PA) particle-phase fluctuating energy
into the spatially correlated and uncorrelated components is not used, and only total exchange
of kinetic energy between phases is allowed. The simplified model employs the standard two-way
coupling approach. The comparison between EL simulations and the two stochastic models in homogeneous
and isotropic turbulence and in homogeneous-shear flow shows that in all cases both models are capable
to reproduce rather well the flow behaviour, notably for dilute flows. The analysis of the CIT gives
more insights on the physical nature of such systems and about the quality of the models. Results
elucidate the fact that simple two-way coupling is sufficient to induce turbulence, even though
the granular energy is not considered. Furthermore, first-order moments including velocity of
the fluid seen by particles can be fairly well represented with such a simplified stochastic model.
However, the decomposition into spatially correlated and uncorrelated components is found to
be necessary to account for anisotropic energy exchanges. When these factors are properly accounted
for as in the complete model, the agreement with the EL statistics is satisfactory up to second order.
