A multilayer network approach combines different network layers, which are connected by interlayer
edges, to create a single mathematical object. These networks can contain a variety of information
types and represent different aspects of a system. However, the process for selecting which information
to include is not always straightforward. Using data on two agonistic behaviors in a captive population
of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), we developed a framework for investigating how pooling
or splitting behaviors at the scale of dyadic relationships (between two individuals) affects
group-level social properties. We designed two reference models to test whether randomizing the
number of interactions across behavior types results in similar structural patterns as the observed
data. Although the behaviors were correlated, the sociality measures derived from observed data
fell outside the distribution of those derived from the reference model. However, once we controlled
for data sparsity in our second reference model, we found that measures from the observed data then
fell within the range of those from the reference model which showed that this result may have been
due to the unequal frequencies of each observed behavior. Thus, our findings support pooling the
two behaviors. This framework can be used for any type of behavior and question, however, caution
should be used when interpreting the results as some measures are sensitive to data properties,
such as unequal rates of observed behavior in our case. This framework will help researchers make
informed and data-driven decisions about which behaviors to pool or separate, prior to using the
data in subsequent multilayer network analyses.
