The dynamics of perturbations to large-amplitude Internal Solitary Waves (ISW) in two-layered
flows with thin interfaces is analyzed by means of linear optimal transient growth methods. Optimal
perturbations are computed through direct-adjoint iterations of the Navier-Stokes equations
linearized around inviscid, steady ISWs obtained from the Dubreil-Jacotin-Long (DJL) equation.
Optimal perturbations are found as a function of the ISW phase velocity $c$ (alternatively amplitude)
for one representative stratification. These disturbances are found to be localized wave-like
packets that originate just upstream of the ISW self-induced zone (for large enough $c$) of potentially
unstable Richardson number, $Ri < 0.25$. They propagate through the base wave as coherent packets
whose total energy gain increases rapidly with $c$. The optimal disturbances are also shown to be
relevant to DJL solitary waves that have been modified by viscosity representative of laboratory
experiments. The optimal disturbances are compared to the local WKB approximation for spatially
growing Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) waves through the $Ri < 0.25$ zone. The WKB approach is able to capture
properties (e.g., carrier frequency, wavenumber and energy gain) of the optimal disturbances
except for an initial phase of non-normal growth due to the Orr mechanism. The non-normal growth
can be a substantial portion of the total gain, especially for ISWs that are weakly unstable to K-H
waves. The linear evolution of Gaussian packets of linear free waves with the same carrier frequency
as the optimal disturbances is shown to result in less energy gain than found for either the optimal
perturbations or the WKB approximation due to non-normal effects that cause absorption of disturbance
energy into the leading face of the wave.
