A formulation is developed to assimilate ocean-wave data into the Numerical Flow Analysis (NFA)
code. NFA is a Cartesian-based implicit Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) code with Volume of Fluid (VOF)
interface capturing. The sequential assimilation of data into NFA permits detailed analysis of
ocean-wave physics with higher bandwidths than is possible using either other formulations, such
as High-Order Spectral (HOS) methods, or field measurements. A framework is provided for assimilating
the wavy and vortical portions of the flow. Nudging is used to assimilate wave data at low wavenumbers,
and the wave data at high wavenumbers form naturally through nonlinear interactions, wave breaking,
and wind forcing. Similarly, the vertical profiles of the mean vortical flow in the wind and the wind
drift are nudged, and the turbulent fluctuations are allowed to form naturally. As a demonstration,
the results of a HOS of a JONSWAP wave spectrum are assimilated to study short-crested seas in equilibrium
with the wind. Log profiles are assimilated for the mean wind and the mean wind drift. The results
of the data assimilations are (1) Windrows form under the action of breaking waves and the formation
of swirling jets; (2) The crosswind and cross drift meander; (3) Swirling jets are organized into
Langmuir cells in the upper oceanic boundary layer; (4) Swirling jets are organized into wind streaks
in the lower atmospheric boundary layer; (5) The length and time scales of the Langmuir cells and
the wind streaks increase away from the free surface; (6) Wave growth is very dynamic especially
for breaking waves; (7) The effects of the turbulent fluctuations in the upper ocean on wave growth
need to be considered together with the turbulent fluctuations in the lower atmosphere; and (8)
Extreme events are most likely when waves are not in equilibrium.
