Technological advancements in radiation therapy (RT) allow the collection of biomarker data on
individual patient response during treatment. Although biomarker data remains subject to substantial
uncertainties, information extracted from this data may allow the RT plan to be adapted in an informative
way. We present a mathematical framework that optimally adapts the treatment-length of an RT plan
based on the acquired mid-treatment biomarker information, and also consider the inexact nature
of this information. We formulate the adaptive treatment-length optimization problem as a 2-stage
problem, where after the first stage we acquire information about model parameters and decisions
in stage 2 may depend on this information. Using Adjustable Robust Optimization (ARO) techniques
we derive explicit optimal decision rules for the stage-2 decisions and solve the optimization
problem. The problem allows for multiple worst-case optimal solutions. To discriminate between
these, we introduce the concept of Pareto Adjustable Robust Optimal (PARO) solutions. In extensive
numerical experiments based on liver cancer patient data, ARO is benchmarked against several other
static and adaptive methods, including robust optimization with a folding horizon. Results show
good performance of ARO both if acquired mid-treatment biomarker data is exact and inexact. We also
investigate the effect of biomarker acquisition time on the performance of the ARO solution and
the benefit of adaptation. Results indicate that a higher level of uncertainty in biomarker information
pushes the optimal moment of biomarker acquisition backwards.
