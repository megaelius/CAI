Fluid motion driven by thermal effects, such as that due to buoyancy in differentially heated three-dimensional
(3D) enclosures, arise in several natural settings and engineering applications. It is represented
by the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in conjunction with the thermal energy transport
equation represented as a convection-diffusion equation (CDE) for the temperature field. In this
study, we develop new 3D lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods based on central moments and using multiple
relaxation times for the three-dimensional, fifteen velocity (D3Q15) lattice, as well as it subset,
i.e. the three-dimensional, seven velocity (D3Q7) lattice to solve the 3D CDE for the temperature
field in a double distribution function framework. Their collision operators lead to a cascaded
structure involving higher order terms resulting in improved stability. In this approach, the
fluid motion is solved by another 3D cascaded LB model from prior work. Owing to the differences in
the number of collision invariants to represent the dynamics of flow and the transport of the temperature
field, the structure of the collision operator for the 3D cascaded LB formulation for the CDE is found
to be markedly different from that for the NSE. The new 3D cascaded (LB) models for thermal convective
flows are validated for natural convection of air driven thermally on two vertically opposite faces
in a cubic cavity enclosure at different Rayleigh numbers against prior numerical benchmark solutions.
Results show good quantitative agreement of the profiles of the flow and thermal fields, and the
magnitudes of the peak convection velocities as well as the heat transfer rates given in terms of
the Nusselt number.
