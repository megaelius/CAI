In this work we question the effect of the uncertainty of the inflow of a wind tunnel on the output of
the numerical simulation of the flow past a cylinder in transonic regime. The uncertainty is considered
as the result of the imperfect knowledge and variability of the inflow produced by the wind tunnel,
here the transonic S3Ch ONERA mid-scale facility. An evaluation of the uncertainty is made by measuring
the inflow departure from a perfectly uniform and steady flow, using a hot-wire rack installed in
the settling chamber of the wind tunnel. Propagation of the input uncertainties is carried out through
a two-dimensional RANS model of the experiment. A polynomial surrogate model is developed to infer
the uncertainty on the drag of the cylinder due to the statistical properties of the inflow. Following
observation of Gaussian inputs, the parameters of the stochastic model are constructed in two ways,
first through a projection approach, based on the Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule, used as a reference,
and then using a sparsity based regression approach, based on compressed sensing (CS) and $\ell_{1}$-minimization.
The comparison between the two approaches highlights the good performances of CS, as it is able to
reproduce the quantity of interest with a considerably lower number of deterministic numerical
simulations, from 4096 down to 21. The statistical distribution of the drag obtained from the surrogate
model shows that the significant uncertainty of the inflow impacts little the drag estimate. The
flow defects is most influential in the central part of the settling chamber, as determined using
Sobol' indices.
