We observed in a previous study (PLoS ONE 6:e24522) that the self-regulation of amygdala activity
via real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) with positive emotion induction was associated,
in healthy participants, with an enhancement in the functional connectivity between the left amygdala
(LA) and six regions of the prefrontal cortex. These regions included the left rostral anterior
cingulate cortex (rACC), bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), bilateral superior
frontal gyrus (SFG), and right medial frontopolar cortex (MFPC). Together with the LA, these six
prefrontal regions thus formed the functional neuroanatomical network engaged during the rtfMRI-nf
procedure. Here we perform a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis of the effective
connectivity for this network. The SVAR analysis demonstrates that the left rACC plays an important
role during the rtfMRI-nf training, modulating the LA and the other network regions. According
to the analysis, the rtfMRI-nf training leads to a significant enhancement in the time-lagged effect
of the left rACC on the LA. The training is also accompanied by significant increases in the instantaneous
(contemporaneous) effects of the left rACC on four other regions - the bilateral DMPFC, the right
MFPC, and the left SFG. The instantaneous effects of the LA on the bilateral DMPFC are also significantly
enhanced. Our results are consistent with a broad literature supporting the role of the rACC in emotion
processing and regulation. Our analysis provides, for the first time, insights into the causal
relationships within the network of regions engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure targeting
the amygdala. It suggests that the rACC may constitute a promising target for rtfMRI-nf training
along with the amygdala in patients with affective disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD).
