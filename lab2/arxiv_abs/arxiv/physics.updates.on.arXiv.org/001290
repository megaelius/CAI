The hydrodynamic flow field generated by self-propelled active particles and swimming microorganisms
is strongly altered by the presence of nearby boundaries in a viscous flow. Using a simple model three-linked
sphere swimmer, we show that the swimming trajectories near a no-slip wall reveal various scenarios
of motion depending on the initial orientation and the distance separating the swimmer from the
wall. We find that the swimmer can either be trapped by the wall, completely escape, or perform an
oscillatory gliding motion at a constant mean height above the wall. Using a far-field approximation,
we find that, at leading order, the wall-induced correction has a source-dipolar or quadrupolar
flow structure where the translational and angular velocities of the swimmer decay as inverse third
and fourth powers with distance from the wall, respectively. The resulting equations of motion
for the trajectories and the relevant order parameters fully characterize the transition between
the states and allow for an accurate description of the swimming behavior near a wall. We demonstrate
that the transition between the trapping and oscillatory gliding states is first order discontinuous,
whereas the transition between the trapping and escaping states is continuous, characterized
by non-trivial scaling exponents of the order parameters. In order to model the circular motion
of flagellated bacteria near solid interfaces, we further assume that the spheres can undergo rotational
motion around the swimming axis. We show that the general three-dimensional motion can be mapped
onto a quasi-two-dimensional representational model by an appropriate redefinition of the order
parameters governing the transition between the swimming states.
