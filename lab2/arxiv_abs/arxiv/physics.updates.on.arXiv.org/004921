The in silico exploration of chemical, physical and biological systems requires accurate and efficient
energy functions to follow their nuclear dynamics at a molecular and atomistic level. Recently,
machine learning tools gained a lot of attention in the field of molecular sciences and simulations
and are increasingly used to investigate the dynamics of such systems. Among the various approaches,
artificial neural networks (NNs) are one promising tool to learn a representation of potential
energy surfaces. This is done by formulating the problem as a mapping from a set of atomic positions
$\mathbf{x}$ and nuclear charges $Z_i$ to a potential energy $V(\mathbf{x})$. Here, a fully-dimensional,
reactive neural network representation for malonaldehyde (MA), acetoacetaldehyde (AAA) and
acetylacetone (AcAc) is learned. It is used to run finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations,
and to determine the infrared spectra and the hydrogen transfer rates for the three molecules. The
finite-temperature infrared spectrum for MA based on the NN learned on MP2 reference data provides
a realistic representation of the low-frequency modes and the H-transfer band whereas the CH vibrations
are somewhat too high in frequency. For AAA it is demonstrated that the IR spectroscopy is sensitive
to the position of the transferring hydrogen at either the OCH- or OCCH$_3$ end of the molecule. For
the hydrogen transfer rates it is demonstrated that the O-O vibration is a gating mode and largely
determines the rate at which the hydrogen is transferred between the donor and acceptor. Finally,
possibilities to further improve such NN-based potential energy surfaces are explored. They include
the transferability of an NN-learned energy function across chemical species (here methylation)
and transfer learning from a lower level of reference data (MP2) to a higher level of theory (pair
natural orbital-LCCSD(T)).
