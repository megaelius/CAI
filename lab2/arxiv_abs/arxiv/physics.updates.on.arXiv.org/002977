Many investigations and reviews show that II-VI compound semiconductor 1-D nanostructures have
a great potential for the future electronic and optoelectronic applications. As an important II-VI
semiconductor, ZnSe is one of the most significant materials with prominent applications in this
issue. In the present work, we firstly provide a comprehensive investigation of the magnetic properties
like magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of ZnSe nanostructures as a 1-D quantum many body.
The magnetic study of this metal reveals a ferromagnetic-antifferomagnetic transition upon cooling.
Magnetization shows a step-like behavior with pronounced plateaus in a specific magnetic field
interval at low temperature. This subject has not been investigated in the previous works. In the
experimental part, thin films of ZnSe are deposited on glass substrates (at two different substrate
temperature) by the spray pyrolysis technique and annealed in vacuum at $400^\circ$C for 1 hour.
Hereby, we investigate the morphology, structural and optical properties of ZnSe thin films using
field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-vis spectrophotometer
measurements. XRD analysis reveal that annealed films grown on glass substrate at $400^\circ$C
are polycrystalline in nature with cubic zincblene structure. By annealing, the grains size, the
diameter and density of the particles increase. The UV-vis measurements display a red-shift of
the absorption edge from the as-deposited to annealed ZnSe thin films as compared to its value for
the ZnSe thin films. The band-gaps of the annealed samples are estimated about 2.71 eV, which are
in consistence with the band gap of ZnSe thin films. The average transmittance of the annealed samples
are over 80 $\%$ close to the infrared wavelength range.
