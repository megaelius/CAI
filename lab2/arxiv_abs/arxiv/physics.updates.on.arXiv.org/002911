A recent statistical analysis of the relationship between tides and seismic activity in Colombia
has suggested the existence of correlation anomalies for the case intermediate depth events in
the Bucaramanga nest and the Cauca cluster (Moncayo et al., 2018). In this work, we explore in detail
the hypothesis that tides may be triggering seismic activity in these regions and extend the analysis
to two other seismic clusters in the northern part of South America, specifically in the areas of
Puyo (Ecuador) and Pucallpa (Peru). For this purpose, we use the available focal mechanism information
for almost hundred events in the area, and calculate for each event the Tidal Coulomb Failure Stress
(TCFS) as obtained from estimations of the tidal strain tensor. Tidal strains are computed considering
both, the Earth Body Tides (BT) and the effect of the Ocean Tidal Loading (OTL). Since our purpose
is to elucidate the role of tides in earthquake nucleation, calculations of the TCFS are made not
only for the time of earthquake, but also for the time of the closest maximum strain within a window
of a few hours before the events. Our results tend to support the hypothesis that tidal stresses are
contributing to earthquake generation in all the studied areas. Additional tests on the earthquakes
within the Bucaramanga nest indicate that the monthly phase is the main tidal contributor to the
earthquake generation process. Our results are in agreement with the suggestion that in the zones
of seismic clusters, and given their intermediate depth conditions where compressional stresses
are expected (Turcotte and Schubert, 2002), the lunisolar forces may contribute to facilitate
the displacement of blocks, and hence the triggering of seismic activity.
