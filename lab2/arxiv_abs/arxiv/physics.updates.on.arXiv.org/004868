Real-world complex systems always interact with each other, which causes these systems to collapse
in an avalanche or cascading manner in the case of random failures or malicious attacks. The robustness
of multilayer networks has attracted great interest, where the modeling and theoretical studies
of which always rely on the concept of multilayer networks and percolation methods. A straightforward
and tacit assumption is that the interdependence across network layers is strong, which means that
a node will fail entirely with the removal of all links if one of its interdependent neighbours fails.
However, this oversimplification cannot describe the general form of interactions across the
network layers in a real-world multilayer system. In this paper, we reveal the nature of the avalanche
disintegration of general multilayer networks with arbitrary interdependency strength across
network layers. Specifically, we identify that the avalanche process of the whole system can essentially
be decomposed into two microscopic cascading dynamics in terms of the propagation direction of
the failures: depth penetration and scope extension. In the process of depth penetration, the failures
propagate from layer to layer, where the greater the number of failed nodes is, the greater the destructive
power that will emerge in an interdependency group. In the process of scope extension, failures
propagate with the removal of connections in each network layer. Under the synergy of the two processes,
we find that the percolation transition of the system can be discontinuous or continuous with changes
in the interdependency strength across network layers, which means that sudden system-wide collapse
can be avoided by controlling the interdependency strength across network layers.
