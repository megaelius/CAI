In space plasma, various effects of magnetic reconnection and turbulence cause the electron motion
to significantly deviate from their Larmor orbits. Collectively these orbits affect the electron
velocity distribution function and lead to the appearance of the "non-gyrotropic" elements in
the pressure tensor. Quantification of this effect has important applications in space and laboratory
plasma, one of which is tracing the electron diffusion region (EDR) of magnetic reconnection in
space observations. Three different measures of agyrotropy of pressure tensor have previously
been proposed, namely, $A\varnothing_e$, $D_{ng}$ and $Q$. The multitude of contradictory measures
has caused confusion within the community. We revisit the problem by considering the basic properties
an agyrotropy measure should have. We show that $A\varnothing_e$, $D_{ng}$ and $Q$ are all defined
based on the sum of the principle minors (i.e. the rotation invariant $I_2$) of the pressure tensor.
We discuss in detail the problems of $I_2$-based measures and explain why they may produce ambiguous
and biased results. We introduce a new measure $AG$ constructed based on the determinant of the pressure
tensor (i.e. the rotation invariant $I_3$) which does not suffer from the problems of $I_2$-based
measures. We compare $AG$ with other measures in 2 and 3-dimension particle-in-cell magnetic reconnection
simulations, and show that $AG$ can effectively trace the EDR of reconnection in both Harris and
force-free current sheets. On the other hand, $A\varnothing_e$ does not show prominent peaks in
the EDR and part of the separatrix in the force-free reconnection simulations, demonstrating that
$A\varnothing_e$ does not measure all the non-gyrotropic effects in this case, and is not suitable
for studying magnetic reconnection in more general situations other than Harris sheet reconnection.
