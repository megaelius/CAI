We review the dynamical behavior of giant fluid vesicles in various types of external hydrodynamic
flow. The interplay between stresses arising from membrane elasticity, hydrodynamic flows, and
the ever present thermal fluctuations leads to a rich phe- nomenology. In linear flow, the properties
of the tank-treading and tumbling motions are now well described by theoretical and numerical models.
At the transition between these two regimes, strong shape deformations and amplification of thermal
fluctua- tions generate a new regime called trembling. In this regime, the vesicle orientation
oscillates quasi-periodically around the flow direction while asymmetric deformations occur.
For stronger flows, small-wavelength deformations like wrinkles are observed, similar to what
happens in a suddenly reversed elongational flow. In steady elonga- tional flow, vesicles with
large excess areas deform into dumbbells at large flow rates and pearling occurs for even stronger
flows. In capillary flows with parabolic flow profile, single vesicles migrate towards the center
of the channel, where they adopt symmetric shapes, for two reasons. First, walls exert a hydrodynamic
lift force which pushes them away. Second, shear stresses are minimal at the tip of the flow. However,
symmetry is broken for vesicles with large excess areas, which flow off-center and de- form asymmetrically.
In suspensions, hydrodynamic interactions between vesicles add up to these two effects, making
it challenging to deduce rheological properties from the dynamics of individual vesicles. Further
investigations of vesicles and similar objects and their suspensions in steady or time-dependent
flow will shed light on phenomena such as blood flow.
