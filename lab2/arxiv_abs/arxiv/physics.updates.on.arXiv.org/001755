We investigate the formation of opinion against authority in an authoritarian society composed
of agents with different levels of authority. We explore a "dissenting" opinion, held by lower-ranking,
obedient, or less authoritative people, spreading in an environment of an "affirmative" opinion
held by authoritative leaders. A real-world example would be a corrupt society where people revolt
against such leaders, but it can be applied to more general situations. In our model, agents can change
their opinion depending on their authority relative to their neighbors and their own confidence
level. In addition, with a certain probability, agents can override the affirmative opinion to
take the dissenting opinion of a neighbor. Based on analytic derivation and numerical simulations,
we observe that both the network structure and heterogeneity in authority, and their correlation,
significantly affect the possibility of the dissenting opinion to spread through the population.
In particular, the dissenting opinion is suppressed when the authority distribution is very heterogeneous
and there exists a positive correlation between the authority and the number of neighbors of people
(degree). Except for such an extreme case, though, spreading of the dissenting opinion takes place
when people have the tendency to override the authority to hold the dissenting opinion, but the dissenting
opinion can take a long time to spread to the entire society, depending on the model parameters. We
argue that the internal social structure of agents sets the scale of the time to reach consensus,
based on the analysis of the underlying structural properties of opinion spreading.
