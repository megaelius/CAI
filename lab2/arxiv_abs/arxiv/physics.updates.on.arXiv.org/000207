Nano engineered spin degree of freedom in carbon system may offer desired exchange coupling with
optimum spin orbit interaction which is essential, to construct solid state qubits, for fault tolerant
quantum computation. The purpose of this communication is to analyze spin dynamics of, basically,
four types of systems, (i) Graphene (system with inversion symmetry), (ii) Graphene like nanocarbons
(GNCs, broken inversion symmetry and heterostructure, sp2 and sp3, environment), and (iii) their
nitrogen doped derivatives. The spin transport data was obtained using the electron spin resonance
spectroscopy (ESR) technique, carried out over 123 to 473K temperature range. Analysis of shape,
linewidths of dispersion derivatives,, and g factor anisotropy has been carried out. Spin parameters
such as, spin spin relaxation time, spin lattice relaxation time, spin flip parameter,spin relaxation
rate,spin, momentum relaxation rate,pseudo chemical potential, density of states, effective
magnetic moment, spin concentration, defect concentration, and Pauli susceptibility, has been
estimated, and examined for their temperature as well as interdependence. Details of the analysis
are presented. The quantitative study underlined the following facts: (i) by and large, spin dynamics
in Graphene and GNCs is significantly different, (ii) transport of spin behaves in opposite fashion,
after doping nitrogen, in both the systems, (iii) reduction in the magnetization has been observed
for both GNCs and Graphene, after doping nitrogen, (iv) hyperfine interactions have been observed
in all classes of systems except in GNCs, (v) nitrogen doped GNCs seems to be appropriate for qubit
designing.
