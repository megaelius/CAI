Pions were predicted by H. Yukawa as force carriers of the inter-nucleon forces, and were detected
in 1947. Today they are known to be bound states of quarks and anti-quarks of the two lightest flavours.
They satisfy Bose statistics, and are the lightest particles of the strong interaction spectrum.
Determination of the parameters of the Standard Model, including the masses of the lightest quarks,
has only recently reached high precision on the lattice. Pions are also known to be pseudo-Goldstone
bosons of spontaneously broken approximate axial-vector symmetries, and a probe of their properties
and interactions at high precision tests our knowledge of the strong interactions. While also being
a probe of the solution of the strong interactions on the computer, which is known as lattice gauge
theory. Despite their long history, there are significant experimental and theoretical challenges
in determining their properties at high precision. Examples include the lifetime of the neutral
pion, and the status of their masses and decay widths in effective field theories. Pion-pion scattering
has been studied for several decades using general methods of field theory such as dispersion relations
based on analyticity, unitarity and crossing. Knowledge from these theoretical methods are used
to confront high precision experimental data, and to analyze them to extract information on their
scattering and phase shift parameters. This knowledge is crucial for estimating the Standard Model
contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which is being probed at Fermilab in
ongoing experiments. Other sensitive tests include the rare decay of the eta meson into three pions,
which represents an isospin violating decay. The present article briefly reviews these important
developments.
