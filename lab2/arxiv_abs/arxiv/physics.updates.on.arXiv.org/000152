Understanding large scale magnetic field growth in turbulent plasmas in the magnetohydrodynamic
limit is a goal of magnetic dynamo theory. In particular, assessing how well large scale helical
field growth and saturation in simulations matches that predicted by existing theories is important
for progress. Using numerical simulations of isotropically forced turbulence without large scale
shear with the implications, we focus on several aspects of this comparison that have not been previously
tested: (1) Leading mean field dynamo theories which break the field into large and small scales
predict that large scale helical field growth rates are determined by the difference between kinetic
helicity and current helicity with no dependence on the non-helical energy in small scale magnetic
fields. Our simulations show that the growth rate of the large scale field from fully helical forcing
is indeed unaffected by the presence or absence of small scale magnetic fields amplified in a precursor
non-helical dynamo. However, because the precursor non helical dynamo in our simulations produced
fields that were strongly sub-equipartition with respect to the kinetic energy, we cannot yet rule
out the potential influence of stronger non- helical small scale fields. (2) We have identified
two features in our simulations which cannot be explained by the most minimalist versions of two-scale
mean field theory: (i) fully helical small scale forcing produces significant non-helical large
scale magnetic energy and (ii) the saturation of the large scale field growth is time-delayed with
respect to what minimalist theory predicts. We comment on desirable generalizations to the theory
in this context and future desired work.
