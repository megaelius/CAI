Electron microscopy is a powerful tool for visualizing the shapes of sub-nanometer objects. However,
contrast is not in proportional to density distribution, and therefore achieving a quantitative
understanding of specimens is not straightforward, especially for low-contrast subjects such
as biological specimens. To overcome this problem, we have developed a new phase-contrast scanning
transmission electron microscope (STEM) in which a probe beam formed with an amplitude Fresnel
zone plate (FZP) and the resulting interference patterns produced by the zeroth and first order
diffracted waves generated by the FZP are detected. We name it FZP-PC-STEM hereinafter. The amplitude
FZP was manufactured by using focused ion beam (FIB) equipment, and the diffraction data were collected
by using diffraction imaging technique. The validity of our proposed optical model was confirmed
by comparing experimental and simulated images. Observations of carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles
by this method showed that the contrast of low-spatial-frequency components in the CNT image was
enhanced, unlike the case in conventional bright-field STEM. This method does not, in principle,
require the post-image processing used in the diffraction imaging method, and it can be easily introduced
into a conventional STEM system without major modifications. The stability and robustness of the
method toward intense electron irradiation during long-time operation were also confirmed. We
expect that the FZP-PC-STEM will be widely applicable to quantitative observations of radiation-sensitive
light-element specimens, with simple and easy operation.
