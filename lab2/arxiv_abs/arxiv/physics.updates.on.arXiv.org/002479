In light of the increasingly strong violations of the Higgs naturalness principle revealed at the
LHC, we examine the assumptions underlying one influential argument for naturalness in the sense
that prohibits fine-tuning of bare Standard Model (SM) parameters. We highlight the dependence
of this argument on the interpretation of these bare parameters as "fundamental parameters," by
direct physical analogy with the interpretation of microscopic lattice parameters in condensed
matter physics. We emphasize that while the notion of fundamental parameters is appropriate to
some applications in condensed matter physics, it plays no essential role in the effective field
theories (EFT's) of high-energy physics. We distinguish two ways of understanding high-energy
EFT's within the Wilsonian framework, the first of which takes an EFT to be uniquely defined by a single
set of physical, fundamental bare parameters, and the second of which dispenses entirely with the
notion of fundamental parameters. In this latter view, an EFT is instead defined by a one-parameter
class of physically equivalent parametrizations related by Wilsonian renormalization group
flows. From this perspective, the delicate cancellation between bare Higgs mass and quantum corrections
appears as an eliminable artifact of mathematical convention, rather than as a physical coincidence
calling out for explanation by a deeper theory. Thus, we aim to clarify the distinction between two
physical interpretations of Wilsonian EFT's and bare parameters in high energy physics, and to
show in light of this distinction how one formulation of the naturalness requirement, based on the
notion that bare parameters at an EFT's physical cutoff constitute "fundamental parameters,"
may be rooted in an excessively literal reading of the high-energy/condensed-matter analogy.
