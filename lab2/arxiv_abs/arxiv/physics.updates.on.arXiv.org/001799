The time-dependent equations of computational electrodynamics (CED) are evolved consistent
with the divergence constraints. As a result, there has been a recent effort to design finite volume
time domain (FVTD) and discontinuous Galerkin time domain (DGTD) schemes that satisfy the same
constraints and, nevertheless, draw on recent advances in higher order Godunov methods. This paper
catalogues the first step in the design of globally constraint-preserving DGTD schemes. The algorithms
presented here are based on a novel DG-like method that is applied to a Yee-type staggering of the
electromagnetic field variables in the faces of the mesh. The other two novel building blocks of
the method include constraint-preserving reconstruction of the electromagnetic fields and multidimensional
Riemann solvers; both of which have been developed in recent years by the first author. We carry out
a von Neumann stability analysis of the entire suite of DGTD schemes for CED at orders of accuracy
ranging from second to fourth. A von Neumann stability analysis gives us the maximal CFL numbers
that can be sustained by the DGTD schemes presented here at all orders. It also enables us to understand
the wave propagation characteristics of the schemes in various directions on a Cartesian mesh.
We find that the CFL of DGTD schemes decreases with increasing order. To counteract that, we also
present constraint-preserving PNPM schemes for CED. We find that the third and fourth order constraint-preserving
DGTD and P1PM schemes have some extremely attractive properties when it comes to low-dispersion,
low-dissipation propagation of electromagnetic waves in multidimensions. Numerical accuracy
tests are also provided to support the von Neumann stability analysis.
