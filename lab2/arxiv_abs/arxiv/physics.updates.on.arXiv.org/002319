Benchmarking and validation are prerequisite for using simulation codes as predictive tools.
In this work, we have developed a Global Model for Negative Hydrogen Ion Source (GMNHIS) and performed
benchmarking of GMNHIS against another independently developed code, Global Enhanced Vibrational
Kinetic Model (GEVKM). This is the first study to present quite comprehensive benchmarking test
of this kind for models of negative hydrogen ion sources (NHIS), and very good agreement has been
achieved for electron temperature, vibrational distribution function (VDF) of hydrogen molecules,
and n_H^-/n_e ratio. The small discrepancies in number densities of negative hydrogen ions, positive
ions, as well as hydrogen atoms can be attributed to the differences in the predicted electron number
density for given discharge power. Higher electron number density obtained with GMNHIS is possibly
due to fewer dissociation channels accounted for in GMNHIS, leading to smaller energy loss. In addition,
we validated GMNHIS against experimental data obtained in an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR)
discharge used for H^- production. The model qualitatively (and even quantitatively for certain
conditions) reproduces the experimental H^- number density. The H^- number density as a function
of pressure first increases at pressures below 12 mTorr, and then saturates for higher pressures.
This dependence was analyzed by evaluating contributions from different reaction pathways to
the creation and loss of the H^- ions. The developed codes can be used for predicting the H^- production,
improving the performance of NHIS, and ultimately optimizing the parameters of negative ion beams
for ITER.
