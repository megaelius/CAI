Non-Markovian quantum evolution of the electronic subsystem in a laser-driven molecule is characterized
through the appearance of negative decoherence rates in the canonical form of the electronic master
equation. For a driven molecular system described in a bipartite Hilbert space H=Hel x Hvib of dimension
2 x Nv, we derive the canonical form of the electronic master equation, deducing the canonical measures
of non-Markovianity and the Bloch volume of accessible states. We find that one of the decoherence
rates is always negative, accounting for the inherent non-Markovian character of the electronic
evolution in the vibrational environment. Enhanced non-Markovian behavior, characterized by
two negative decoherence rates, appears if there is a coupling between the electronic states g,
e, such that the evolution of the electronic populations obeys d(PgPe)/dt > 0. Non-Markovianity
of the electronic evolution is analyzed in relation to temporal behaviors of the electronic-vibrational
entanglement and electronic coherence, showing that enhanced non-Markovian behavior accompanies
entanglement increase. Taking as an example the coupling of two electronic states by a laser pulse
in the Cs2 molecule, we analyze non-Markovian dynamics under laser pulses of various strengths,
finding that the weaker pulse stimulates the bigger amount of non-Markovianity. We show that increase
of the electronic-vibrational entanglement over a time interval is correlated to the growth of
the total amount of non-Markovianity calculated over the same interval using canonical measures
and connected with the increase of the Bloch volume. After the pulse, non-Markovian behavior is
correlated to electronic coherence, such that vibrational motion in the electronic potentials
which diminishes the nuclear overlap, implicitly increasing the linear entropy of entanglement,
brings a memory character to dynamics.
