It is known that unconfined dust explosions consist of a relatively weak primary (turbulent) deflagrations
followed by a devastating secondary explosion. The secondary explosion may propagate with a speed
of up to 1000 m/s producing overpressures of over 8-10 atm. Since detonation is the only established
theory that allows a rapid burning producing a high pressure that can be sustained in open areas,
the generally accepted view was that the mechanism explaining the high rate of combustion in dust
explosions is deflagration to detonation transition. In the present work we propose a theoretical
substantiation of the alternative propagation mechanism explaining origin of the secondary explosion
producing the high speeds of combustion and high overpressures in unconfined dust explosions.
We show that clustering of dust particles in a turbulent flow gives rise to a significant increase
of the thermal radiation absorption length ahead of the advancing flame front. This effect ensures
that clusters of dust particles are exposed to and heated by the radiation from hot combustion products
of large gaseous explosions sufficiently long time to become multi-point ignition kernels in a
large volume ahead of the advancing flame front. The ignition times of fuel-air mixture by the radiatively
heated clusters of particles is considerably reduced compared to the ignition time by the isolated
particle. The radiation-induced multi-point ignitions of a large volume of fuel-air ahead of the
primary flame efficiently increase the total flame area, giving rise to the secondary explosion,
which results in high rates of combustion and overpressures required to account for the observed
level of overpressures and damages in unconfined dust explosions, such as e.g. the 2005 Buncefield
explosion and several vapor cloud explosions of severity similar to that of the Buncefield incident.
