We synthesise and deposit on a substrate monoatomic chains of carbon atoms stabilised by gold nanoparticles.
Raman, absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra reveal resonant features of straight polyyne
chains, that is significantly beyond the theoretical stability limit of 6 atoms for free-standing
carbon chains. Polyyne is a direct band gap semiconductor whose lowest energy optical transition
varies in the range between 2 and 5 eV depending on the number of atoms in the chain. Low temperature
PL spectra reveal a characteristic triplet fine-structure that repeats itself for carbon chains
of different lengths. The triplet is invariably composed by a sharp intense peak accompanied by
two broader satellites shifted by about 15 and 25 meV to the lower energy side of the main peak. We interpret
these features as an edge-state neutral exciton, positively and negatively charged trions, respectively.
The localization of exciton wave-functions at the end of gold-stabilised carbon chains is confirmed
by ab-initio calculations. The time-resolved PL shows that the radiative life time of the observed
quasiparticles is about 1 ns that is consistent with the characteristic exciton lifetimes in carbon
nanotubes (CNT). The radiative lifetime increases with the increase of the length of the chain.
At high temperatures a non-radiative exciton decay channel appears due to the termal hopping of
carriers between parallel carbon chains. In contrast to CNT excitons, the excitons in carbyne are
characterised by lower binding energies (of the order of 15-20 meV), large oscillator strengths
and extremely low inhomogeneous broadenings that allow for the detection of the fine structure
of exciton and trion transitions. The observation of strong and narrow exciton resonances in PL
spectra of monoatomic carbon chains paves the way to their applications in nano-lasers and single
photon emitters.
