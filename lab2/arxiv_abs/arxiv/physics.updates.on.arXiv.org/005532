The recent advent of high precision antihydrogen spectroscopy opens the way to stringent experimental
tests of the fundamental principles underlying particle physics and general relativity (GR),
such as Lorentz and CPT invariance and the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP), on pure antimatter
systems. In this paper, the nature and implications of these tests is investigated, with special
reference to the ALPHA antihydrogen programme at CERN. This is underpinned by a theoretical review
of the role of antiparticles, causality and fundamental symmetries in relativistic quantum field
theory (QFT) and the theory of time measurement in GR. Low-energy effective theories which break
Lorentz and CPT symmetry, or the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP), are then introduced, together
with a review of several `fifth force' scenarios involving new long-range forces which would effectively
violate the universality of free-fall, or Weak Equivalence Principle (WEPff). The possible role
of CPT violation in determining the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe is discussed.
Explicit calculations are given for the dependence on possible Lorentz and CPT violating couplings
of the transition frequencies amongst the 1S, 2S and 2P hyperfine states measured in the magnetic
field of the ALPHA trap and the resulting bounds are compared with existing limits. An analysis of
the implications for the EEP of current free-fall and spectroscopic measurements with antihydrogen
is presented and existing and potential bounds on WEPff and the universality of clocks (WEPc) are
derived, together with constraints on fifth forces. Future prospects for high-precision antihydrogen
spectroscopy, free-fall and gravitational redshift experiments, and anti-atom matter-wave
interferometry are described and experimental possibilities involving other antimatter species
are briefly outlined.
