The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe, the dynamics of the supernovae
that produced the heavy elements necessary for life, and whether protons eventually decay -- these
mysteries at the forefront of particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early
evolution of our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. DUNE is an international world-class
experiment dedicated to addressing these questions as it searches for leptonic charge-parity
symmetry violation, stands ready to capture supernova neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon
decay as a signature of a grand unified theory underlying the standard model. Central to achieving
DUNE's physics program is a far detector that combines the many tens-of-kiloton fiducial mass necessary
for rare event searches with sub-centimeter spatial resolution in its ability to image those events,
allowing identification of the physics signatures among the numerous backgrounds. In the single-phase
liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) technology, ionization charges drift horizontally
in the liquid argon under the influence of an electric field towards a vertical anode, where they
are read out with fine granularity. A photon detection system supplements the TPC, directly enhancing
physics capabilities for all three DUNE physics drivers and opening up prospects for further physics
explorations. The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE physics program
and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE liquid argon TPC far detector modules.
Volume IV presents an overview of the basic operating principles of a single-phase LArTPC, followed
by a description of the DUNE implementation. Each of the subsystems is described in detail, connecting
the high-level design requirements and decisions to the overriding physics goals of DUNE.
