Objective: The utility of fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring can only be achieved with an acquisition
sampling rate that preserves the underlying physiological information on the millisecond time
scale (1000 Hz rather than 4 Hz). For such acquisition, fetal ECG (fECG) is required, rather than
the ultrasound to derive FHR. We tested one recently developed algorithm, SAVER, and two widely
applied algorithms to extract fECG from a single channel maternal ECG signal recorded over the xyphoid
process rather than the routine abdominal signal. Approach: At 126dG, ECG was attached to near-term
ewe and fetal shoulders, manubrium and xyphoid processes (n=12). FECG served as the ground-truth
to which the fetal ECG signal extracted from the simultaneously-acquired maternal ECG was compared.
All fetuses were in good health during surgery (pH 7.29+/-0.03, pO2 33.2+/-8.4, pCO2 56.0+/-7.8,
O2Sat 78.3+/-7.6, lactate 2.8+/-0.6, BE -0.3+/-2.4). Main result: In all animals, single lead
fECG extraction algorithm could not extract fECG from the maternal ECG signal over the xyphoid process
with the F1 less than 50%. Significance: The applied fECG extraction algorithms might be unsuitable
for the maternal ECG signal over the xyphoid process, or the latter does not contain strong enough
fECG signal, although the lead is near the mother's abdomen. Fetal sheep model is widely used to mimic
various fetal conditions, yet ECG recordings in a public data set form are not available to test the
predictive ability of fECG and FHR. We are making this data set openly available to other researchers
to foster non-invasive fECG acquisition in this animal model.
