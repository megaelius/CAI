Heart muscle contraction is normally activated by a synchronized Ca release from sarcoplasmic
reticulum (SR), a major intracellular Ca store. However, under abnormal conditions Ca leaks from
the SR, decreasing heart contraction amplitude and increasing risk of life-threatening arrhythmia.
The mechanisms and regimes of SR operation generating the abnormal Ca leak remain unclear. Here
we employed both numerical and analytical modeling to get mechanistic insights into the emergent
Ca leak phenomenon. Our numerical simulations using a detailed realistic model of Ca release unit
(CRU) reveal sharp transitions resulting in Ca leak. The emergence of leak is closely mapped mathematically
to the Ising model from statistical mechanics. The system steady-state behavior is determined
by two aggregate parameters: the analogues of magnetic field ($h$) and the inverse temperature
($\beta$) in the Ising model, for which we have explicit formulas in terms of SR Ca and release channel
opening/closing rates. The classification of leak regimes takes the shape of a phase $\beta$-$h$
diagram, with the regime boundaries occurring at $h$=0 and a critical value of $\beta$ ($\beta*$)
which we estimate using a classical Ising model and mean field theory. Our theory predicts that a
synchronized Ca leak will occur when $h$>0 and $\beta>\beta*$ and a disordered leak occurs when
$\beta<\beta*$ and $h$ is not too negative. The disorder leak is distinguished from synchronized
leak (in long-lasting sparks) by larger Peierls contour lengths, an output parameter reflecting
degree of disorder. Thus, in addition to our detailed numerical model approach we also offer an instantaneous
computational tool using analytical formulas of the Ising model for respective RyR parameters
and SR Ca load that describe and classify phase transitions and leak emergence.
