The novel MPGD-based photon detectors of COMPASS RICH-1 consist of large-size hybrid MPGDs with
multi-layer architecture including two layers of Thick-GEMs and a bulk resistive MicroMegas.
The top surface of the first THGEM is coated with a CsI film which also acts as photo-cathode. These
detectors have been successfully in operation at COMPASS since 2016. Concerning bias-voltage
supply, the Thick-GEMs are segmented in order to reduce the energy released in case of occasional
discharges, while the MicroMegas anode is segmented into pads individually biased with positive
voltage while the micromesh is grounded. In total, there are about ten different electrode types
and more than 20000 electrodes supplied by more than 100 HV channels, where appropriate correlations
among the applied voltages are required for the correct operation of the detectors. Therefore,
a robust control system is mandatory, implemented by a custom designed software package, while
commercial power supply units are used. This sophisticated control system allows to protect the
detectors against errors by the operator, to monitor and log voltages and currents at 1 Hz rate, and
automatically react to detector misbehaviour. In addition, a voltage compensation system has
been developed to automatically adjust the biasing voltage according to environmental pressure
and temperature variations, to achieve constant gain over time. This development answers to a more
general need. In fact, voltage compensation is always a requirement for the stability of gaseous
detectors and its need is enhanced in multi-layer ones. In this paper, the HV system and its performance
are described in details, as well as the stability of the novel MPGD-based photon detectors during
the physics data taking at COMPASS.
