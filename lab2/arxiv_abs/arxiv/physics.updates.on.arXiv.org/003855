Implementing multicomponent diffusion models in reacting-flow simulations is computationally
expensive due to the challenges involved in calculating diffusion coefficients. Instead, mixture-averaged
diffusion treatments are typically used to avoid these costs. However, to our knowledge, the accuracy
and appropriateness of the mixture-averaged diffusion models has not been verified for three-dimensional
turbulent premixed flames. In this study we propose a fast, efficient, low-memory algorithm and
use that to evaluate the role of multicomponent mass diffusion in reacting-flow simulations. Direct
numerical simulation of these flames is performed by implementing the Stefan-Maxwell equations
in NGA. A semi-implicit algorithm decreases the computational expense of inverting the full multicomponent
ordinary diffusion array while maintaining accuracy and fidelity. We demonstrate the algorithm
to be stable, and its performance scales approximately with the number of species squared. We first
verify the method by performing one-dimensional simulations of premixed hydrogen flames and compare
with matching cases in Cantera. As an initial study of multicomponent diffusion, we simulate premixed,
three-dimensional turbulent hydrogen flames, neglecting secondary Soret and Dufour effects.
Simulation conditions are carefully selected to match previously published results and ensure
valid comparison. Our results show that using the mixture-averaged diffusion assumption lead
to a 15% under-prediction of the normalized turbulent flame speed for premixed hydrogen air flames.
This large difference in the turbulent flame speed raises questions on the appropriateness of using
the mixture-averaged diffusion assumption for DNS of moderate to high Karlovitz number flames.
