We design and characterize a novel axilens-based diffractive optics platform that flexibly combines
efficient point focusing and grating selectivity and is compatible with scalable top-down fabrication
based on a 4-level phase mask configuration. This is achieved using phase-modulated compact axilens
devices that simultaneously focus incident radiation of selected wavelengths at predefined locations
with larger focal depths compared to traditional Fresnel lenses. In addition, the proposed devices
are polarization insensitive and maintain a large focusing efficiency over a broad spectral band.
Specifically, here we discuss and characterize modulated axilens configurations designed for
long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) in the $6~\mu$m--12~$\mu$m wavelength range and in the $4~\mu$m--6~$\mu$m
mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) range. These devices are ideally suited for monolithic integration
atop the substrate layers of infrared focal plane arrays (IR-FPAs) and for use as compact microspectrometers.
We systematically study their focusing efficiency, spectral response, and cross talk ratio, and
we demonstrate linear control of multi-wavelength focusing on a single plane. Our design method
leverages Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (RS) diffraction theory and is validated numerically using the
Finite Element Method (FEM). Finally, we demonstrate the application of spatially modulated axilenses
to the realization of compact, single-lens spectrometer. By optimizing our devices, we achieve
a minimum distinguishable wavelength interval of $\Delta\lambda=240nm$ at $\lambda_0=8{\mu}m$
and $\Delta\lambda=165nm$ at $\lambda_0=5{\mu}m$. The proposed devices add fundamental spectroscopic
capabilities to compact imaging devices for a number of applications ranging from spectral sorting
to LWIR and MWIR phase contrast imaging and detection.
