Recently, there has been growing interest and effort in developing high-speed high-precision
3D imaging technologies for a wide range of industrial, automotive and biomedical applications.
Optical frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) light detection and ranging (LiDAR), which
shares the same working principle as swept-source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT), is an
emerging 3D surface imaging technology that offers higher sensitivity and resolution than conventional
time-of-flight (ToF) ranging. Recently, with the development of high-performance swept sources
with meter-scale instantaneous coherence lengths, the imaging range of both OCT and FMCW has been
significantly improved. However, due to the limited bandwidth of current generation digitizers
and the speed limitations of beam steering using mechanical scanners, long range OCT and FMCW typically
suffer from a low 3D frame rate (<1Hz), which greatly restricts their applications in imaging dynamic
or moving objects. In this work, we report a high-speed FMCW based 3D surface imaging system, combining
a grating for beam steering with a compressed time-frequency analysis approach for depth retrieval.
We thoroughly investigate the localization accuracy and precision of our system both theoretically
and experimentally. Finally, we demonstrate 3D surface imaging results of multiple static and
moving objects, including a flexing human hand. The demonstrated technique performs 3D surface
imaging with submillimeter localization accuracy over a tens-of-centimeter imaging range with
an overall depth voxel acquisition rate of 7.6 MHz, enabling densely sampled 3D surface imaging
at video rate.
