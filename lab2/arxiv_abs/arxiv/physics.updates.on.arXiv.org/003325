A model-independent first-principle first-order investigation of the shape of turbulent density-power
spectra in the ion-inertial range of the solar wind at 1 AU is presented. De-magnetised ions in the
ion-inertial range of quasi-neutral plasmas respond to Kolmogorov (K) or Iroshnikov-Kraichnan
(IK) inertial-range velocity turbulence power spectra via the spectrum of the velocity-turbulence-related
random-mean-square induction-electric field. Maintenance of electrical quasi-neutrality
by the ions causes deformations in the power spectral density of the turbulent density fluctuations.
Kolmogorov inertial range spectra in solar wind velocity turbulence and observations of density
power spectra suggest that the occasionally observed scale-limited bumps in the density-power
spectrum may be traced back to the electric ion response. Magnetic power spectra react passively
to the density spectrum by warranting pressure balance. This approach still neglects contribution
of Hall currents and is restricted to the ion-inertial range scale. While both density and magnetic
turbulence spectra in the affected range of ion-inertial scales deviate from Kolmogorov or Iroshnikov-Kraichnan,
the velocity turbulence preserves its inertial range shape in this process to which spectral advection
turns out to be secondary but may become observable under special external conditions. One such
case observed by WIND is analysed. We discuss various aspects of this effect including the affected
wavenumber scale range, dependence on angle between mean flow velocity and wavenumber and, for
a radially expanding solar wind flow when assuming adiabatic expansion at fast solar wind speeds
and a Parker dependence of the solar wind magnetic field on radius, also the presumable limitations
on the radial location of the turbulent source region.
