Physics-based simulations are often used to model and understand complex physical systems and
processes in domains like fluid dynamics. Such simulations, although used frequently, have many
limitations which could arise either due to the inability to accurately model a physical process
owing to incomplete knowledge about certain facets of the process or due to the underlying process
being too complex to accurately encode into a simulation model. In such situations, it is often useful
to rely on machine learning methods to fill in the gap by learning a model of the complex physical process
directly from simulation data. However, as data generation through simulations is costly, we need
to develop models, being cognizant of data paucity issues. In such scenarios it is often helpful
if the rich physical knowledge of the application domain is incorporated in the architectural design
of machine learning models. Further, we can also use information from physics-based simulations
to guide the learning process using aggregate supervision to favorably constrain the learning
process. In this paper, we propose PhyDNN, a deep learning model using physics-guided structural
priors and physics-guided aggregate supervision for modeling the drag forces acting on each particle
in a Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method(CFD-DEM). We conduct extensive experiments
in the context of drag force prediction and showcase the usefulness of including physics knowledge
in our deep learning formulation both in the design and through learning process. Our proposed PhyDNN
model has been compared to several state-of-the-art models and achieves a significant performance
improvement of 8.46% on average across all baseline models. The source code has been made available
and the dataset used is detailed in [1, 2].
