We report the results of molecular dynamics simulations of the properties of a pseudo-atom model
of dodecane thiol ligated 5-nm diameter gold nanoparticles (AuNP) in vacuum as a function of ligand
coverage and particle separation in three state of aggregation: the isolated AuNP, an isolated
pair of AuNPs and a square assembly of AuNPs. Our calculations show that for all values of the coverage
the ligand density along a radius emanating from the core of an isolated AuNP oscillates along the
chain up to the fourth pseudo-atom, then smoothly decays to zero. We examine the ligand envelope
as a function of the coverage and demonstrate that the deformation of that envelope generated by
interaction between the NPs is coverage-dependent, so that the shape, depth and position of the
minimum of the potential of mean force displays a systematic dependence on the coverage. We propose
an accurate analytical description of the calculated potential of mean force with parameters that
scale linearly with the ligand coverage. We define and calculate an effective pair potential of
mean force for a square configuration of particles; our definition contains, implicitly, both
the three- and four-particle contributions to deviation from additivity. We find that the effective
pair potential of mean force in this configuration has a different minimum and a different well depth
than the isolated pair potential of mean force. Previous work has found that the three-particle
contribution to deviation from additivity is monotone repulsive, whereas we find that the combined
three- and four-particle contributions have an attractive well, implying that the three- and four-particle
contributions are of comparable magnitude but opposite sign, thereby suggesting that even higher
order correction terms likely play a significant role in the behavior of assemblies of many nanoparticles.
