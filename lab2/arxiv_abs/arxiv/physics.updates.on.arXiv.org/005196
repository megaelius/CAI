Floquet-Bloch wave asymptotics is used to homogenize the in-plane mechanical response of a lattice
grid of elastic Rayleigh rods, possessing a distributed mass density together with a rotational
inertia and subject to incremental dynamics, superimposed to a given state of axial loading of arbitrary
magnitude. In contrast to the quasi-static energy match (addressed in Part I of the present study),
the vibrational properties of the lattice are directly represented by the acoustic tensor of the
equivalent solid, without passing through the constitutive tensor which is instead arrived via
energy equivalency. The acoustic tensor is shown to result independent of the rods' rotational
inertia and allows directly the analysis of strong ellipticity of the equivalent continuum, evidencing
coincidence with macro-bifurcation in the lattice. On the other hand, the dynamics of micro-bifurcation
corresponds to a vanishing frequency, at finite wavelength, of the lowest dispersion branch of
the lattice. Dynamic homogenization reveals the structure of the acoustic branches close to ellipticity
loss, and of forced vibrations (both in physical space and Fourier space) showing low-frequency
wave localizations. A comparison between the strain localization occurring near ellipticity
loss and the forced vibration of the lattice, both corresponding to the application of a concentrated
pulsating force, shows that the homogenization technique allows an almost perfect representation
of the lattice. Therefore, the presented results pave the way for the design of architected cellular
materials to be used in applications where extreme deformation are involved.
