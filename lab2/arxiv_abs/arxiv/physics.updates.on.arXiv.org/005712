[Objective] To develop a CAD system for proximal femoral fracture for plain frontal hip radiographs
by CNN trained on a large dataset collected at multiple institutions. And, the possibility of the
diagnosis rate improvement of the proximal femoral fracture by the resident using this CAD system
as an aid of the diagnosis. [Materials and methods] In total, 4851 cases of proximal femoral fracture
patients who visited each institution between 2009 and 2019 were included. 5242 plain pelvic radiographs
were extracted from a DICOM server, and a total of 10484 images(5242 with fracture and 5242 without
fracture) were used for machine learning. A CNN approach was used. We used the EffectiventNet-B4
framework with Pytorch 1.3 and Fast.ai 1.0. In the final evaluation, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
F-value, and AUC were evaluated. Grad-CAM was used to conceptualize the basis of the diagnosis by
the CAD system. For 31 residents and 4 orthopedic surgeons, the image diagnosis test was carried
out for 600 photographs of proximal femoral fracture randomly extracted from test image data set.
And, diagnosis rate in the situation with/without the diagnosis support by the CAD system were evaluated
respectively. [Results] The diagnostic accuracy of the learning model was 96.1%, sensitivity
95.2%, specificity 96.9%, F value 0.961, and AUC 0.99. Grad-CAM was used to show the most accurate
diagnosis. In the image diagnosis test, the resident acquired the diagnostic ability equivalent
to that of the orthopedic surgeon by using the diagnostic aid of the CAD system. [Conclusions] The
CAD system using AI for the proximal femoral fracture which we developed could offer the diagnosis
reason, and it became an image diagnosis tool with the high diagnosis accuracy. And, the possibility
of contributing to the diagnosis rate improvement was considered in the field of actual clinical
environment such as emergency room.
