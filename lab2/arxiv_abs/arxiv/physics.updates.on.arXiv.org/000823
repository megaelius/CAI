Fermi operator expansion (FOE) methods are powerful alternatives to diagonalization type methods
for solving Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT). One example is the pole expansion and
selected inversion (PEXSI) method, which approximates the Fermi operator by rational matrix functions
and reduces the computational complexity to at most quadratic scaling for solving KSDFT. Unlike
diagonalization type methods, the chemical potential often cannot be directly read off from the
result of a single step of evaluation of the Fermi operator. Hence multiple evaluations are needed
to be sequentially performed to compute the chemical potential to ensure the correct number of electrons
within a given tolerance. This hinders the performance of FOE methods in practice. In this paper
we develop an efficient and robust strategy to determine the chemical potential in the context of
the PEXSI method. The main idea of the new method is not to find the exact chemical potential at each
self-consistent-field (SCF) iteration iteration, but to dynamically and rigorously update the
upper and lower bounds for the true chemical potential, so that the chemical potential reaches its
convergence along the SCF iteration. Instead of evaluating the Fermi operator for multiple times
sequentially, our method uses a two-level strategy that evaluates the Fermi operators in parallel.
In the regime of full parallelization, the wall clock time of each SCF iteration is always close to
the time for one single evaluation of the Fermi operator, even when the initial guess is far away from
the converged solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method using examples with
metallic and insulating characters, as well as results from ab initio molecular dynamics.
