We point out that in models of macroscopic topological defects composed of one or more scalar fields
that interact with standard-model fields via scalar-type couplings, the back-action of ambient
matter on the scalar field(s) produces an environmental dependence of the fundamental constants
of nature, as well as spatial variations of the fundamental constants in the vicinity of dense bodies
such as Earth. In sufficiently dense environments, spontaneous symmetry breaking may be inhibited
altogether for $\phi^2$ interactions, potentially delaying the cosmological production of topological
defects. We derive bounds on non-transient variations of the fundamental constants from torsion-pendulum
experiments that search for equivalence-principle-violating forces, experiments comparing
the frequencies of ground- and space-based atomic clocks, as well as ground-based clocks at different
heights in the recent Tokyo Skytree experiment, and measurements comparing atomic and molecular
transition frequencies in terrestrial and low-density astrophysical environments. Our results
constrain the present-day mass-energy fraction of the Universe due to a network of infinite domain
walls produced shortly after the BBN or CMB epochs to be $\Omega_{\textrm{walls},0} \ll 10^{-10}$
for the symmetron model with a $\phi^4$ potential and $\phi^2$ interactions, improving over CMB
quadrupolar temperature anisotropy bounds by at least 5 orders of magnitude. Our newly derived
bounds on domain walls with $\phi^2$ interactions via their effects of non-transient variations
of the fundamental constants are significantly more stringent than previously reported clock-
and cavity-based limits on passing domain walls via transient signatures and previous bounds from
different types of non-transient signatures, under the same set of assumptions.
