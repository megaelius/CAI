In the framework of density functional theory (DFT), the lowest triplet excitation energies, E{_T},
can be evaluated using multiple formulations, the most straightforward of which are unrestricted
ground state DFT (UDFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). Assuming the exact exchange-correlation
(XC) functional is applied, both formulations should provide identical values for E{_T}, which
is a constraint that approximate XC functionals should obey. However, this condition is not satisfied
by most commonly used XC functionals, resulting in inaccurate predictions of low-lying, photochemically
important excited states, such as the lowest triplet (T{_1}) and singlet (S{_1}) excited states.
In the present study, we propose a novel and non-empirical prescription to approximate the exact
XC functional, referred to as "triplet tuning", by enforcing the aforementioned agreement of E{_T}
between UDFT and TDDFT. This scheme allows us to construct the XC functional on a case-by-case basis
using the molecular structure as the exclusive input, without fitting to any experimental data.
The first triplet-tuned XC functional, TT-{\omega}PBEh, is formulated as a long-range-corrected
(LRC) hybrid and tested on four test sets of large organic molecules. TT-{\omega}PBEh manages to
provide more accurate predictions for key observables in photochemical measurements, including
but not limited to E{_T}, optical band gaps (E{_S}), singlet-triplet gaps ({\Delta}E{_ST}), and
ionization potentials (I). This promising triplet tuning scheme can be applied to a wide range of
systems, as it adjusts the effective electron-hole interactions to arrive at the correct excitation
energies.
