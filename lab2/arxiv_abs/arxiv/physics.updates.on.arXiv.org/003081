Identifying the key microstructure representations is crucial for Computational Materials Design
(CMD). However, existing microstructure characterization and reconstruction (MCR) techniques
have limitations to be applied for materials design. Model-based MCR approaches do not have parameters
that can serve as design variables, while MCR techniques that rely on dimension reduction tend to
lose important microstructural information. In this work, we present a deep adversarial learning
methodology that overcomes the limitations of existing MCR techniques. In the proposed methodology,
generative adversarial networks (GAN) are trained to learn the mapping between latent variables
and microstructures. Thereafter, the low-dimensional latent variables serve as design variables,
and a Bayesian optimization framework is applied to obtain microstructures with desired material
property. Due to the special design of the network architecture, the proposed methodology is able
to identify the latent (design) variables with desired dimensionality, as well as minimize the
information loss even for complex material microstructures. The validity of the proposed methodology
is tested numerically on a synthetic microstructure dataset and its effectiveness for materials
design is evaluated through a case study of optimizing optical performance for energy absorption.
In addition, the scalability and transferability of proposed methodology are also demonstrated
in this work. Specifically, the proposed methodology is scalable to generate arbitrary sized microstructures,
and it can serve as a pre-trained model to improve the performance of a structure-property predictive
model via transfer learning.
