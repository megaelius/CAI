We investigate the statistical mechanics of a family of two dimensional (2D) fluid flows, described
by the generalized Euler equations, or {\alpha}-models. We aim to study the equilibrium mechanics,
using initially a point-vortex approximation and then exploiting the full continuous equations,
invoking the maximization of appropriate entropy functionals. The point-vortex approximation
highlights an important difference between the 2D turbulence and local dynamics models. In the
latter, it is in fact possible to derive a statistical measure only considering two conserved quantities
as constraints for the maximization problem, the Hamiltonian and the angular impulse. This result
does not hold for 2D turbulence. Both the continuous and the point vortex approximation allow for
the derivation of mean field equations that act as constraints for the functional relation between
the streamfunction and the active scalar of the model considered. Further, the analysis of the continuous
equations suggests the existence of a selective decay principle for the whole family of models.
To test these ideas we use numerical simulations of the partial differential equations of the {\alpha}-models
starting from different sets of initial conditions (i.c.s). For random i.c.s, all the solutions
tend to a dipolar structure. The functional relation between the active scalar and the streamfunction
shows an increase of nonlinearity with a decrease of the locality of the dynamics. We then test the
evolution of the specific case of SQG for i.c.s in the form of a hyperbolic saddle, that is a candidate
for the possible formation of singularity through a self-similar cascade though secondary instabilities.
Results show the presence of a scale dependent selective decay associated to the breaking of the
frontal structures emerging from the flow, suggesting a relation with the change of topology of
the flow.
