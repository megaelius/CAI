In this paper, the collective dynamics of the large aspect ratio dusty plasma is studied over a wide
range of discharge parameters. An inductively coupled diffused plasma, which creates an electrostatic
trap to confine the negatively charged grains, is used to form a large volume (or large aspect ratio)
dusty plasma at low pressure. For introducing the dust grains into the potential well, a unique technique
using a secondary DC glow discharge plasma is employed. The dust dynamics is recorded in a 2-dimension
(2D) plane at a given axial location. The dust fluid exhibits wave like behavior at low pressure (p
< 0.06 mbar) and high rf power (P > 3 W). The mixed motion, waves and vortices, are observed at an intermediate
gas pressure(p = 0.08 mbar) and low power (P < 3 W). Above the threshold value of gas pressure (p > 0.1
mbar), the clockwise and anti-clockwise co-rotating vortex series are observed on the edges of
the dust cloud, whereas the particles in central region show the random motion. These vortices are
only observed above a threshold width of the dust cloud. The streaming ions are considered the available
free energy source to excite the waves in dust grain medium. The occurrence of the co-rotating vortices
is understood on the basis of the charge gradient of dust particles which is orthogonal to the gravity.
The charge gradient is a consequence of the plasma inhomogeneity from the central region to the outer
edge of dust fluid. Since, a vortex has the characteristic size in the dissipative medium; therefore,
a series of the co-rotating vortex on the both sides of dusty plasma is observed. The experimental
results on the vortex formation and its multiplicity are compared to an available theoretical model
and are found to be in close agreement.
