We investigate limits on the current of the PSI Injector II high intensity separate-sector isochronous
cyclotron, in its present configuration and after a proposed upgrade. Accelerator Driven Subcritical
Reactors, neutron and neutrino experiments, and medical isotope production all benefit from increases
in current, even at the ~ 10% level: the PSI cyclotrons provide relevant experience. As space charge
dominates at low beam energy, the injector is critical. Understanding space charge effects and
halo formation through detailed numerical modelling gives clues on how to maximise the extracted
current. Simulation of a space-charge dominated low energy high intensity (9.5 mA DC) machine,
with a complex collimator set up in the central region shaping the bunch, is not trivial. We use the
OPAL code, a tool for charged-particle optics calculations in large accelerator structures and
beam lines, including 3D space charge. We have a precise model of the present production) Injector
II, operating at 2.2 mA current. A simple model of the proposed future (upgraded) configuration
of the cyclotron is also investigated. We estimate intensity limits based on the developed models,
supported by fitted scaling laws and measurements. We have been able to perform more detailed analysis
of the bunch parameters and halo development than any previous study. Optimisation techniques
enable better matching of the simulation set-up with Injector II parameters and measurements.
We show that in the production configuration the beam current scales to the power of three with the
beam size. However, at higher intensities, 4th power scaling is a better fit, setting the limit of
approximately 3 mA. Currents of over 5 mA, higher than have been achieved to date, can be produced
if the collimation scheme is adjusted.
