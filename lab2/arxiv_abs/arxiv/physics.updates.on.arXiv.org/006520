The analysis and design of advection-diffusion based molecular communication (MC) systems in
cylindrical environments is of particular interest for applications such as micro-fluidics and
targeted drug delivery in blood vessels. Therefore, the accurate modeling of the corresponding
MC channel is of high importance. The propagation of particles in these systems is caused by a combination
of diffusion and flow with a parabolic velocity profile, i.e., laminar flow. The propagation characteristics
of the particles can be categorized into three different regimes: The flow dominant regime where
the influence of diffusion on the particle transport is negligible, the dispersive regime where
diffusion has a much stronger impact than flow, and the mixed regime where both effects are important.
For the limiting regimes, i.e., the flow dominant and dispersive regimes, there are well-known
solutions and approximations for particle transport. In contrast, there is no general analytical
solution for the mixed regime, and instead, approximations, numerical techniques, and particle
based simulations have been employed. In this paper, we develop a general model for the advection-diffusion
problem in cylindrical environments which provides an analytical solution applicable in all regimes.
The modeling procedure is based on a transfer function approach and the main focus lies on the incorporation
of laminar flow into the analytical model. The properties of the proposed model are analyzed by numerical
evaluation for different scenarios including the uniform and point release of particles. We provide
a comparison with particle based simulations and the well-known solutions for the limiting regimes
to demonstrate the validity of the proposed analytical model.
