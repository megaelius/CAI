Here we consider some well-known facts in syntax from a physics perspective, which allows us to establish
some remarkable equivalences. Specifically, we observe that the operation MERGE put forward by
N. Chomsky in 1995 can be interpreted as a physical information coarse-graining. Thus, MERGE in
linguistics entails information renormalization in physics, according to different time scales.
We make this point mathematically formal in terms of language models, i.e., probability distributions
over word sequences, widely used in natural language processing as well as other ambits. In this
setting, MERGE corresponds to a 3-index probability tensor implementing a coarse-graining, akin
to a probabilistic context-free grammar. The probability vectors of meaningful sentences are
naturally given by stochastic tensor networks (TN) that are mostly loop-free, such as Tree Tensor
Networks and Matrix Product States. These structures have short-ranged correlations in the syntactic
distance by construction and, because of the peculiarities of human language, they are extremely
efficient to manipulate computationally. We also propose how to obtain such language models from
probability distributions of certain TN quantum states, which we show to be efficiently preparable
by a quantum computer. Moreover, using tools from entanglement theory, we use these quantum states
to prove classical lower bounds on the perplexity of the probability distribution for a set of words
in a sentence. Implications of these results are discussed in the ambits of theoretical and computational
linguistics, artificial intelligence, programming languages, RNA and protein sequencing, quantum
many-body systems, and beyond. Our work shows how many of the key linguistic ideas from the last century,
including developments in computational linguistics, fit perfectly with known physical concepts
linked to renormalization.
