Multiple bases are presented for the conclusion that potentials are fundamental in electrodynamics,
with electric and magnetic fields as quantities auxiliary to the scalar and vector potentials --
opposite to the conventional ordering. One foundation for the concept of basic potentials and auxiliary
fields consists of examples where two sets of gauge-related fields are such that one is physical
and the other is erroneous, with the information for the proper choice supplied by the potentials.
A major consequence is that a change of gauge is not a unitary transformation in quantum mechanics;
a principle heretofore unchallenged. The primacy of potentials over fields leads to the concept
of a hierarchy of physical quantities, where potentials and energies are primary, while fields
and forces are secondary. Secondary quantities provide less information than do primary quantities.
Some criteria by which strong laser fields are judged are based on secondary quantities, making
it possible to arrive at inappropriate conclusions. This is exemplified by several field-related
misconceptions as diverse as the behavior of charged particles in very low frequency propagating
fields, and the fundamental problem of pair production at very high intensities. In each case, an
approach based on potentials gives appropriate results, free of ambiguities. The examples encompass
classical and quantum phenomena, in relativistic and nonrelativistic conditions. This is a major
extension of the quantum-only Aharonov-Bohm effect, both in supporting the primacy of potentials
over fields, and also in showing how field-based conceptions can lead to errors in basic applications.
