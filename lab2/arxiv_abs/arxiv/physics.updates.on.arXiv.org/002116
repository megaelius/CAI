The neutron detection system for characterization of emissivity in ITER Tokamak during DD and DT
experiments poses serious challenges to the performance of the diagnostic control and data acquisition
system (CDAcq). The ongoing design of the ITER Radial Neutron Camera (RNC) diagnostic is composed
by 26 lines of sight (LOS) for complete plasma inspection. The CDAcq system aims at meeting the ITER
requirements of delivering the measurement of the real-time neutron emissivity profile with time
resolution and control cycle time of 10 ms at peak event rate of 2 MEvents/s per LOS. This measurement
demands the generation of the neutron spectra for each LOS with neutron/gamma discrimination and
pile up rejection. The neutron spectra can be totally processed in the host CPU or it can use the processed
data coming from the system FPGA. The number of neutron counts extracted from the spectra is then
used to calculate the neutron emissivity profile using an inversion algorithm. Moreover, it is
required that the event based raw data acquired is made available to the ITER data network without
local data storage for post processing. The data production for the 2 MEvents/s rate can go up to a
maximum data throughput of 0.5 GB/s per channel. The evaluation of the use of real-time data compression
techniques in RNC is also depicted in another contribution. To meet the demands of the project a CDAcq
prototype has been used to design and test a high-performance distributed software architecture
taking advantage of multi-core CPU technology capable of coping with the requirements. This submission
depicts the design of the real-time architecture, the spectra algorithms (pulse height analysis,
neutron/gamma discrimination and pile-up correction) and the inversion algorithm to calculate
the emissivity profile. Preliminary tests to evaluate the system performance with synthetic data
are presented.
