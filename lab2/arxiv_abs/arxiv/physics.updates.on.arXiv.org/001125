We present a set of effective outflow/open boundary conditions and an associated algorithm for
simulating the dynamics of multiphase flows consisting of $N$ ($N\geqslant 2$) immiscible incompressible
fluids in domains involving outflows or open boundaries. These boundary conditions are devised
based on the properties of energy stability and reduction consistency. The energy stability property
ensures that the contributions of these boundary conditions to the energy balance will not cause
the total energy of the N-phase system to increase over time. Therefore, these open/outflow boundary
conditions are very effective in overcoming the backflow instability in multiphase systems. The
reduction consistency property ensures that if some fluid components are absent from the N-phase
system then these N-phase boundary conditions will reduce to those corresponding boundary conditions
for the equivalent smaller system. Our numerical algorithm for the proposed boundary conditions
together with the N-phase governing equations involves only the solution of a set of de-coupled
individual Helmholtz-type equations within each time step, and the resultant linear algebraic
systems after discretization involve only constant and time-independent coefficient matrices
which can be pre-computed. Therefore, the algorithm is computationally very efficient and attractive.
We present extensive numerical experiments for flow problems involving multiple fluid components
and inflow/outflow boundaries to test the proposed method. In particular, we compare in detail
the simulation results of a three-phase capillary wave problem with Prosperetti's exact physical
solution and demonstrate that the method developed herein produces physically accurate results.
