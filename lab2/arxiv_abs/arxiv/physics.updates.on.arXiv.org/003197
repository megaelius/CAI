Soliton microcombs constitute miniaturized optical frequency combs and have already been used
for coherent telecommunications, astronomical spectrometer calibration and ultrafast ranging.
The majority of these applications have utilized silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$), a space- and CMOS-compatible
material platform featuring ultralow optical losses, suitable for integration with on-chip lasers.
However, soliton microcombs in Si$_3$N$_4$ at microwave repetition rates have not been achieved,
which enable e.g. photonics-based microwave oscillators and dense WDM channels for coherent communication,
and can significantly reduce the system complexity of recently demonstrated photonic integrated
frequency synthesizers and atomic clocks. Here, using the photonic Damascene reflow process,
we fabricate integrated Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators with quality factor exceeding 22 million,
and demonstrate a 19.6 GHz, K-band single soliton microcomb at an ultralow input power of 35 mW, without
requiring a complex soliton initiation technique. This power level is on a par with silica and crystalline
resonators, and compatible with integrated lasers. We utilize the device to create low-noise K-band
microwave oscillators, with phase noise levels at --65 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz and --115 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz
offset frequency, and study the phase noise performance limitations. Equally important, we demonstrate
a single soliton at X-band repetition rate of only 9.77 GHz. Our results establish integrated Si$_3$N$_4$
soliton microcombs as photonic microwave oscillators, that may form central elements for future
microwave photonics systems.
