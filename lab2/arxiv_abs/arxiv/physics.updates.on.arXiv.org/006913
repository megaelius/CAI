Photovoltaic cells (PVc), as an energy provider to the next generation and the biggest source of
renewable energy. Since the last decade improving efficiency and reducing the cost of PVc has been
a subject of active research among scientists. Promising progress in the field of material science
and manufacturing process at Nano-level played a big role. Still, at present there are many challenges
before photovoltaics for efficient and economic energy. However, Photovoltaics cell based on
p-n type homojunction semiconductors with different organic and inorganic materials reported
thus for generally suffer from poor performance. According to the available literature, colloidal
quantum dots having immense properties like a wide range of light absorption, easily charge separation
and transport. To utilize the maximum part of the spectrum of solar energy reaching to the earth and
making effective energy production, here we introduce the complete cell architecture and numerical
investigation on quantum dot based solar cells (QDSCs) with a heterostructure multijunction approach.
Successive ionic layer adsorption at different heterogeneous interfaces were analyzed. We majorly
focused on improving the electrical and optical properties of the QDSCs achieved by different materials
and structural approaches. Here, we report a heterostructure II-Type of band alignment engineering
strategy for QDSCs interfaces that significantly enhances the efficiency descriptors. In the
context of intermediate band solar cell (IBSC), we investigated optical properties of QDs and strain
effects on multilayer PVc and we summarize the strain effect in QDs growth and local energy band bending
of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB).
