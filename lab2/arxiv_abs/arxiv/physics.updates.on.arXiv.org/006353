Solar wind electron velocity distributions at 1 au consist of a thermal "core" population and two
suprathermal populations: "halo" and "strahl". The core and halo are quasi-isotropic, whereas
the strahl typically travels radially outwards along the parallel and/or anti-parallel direction
with respect to the interplanetary magnetic field. With Cluster-PEACE data, we analyse energy
and pitch angle distributions and use machine learning techniques to provide robust classifications
of these solar wind populations. Initially, we use unsupervised algorithms to classify halo and
strahl differential energy flux distributions to allow us to calculate relative number densities,
which are of the same order as previous results. Subsequently, we apply unsupervised algorithms
to phase space density distributions over ten years to study the variation of halo and strahl breakpoint
energies with solar wind parameters. In our statistical study, we find both halo and strahl suprathermal
breakpoint energies display a significant increase with core temperature, with the halo exhibiting
a more positive correlation than the strahl. We conclude low energy strahl electrons are scattering
into the core at perpendicular pitch angles. This increases the number of Coulomb collisions and
extends the perpendicular core population to higher energies, resulting in a larger difference
between halo and strahl breakpoint energies at higher core temperatures. Statistically, the locations
of both suprathermal breakpoint energies decrease with increasing solar wind speed. In the case
of halo breakpoint energy, we observe two distinct profiles above and below 500 km/s. We relate this
to the difference in origin of fast and slow solar wind.
