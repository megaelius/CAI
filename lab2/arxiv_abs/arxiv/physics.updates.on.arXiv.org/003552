Liquid water has been proved to be an excellent medium for specimen structure imaging by a scanning
electron microscope. Knowledge of electron-water interaction physics and particularly the secondary
electron yield is essential to the interpretation of the imaging contrast. However, very little
is known up to now experimentally on the low energy electron interaction with liquid water because
of certain practical limitations. It is then important to gain some useful information about electron
emission from water by a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique that can numerically model electron
transport trajectories in water. In this study, we have performed MC simulations of electron emission
from liquid water in the primary energy range of 50 eV-30 keV by using two different codes, i.e. a classical
MC (CMC) code developed in our laboratory and the Geant4-DNA (G4DNA) code. The calculated secondary
electron yield and electron backscattering coefficient are compared with experimental results
wherever applicable to verify the validity of physical models for the electron-water interaction.
The secondary electron yield vs. primary energy curves calculated by the two codes present the same
generic curve shape as that of metals but in rather different absolute values. G4DNA yields the underestimated
absolute values due to the application of one step thermalization model by setting a cutoff energy
at 7.4 eV so that the low energy losses due to phonon excitations are omitted. Our CMC calculation
of secondary electron yield is closer to the experimental data and the energy distribution is reasonable.
It is concluded that a full dielectric function data at low energy loss values below 7.4 eV shall be
employed in G4DNA model for the modeling of low energy electrons.
