In the first part of the paper, we introduce the concept of observable quantities associated with
a macroinstrument measuring the density and temperature and with a microinstrument determining
the radius of a molecule and its free path length, and also the relationship between these observable
quantities. The concept of the number of degrees of freedom, which relates the observable quantities
listed above, is generalized to the case of low temperatures. An analogy between the creation and
annihilation operators for pairs (dimers) and the creation and annihilation operators for particles
(molecules) is carried out. A generalization of the concept of a Bose condensate is introduced for
classical molecules as an analog of an ideal liquid (without attraction). The negative pressure
in the liquid is treated as holes (of exciton type) in the density of the Bose condensate. The phase
transition gas-liquid is calculated for an ideal gas (without attraction). A comparison with experimental
data is carried out. In the other part of the paper, we introduce the concept of new observable quantity,
namely, of a pair (a dimer), as a result of attraction between the nearest neighbors. We treat in a
new way the concepts of Boyle temperature $T_B$ (as the temperature above which the dimers disappear)
and of the critical temperature $T_c$ (below which the trimers and clusters are formed). The equation
for the Zeno line is interpreted as the relation describing the dependence of the temperature on
the density at which the dimers disappear. We calculate the maximal density of the liquid and also
the maximal density of the holes. The law of corresponding states is derived as a result of an observation
by a macrodevice which cannot distinguish between molecules of distinct gases, theoretical and
experimental data are compared, observations in three scales, macro, micro, and nano, are studied.
