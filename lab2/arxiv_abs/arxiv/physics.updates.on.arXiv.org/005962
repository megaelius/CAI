One of the many unresolved questions that revolves around the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is whether
local outbreaks can depend on ambient conditions like temperature and relative humidity. In this
paper, we put forward a model that tries to explain and describe the possible temperature and relative
humidity dependence of viral outbreaks controlled by transmission of respiratory droplets. The
model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the infected population based on a reaction
mechanism - the final equations of which are similar to the well-known SIR model. The advantage of
modeling the pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound physical
interpretation and could be modeled using the collision rate theory. As such, the infection rate
constant is shown to be linearly related to the square of the virus laden droplet lifetime. In the
second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for disease transmission as
salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation time accounting for initial droplet cooling,
heat and mass transfer and finally crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares
with the experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water
and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model. The model shows that the overall
evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature and relative humidity.
It is shown that the evaporation time of a particular droplet size could also be chosen as the characteristic
lifetime of the droplets. Since the droplet evaporation time determines the infection rate constant,
temperature and relative humidity are shown to rather strongly impact the outbreak growth rates.
