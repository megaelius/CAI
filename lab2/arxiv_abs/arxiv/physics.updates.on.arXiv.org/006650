In order to explore the influence of combustion-induced thermal expansion on turbulence, a new
research method is introduced. The method consists in jointly applying Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition
and conditioned structure functions to analyzing turbulent velocity fields. Opportunities offered
by the method are demonstrated by using it to process Direct Numerical Simulation data obtained
earlier from two statistically 1D, planar, fully-developed, weakly turbulent, single-step-chemistry,
premixed flames characterized by two significantly different (7.52 and 2.50) density ratios,
with all other things being approximately equal. To emphasize the influence of combustion-induced
thermal expansion on turbulent flow of unburned mixture upstream of a premixed flame, the focus
of analysis is placed on structure functions conditioned to the unburned mixture in both points.
Two decomposition techniques, i.e. (i) a widely used orthogonal Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition
and (ii) a recently introduced natural Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, are probed, with results
obtained using them being similar in the largest part of the computational domain with the exception
of narrow zones near the inlet and outlet boundaries. Computed results indicate that combustion-induced
thermal expansion can significantly change turbulent flow of unburned mixture upstream of a premixed
flame by generating anisotropic potential velocity fluctuations whose spatial structure differ
substantially from spatial structure of the incoming turbulence. The magnitude of such potential
velocity fluctuations is greater than the magnitude of the solenoidal velocity fluctuations in
the largest part of the mean flame brush in the case of the high density ratio. In the case of the low
density ratio, the latter magnitude is larger everywhere, but the two magnitudes are comparable
in the middle of the mean flame brush.
