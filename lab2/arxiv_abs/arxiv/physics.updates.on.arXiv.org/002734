The IORIO (In-Orbit Relativity Iuppiter Observatory) concept consists of a fast orbiter of Jupiter
$\left(P_\textrm{b}\simeq 0.12~\textrm{d}\right)$, endowed with a Juno-type Doppler ranging
device, accurate to $\sigma_{\dot\rho}\simeq 0.003~\textrm{mm~s}^{-1}$, originally proposed
to measure the post-Newtonian range-rate signature proportional to $GSJ_2c^{-2}$. It could be
made as large as $\Delta\dot\rho_\textrm{gm}\simeq 0.2-0.02~\textrm{mm~s}^{-1}$, depending
on the orientation of the orbital plane. Also other general relativistic effects could be measurable,
including also the one proportional to $GMJ_2c^{-2}$, never put to the test so far. A major source
of systematic error is our imperfect knowledge of the magnitude and orientation of the Newtonian
multipolar expansion of the Jovian gravity field. We numerically investigate its biasing impact
on the general relativistic signatures by determining the required level of improvement of each
Newtonian multipole with respect to its present-day accuracy based on the analysis of just some
perijove passages of the spacecraft Juno, currently orbiting Jupiter. If, on the one hand, the accuracy
of most of the Jovian multipoles up to degree $\ell = 12$ should be improved by a factor of about $50-500$,
with a peak of $1,000$ for $J_{10}$, in order to reach the size of the $GSJ_2c^{-2}$ effect, on the
other hand, the spin pole position, impacting mostly the $J_2$ classical signal, would require
a relatively more modest improvement by a factor of 100. The improvements needed to reach the size
of the $GMJ_2c^{-2},~GSc^{-2}$ signals are smaller, amounting to a factor of $\simeq 5-50$ or so.
Remarkably, most of the competing Newtonian signals have quite different temporal signatures
with respect to the post-Newtonian ones, making, thus, potentially easier disentangling them.
