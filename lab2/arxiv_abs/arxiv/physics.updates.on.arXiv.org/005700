We consider a cerebellar ring network for the optokinetic response (OKR), and investigate the effect
of diverse recoding of granule (GR) cells on OKR by varying the connection probability $p_c$ from
Golgi to GR cells. For an optimal value of $p_c^*~(=0.06)$, individual GR cells exhibit diverse
spiking patterns which are in-phase, anti-phase, or complex out-of-phase with respect to their
population-averaged firing activity. Then, these diversely-recoded signals via parallel fibers
(PFs) from GR cells are effectively depressed by the error-teaching signals via climbing fibers
from the inferior olive which are also in-phase ones. Synaptic weights at in-phase PF-Purkinje
cell (PC) synapses of active GR cells are strongly depressed via strong long-term depression (LTD),
while those at anti- and complex out-of-phase PF-PC synapses are weakly depressed through weak
LTD. This kind of "effective" depression (i.e., strong/weak LTD) at PF-PC synapses causes a big
modulation in firing of PCs, which then exert effective inhibitory coordination on vestibular
nucleus (VN) neuron (which evokes OKR). For the firing of VN neuron, the learning gain degree ${\cal{L}}_g$,
corresponding to the modulation gain ratio, increases with increasing learning cycle, and it saturates
at about the 300th cycle. By varying $p_c$ from $p_c^*$, we find that a plot of saturated learning
gain degree ${\cal L}_g^*$ versus $p_c$ forms a bell-shaped curve with a peak at $p_c^*$ (where the
diversity degree in firing of GR cells is also maximum). Consequently, the more diverse in recoding
of GR cells, the more effective in motor learning for the OKR adaptation.
