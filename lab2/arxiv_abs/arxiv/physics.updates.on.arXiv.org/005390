In analogy to the development of fluorescent proteins, innovative tools for screening optoacoustic
cell labels could lead to tailored protein labels for OA, imparting novel ways to visualize biological
structure and function. Optoacoustic imaging emerges towards a highly promising modality for
life sciences and medical practise with advantageous capabilities such as great accessible depth,
and 3D studying of living tissue. The development of novel labels with molecular specificity could
significantly enhance the optoacoustic contrast, specificity, and sensitivity and allow optoacoustic
to interrogate tissues not amenable to the fluorescence method. We report on an optoacoustic flow
cytometer (OAFC) prototype, developed for screening optoacoustic reporter genes. The cytometer
concurrently records light scattering for referencing purposes. Since recording light scattering
is completely independent from OA, we believe it to be a more reliable referencing method than e.g.
fluorescence or ultrasound-backscatter. Precise characterization of our OAFC prototype showcases
its ability to optoacoustically characterize objects in-flow that are in the size range of single
cells. We apply the OAFC to distinguish individual E. coli cells based on optoacoustic properties
of their expressed chromoproteins read in-flow using microfluidic arrangements and achieved
precisions over 90%. We discuss how the light scattering referenced OAFC method offers a critical
step towards routine measurement of optoacoustic properties of single-cells and could pave the
way for identifying genetically encoded optoacoustic reporters, by transferring working concepts
of the fluorescence field.
