We study minimizers with velocity discontinuities for the hydrogenoid atomic model using the \emph{variational}
electromagnetic two-body problem with past and future boundary conditions. Along regular segments,
these \emph{broken extrema} satisfy Euler-Lagrange equations which are \emph{neutral differential
delay} equations with state-dependent deviating arguments. At points where velocities are \emph{discontinuous},
broken extrema satisfy the Weierstrass-Erdmann corner conditions that \emph{energies} and \emph{momenta}
are \emph{continuous}. We construct \emph{periodic} broken extrema near some circular orbits,
using solutions of the neutral differential delay equations along regular segments and a variational
approximation for the spiky boundary-layer segments. A discrete set of finitely measured neighbourhoods
of periodic orbits result from the Weierstrass-Erdmann stabilization of explosive tangent modes
near some circular orbits. The Weierstrass-Erdmann conditions are \emph{further compatible}
with the requirement of vanishing far-fields, thus creating finitely measured neighbourhoods
of periodic orbits with vanishing far-fields right at the atomic magnitude. We vary the mass ratio
by \emph{three orders of magnitude}, thus studying the atoms of \emph{hydrogen}, \emph{muonium}
and \emph{positronium}. In each case the broken extrema have magnitudes in quantitative agreement
with experiment and quantum mechanics, i.e., the spacings between consecutive discrete orbital
angular momenta agree with Planck's constant within thirty-percent, while orbital frequencies
agree with a corresponding spectroscopic line within a few percent. Last, we discuss the \emph{extension}
of Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics of point charges to \emph{variational} electrodynamics.
