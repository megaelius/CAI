The lack of low frequency information and a good initial model can seriously affect the success of
full waveform inversion (FWI), due to the inherent cycle skipping problem. Computational low frequency
extrapolation is in principle the most direct way to address this issue. By considering bandwidth
extension as a regression problem in machine learning, we propose an architecture of convolutional
neural network (CNN) to automatically extrapolate the missing low frequencies without preprocessing
and post-processing steps. The bandlimited recordings are the inputs of the CNN and, in our numerical
experiments, a neural network trained from enough samples can predict a reasonable approximation
to the seismograms in the unobserved low frequency band, both in phase and in amplitude. The numerical
experiments considered are set up on simulated P-wave data. In extrapolated FWI (EFWI), the low-wavenumber
components of the model are determined from the extrapolated low frequencies, before proceeding
with a frequency sweep of the bandlimited data. The proposed deep-learning method of low-frequency
extrapolation shows adequate generalizability for the initialization step of EFWI. Numerical
examples show that the neural network trained on several submodels of the Marmousi model is able
to predict the low frequencies for the BP 2004 benchmark model. Additionally, the neural network
can robustly process seismic data with uncertainties due to the existence of noise, poorly-known
source wavelet, and different finite-difference scheme in the forward modeling operator. Finally,
this approach is not subject to the structural limitations of other methods for bandwidth extension,
and seems to offer a tantalizing solution to the problem of properly initializing FWI.
