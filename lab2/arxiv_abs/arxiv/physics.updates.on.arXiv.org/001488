In the present thesis, a computational framework for the analysis of the deformation and damage
phenomena occurring at the micro-scale of polycrystalline materials is presented. Micro-mechanics
studies are commonly performed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) for its versatility and robustness.
However, finite element formulations usually lead to an extremely high number of degrees of freedom
of the considered micro-structures, thus making alternative formulations of great engineering
interest. Among the others, the Boundary Element Method (BEM) represents a viable alternative
to FEM approaches as it allows to express the problem in terms of boundary values only, thus reducing
the total number of degrees of freedom. The computational framework developed in this thesis is
based on a non-linear multi-domain BEM approach for generally anisotropic materials and is devoted
to the analysis of three-dimensional polycrystalline microstructures. Different theoretical
and numerical aspects of the polycrystalline problem using the boundary element method are investigated:
first, being the formulation based on a integral representation of the governing equations, a novel
and more compact expression of the integration kernels capable of representing the multi-field
behaviour of generally anisotropic materials is presented; second, the sources of the high computational
cost of polycrystalline analyses are identified and suitably treated by means of different strategies
including an ad-hoc grain boundary meshing technique developed to tackle the large statistical
variability of polycrystalline micro-morphologies; third, non-linear deformation and failure
mechanisms such as inter-granular and trans-granular cracking and generally anisotropic crystal
plasticity are studied and the numerical results presented throughout the thesis demonstrate
the potential of the developed framework.
