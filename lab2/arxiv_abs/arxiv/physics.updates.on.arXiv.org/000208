Chemical crosslinking of collagen is a general strategy to reproduce macroscale tissue properties
in physiological environment. However, simultaneous control of protein conformation, material
properties and biofunctionality is highly challenging with current synthetic strategies. Consequently,
the potentially-diverse clinical applications of collagen-based biomaterials cannot be fully
realised. In order to establish defined biomacromolecular systems for mineralised tissue applications,
type I collagen was functionalised with 1,3-Phenylenediacetic acid (Ph) and investigated at the
molecular, macroscopic and functional levels. Preserved triple helix conformation was observed
in obtained covalent networks via ATR-FTIR and WAXS, while network crosslinking degree could be
adjusted based on specific reaction conditions. Decreased swelling ratio and increased thermo-mechanical
properties were observed compared to state of-the-art carbodiimide (EDC)-crosslinked collagen
controls, likely related to the intermolecular covalent incorporation of the aromatic segment.
Ph crosslinked hydrogels displayed nearly intact material integrity and only a slight mass decrease
following 1-week incubation in either PBS or simulated body fluid (SBF), in contrast to EDC crosslinked
collagen. Furthermore, FTIR, SEM and EDS revealed deposition of a calcium-phosphate phase on SBF-retrieved
samples, whereby an increased calcium phosphate ratio was observed in hydrogels with higher Ph
content. 72-hour material extracts were well tolerated by L929 mouse fibroblasts, whereby cell
confluence and metabolic activity (MTS assay) were comparable to those of cells cultured in cell
culture medium (positive control). In light of their controlled structure-function properties,
these biocompatible collagen hydrogels represent attractive material systems for potential
mineralised tissue applications.
