There have been periodic efforts in recent decades to search for extraterrestrial intelligence
(SETI), especially by trying to find an extraterrestrial (ET) radio signal or other technosignature
in space. Yet, no such technosignatures have been found. Considering the vastness of space, finding
such technosignatures has been described as trying to find a needle in a cosmic haystack. To help
resolve this, two hypotheses are proposed to aid SETI researchers in narrowing the search for ET
technosignatures, based on a network analysis approach to locate where in space potential ET communication
networks would most likely be. A potential ET communication network can use exoplanets as communication
access points (e.g., placing a communication satellite into planetary orbit, or an antenna on a
planetary surface). The approach uses a topology where exoplanets are represented as nodes, and
the lines of average distance (generalized communication paths) between adjacent exoplanets
are represented as edges; the nodes and edges form local and wide planetary networks. Using the approach
and data visualization on exoplanet databases can highlight locations of potential ET communication
networks in space. The first hypothesis posits that an ET technosignature would more likely appear
in a potentially habitable solar system containing a high concentration of planets, wherein the
planets function as communication access points to facilitate a potential ET communication network.
The second hypothesis posits that an ET technosignature would more likely appear in a highly concentrated
cluster of potentially habitable solar systems. Contributions to the SETI field can be increased
accuracy in finding ET technosignatures, increased accuracy in reaching a Schelling point (a mutual
realization of how we and an ET intelligence can find each other), and promoting interdisciplinary
SETI research.
