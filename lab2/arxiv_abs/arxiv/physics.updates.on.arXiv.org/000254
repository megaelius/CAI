Particle flows of high particle concentration are important in many fields, including chemical
processing, pharmaceutical processing, energy conversion and powder transport. However, despite
decades of research and industrial application, the real time behavior of particle flow fields
is still not well understood. One of the main reasons is that experimental data is difficult to acquire
in such harsh, opaque particle flow environments. In this educational video for the Gallery of Fluid
Motion, high speed video acquired with a new, patented high speed particle imaging velocimetry
(high speed PIV) technology is presented. This technology was developed by the USDOE National Energy
Technology Laboratory (NETL). It is being applied to observe and measure the real time behavior
of individual particle motion inside particle flow fields of high particle concentration for the
first time. The high speed PIV system records high speed videos of particle motion with excellent
spatial and temporal clarity. The high speed videos are analyzed to measure the concentration and
the two-dimensional motion (velocity and trajectory) of individual particles. Data sample rates
for velocity vectors are in the range of 0.1 to 3 million vectors per second, thereby providing full
resolution of the temporal domain of particle velocity. To see and measure particle motion inside
the flow fields at high particle concentrations, a custom borescope is inserted into particle flow
fields. The particle tracking technique can measure gas and fluid flow if the particles are small
enough (have a low enough Stokes number) to follow the gas/fluid flow. In areas of rapid mixing, such
as turbulent wakes, particle tracking can provide better spatial resolution that conventional
cross-correlation based PIV analysis. Keywords: fluid dynamics video, particle tracking, fluidization
