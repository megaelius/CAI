Background: Spike trains of multiple neurons can be analyzed following the summed population (SP)
or the labeled line (LL) hypothesis. Responses to external stimuli are generated by a neuronal population
as a whole or the individual neurons have encoding capacities of their own. The SPIKE-distance estimated
either for a single, pooled spike train over a population or for each neuron separately can serve
to quantify these responses. New Method: For the SP case we compare three algorithms that search
for the most discriminative subpopulation over all stimulus pairs. For the LL case we introduce
a new algorithm that combines neurons that individually separate different pairs of stimuli best.
Results: The best approach for SP is a brute force search over all possible subpopulations. However,
it is only feasible for small populations. For more realistic settings, simulated annealing clearly
outperforms gradient algorithms with only a limited increase in computational load. Our novel
LL approach can handle very involved coding scenarios despite its computational ease. Comparison
with Existing Methods: Spike train distances have been extended to the analysis of neural populations
interpolating between SP and LL coding. This includes parametrizing the importance of distinguishing
spikes being fired in different neurons. Yet, these approaches only consider the population as
a whole. The explicit focus on subpopulations render our algorithms complimentary. Conclusions:
The spectrum of encoding possibilities in neural populations is broad. The SP and LL cases are two
extremes for which our algorithms provide correct identification results.
