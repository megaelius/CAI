A review is given of some well-known and some recent results for two- and three-dimensional (2D and
3D) solitons, with emphasis on states carrying embedded vorticity. Unlike typically stable 1D
solitons, 2D and 3D ones are vulnerable to instabilities induced by the critical and supercritical
collapse, respectively, in the 2D and 3D models with cubic focusing nonlinearity. Vortex solitons
are subject to a still stronger splitting instability. For this reason, a central problem is looking
for physical settings in which 2D and 3D solitons may be stabilized. The review addresses, first,
two well-established topics, viz., the stabilization of vortex solitons by means of competing
nonlinearities, or by trapping potentials (harmonic-oscillator and spatially-periodic ones).
The former topic includes a new addition, viz., the prediction of robust quantum droplets. Two other
topics outline new schemes elaborated for the creation of stable vortical solitons. One scheme
relies on the use of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in binary BEC, making it possible to predict stable
2D and 3D solitons, which couple or mix components with vorticities S=0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices
(SVs) or mixed modes (MMs), respectively). In this system, the situation is different in the 2D and
3D geometries. In 2D, SOC helps to create a ground state (GS), represented by stable SV or MM solitons,
whose norm falls below the threshold value at which the critical collapse sets in. In the 3D geometry,
the supercritical collapse does not allow one to create a GS, but metastable solitons of the SV and
MM types can be constructed. Another new scheme makes it possible to create stable 2D vortex-ring
solitons with arbitrarily high S in a binary BEC with components coupled by microwave radiation.
Some other topics are addressed too, such as vortex solitons in dissipative media and attempts to
create vortex solitons in experiments.
