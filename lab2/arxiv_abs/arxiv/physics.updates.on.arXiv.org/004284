Turbulence structure resulting from multi-fluid or multi-species, variable-density isotropic
turbulence interaction with a Mach 2 shock is studied using turbulence-resolving shock-capturing
simulations and Eulerian (grid) and Lagrangian (particle) methods. The complex roles density
play in the modification of turbulence by the shock wave are identified. Statistical analyses of
the velocity gradient tensor (VGT) show that the density variations significantly change the turbulence
structure and flow topology. Specifically, a stronger symmetrization of the joint probability
density function (PDF) of second and third invariants of the anisotropic velocity gradient tensor,
PDF$(Q^\ast, R^\ast)$, as well as the PDF of the vortex stretching contribution to the enstrophy
equation, are observed in the multi-species case. Furthermore, subsequent to the interaction
with the shock, turbulent statistics also acquire a differential distribution in regions having
different densities. This results in a nearly symmetrical PDF$(Q^\ast, R^\ast)$ in heavy fluid
regions, while the light fluid regions retain the characteristic tear-drop shape. To understand
this behavior and the return to "standard" turbulence structure as the flow evolves away from the
shock, Lagrangian dynamics of the VGT and its invariants are studied by considering particle residence
times and conditional particle variables in different flow regions. The pressure Hessian contributions
to the VGT invariants transport equations are shown to be not only affected by the shock wave, but
also by the density in the multi-fluid case, making them critically important to the flow dynamics
and turbulence structure.
