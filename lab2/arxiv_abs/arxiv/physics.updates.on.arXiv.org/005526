How an individual's unique brain connectivity determines that individual's cognition, behavior,
and risk for pathology is a fundamental question in basic and clinical neuroscience. In seeking
answers, many have turned to machine learning, with some noting the particular promise of deep neural
networks in modelling complex non-linear functions. However, it is not clear that complex functions
actually exist between brain connectivity and behavior, and thus if deep neural networks necessarily
outperform simpler linear models, or if their results would be interpretable. Here we show that,
across 52 subject measures of cognition and behavior, deep neural networks fit to each brain region's
connectivity outperform linear regression, particularly for the brain's connector hubs--regions
with diverse brain connectivity--whereas the two approaches perform similarly when fit to brain
systems. Critically, averaging deep neural network predictions across brain regions results
in the most accurate predictions, demonstrating the ability of deep neural networks to easily model
the various functions that exists between regional brain connectivity and behavior, carving the
brain at its joints. Finally, we shine light into the black box of deep neural networks using multislice
network models. We determined that the relationship between connector hubs and behavior is best
captured by modular deep neural networks. Our results demonstrate that both simple and complex
relationships exist between brain connectivity and behavior, and that deep neural networks can
fit both. Moreover, deep neural networks are particularly powerful when they are first fit to the
various functions of a system independently and then combined. Finally, deep neural networks are
interpretable when their architectures are structurally characterized using multislice network
models.
