Topological phases enable protected transport along the edges of materials, offering immunity
against scattering from disorder and imperfections. These phases were suggested and demonstrated
not only for electronic systems, but also for electromagnetic waves, cold atoms, acoustics, and
even mechanics. Their potential applications range from spintronics and quantum computing to
highly efficient lasers. Traditionally, the underlying model of these systems is a spatial lattice
in two or three dimensions. However, it recently became clear that many lattice systems can exist
also in synthetic dimensions which are not spatial but extend over a different degree of freedom.
Thus far, topological insulators in synthetic dimensions were demonstrated only in cold atoms,
where synthetic dimensions have now become a useful tool for demonstrating a variety of lattice
models that are not available in spatial lattices. Subsequently, efforts have been directed towards
realizing topological lattices with synthetic dimensions in photonics, where they are connected
to physical phenomena in high-dimensions, interacting photons, and more. Here we demonstrate
experimentally the first photonic topological insulator in synthetic dimensions. The ability
to study experimentally photonic systems in synthetic dimensions opens the door for a plethora
of unexplored physical phenomena ranging from PT-symmetry, exceptional points and unidirectional
invisibility to Anderson localization in high dimensions and high-dimensional lattice solitons,
topological insulator lasers in synthetic dimensions and more. Our study here paves the way to these
exciting phenomena, which are extremely hard (if not impossible) to observe in other physical systems.
