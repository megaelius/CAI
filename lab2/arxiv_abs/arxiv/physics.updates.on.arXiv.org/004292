Even though automatic classification and interpretation would be highly desired features for
the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (MMS), the gold rush era in machine learning has yet to reach
the science done with observations collected by MMS. We investigate the properties of the ion sky
maps produced by the Dual Ion Spectrometers (DIS) from the Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI). Running
the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a mixed subset of the data suggests that more than 500 components
are needed to cover 80% of the variance. Hence, simple machine learning techniques might not deal
with classification of plasma regions. Use of a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional autoencoder
(3D-CAE) allows to reduce the data dimensionality by 128 times while still maintaining a decent
quality energy distribution. However, k-means clustering computed over the compressed data is
not capable of separating measurements according to the physical properties of the plasma. A three-dimensional
convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), trained on a rather small amount of human labelled training
examples is able to predict plasma regions with 99% accuracy. The low probability predictions of
the 3D-CNN reveal the mixed state regions, such as the magnetopause or bow shock, which are of key
interest to researchers of the MMS mission. The 3D-CNN and data processing software could easily
be deployed on ground-based computers and provide classification for the whole MMS database. Data
processing through the trained 3D-CNN is fast and efficient, opening up the possibility for deployment
in data-centers or in situ operation onboard the spacecraft.
