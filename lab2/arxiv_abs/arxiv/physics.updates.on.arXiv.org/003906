A. De Rosis and K. H. Luo, Phys. Rev. E 99, 013301 (2019) has shown the importance of taking into account
high-order Hermite polynomials in the derivation of Galilean invariant central-moments of the
discrete equilibrium state. Another recent work https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.013310
A. De Rosis, Phys. Rev. E 95, 013310 (2017) has led to the derivation of concise and efficient three-dimensional
central-moment-based lattice Boltzmann methods. Combining these two approaches, we propose
a compact and mathematically sound formulation of the central-moments-based lattice Boltzmann
scheme with external forcing. More specifically, the proposed formalism fully takes advantage
of the D3Q27 discretization by relying on the corresponding set of 27 Hermite polynomials (up to
the sixth order) for the derivation of both the discrete equilibrium state and the forcing term.
The present methodology is more consistent than previous approaches, as it properly explains how
to derive Galilean invariant central moments of the forcing term in an \emph{a priori} manner. Furthermore,
while keeping the numerical properties of the classical cascaded lattice Boltzmann method, the
present work leads to a compact and simple algorithm, representing a concise methodology using
central moments and external forcing within the lattice Boltzmann framework. To support these
statements, mathematical derivations, a comparative study with six other forcing schemes, as
well as, several numerical simulations of increasing complexity are provided.
