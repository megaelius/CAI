In cells and in vitro assays the number of motor proteins involved in biological transport processes
is far from being unlimited. The cytoskeletal binding sites are in contact with the same finite reservoir
of motors (either the cytosol or the flow chamber) and hence compete for recruiting the available
motors, potentially depleting the reservoir and affecting cytoskeletal transport. In this work
we provide a theoretical framework to study, analytically and numerically, how motor density profiles
and crowding along cytoskeletal filaments depend on the competition of motors for their binding
sites. We propose two models in which finite processive motor proteins actively advance along cytoskeletal
filaments and are continuously exchanged with the motor pool. We first look at homogeneous reservoirs
and then examine the effects of free motor diffusion in the surrounding medium. We consider as a reference
situation recent in vitro experimental setups of kinesin-8 motors binding and moving along microtubule
filaments in a flow chamber. We investigate how the crowding of linear motor proteins moving on a
filament can be regulated by the balance between supply (concentration of motor proteins in the
flow chamber) and demand (total number of polymerised tubulin heterodimers). We present analytical
results for the density profiles of bound motors, the reservoir depletion, and propose novel phase
diagrams that present the formation of jams of motor proteins on the filament as a function of two
tuneable experimental parameters: the motor protein concentration and the concentration of tubulins
polymerized into cytoskeletal filaments. Extensive numerical simulations corroborate the analytical
results for parameters in the experimental range and also address the effects of diffusion of motor
proteins in the reservoir.
