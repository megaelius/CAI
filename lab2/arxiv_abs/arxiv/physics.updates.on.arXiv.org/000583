Serving as a new two-dimensional plasmonic material, graphene has stimulated an intensive study
of its optical properties which benefit from the unique electronic band structure of the underlying
honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms. In classical electrodynamics, nanostructured graphene is
commonly modeled by the computationally demanding problem of a three-dimensional conducting
film of atomic-scale thickness. Here, we propose an efficient alternative two-dimensional electrostatic
approach where all the calculation procedures are restricted to the plane of the graphene sheet.
To explore possible quantum effects, we perform tight-binding calculations, adopting a random-phase
approximation. We investigate the multiple plasmon modes in triangles of graphene, treating the
optical response classically as well as quantum mechanically in the case of both armchair and zigzag
edge termination of the underlying atomic lattice. Compared to the classical plasmonic spectrum
which is "blind" to the edge termination, we find that the quantum plasmon frequencies exhibit blueshifts
in the case of armchair edge termination, while redshifts are found for zigzag edges. Furthermore,
we find spectral features in the zigzag case which are associated with electronic edge states not
present for armchair termination. Merging pairs of such triangles into dimers, the plasmon hybridization
leads to energy splitting in accordance with plasmon-hybridization theory, with a lower energy
for the antisymmetric modes and a smaller splitting for modes with less confinement to the gap region.
The hybridization appears strongest in classical calculations while the splitting is lower for
armchair edges and even more reduced for zigzag edges. Our various results illustrate a surprising
phenomenon: Even 20 nm large graphene structures clearly exhibit quantum plasmonic features due
to atomic-scale details in the edge termination.
