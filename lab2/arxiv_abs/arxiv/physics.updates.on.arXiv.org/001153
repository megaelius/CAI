What does the diffraction pattern from a single atom look like? How does it differ from the scattering
from long range potential? With the development of new high-dynamic range pixel array detectors
to measure the complete momentum distribution, these questions have immediate relevance for designing
and understanding momentum-resolved imaging modes. We explore the asymptotic limits of long range
and short range potentials. We use a simple quantum mechanical model to explain the general and asymptotic
limits for the probability distribution in both and real and reciprocal space. Features in the scattering
potential much larger than the probe size cause the bright-field disk to deflect uniformly, while
features much smaller than the probe size, instead of a deflection cause a redistribution of intensity
within the bright-field disk. Because long range and short range features are encoded differently
in the diffraction pattern, it is possible to separate their contributions in differential phase
contrast (DPC) or Center-of-Mass (CoM) imaging. The shape profiles for atomic resolution CoM imaging
are dominated by the shape of the probe gradient and not the highly-singular atomic potentials or
their local fields. Instead, only the peak height shows an atomic-number sensitivity, whose precise
dependence is determined by the convergence angle. At lower convergence angles, the contrast oscillates
with increasing atomic number, similar to bright field imaging. The range of collection angles
impacts DPC and CoM imaging differently, with CoM being more sensitive to the upper cutoff limit,
while DPC is more sensitive to the lower cutoff.
