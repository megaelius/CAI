We solve a design optimization problem for deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) device to
sort same-size biological cells by their deformability, in particular to sort red blood cells (RBCs)
by their viscosity contrast between the fluid in the interior and the exterior of the cells. A DLD
device optimized for efficient cell sorting enables rapid medical diagnoses of several diseases
such as malaria since infected cells are stiffer than their healthy counterparts. The device consists
of pillar arrays in which pillar rows are tilted and hence are not orthogonal to the columns. This
arrangement leads cells to have different final vertical displacements depending on their deformability,
therefore, it vertically separates the cells. Pillar cross section, tilt angle of the pillar rows
and center-to-center distances between pillars define a unique device. For a given pair of viscosity
contrast values of the cells we seek optimal DLD designs by fixing the tilt angle and the center-to-center
distances. So the only design parameter is the pillar cross section which we parameterize with uniform
5th order B-splines. We propose an objective function to try to capture efficient cell sorting.
The objective function is evaluated by simulating the cell flows through a device using our 2D model
based on a boundary integral method (Kabacaoglu et al. Journal of Computational Physics, 357:43-77,
2018). We solve the optimization problem using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
(CMA-ES), which is a stochastic, derivative-free algorithm. We present several scenarios where
solving the optimization problem finds designs that can separate cells with similar viscosity
contrast values. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which poses designing a DLD
device as a constrained optimization problem and shows that solving this problem systematically
discovers optimal designs.
