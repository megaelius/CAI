In wall-bounded turbulence, a multitude of coexisting turbulence structures form the streamwise
velocity energy spectrum from the viscosity- to the inertia-dominated range of scales. Definite
scaling-trends for streamwise spectra have remained empirically elusive, although a prominent
school of thought stems from the works of Perry and Abell (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 79, 1977, pp. 785-799)
and Perry et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 165, 1986, pp. 163-199), which were greatly inspired by the
attached-eddy hypothesis of Townsend (The Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow, Cambridge University
Press, 1976). In this paper, we re-examine the turbulence kinetic energy of the streamwise velocity
component in the context of the spectral decompositions of Perry and coworkers. Two universal spectral
filters are derived via spectral coherence analysis of two-point velocity signals, spanning a
Reynolds number range $Re_\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(10^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and form the basis
for our decomposition of the logarithmic-region turbulence into stochastically wall-detached
and wall-attached portions of energy. The latter is composed of scales larger than a streamwise/wall-normal
ratio of $\lambda_x/z \approx 14$. If the decomposition is accepted, a $k_x^{-1}$ scaling region
can only appear for $Re_\tau \geq 80\,000$, at a wall-normal position of $z^+ = 100$. Following Perry
and co-workers, it is hypothesized that spectral contributions from turbulence structures other
than attached eddies obscure a $k_x^{-1}$ scaling. When accepting the idea of different spectral
contributions it is furthermore shown that a broad outer-spectral peak is present even at low $Re_\tau$.
