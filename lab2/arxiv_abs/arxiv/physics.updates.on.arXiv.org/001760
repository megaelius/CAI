The development of accurate and transferable machine learning (ML) potentials for predicting
molecular energetics is a challenging task. The process of data generation to train such ML potentials
is a task neither well understood nor researched in detail. In this work, we present a fully automated
approach for the generation of datasets with the intent of training universal ML potentials. It
is based on the concept of active learning (AL) via Query by Committee (QBC), which uses the disagreement
between an ensemble of ML potentials to infer the reliability of the ensemble's prediction. QBC
allows the presented AL algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical space where the ML
potential fails to accurately predict the potential energy. AL improves the overall fitness of
ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test cases by mitigating human biases in deciding
what new training data to use. AL also reduces the training set size to a fraction of the data required
when using naive random sampling techniques. To provide validation of our AL approach we develop
the COMP6 benchmark (publicly available on GitHub), which contains a diverse set of organic molecules.
Through the AL process, it is shown that the AL-based potentials perform as well as the ANI-1 potential
on COMP6 with only 10% of the data, and vastly outperforms ANI-1 with 25% the amount of data. Finally,
we show that our proposed AL technique develops a universal ANI potential (ANI-1x) that provides
accurate energy and force predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark. This universal ML potential
achieves a level of accuracy on par with the best ML potentials for single molecule or materials,
while remaining applicable to the general class of organic molecules comprised of the elements
CHNO.
