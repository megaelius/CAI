We establish Lagrangian formulae for energy conservation anomalies involving the discrepancy
between short-time two-particle dispersion forward and backward in time. These results are facilitated
by a rigorous version of the Ott-Mann-Gaw\c{e}dzki relation, sometimes described as a "Lagrangian
analogue of the 4/5ths law". In particular, we prove that for any space-time $L^3$ weak solution
of the Euler equations, the Lagrangian forward/backward dispersion measure matches on to the energy
defect in the sense of distributions. For strong limits of $d\geq3$ dimensional Navier-Stokes
solutions the defect distribution coincides with the viscous dissipation anomaly. The Lagrangian
formula shows that particles released into a $3d$ turbulent flow will initially disperse faster
backward-in-time than forward, in agreement with recent theoretical predictions of Jucha et.
al (2014). In two dimensions, we consider strong limits of solutions of the forced Euler equations
with increasingly high-wavenumber forcing as a model of an ideal inverse cascade regime. We show
that the same Lagrangian dispersion measure matches onto the anomalous input from the infinite-frequency
force. As forcing typically acts as an energy source, this leads to the prediction that particles
in $2d$ typically disperse faster forward in time than backward, which is opposite to what occurs
in $3d$. Time-asymmetry of the Lagrangian dispersion is thereby closely tied to the direction of
the turbulent cascade, downscale in $d\geq 3$ and upscale in $d=2$. These conclusions lend support
to the conjecture of Eyink & Drivas (2015) that a similar connection holds for time-asymmetry of
Richardson two-particle dispersion and cascade direction, albeit at longer times.
