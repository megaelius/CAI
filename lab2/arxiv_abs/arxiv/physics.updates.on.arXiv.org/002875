In LHC Run 3, ALICE will increase the data taking rate significantly to continuous readout of 50 kHz
minimum bias Pb-Pb collisions. The reconstruction strategy of the online offline computing upgrade
foresees a first synchronous online reconstruction stage during data taking enabling detector
calibration, and a posterior calibrated asynchronous reconstruction stage. We present a tracking
algorithm for the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), the main tracking detector of ALICE. The reconstruction
must yield results comparable to current offline reconstruction and meet the time constraints
like in the current High Level Trigger (HLT), processing 50 times as many collisions per second as
today. It is derived from the current online tracking in the HLT, which is based on a Cellular automaton
and the Kalman filter, and we integrate missing features from offline tracking for improved resolution.
The continuous TPC readout and overlapping collisions pose new challenges: conversion to spatial
coordinates and the application of time- and location dependent calibration must happen in between
of track seeding and track fitting while the TPC occupancy increases five-fold. The huge data volume
requires a data reduction factor of 20, which imposes additional requirements: the momentum range
must be extended to identify low-pt looping tracks and a special refit in uncalibrated coordinates
improves the track model entropy encoding. Our TPC track finding leverages the potential of hardware
accelerators via the OpenCL and CUDA APIs in a shared source code for CPUs, GPUs, and both reconstruction
stages. Porting more reconstruction steps like the remainder of the TPC reconstruction and tracking
for other detectors will shift the computing balance from traditional processors to GPUs.
