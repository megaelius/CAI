The paper aims to apply the complex-octonions to explore the variable gravitational mass and energy
gradient of several particles in the external ultra-strong magnetic fields. J. C. Maxwell was the
first to introduce the algebra of quaternions to study the physical properties of electromagnetic
fields. Some scholars follow up this method in the field theories. Nowadays, they employ the complex-octonions
to analyze simultaneously the physical quantities of electromagnetic and gravitational fields,
including the field potential, field strength, field source, linear momentum, angular momentum,
torque, and force. When the octonion force is equal to zero, it is able to deduce eight independent
equilibrium equations, especially the force equilibrium equation, precession equilibrium equation,
mass continuity equation, and current continuity equation. In the force equilibrium equation,
the gravitational mass is variable. The gravitational mass is the sum of the inertial mass and a few
tiny terms. These tiny terms will be varied with not only the fluctuation of field strength and of
potential energy, but also the spatial dimension of velocity. The study reveals that it is comparatively
untoward to attempt to measure directly the variation of these tiny terms of gravitational mass
in the ultra-strong magnetic field. However it is not such difficult to measure the energy gradient
relevant to the variation of these tiny terms of gravitational mass. In the complex-octonion space,
the gravitational mass is a sort of variable physical quantity, rather than an intrinsic property
of any physical object. And this inference is accordant with the academic thought of `the mass is
not an intrinsic property any more' in the unified electro-weak theory.
