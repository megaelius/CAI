We study the stability of the Couette flow $(y,0,0)^T$ in the 3D incompressible magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) equations for a conducting fluid on $\mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T} $ in
the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field $\alpha(\sigma, 0, 1)$. We consider the inviscid,
ideal conductor limit $\textbf{Re}^{-1}$, $\textbf{R}_m^{-1} \ll 1$ and prove that for strong
and suitably oriented background fields the Couette flow is asymptotically stable to perturbations
small in the Sobolev space $H^N$. More precisely, we show that if $\alpha$ and $N$ are sufficiently
large, $\sigma \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ satisfies a generic Diophantine condition,
and the initial perturbations $u_{in}$ and $b_{in}$ to the Couette flow and magnetic field, respectively,
satisfy $\|(u_{in},b_{in})\|_{H^N} = \epsilon \ll \textbf{Re}^{-1}$, then the resulting solution
to the 3D MHD equations is global in time and the perturbation $(u(t,x+yt,y,z),b(t,x+yt,y,z))$
remains $\mathcal{O}(\textbf{Re}^{-1})$ in $H^{N'}$ for some $N'(\sigma) < N$. Our proof establishes
enhanced dissipation estimates describing the decay of the $x$-dependent modes on the timescale
$t \sim \textbf{Re}^{1/3}$, as well as inviscid damping of the velocity and magnetic field that
agrees with the optimal decay rate for the linearized system. In the Navier-Stokes case, high regularity
control on the perturbation in a coordinate system adapted to the mixing of the Couette flow is known
only under the stronger assumption $\epsilon \ll \textbf{Re}^{-3/2}$. The improvement in the
MHD setting is possible because the magnetic field induces time oscillations that partially suppress
the lift-up effect, which is the primary transient growth mechanism for the Navier-Stokes equations
linearized around the Couette flow.
