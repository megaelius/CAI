Here, we provide preliminary experimental results of the geopotential determination based on
time elapse comparisons between two remote atomic clocks located at Beijing and Wuhan, respectively.
After synchronizing two hydrogen atomic clocks at Beijing 203 Institute Laboratory (BIL) for 20
days as zero-baseline calibration, we transport one clock to Luojiashan Time-Frequency Station
(LTS), Wuhan, without stopping its running. Continuous comparisons between the two remote clocks
were conducted for 65 days based on the Common View Satellite Time Transfer (CVSTT) technique. The
ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) technique is applied to removing the uninteresting
periodic signals contaminated in the original CVSTT observations to obtain the residual clocks-offsets
series, from which the time elapse between the two remote clocks was determined. Based on the accumulated
time elapse between these two clocks the geopotential difference between these two stations was
determined. Given the orthometric height (OH) of BIL, the OH of the LTS was determined based on the
determined geopotential difference. Comparisons show that the OH of the LTS determined by time
elapse comparisons deviates from that determined by Earth gravity model EGM2008 by about 98 m. The
results are consistent with the frequency stabilities of the hydrogen atomic clocks (at the level
of $10^{-15}$/day) applied in our experiments. In addition, we used 85-days original observations
to determine the geopotential difference between two remote stations based on the CVSTT technique.
Using more precise atomic or optical clocks, the CVSTT method for geopotential determination could
be applied effectively and extensively in geodesy in the future.
