Thermal fluctuations limit the sensitivity of precision measurements ranging from laser interferometer
gravitational wave observatories to optical atomic clocks. In optical cavities, thermally induced
fluctuations of length or refractive index create frequency noise. Here we investigate a previously
unreported broadband noise process, thermal intermodulation noise, originating from the transduction
of frequency fluctuations by the inherent nonlinearity of the cavity-laser detuning response.
We show that the Brownian motion of a thin Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane in an optomechanical cavity at room
temperature, instead of transducing into the phase quadrature only, also creates intensity noise
for resonant laser excitation. We study the laser detuning dependence of this noise and also demonstrate
that its magnitude scales with the quartic power of the ratio of the optomechanical coupling rate
to the cavity linewidth. Both dependencies are in excellent agreement with our developed theoretical
model. We use a phononic crystal membrane with a low mass, soft-clamped defect mode and operate in
a regime where quantum fluctuations of radiation pressure are expected to dominate the motion of
the membrane (i.e. a nominal quantum cooperativity of unity). However, we find that the thermal
intermodulation noise exceeds the vacuum fluctuations by more than two orders of magnitude, even
within the phononic bandgap, thereby preventing the observation of ponderomotive squeezing.
Our work shows that a new noise source arises as a consequence of nonlinear cavity transduction,
which is broadly relevant to cavity-based measurements, and is especially pronounced when thermally
induced frequency fluctuations are comparable to the optical linewidth.
