Several analysis methods for nonstationary fluctuations are described and applied to the edge
localized mode (ELM) instabilities of limiter H-mode plasmas. The microwave scattering diagnostic
observes poloidal $k_{\theta}$ values of 3.3 cm$^{-1}$, averaged over a 20 cm region at the plasma
edge.A short autoregressive filter enhances the nonstationary component of the plasma fluctuations
by removing much of the background level of stationary fluctuations. Between ELMs, the spectrum
predominantly consists of broad-banded 300-700 kHz fluctuations propagating in the electron
diamagnetic drift direction, indicating the presence of a negative electric field near the plasma
edge. The time-frequency spectrogram is computed with the multiple taper technique. By using the
singular value decomposition of the spectrogram, it is shown that the spectrum during the ELM is
broader and more symmetric than that of the stationary spectrum. The ELM period and the evolution
of the spectrum between ELMs varies from discharge to discharge. For the discharge under consideration
which has distinct ELMs with a 1 msec period, the spectrum has a maximum in the electron drift direction
which relaxes to a near constant value %its characteristic shape in the first half millisecond after
the end of the ELM and then grows slowly. In contrast, the level of the fluctuations in the ion drift
direction increases exponentially by a factor of eight in the five milliseconds~after the ELM.
High frequency precursors are found which occur one millisecond before the ELMs and propagate in
the ion drift direction. These precursors are very short ($\sim 10 \mu$secs), coherent bursts,
and they predict the occurrence of an ELM with a high success rate.
