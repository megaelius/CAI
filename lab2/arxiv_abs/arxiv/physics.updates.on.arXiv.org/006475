The aim of this work is to efficiently and robustly solve the statistical inverse problem related
to the identification of the elastic properties at both macroscopic and mesoscopic scales of heterogeneous
anisotropic materials with a complex microstructure that usually cannot be properly described
in terms of their mechanical constituents at microscale. Within the context of linear elasticity
theory, the apparent elasticity tensor field at a given mesoscale is modeled by a prior non-Gaussian
tensor-valued random field. A general methodology using multiscale displacement field measurements
simultaneously made at both macroscale and mesoscale has been recently proposed for the identification
the hyperparameters of such a prior stochastic model by solving a multiscale statistical inverse
problem using a stochastic computational model and some information from displacement fields
at both macroscale and mesoscale. This paper contributes to the improvement of the computational
efficiency, accuracy and robustness of such a method by introducing (i) a mesoscopic numerical
indicator related to the spatial correlation length(s) of kinematic fields, allowing the time-consuming
global optimization algorithm (genetic algorithm) used in a previous work to be replaced with a
more efficient algorithm and (ii) an ad hoc stochastic representation of the hyperparameters involved
in the prior stochastic model in order to enhance both the robustness and the precision of the statistical
inverse identification method. Finally, the proposed improved method is first validated on in
silico materials within the framework of 2D plane stress and 3D linear elasticity (using multiscale
simulated data obtained through numerical computations) and then exemplified on a real heterogeneous
biological material (beef cortical bone) within the framework of 2D plane stress linear elasticity
(using multiscale experimental data obtained through mechanical testing monitored by digital
image correlation).
