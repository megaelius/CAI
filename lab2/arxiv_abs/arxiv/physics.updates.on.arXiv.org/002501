Perovskite solar cells are notorious for exhibiting transient behaviour not seen in conventional
inorganic semiconductor devices. Significant inroads have been made into understanding this
fact in terms of rapid ion migration, now a well-established property of the prototype photovoltaic
perovskite MAPbI$_3$ and strongly implicated in the newer mixed compositions. Here we study the
manifestations of ion migration in frequency-domain small-signal measurements, focusing on
the popular technique of Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). We provide new interpretations
for a variety of previously puzzling features, including giant photo-induced low-frequency capacitance
and negative capacitance in a variety of forms. We show that these apparently strange measurements
can be rationalized by the splitting of AC current into two components, one associated with charge-storage,
and the other with the quasi-steady-state recombination current of electrons and holes. The latter
contribution to the capacitance can take either a positive or a negative sign, and is potentially
very large when slow, voltage-sensitive processes such as ion migration are at play. Using numerical
drift-diffusion semiconductor models, we show that giant photo-induced capacitance, inductive
loop features, and low-frequency negative capacitance all emerge naturally as consequences of
ion migration via its coupling to quasi-steady-state electron and hole currents. In doing so, we
unify the understanding of EIS measurements with the comparably well-developed theory of rate
dependent current-voltage (I-V) measurements in perovskite cells. Comparing the two techniques,
we argue that EIS is more suitable for quantifying I-V hysteresis than conventional methods based
on I-V sweeps, and demonstrate this application on a variety of cell types.
