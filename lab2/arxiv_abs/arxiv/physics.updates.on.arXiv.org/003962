Having the ability to predict the nature and amounts of plutonium emissions in industrial accidents,
such as in solvent fires at PUREX nuclear reprocessing facilities, is a key concern of nuclear safety
agencies. In accident conditions and in the presence of oxygen and water vapor, plutonium is expected
to form three major volatile species $\rm{PuO_2}$, $\rm{PuO_3}$, and $\rm{PuO_2(OH)_2}$, for
which the thermodynamic data necessary for predictions (enthalpies of formation and heat capacities)
presently shows either large uncertainties or is lacking. In this work we aim to alleviate such shortcomings
by obtaining the aforementioned data via relativistic correlated electronic structure calculations
employing a two-step multireference relativistic approach, which is able to describe the multireference
character of the ground-state wavefunctions of $\rm{PuO_3}$ and $\rm{PuO_2(OH)_2}$. We benchmark
this approach by comparing it to relativistic coupled cluster calculations for the ground, ionized
and excited states of $\rm{PuO_2}$. Our results allow us to predict enthalpies of formation $\Delta_fH^\ominus(\rm{298.15~K})$
of $\rm{PuO_2}$, $\rm{PuO_3}$ and $\rm{PuO_2(OH)_2}$ to be $\rm{-449.7\pm7.6~kJ\;mol^{-1}}$,
$\rm{-553.3\pm30.5~kJ\;mol^{-1}}$, and $\rm{-1012.9\pm42.2~kJ\;mol^{-1}}$, respectively,
which confirm the predominance of plutonium dioxide, but also reveal the existence of plutonium
trioxide in gaseous phase under oxidative condition, though the partial pressures of $\rm{PuO_3}$
and $\rm{PuO_2(OH)_2}$ are nonetheless always rather low under wet atmosphere. Our calculations
also permit us to reassess prior results for $\rm{PuO_2}$, establishing the ground state of the
$\rm{PuO_2}$ molecule is mainly of $\rm{^{5}\Sigma_{g}^+}$ character, as well as to confirm the
experimental value for the adiabatic ionization energy of $\rm{PuO_2}$.
