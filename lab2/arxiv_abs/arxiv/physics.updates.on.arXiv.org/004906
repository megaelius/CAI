The modulational instability of dust-ion-acoustic (DIA) mode and associated rogue waves in a three
component dusty plasma system (containing inertial warm ion and negatively charged dust fluids
along with inertialess $q$-distributed electrons) has been theoretically investigated. A nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) has been derived by employing the reductive perturbation method.
It is observed that the dusty plasma system under consideration supports the fast and slow DIA modes,
and that the dispersion and nonlinear coefficients of the NLSE determine the parametric regimes
not only for the modulationally stable and unstable fast DIA mode, but also for the formation of the
DIA rogue waves. The parametric regimes for the modulational instability of the fast DIA mode, and
the criterion for the formation of the DIA rogue waves have been found to be significantly modified
by the effects of the relevant plasma parameters, particularly, mass and charge state of ion and
dust species, number density of the plasma species, and non-extensive parameter $q$, etc. It is
found that the modulationally stable parametric regime decreases (increases) with the increase
in the value of positive (negative) $q$. The numerical analysis has also shown that the nonlinearity
as well as the amplitude and width of the rogue waves increases (decreases) with the mass of positive
ion (negative dust grains) while decreases (increases) with the charge state of the positive ion
(negative dust). The applications of our present work in space (viz., Earth ionosphere, magnetosphere,
molecular clouds, interstellar medium, cometary tails, and planetary rings, etc.) and laboratory
plasmas have been pinpointed.
