First simulations of deuterium shattered pellet injection (SPI) into an ASDEX Upgrade H-Mode plasma
with the JOREK MHD code are presented. Resistivity is increased by one order of magnitude in most
simulations to reduce computational costs and allow for extensive parameter scans. The effect
of various physical parameters onto MHD activity and thermal quench (TQ) dynamics is studied and
the influence of MHD onto ablation is shown. TQs are obtained quickly after injection in most simulations
with a typical duration of 100 microseconds, which slows down at lower resistivity. Although the
n=1 magnetic perturbation dominates in the simulations, toroidal harmonics up to n=10 contribute
to stochastization and stochastic transport in the plasma core. The post-TQ density profile remains
hollow for a few hundred microseconds. However, when flux surfaces re-form around the magnetic
axis, the density has become monotonic again suggesting a beneficial behaviour for runaway electron
avoidance/mitigation. With $10^{21}$ atoms injected, the TQ is typically incomplete and triggered
when the shards reach the q=2 rational surface. At a larger number of injected atoms, the TQ can set
in even before the shards reach this surface. For low field side injection considered here, repeated
formation of outward convection cells is observed in the ablation region reducing material assimilation.
Responsible is a sudden rise of pressure in the high density cloud when the stochastic region expands
further releasing heat from the hot core. After the TQ, strong sheared poloidal rotation is created
by Maxwell stress, which contributes to re-formation of flux surfaces.
