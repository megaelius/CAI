Lithium niobate (LN), known as "silicon of photonics," exhibits outstanding material characteristics
with great potential for broad applications. Enhancing light-matter interaction in the nanoscopic
scale would result in intriguing device characteristics that enable revealing new physical phenomena
and realizing novel functionalities inaccessible by conventional means. High-Q two dimensional
(2D) photonic crystal (PhC) slab nanoresonators are particularly suitable for this purpose, which,
however, remains open challenge to be realized on the lithium niobate platform. Here we take an important
step towards this direction, demonstrating 2D LN PhC slab nanoresonators with optical Q as high
as $3.51 \times 10^5$, about three orders of magnitude higher than other 2D LN PhC structures reported
to date. The high optical quality, tight mode confinement, together with pure polarization characteristics
of the devices enable us to reveal peculiar anisotropy of photorefraction quenching and unique
anisotropic thermo-optic nonlinear response, which have never been reported before. They also
allow us to observe third harmonic generation for the first time in on-chip LN nanophotonic devices,
and strong orientation-dependent generation of second harmonic. The demonstrated high-Q 2D LN
PhC nanoresonators not only offer an excellent device platform for the exploration of extreme nonlinear
and quantum optics at single-photon and few-photon level, but also open up a great avenue towards
future development of large-scale integrated LN photonic circuits for energy efficient nonlinear
photonic and electro-optic signal processing.
