The process of divertor detachment, whereby heat and particle fluxes to divertor surfaces are strongly
diminished, is required to reduce heat loading and erosion in a magnetic fusion reactor to acceptable
levels. In this paper the physics leading to the decrease of the total divertor ion current (It),
or 'roll-over', is experimentally explored on the TCV tokamak through characterization of the
location, magnitude and role of the various divertor ion sinks and sources including a complete
analysis of particle and power balance. These first measurements of the profiles of divertor ionisation
and hydrogenic radiation along the divertor leg are enabled through novel spectroscopic techniques.
Over a range in TCV plasma conditions (plasma current and electron density, with/without impurity-seeding)
the $I_t$ roll-over is ascribed to a drop in the divertor ion source; recombination remains small
or negligible farther into the detachment process. The ion source reduction is driven by both a reduction
in the power available for ionization, Precl, and concurrent increase in the energy required per
ionisation, $E_{ion}$: often described as 'power starvation' (or 'power limitation'). The detachment
threshold is found experimentally (in agreement with analytic model predictions) to be $\sim P_{recl}/I_t
{E_{ion}} \sim 2$, corresponding to a target electron temperature, $T_t \sim E_{ion}/{\gamma}$
where ${\gamma}$ is the sheath transmission coefficient. The target pressure reduction, required
to reduce the target ion current, is driven both by volumetric momentum loss as well as upstream pressure
loss. The measured evolution through detachment of the divertor profile of various ion sources/sinks
as well as power losses are quantitatively reproduced through full 2D SOLPS modelling through the
detachment process as the core density is varied.
