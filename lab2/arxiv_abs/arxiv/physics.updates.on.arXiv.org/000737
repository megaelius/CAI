Surface observations indicate that the speed of the solar meridional circulation in the photosphere
varies in anti-phase with the solar cycle. The current explanation for the source of this variation
is that inflows into active regions alter the global surface pattern of the meridional circulation.
When these localized inflows are integrated over a full hemisphere, they contribute to the slow
down of the axisymmetric poleward horizontal component. The behavior of this large scale flow deep
inside the convection zone remains largely unknown. Present helioseismic techniques are not sensitive
enough to capture the dynamics of this weak large scale flow. Moreover, the large time of integration
needed to map the meridional circulation inside the convection zone, also masks some of the possible
dynamics on shorter timescales. In this work we examine the dynamics of the meridional circulation
that emerges from a 3D MHD global simulation of the solar convection zone. Our aim is to assess and
quantify the behavior of meridional circulation deep inside the convection zone, where the cyclic
large-scale magnetic field can reach considerable strength. Our analyses indicate that the meridional
circulation morphology and amplitude are both highly influenced by the magnetic field, via the
impact of magnetic torques on the global angular momentum distribution. A dynamic feature induced
by these magnetic torques is the development of a prominent upward flow at mid latitudes in the lower
convection zone that occurs near the equatorward edge of the toroidal bands and that peaks during
cycle maximum. Globally, the dynamo-generated large-scale magnetic field drives variations
in the meridional flow, in stark contrast to the conventional kinematic flux transport view of the
magnetic field being advected passively by the flow.
