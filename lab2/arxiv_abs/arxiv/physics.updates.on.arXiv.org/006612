Purpose: Free water elimination diffusion tensor imaging (FWE-DTI) has been widely used to distinguish
increases of free water (FW) partial volume effects from tissue's diffusion in healthy ageing and
degenerative diseases. Since the FWE-DTI fitting is only well posed for multi-shell acquisitions,
a regularized gradient descent (RGD) method was proposed to enable application to single-shell
data, more common in the clinic. However, the validity of the RGD method has been poorly assessed.
This study aims to quantify the specificity of FWE-DTI procedures on single- and multi-shell data.
Methods: Different FWE-DTI fitting procedures were tested on an open-source in vivo diffusion
dataset and single- and multi-shell synthetic signals, including the RGD and standard non-linear
least squares (NLS) methods. Single-voxel simulations were carried out to compare initialization
approaches. A multi-voxel phantom simulation was performed to evaluate the impact of spatial regularization
when comparing between methods. To test the algorithms' specificity, phantoms with two different
types of lesions were simulated: with increased mean diffusivity (MD) or with increased FW. Result:
Plausible parameter maps were obtained with RGD from single-shell in vivo data. The plausibility
of these maps was shown to be determined by the initialization. Tests with simulated lesions inserted
into the in vivo data revealed that the RGD approach cannot distinguish FW from tissue MD alterations,
contrarily to the NLS algorithm. Conclusion: RGD FWE-DTI has limited specificity and, thus, its
results from single-shell data should be carefully interpreted. When possible, multi-shell acquisitions
and the NLS approach should be preferred instead.
