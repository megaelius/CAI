The X-ray transform models a forward projection operator of image formation, which has been widely
used for tomographic image reconstruction. We propose a new algorithm to compute that transform
of an image represented by unit (pixel/voxel) basis functions, for various two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional
(3D) scanning geometries, such as 2D/3D parallel beam, 2D fan beam, 3D circular/helical cone beam,
etc. Since the transform is acting as a line integral, the fundamental task is to calculate this integral
of the unit basis functions, which is equivalently the intersection length of the ray with the associated
unit. For a given ray, using the support of unit basis function, we derive the sufficient and necessary
condition of non-vanishing intersectability, and obtain the analytic formula for the intersection
length, which can be used to distinguish the units that produce valid intersections with the given
ray, and then perform simple calculations only for those units. The algorithm is easy to be implemented,
and the computational cost is optimal. Moreover, we discuss the intrinsic ambiguities of the problem
itself that perhaps happen, and present a solution. The algorithm not only possesses the adaptability
with regard to the center position, scale and size of the image, and the scanning geometry as well,
but also is quite suited to parallelize with optimality. The resulting projection matrix can be
sparsely stored and output if needed, and the adjoint of X-ray transform can be also computed by the
algorithm. Finally, we validate the correctness of the algorithm by the aforementioned scanning
geometries.
