Numerical simulations are performed on a stochastic model based on Monte Carlo damage simulation
process and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to investigate the formation and evaluation of
isolated and multiple DNA damage and cellular survival by light ionizing radiation in a colony of
tumour cells. The contribution of the local clustering of the strand breaks and base damage is taken
into account while considering double-strand breaks (DSBs) as primary lesions in the DNA of the
cell nucleus induced by ionizing radiation. The model incorporates the combined effects of biological
processes such as the tumour oxygenation, cellular multiplication and mutation through various
probability distributions in a full Monte Carlo simulation of fractionated hadrontherapy. Our
results indicate that the linear and quadratic parameters of the model show a negative correlation,
for protons and helium ions, which might suggest an underlying biological mechanism. Despite using
a model with quite different descriptions of linear and quadratic parameters, the observed results
for linear parameter show largely reasonable agreement while the quadratic parameter consistent
deviations from the results obtained using the LEM model at low LET. In addition to the LET dependence,
RBE values showed a strong dependence on alpha/beta ratio and a considerable scatter for various
particle types indicate particle specific behaviour of initial its slope. The surviving curves
show a non-linear dose-response suggesting that interaction among DSBs induced by ionizing radiation
contribute significantly to the quadratic term of the model.
