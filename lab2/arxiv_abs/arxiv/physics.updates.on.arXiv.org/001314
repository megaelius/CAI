Recent advancements in the field of Fabry-Perot cavity based optical refractometry (OR), FPC-OR,
comprising the use of proposed novel methodologies based on drift-free Dual FPC-OR (DF-DFPC-OR),
have alleviated much of earlier problems with FPC-OR, in particular drifts of the cavity spacer,
and therefore open up for new levels of accurate characterization of gases. However, to be able to
use these techniques for highly accurate assessments, general and explicit expressions are needed
for how the gas density, ${\rho_n}$, is related to the refractivity of the gas, $n - 1$, and how the
latter depends on the change in frequency of laser light that follows an evacuation of the cavity,
$\Delta {\nu_l}$. This paper presents such relations that properly acknowledge the influence
of all conceivable phenomena and higher order (non-linear) contributions to the assessment of
these entities under drift-free conditions. The relative contributions of each of these phenomena
to measurements of gas refractivity and density are individually assessed. It is shown, among other
things, that, the influence of cavity deformation is larger for an open cavity (placed in a compartment
in which gas is introduced) than a closed one; if not accounted for appropriately, under standard
pressure and temperature conditions it can contribute to the accuracy of the technique with up to
a few times 10$^{-3}$ if an open cavity is used, while it can be an order of magnitude smaller, i.e.
in the order of 10$^{-4}$, for a well-designed closed cavity. It is also shown that the non-linearities
from dispersion are smaller for the cases when relocking takes place than when it is not used. The
expressions derived can serve as a basis for assessment of refractivity or gas density, and changes
in such, in future realizations of OR in such a way that they can fully benefit from the extraordinary
power of DF-DFPC-OR.
