Microwave digital communication at interstellar distances applies to starship and extraterrestrial
civilization (SETI and METI) communication. Large distances demand large transmitted power and/or
large antennas, while the propagation is transparent over a wide bandwidth. Recognizing a fundamental
tradeoff, reduced energy delivered to the receiver at the expense of wide bandwidth (the opposite
of terrestrial objectives) is advantageous. Wide bandwidth also results in simpler design and
implementation, allowing circumvention of dispersion and scattering arising in the interstellar
medium and motion effects and obviating any related processing. The minimum energy delivered to
the receiver per bit of information is determined by cosmic microwave background alone. By mapping
a single bit onto a carrier burst, the Morse code invented for the telegraph in 1836 comes closer to
this minimum energy than approaches used in modern terrestrial radio. Rather than the terrestrial
approach of adding phases and amplitudes to increases information capacity while minimizing bandwidth,
adding multiple time-frequency locations for carrier bursts increases capacity while minimizing
energy per information bit. The resulting location code is extremely simple and yet can approach
the minimum energy as bandwidth is expanded. It is consistent with easy discovery, since carrier
bursts are energetic and straightforward modifications to post-detection pattern recognition
can identify burst patterns. The interstellar coherence hole captures the time and frequency coherence
constraints, and observations of the environment by transmitter and receiver constrain the burst
parameters and limit the search scope.
