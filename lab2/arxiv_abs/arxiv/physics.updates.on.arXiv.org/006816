Detachment, an important mechanism for reducing target heat deposition, is achieved through reductions
in power, particle and momentum; which are induced through plasma-atom and plasma-molecule interactions.
Experimental research in how those reactions precisely contribute to detachment is limited. In
this work, we investigate a new spectroscopic technique to utilise Hydrogen Balmer line measurements
to 1) disentangle the Balmer line emission from the various plasma-atom and plasma-molecule interactions;
and 2) quantify their contributions to ionisation, recombination and radiative power losses.
During detachment, the observed $H\alpha$ emission often strongly increases, which could be an
indicator for plasma-molecule interactions involving $H_2^+$ and/or $H^-$. Our analysis technique
quantifies the $H\alpha$ emission due to plasma-molecule interactions and uses this to 1) quantify
the Balmer line emission contribution due to $H_2^+$ and/or $H^-$; 2) subsequently estimate its
resulting particle sinks/sources and radiative power losses. Its performance is verified using
synthetic diagnostic techniques of both detached TCV and MAST-U SOLPS-ITER simulations. Experimental
results of this technique on TCV data show a bifurcation occurs between the measured total $H\alpha$
and the atomic estimate of $H\alpha$ emission, indicative of the presence of additional $H\alpha$
due to plasma-molecule interactions with $H_2^+$ (and/or $H^-$). An example analysis shows that
the hydrogenic line series, even $Ly\alpha$ as well as the medium-n Balmer lines can be significantly
influenced by plasma-molecule interactions by tens of percent during which significant Molecular
Activated Recombination (MAR) is expected.
