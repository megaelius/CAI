A grouping-circular-based (GCB) greedy algorithm is proposed to promote the efficiency of mesh
deformation. By incorporating the multigrid concept that the computational errors on the fine
mesh can be approximated with those on the coarse mesh, this algorithm stochastically divides all
boundary nodes into $m$ groups and uses the locally maximum radial basis functions (RBF) interpolation
error of each group as an approximation to the globally maximum one of all boundary nodes in each iterative
procedure for reducing the RBF support nodes. For this reason, it avoids the interpolation conducted
at all boundary nodes and thus reduces the corresponding computational complexity from $O\left({N_c^2{N_b}}
\right)$ to $O\left( {N_c^3} \right)$. Besides, after $m$ iterations, the interpolation errors
of all boundary nodes are computed once, thus allowing all boundary nodes can contribute to error
control. Two canonical deformation problems of the ONERA M6 wing and the DLR-F6 Wing-Body-Nacelle-Pylon
configuration are computed to validate the GCB greedy algorithm. The computational results show
that the GCB greedy algorithm is able to remarkably promote the efficiency of computing the interpolation
errors in the data reducing procedure by dozens of times. Because an increase of $m$ results in an
increase of $N_c$, an appropriate range of $\left[ {{N_b}/{N_c},{\rm{ }}2{N_b}/{N_c}}\right]$
for $m$ is suggested to prevent too much additional computations for solving the linear algebraic
system and computing the displacements of volume nodes induced by the increase of $N_c $. The results
also show that the GCB greedy algorithm tends to generate a more significant efficiency improvement
for mesh deformation when a larger-scale mesh is applied.
