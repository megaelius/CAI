We present a new general model for the prediction of the drag coefficient of non-spherical solid
particles of regular and irregular shapes falling in gas or liquid valid for sub-critical particle
Reynolds numbers (i.e. $Re < 3 \times 10^5$). Results are obtained from experimental measurements
on 300 regular and irregular particles in the air and analytical solutions for ellipsoids. Depending
on their size, irregular particles are accurately characterized with a 3D laser scanner or SEM micro-CT
method. The experiments are carried out in settling columns with height of 0.45 to 3.60m and in a 4m-high
vertical wind tunnel. In addition, $881$ additional experimental data points are also considered
that are compiled from the literature for particles of regular shapes falling in liquids. New correlation
is based on the particle Reynolds number and two new shape descriptors defined as a function of particle
flatness, elongation and diameter. New shape descriptors are easy-to-measure and can be more easily
characterized than sphericity. The new correlation has an average error of $\sim 10\%$, which is
significantly lower than errors associated with existing correlations. Additional aspects of
particle sedimentation is also investigated. First, it is found that particles falling in dense
liquids, in particular at $Re>1000$, tend to fall with their maximum projection area perpendicular
to their falling direction, whereas in gases their orientation is random. Second, effects of small-scale
surface vesicularity and roughness on the drag coefficient of non-spherical particles found to
be $<10\%$. Finally, the effect of particle orientation on the drag coefficient is discussed and
additional correlations are presented to predict the end members of drag coefficient due to change
in the particle orientation.
