Although an increased availability of computational resources has enabled high-fidelity simulations
of turbulent flows, the RANS models are still the dominant tools for industrial applications. However,
the predictive capabilities of RANS models are limited by potential inaccuracy driven by hypotheses
in the Reynolds stress closure. Recently, a Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) approach
has been proposed to learn the functional form of Reynolds stress discrepancy in RANS simulations
based on available data. It has been demonstrated that the learned discrepancy function can be used
to improve Reynolds stresses in different flows where data are not available. However, owing to
a number of challenges, the improvements have been demonstrated only in the Reynolds stress prediction
but not in the corresponding propagated quantities of interest. In this work, we introduce the procedures
toward a complete PIML framework for predictive turbulence modeling, including learning Reynolds
stress discrepancy function, predicting Reynolds stresses in different flows, and propagating
to mean flow fields. The process of Reynolds stress propagation and predictive accuracy of the propagated
velocity field are investigated. To improve the learning-prediction performance, the input features
are enriched based on an integrity basis of invariants. The fully developed turbulent flow in a square
duct is used as the test case. The discrepancy model is trained on flow fields obtained from several
Reynolds numbers and evaluated on a duct flow at a Reynolds number higher than any of the training
cases. The predicted Reynolds stresses are propagated to velocity field through RANS equations.
Numerical results show excellent predictive performances in both Reynolds stresses and their
propagated velocities, demonstrating the merits of the PIML approach in predictive turbulence
modeling.
