Adaptive networks are a versatile approach to model phenomena such as contagion and spreading dynamics,
critical transitions and structure formation that emerge from the dynamic coevolution of complex
network structure and node states. Here, we study critical transitions in contagion dynamics on
multilayer adaptive networks with dynamic node states and present an application to the governance
of sustainable resource use. We focus on a three layer adaptive network model, where a polycentric
governance network interacts with a social network of resource users which in turn interacts with
an ecological network of renewable resources. We uncover that sustainability is favored for slow
interaction timescales, large homophilic network adaptation rate (as long it is below the fragmentation
threshold) and high taxation rates. Interestingly, we also observe a trade-off between an eco-dictatorship
(reduced model with a single governance actor that always taxes unsustainable resource use) and
the polycentric governance network of multiple actors. In the latter setup, sustainability is
enhanced for low but hindered for high tax rates compared to the eco-dictatorship case. These results
highlight mechanisms generating emergent critical transitions in contagion dynamics on multilayer
adaptive network and show how these can be understood and approximated analytically, relevant
for understanding complex adaptive systems from various disciplines ranging from physics and
epidemiology to sociology and global sustainability science. The paper also provides insights
into potential critical intervention points for policy in the form of taxes in the governance of
sustainable renewable resource use that can inform more process-detailed social-ecological
modeling.
