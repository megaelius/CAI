Elliptic nozzle geometry is attractive for mixing enhancement of supersonic jets. However, jet
dynamics, such as flapping, gives rise to high-intensity tonal sound. We experimentally manipulate
the supersonic elliptic jet morphology by using two sharp-tipped lobes. The lobes are placed on
either end of the minor axis in an elliptic nozzle. The design Mach number and the aspect ratio of the
elliptic nozzle and the lobed nozzle are 2.0 and 1.65. The supersonic jet is exhausted into ambient
at almost perfectly expanded conditions. Time-resolved schlieren imaging, longitudinal and
cross-sectional planar laser Mie-scattering imaging, planar Particle Image Velocimetry, and
near-field microphone measurements are performed to assess the fluidic behavior of the two nozzles.
Dynamic Mode and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (DMD and POD) analysis are carried out on the schlieren
and the Mie-scattering images. Mixing characteristics are extracted from the Mie-scattering
images through the image processing routines. The flapping elliptic jet consists of two dominant
DMD modes, while the lobed nozzle has only one dominant mode, and the flapping is suppressed. Microphone
measurements show the associated noise reduction. The jet column bifurcates in the lobed nozzle
enabling a larger surface contact area with the ambient fluid and higher mixing rates in the near-field
of the nozzle exit. The jet width growth rate of the two-lobed nozzle is about twice as that of the elliptic
jet in the near-field, and there is a 40\% reduction in the potential core length. Particle Image
Velocimetry (PIV) contours substantiate the results.
