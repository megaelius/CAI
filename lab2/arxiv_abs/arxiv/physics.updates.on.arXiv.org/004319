Pedestrian crowding occurs more frequent. As a result of the increasing pedestrian demand in public
space, the limits of pedestrian spaces are of increasing interest. Some research on the maximum
demand that can flow through a cross-section has been presented, which mainly features simple movement
base cases, low-density situations and/or a homogeneous crowd. Consequently, it is currently
unclear to what extent their findings apply to heterogeneous high-density crowds, which are often
encountered during real-world scenarios. The CrowdLimits experiment attempted to reproduce
crowd movement dynamics of heterogeneous crowds experiencing higher densities than have been
recorded up to this moment. Here, the aim was to study the impact of the three important differences
between the current laboratory studies and real-world crowd dynamics in crowded pedestrian spaces
simultaneously, namely crowd heterogeneity, high densities movements, and (more) complex movement
base cases. This study shows that there are substantial differences in the maximum sustainable
flow rate, and the maximum local and global sustainable density for distinct movement base cases
and flow ratios. Moreover, the results provide evidence of that continuation of flow under very
high densities can be recreated under laboratory conditions using a heterogeneous population
of pedestrians. Besides, the experimental results indicate that the maximum global flow rate decreases
when the scenario becomes more difficult (i.e. bidirectional to intersecting) and the collision
avoidance opportunities decrease (i.e. 80-20 to 50-50 flow ratio). Thus, this paper concludes
that the maximum flow rate of pedestrian infrastructures decreases with increasing complexity.
