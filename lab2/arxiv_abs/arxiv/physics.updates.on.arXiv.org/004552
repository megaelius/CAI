Scintillating NaI(Tl) crystals are widely used in a large variety of experimental applications.
However, for the use as Dark Matter (DM) detectors, such crystals demand a high level of radio-purity,
not achievable by means of standard industrial techniques. One of the main difficulties comes from
the presence of potassium that always accompanies sodium in alkali halides. On the other hand, the
arguable DM detection by DAMA experiment using NaI(Tl) scintillating crystals requires a reliable
verification able to either confirm the existence of DM or rule out the DAMA claim. Ultra-low radioactivity
NaI(Tl) crystals, particularly with very low potassium content, are therefore indispensable
to overcome the current stalemate in Dark Matter searches. Nonetheless, apart from DAMA-LIBRA
experiments, to date, no other experiment has succeeded in building a detector from NaI(Tl) crystals
with potassium content of ppb level. This work describes recent results in the preparation of ultra-radio-pure
NaI(Tl) crystals using a modified Bridgman method. A double-walled platinum crucible technique
has been designed and reliability tests show that 5 ppb of potassium in the NaI(Tl) crystals of 2 and
3 inches in diameter can be achieved starting from NaI powder with potassium content of the order
of 10 ppb. The potassium excess is segregated in the tail-side of the as grown ingot where measured
potassium concentration is above 20 ppb. The purifying effect of Bridgman growth for larger NaI(Tl)
crystals is currently being tested. The work also reports on scintillation parameters of our NaI(Tl)
crystals measured in a dedicated setup conceived for naked, hygroscopic crystals. The reproducible
and reliable production of ultra-low radioactivity NaI(Tl) crystals reported in this work will
hopefully spur the construction of new DM search experiments and, anyway, clarify the controversial
DAMA-LIBRA results.
