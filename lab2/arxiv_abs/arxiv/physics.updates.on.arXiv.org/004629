This paper presents the response of the ionosphere during the intense geomagnetic storms of October
12-20, 2016 and May 26-31, 2017 which occurred during the declining phase of the solar cycle 24. Total
Electron Content (TEC) from GPS measured at Indore, Calcutta and Siliguri having geomagnetic dips
varying from 32.23{\deg}N, 32{\deg}N and 39.49{\deg}N respectively and at the International
GNSS Service (IGS) stations at Lucknow (beyond anomaly crest), Hyderabad (between geomagnetic
equator and northern crest of EIA) and Bangalore (near magnetic equator) in the Indian longitude
zone have been used for the storms. Prominent peaks in diurnal maximum in excess of 20-45 TECU over
the quiet time values were observed during the October 2016 storm at Lucknow, Indore, Hyderabad,
Bangalore and 10-20 TECU for the May 2017 storm at Siliguri, Indore, Calcutta and Hyderabad. The
GUVI images onboard TIMED spacecraft that measures the thermospheric O/N2 ratio, showed high values
(O/N2 ratio of about 0.7) on October 16 when positive storm effects were observed compared to the
other days during the storm period. The observed features have been explained in terms of the O/N2
ratio increase in the equatorial thermosphere, CIR-induced High Speed Solar Wind (HSSW) event
for the October 2016 storm. The TEC enhancement has also been explained in terms of the Auroral Electrojet
(AE), neutral wind values obtained from the Horizontal Wind Model (HWM14) and equatorial electrojet
strength from magnetometer data for both October 2016 and May 2017 storms. These results are one
of the first to be reported from the Indian longitude sector on influence of CME- and CIR-driven geomagnetic
storms on TEC during the declining phase of solar cycle 24.
