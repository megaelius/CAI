We believe that the extreme solar modulation of 3-60 MeV Galactic electrons measured by Voyager
in the heliosheath and the interpretation of this new data in terms of the rigidity dependence of
the diffusion coefficient at low rigidities presented in this paper represents a major step in understanding
diffusion theory as it applies to energetic particles. This description uses electron spectra
measured at 5 different epochs and distances within the heliosheath. The diffusion dependence
needed to explain the remarkable solar modulation effects observed for both electrons and higher
rigidity protons as one progresses from the heliopause inward by ~25 AU to the termination shock
really has two distinct rigidity regimes. Above a rigidity ~Pc the diffusion coefficient has a dependence
~beta P, the modulation is ~P and its magnitude increases linearly with radius in AU according to
the integral of dr/K. This integral defines a potential, beta, called the modulation potential,
thus explaining the proton variations. At rigidities <Pc, the diffusion coefficient is ~beta and
independent of rigidity. The modulation is also independent of rigidity but its magnitude depends
on the modulation potential, thus explaining the electron modulation. One needs both electron
and proton observations, together, to recognize the physical description of the solar modulation
process. For the first time we have been able, using proton data at high rigidities and electron data
at low rigidities, to put together a picture of the high and low rigidity diffusion coefficients
and how they affect energetic particles in an astrophysical scale environment.
