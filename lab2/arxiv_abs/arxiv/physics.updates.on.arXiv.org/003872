Aims. We use Hermite splines to interpolate pressure and its derivatives simultaneously, thereby
preserving mathematical relations between the derivatives. The method therefore guarantees
that thermodynamic identities are obeyed even between mesh points. In addition, our method enables
an estimation of the precision of the interpolation by comparing the Hermite-spline results with
those of frequent cubic (B-) spline interpolation. Methods. We have interpolated pressure as a
function of temperature and density with quintic Hermite 2D-splines. The Hermite interpolation
requires knowledge of pressure and its first and second derivatives at every mesh point. To obtain
the partial derivatives at the mesh points, we used tabulated values if given or else thermodynamic
equalities, or, if not available, values obtained by differentiating B-splines. Results. The
results were obtained with the grid of the SAHA-S equation-of-state (EOS) tables. The maximum $lg
P$ difference lies in the range from $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-4}$, and $\Gamma_1$ difference varies from
$10^{-9}$ to $10^{-3}$. Specifically, for the points of a solar model, the maximum differences
are one order of magnitude smaller than the aforementioned values. The poorest precision is found
in the dissociation and ionization regions, occurring at $T \sim 1.5\cdot 10^3 - 10^5$ K. The best
precision is achieved at higher temperatures, $T>10^5$ K. To discuss the significance of the interpolation
errors we compare them with the corresponding difference between two different equation-of-state
formalisms, SAHA-S and OPAL 2005. We find that the interpolation errors of the pressure are a few
orders of magnitude less than the differences from between the physical formalisms, which is particularly
true for the solar-model points.
