Elastic strain energy released during shear failure in rock is partially spent as fracture energy
$\Gamma$ to propagate the rupture further. $\Gamma$ is dissipated within the rupture tip process
zone, and includes energy dissipated as off-fault damage, $\Gamma_\mathrm{off}$. Quantifying
off-fault damage formed during rupture is crucial to understand its effect on rupture dynamics
and slip-weakening processes behind the rupture tip, and its contribution to seismic radiation.
Here, we quantify $\Gamma_\mathrm{off}$ and associated change in off-fault mechanical properties
during and after quasi-static and dynamic rupture. We do so by performing dynamic and quasi-static
shear failure experiments on intact Lanh\'elin granite under triaxial conditions. We quantify
the change in elastic moduli around the fault from time-resolved 3D $P$-wave velocity tomography
obtained during and after failure. We measure the off-fault microfracture damage after failure.
From the tomography, we observe a localised maximum 25\% drop in $P$-wave velocity around the shear
failure interface for both quasi-static and dynamic failure. Microfracture density data reveals
a damage zone width of around 10 mm after quasi-static failure, and 20 mm after dynamic failure. Microfracture
densities obtained from $P$-wave velocity tomography models using an effective medium approach
are in good agreement with the measured off-fault microfracture damage. $\Gamma_\mathrm{off}$
obtained from off-fault microfracture measurements is around 3 kJm$^{2}$ for quasi-static rupture,
and 5.5 kJm$^{2}$ for dynamic rupture. We argue that rupture velocity determines damage zone width
for slip up to a few mm, and that shear fracture energy $\Gamma$ increases with increasing rupture
velocity.
