An eight element, compact Ultra Wideband-Multiple Input Multiple Output (UWB-MIMO) antenna capable
of providing high data rates for future Fifth Generation (5G) terminal equipments along with the
provision of necessary bandwidth for Third Generation (3G) and Fourth Generation (4G) communications
that accomplishes band rejection from 4.85 to 6.35 GHz by deploying a Inductor Capacitor (LC) stub
on the ground plane is presented. The incorporated stub also provides flexibility to reject any
selected band as well as bandwidth control. The orthogonal placement of the printed monopoles permits
polarization diversity and provides high isolation. In the proposed eight element UWB-MIMO/diversity
antenna, monopole pair 3-4 are 180o mirrored transform of monopole pair 1-2 which lie on the opposite
corners of a planar 50 x 50 mm2 substrate. Four additional monopoles are then placed perpendicularly
to the same board leading to a total size of 50 x 50 x 25 mm3 only. The simulated results are validated
by comparing the measurements of a fabricated prototype. It was concluded that the design meets
the target specifications over the entire bandwidth of 2 to 12 GHz with a reflection coefficient
better than -10 dB (except the rejected band), isolation more than 17 dB, low envelope correlation,
low gain variation, stable radiation pattern, and strong rejection of the signals in the Wireless
Local Area Network (WLAN) band. Overall, compact and reduced complexity of the proposed eight element
architecture, strengthens its practical viability for the diversity applications in future 5G
terminal equipments amongst other MIMO antennas designs present in the literature.
