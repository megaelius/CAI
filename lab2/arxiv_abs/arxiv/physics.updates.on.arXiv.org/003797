Genetic and environmental factors are traditionally seen as the sole causes of congenital anomalies.
In this paper we introduce a third possible cause, namely random "manufacturing" discrepancies
with respect to ``design'' values. A clear way to demonstrate the existence of this component is
to ``shut'' the two others and to see whether or not there is remaining variability. Perfect clones
raised under well controlled laboratory conditions fulfill the conditions for such a test. Carried
out for four different species, the test reveals a variability remainder of the order of 10%-20%
in terms of coefficient of variation. As an example, the CV of the volume of E.coli bacteria immediately
after binary fission is of the order of 10%. In short, ``manufacturing'' discrepancies occur randomly,
even when no harmful mutation or environmental factors are involved. Not surprisingly, there is
a strong connection between congenital defects and infant mortality. In the wake of birth there
is a gradual elimination of defective units and this screening accounts for the post-natal fall
of infant mortality. Apart from this trend, post-natal death rates also have humps and peaks associated
with various inabilities and defects.\qL In short, infant mortality rates convert the case-by-case
and mostly qualitative problem of congenital malformations into a global quantitative effect
which, so to say, summarizes and registers what goes wrong in the embryonic phase. Based on the natural
assumption that for simple organisms (e.g. rotifers) the manufacturing processes are shorter
than for more complex organisms (e.g. mammals), fewer congenital anomalies are expected. Somehow,
this feature should be visible on the infant mortality rate. How this conjecture can be tested is
outlined in our conclusion.
