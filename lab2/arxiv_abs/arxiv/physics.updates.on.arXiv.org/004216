Continuous data assimilation (CDA) is successfully implemented for the first time for efficient
dynamical downscaling of a global atmospheric reanalysis. A comparison of the performance of CDA
with the standard grid and spectral nudging techniques for representing long- and short-scale
features in the downscaled fields using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is further
presented and analyzed. The WRF model is configured at 25km horizontal resolution and is driven
by 250km initial and boundary conditions from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis fields. Downscaling experiments
are performed over a one-month period in January, 2016. The similarity metric is used to evaluate
the performance of the downscaling methods for large and small scales. Similarity results are compared
for the outputs of the WRF model with different downscaling techniques, NCEP reanalysis, and Final
Analysis. Both spectral nudging and CDA describe better the small-scale features compared to grid
nudging. The choice of the wave number is critical in spectral nudging; increasing the number of
retained frequencies generally produced better small-scale features, but only up to a certain
threshold after which its solution gradually became closer to grid nudging. CDA maintains the balance
of the large- and small-scale features similar to that of the best simulation achieved by the best
spectral nudging configuration, without the need of a spectral decomposition. The different downscaled
atmospheric variables, including rainfall distribution, with CDA is most consistent with the
observations. The Brier skill score values further indicate that the added value of CDA is distributed
over the entire model domain. The overall results clearly suggest that CDA provides an efficient
new approach for dynamical downscaling by maintaining better balance between the global model
and the downscaled fields.
