In recent years, commercial HTS superconductors have gained an increasing interest for their use
in applications involving large-scale superconductor systems. These systems are typically made
from hundreds to thousands of turns of conductors. Due to the large number of turns, the simulations
of a whole system can become prohibitive in terms of computing time and load. Therefore, an efficient
strategy which does not compromise the accuracy of calculations is needed. Recently, a method,
based on a multi-scale approach, showed that the computational load can be lowered by simulating,
in detail, only several significant tapes from the system. The main limitation of this approach
is the inaccuracy of the estimation of the background magnetic field. To address this issue, we consider
the following two complementary strategies. The first strategy consists in the iterative implementation
of the multi-scale method. The multi-scale method solves itself a dynamic problem, the iterative
implementation proposed here is the iterative application of the multi-scale method, and a dynamic
solution is obtained at each iteration. The second strategy is a new interpolation method for current
distributions, based on the inverse cumulative density function interpolation technique. With
respect to conventional interpolation methods, a more realistic current density distribution
is then obtained, which allows for a better estimation of the background magnetic field, and consequently,
a better estimation of the hysteresis losses. In contrast with previous works, here we do not focus
only on the estimation of the hysteresis losses, but also the estimation of background field and
the current density distribution is addressed.
