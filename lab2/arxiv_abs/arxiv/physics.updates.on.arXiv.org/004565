The risk of conflict is exasperated by a multitude of internal and external factors. Current multivariate
analysis paints diverse causal risk profiles that vary with time. However, these profiles evolve
and a universal model to understand that evolution remains absent. Most of the current conflict
analysis is data-driven and conducted at the individual country or region level, often in isolation.
Consistent consideration of multi-scale interactions and their non-linear dynamics is missing.
Here, we develop a multiplexed network model, where each city is modelled as a non-linear bi-stable
system with stable states in either war or peace. The causal factor categories which exasperate
the risk of conflict are each modelled as a network layer. We consider 3 layers: (1) core geospatial
network of interacting cities reflecting ground level interactions, (2) cultural network of interacting
countries reflecting cultural groupings, and (3) political network of interacting countries
reflecting alliances. Together, they act as drivers to push cities towards or pull cities away from
war. Using a variety of data sources relative to 2002-2016, we show, that our model correctly predicts
the transitions from war to peace and peace to war with F1 score of 0.78 to 0.92 worldwide at the city
scale resolution. As many conflicts during this period are auto-regressive (e.g. the War on Terror
in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Narco War across the Americas), we can predict the emergence of new war
or new peace. We demonstrate successful predictions across a wide range of conflict genres and we
perform causal discovery by identifying which model component led to the correct prediction. In
the cases of Somalia (2008-13), Myanmar (2013-15), Colombia (2011-14), Libya (2014-16), and Yemen
(2011-13) we identify the set of most likely causal factors and how it may differ across a country
and change over time.
