High energy particle accelerators have been crucial in providing a deeper understanding of fundamental
particles and the forces that govern their interactions. In order to increase the energy or reduce
the size of the accelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield acceleration,
in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong electric fields, is one such promising
novel acceleration technique. Pioneering experiments have shown that an intense laser pulse or
electron bunch traversing a plasma, drives electric fields of 10s GV/m and above. These values are
well beyond those achieved in conventional RF accelerators which are limited to ~0.1 GV/m. A limitation
of laser pulses and electron bunches is their low stored energy, which motivates the use of multiple
stages to reach very high energies. The use of proton bunches is compelling, as they have the potential
to drive wakefields and accelerate electrons to high energy in a single accelerating stage. The
long proton bunches currently available can be used, as they undergo self-modulation, a particle-plasma
interaction which longitudinally splits the bunch into a series of high density microbunches,
which then act resonantly to create large wakefields. The AWAKE experiment at CERN uses intense
bunches of protons, each of energy 400 GeV, with a total bunch energy of 19 kJ, to drive a wakefield
in a 10 m long plasma. Bunches of electrons are injected into the wakefield formed by the proton microbunches.
This paper presents measurements of electrons accelerated up to 2 GeV at AWAKE. This constitutes
the first demonstration of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. The potential for this
scheme to produce very high energy electron bunches in a single accelerating stage means that the
results shown here are a significant step towards the development of future high energy particle
accelerators.
