Molecular specific photonic localization is a sensitive technique to probe the structural alterations
or abnormalities in a cell such as abnormalities due to alcohol or other drugs. Alcohol consumption
during pregnancy by mother, or fetal alcoholism, is one of the major factors of mental retardation
in children. Fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder are awful
outcomes of the maternal alcohol consumption linked with notable cognitive and behavioral defects.
Alcohol consumed by the pregnant mother, being teratogenic, interferes with the fetal health resulting
brain damage and other birth defects. This might affect the brain cells at the very nanolevel which
cannot be predicted by the present histopathological procedures. We perform quantification of
nanoscale spatial structural alterations in two different spatial molecular components, DNA
and histone molecular mass densities, in brain cell nuclei of fetal alcohol effected (FAE) pups
at postnatal day 60. Confocal images of the brain cells are collected and the degree of morphological
alterations in DNA and histone, in terms of mass density fluctuations are obtained using the recently
developed molecular specific light or photonic localization analysis technique. The results
show an increase in degree of spatial structural disorder in DNA and a reduced histone modification.
Increase in spatial disorder in DNA may suggest DNA unwinding and possibly responsible for increase
in gene expression. Reduced histone modification may suggest its release from the DNA and help in
the unwinding of DNA and gene expression. The probable cause for structural disorder as well as opposite
rearrangements for DNA and histone molecules in fetal alcohol effects is also discussed.
