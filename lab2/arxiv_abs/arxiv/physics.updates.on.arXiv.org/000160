A linearized energy-balance model for global temperature is formulated, featuring a scale-free
long-range memory (LRM) response and stochastic forcing representing the influence on the ocean
heat reservoir from atmospheric weather systems. The model is parametrized by an effective response
strength, the stochastic forcing strength, and the memory exponent. The instrumental global surface
temperature record and the deterministic component of the forcing are used to estimate these parameters
by means of the maximum-likelihood method. The residual obtained by subtracting the deterministic
solution from the observed record is analyzed as a noise process and shown to be consistent with a
long-memory time-series model and inconsistent with a short-memory model. By decomposing the
forcing record in contributions from solar, volcanic, and anthropogenic activity one can estimate
the contribution of each to 20'th century global warming. The LRM model is applied with a reconstruction
of the forcing for the last millennium to predict the large-scale features of northern hemisphere
temperature reconstructions, and the analysis of the residual also clearly favors the LRM model
on millennium time scale. The decomposition of the forcing shows that volcanic aerosols give a considerably
greater contribution to the cooling during the Little Ice Age than the reduction in solar irradiance
associated with the Maunder minimum in solar activity. The LRM model implies a transient climate
response in agreement with IPCC AR4 projections, but the stronger response on longer time scales
suggests to replace the notion of equilibrium climate sensitivity by a time-scale dependent sensitivity.
