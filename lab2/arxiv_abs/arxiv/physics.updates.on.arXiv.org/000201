The characteristics of the hydro-thermal flow which occurs when a cold fluid is injected into a hot
fractured bedrock depend on the morphology of the fracture. We consider a sharp triangular asperity,
invariant in one direction, perturbing an otherwise flat fracture. We investigate its influence
on the macroscopic hydraulic transmissivity and heat transfer efficiency, at fixed low Reynolds
number. In this study, numerical simulations are done with a coupled lattice Boltzmann method that
solves both the complete Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion equations in three dimensions.
The results are compared with those obtained under lubrication approximations which rely on many
hypotheses and neglect the three-dimensional (3D) effects. The lubrication results are obtained
by analytically solving the Stokes equation and a two-dimensional (integrated over the thickness)
advection-diffusion equation. We use a lattice Boltzmann method with a double distribution (for
mass and energy transport) on hypercubic and cubic lattices. Beyond some critical slope for the
boundaries, the velocity profile is observed to be far from a quadratic profile in the vicinity of
the sharp asperity: the fluid within the triangular asperity is quasi-static. We find that taking
account of both the 3D effects and the cooling of the rock, are important for the thermal exchange.
Neglecting these effects with lubrication approximations results in overestimating the heat
exchange efficiency. The evolution of the temperature over time, towards steady state, also shows
complex behavior: some sites alternately reheat and cool down several times, making it difficult
to forecast the extracted heat.
