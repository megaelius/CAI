Many astrophysical environments such as X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei, and accretion
disks of compact objects have photoionized plasmas. The strong photoionizing environment found
near these bright X-ray sources can be produced in a scaled laboratory experiment, and direct measurements
can form a testbed for spectroscopic models and photoionization codes used in analysis of these
astrophysical objects. Such scaled experiments are currently being conducted using Ne filled
gas cells on the Z-facility as part of the Z Astrophysical Plasma Properties (ZAPP) collaboration.
The plasma is diagnosed using a pressure sensor for density and X-ray absorption spectroscopy for
charge-state distribution. The electron temperature is presently inferred from a Li-like ion
level population ratio, but it is necessary to obtain an independent temperature measurement,
as photoionization alters the charge state distribution and can therefore cause errors in temperatures
obtained via line ratio techniques. Optical Thomson scattering is a fitting diagnostic because
it directly probes the distribution of plasma particle velocities with respect to a central probe
frequency. It is a powerful diagnostic which can produce time and space resolved measurements of
electron temperature, as well as, electron density, ion temperature, and average ionization.
In this paper, we explore a possible design for an optical Thomson scattering system to supplement
X-ray spectroscopic measurements. The proposed design will use equipment that is available on
Z, though not yet assembled. Both the feasibility and impact of this new diagnostic are assessed
by simulating expected spectra for a range of plasma parameters, thereby demonstrating the sensitivity
of this diagnostic.
