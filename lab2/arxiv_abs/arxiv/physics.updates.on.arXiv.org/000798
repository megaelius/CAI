The Micromegas technology is one of the most successful MPGD concepts and widely utilized in nuclear
and particle physics experiments. Twenty years of research and development rendered the technology
sufficiently mature to be selected as precision tracking detector for the New Small Wheel (NSW)
upgrade of the ATLAS Muon spectrometer. This will be the first large scale application of Micromegas
in one of the major LHC experiments. The studies on signal formation in Micromegas focuses on the
microscopic signal electron loss mechanisms and the amplification processes in electron gas interaction.
Based on a model of detector parameter dependencies, these processes are scrutinized in an iterating
comparison between exper- imental results, theory prediction of the macroscopic observables
and process simulation on the microscopic level. Utilizing the specialized detectors developed
in the scope of this thesis as well as refined simulation algorithms, an unprecedented level of accuracy
in the process description is reached, deepening the understanding of the fundamental process
in gaseous detectors. The second part is dedicated to the challenges arising with the large scale
Micro- megas production for the ATLAS NSW. A selection of technological choices, are discussed
alongside a final report on two production related tasks addressing the detectors core components:
For the industrial production of resistive anode PCBs a detailed quality control (QC) and quality
assurance (QA) scheme as well as the therefore required testing tools have been developed. In parallel
the study on micromesh parameter optimization and production feasibility resulted in the selection
of the proposed mesh by the NSW community. The successful completion of both tasks were important
milestones towards the construction of large size Micromegas detectors clearing the path for NSW
series production.
