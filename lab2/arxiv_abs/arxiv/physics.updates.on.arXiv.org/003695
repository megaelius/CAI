Self-organization of kinesin-driven, microtubule-based 3D active fluids relies on the collective
dynamics of single microtubules. However, the connection between macroscopic fluid flows and
microscopic motion of microtubules remains unclear. In this work, the motion of single microtubules
was characterized by means of 2D gliding assays and compared with the flows of 3D active fluids. While
the scales of the two systems differ by 1,000x, both were driven by processive, non-processive or
an equal mixture of both molecular motor proteins. To search for the dynamic correlation between
both systems, the motor activities were tuned by varying temperature and ATP concentration, and
the changes in both systems were compared. Motor processivity played an important role in active
fluid flows but only when the fluids were nearly motionless; otherwise, flows were dominated by
hydrodynamic resistance controlled by sample size. Furthermore, while the motors' thermal reaction
led active fluids to flow faster with increasing temperature, such temperature dependence could
be reversed by introducing temperature-varying depletants, emphasizing the potential role of
the depletant in designing an active fluid's temperature response. The temperature response of
active fluids was nearly immediate (<10 sec). Such a characteristic enables active fluids to be
controlled with a temperature switch. Overall, this work not only clarifies the role of temperature
in active fluid activity, but also sheds light on the underlying principles of the relationship
between the collective dynamics of active fluids and the dynamics of their constituent single microtubules.
