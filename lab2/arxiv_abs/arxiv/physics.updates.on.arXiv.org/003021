Photoemission driven by a strong electric field of near-infrared or visible light, referred to
as strong-field photoemission, produces attosecond electron pulses that are synchronized to
the waveform of the incident light, and this principle lies at the heart of current attosecond technologies.
However, full access to strong-field photoemission regimes at near-infrared wavelengths based
on solid-state materials is restricted by space-charge screening and material damage at high optical-field
strengths, which significantly hampers the realization of predicted attosecond technologies,
such as ultra-sensitive optical phase modulation. Here, we demonstrate a new type of strong-field
photoemission behaviour with extreme nonlinearity -- photoemission current scales follow a 40th
power law of the optical-field strength, making use of sub-nanometric carbon nanotubes and 800
nm pulses. As a result, the total photoemission current depends on the carrier-envelope phase with
a greatly improved photoemission current modulation depth of up to 100%, which has not previously
been achieved. Time-dependent density functional calculations reveal the completely new behaviour
of the optical-field induced tunnelling emission process directly from the valence band of the
carbon nanotubes, which is an indication of full access to a strong-field photoemission regime.
Furthermore, the nonlinear dynamics are observed to be tunable by changing the binding energy of
the valence-band-maximum, as confirmed by Simpleman model calculations. We believe that such
extreme nonlinear photoemission from nanotips offers a new means of producing extreme temporal-spatial
resolved electron pulses. These results additionally provide a new design philosophy for attosecond
electronics and optics by making use of tunable band structures in nanomaterials.
