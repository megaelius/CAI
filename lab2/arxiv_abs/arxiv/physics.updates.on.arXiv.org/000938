Ultrafast dynamical processes in photoexcited molecules can be observed with pump-probe measurements,
in which information about the dynamics is obtained from the transient signal associated with the
excited state. Background signals provoked by pump and/or probe pulses alone often obscure these
excited state signals. Simple subtraction of pump-only and/or probe-only measurements from the
pump-probe measurement, as commonly applied, results in a degradation of the signal-to-noise
ratio and, in the case of coincidence detection, the danger of overrated background subtraction.
Coincidence measurements additionally suffer from false coincidences. Here we present a probabilistic
approach based on Bayesian probability theory that overcomes these problems. For a pump-probe
experiment with photoelectron-photoion coincidence detection we reconstruct the interesting
excited state spectrum from pump-probe and pump-only measurements. This approach allows to treat
background and false coincidences consistently and on the same footing. We demonstrate that the
Bayesian formalism has the following advantages over simple signal subtraction: (i) the signal-to-noise
ratio is significantly increased, (ii) the pump-only contribution is not overestimated, (iii)
false coincidences are excluded, (iv) prior knowledge, such as positivity, is consistently incorporated,
(v) confidence intervals are provided for the reconstructed spectrum, and (vi) it is applicable
to any experimental situation and noise statistics. Most importantly, by accounting for false
coincidences, the Bayesian approach allows to run experiments at higher ionization rates, resulting
in a significant reduction of data acquisition times. The application to pump-probe coincidence
measurements on acetone molecules enables novel quantitative interpretations about the molecular
decay dynamics and fragmentation behavior.
