We report a fully quantum-dynamical study of the intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution
(IVR) in the electronic ground state of carbonyl sulfide (OCS), which is a prototype of an isolated
many-body quantum system with strong internal couplings and non-Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus
(RRKM) behavior. We pay particular attention to the role of many-body localization and the approach
to thermalization, which currently are topics of considerable interest, as they pertain to the
very foundations of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. We employ local-mode (valence)
coordinates and consider initial excitations localized in one local mode, with energies ranging
from low to near the dissociation threshold, where the classical dynamics have been shown to be chaotic.
We propagate the nuclear wavepacket on the potential energy surface by means of the numerically
exact multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method and employ mean local energies, time-dependent
and time-averaged populations in quantum number space, energy distributions, entanglement entropies,
local population distributions, microcanonical averages, and dissociation probabilities,
as diagnostic tools. This allows us to identify a continuous localization $\rightarrow$ delocalization
transition in the energy flow, associated with the onset of quantum chaos, as the excitation energy
increases up to near the dissociation threshold. Moreover, we find that at this energy and $\sim$1
ps the molecule nearly thermalizes. Furthermore, we observe that IVR is so slow that the molecule
begins to dissociate well before such quasi-thermalization is complete, in accordance with earlier
classical-mechanical predictions of non-RRKM behavior.
