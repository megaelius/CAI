The swift excitation of the transparent dielectrics by intense short laser pulse produces ultra-fast
re-structuring of the electronic landscape generating a wealth of material states continuously
changing in space and in time in accord with the variations of the intensity. These unconventional
transient material states combine simultaneously dielectric and metal properties (Die-Met).
The laser excitation transforms a transparent dielectric into electrically inhomogeneous state
early in the pulse time [1]. The permittivity of excited material varies in time and in space changing
from positive to negative values that strongly affects the interaction process. The interplay
between the transient permittivity gradient and polarisation of the incident laser becomes the
major process of the new interaction mode. In a particular relation between the polarization and
the permittivity gradient the incident field amplitude grows up while the wave is approaching to
the surface where the real part of permittivity turns to zero. That results in the local increase
in the absorbed energy density. The complex 3D structure of the permittivity makes a transparent
part of excited dielectric (at ${\epsilon}0 > {\epsilon}re > 0$) optically active. The electro-magnetic
wave passing through such a medium gets a twisted trajectory and accrues the geometric phase [2].
The plane of polarisation rotation and phase depends on the 3D permittivity structure [3]. Measuring
the polarisation and phase of the probe beam allows quantitatively identify this new transient
state. We discuss the revelations of this effect in different experimental situations and possible
applications.
