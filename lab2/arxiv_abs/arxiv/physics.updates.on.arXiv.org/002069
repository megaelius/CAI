Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes(RANS) method will still play a vital role in the following several
decade in aerospace engineering. Although RANS models are widely used, empiricism and large discrepancies
between models reduce the reliability of simulating complex flows. Therefore, in recent years,
data-driven turbulence model has aroused widespread concern in fluid mechanics. Based on the experimental/numerical
simulation results, this approach aims to modify or construct the turbulence model for specific
purposes by machine learning technologies. In this paper, we take the results calculated by SA model
as training data. Different from low Reynolds number turbulent flows, the data from high Reynolds
number flows shows an apparent scaling effect, thus leading to difficulties in the data-driven
modeling. In order to improve the fitting accuracy, we divided the flow field into near-wall region,
wake region, and far-field region, and built individual model for every region. In this paper, we
adopted the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and some auxiliary optimization algorithms
to reconstruct a mapping function between mean variables and the eddy viscosity. Since this model
reflects the relationship between local flow characteristics and turbulent eddy viscosity, it
is independent on the airfoil shape and flow condition. The training data in this paper is generated
from only three subsonic flow calculations of NACA0012 airfoil. By coupling the proposed approach
with N-S equations, we calculated various flow cases as well as two different airfoils and showed
the eddy viscosity contours, velocity profiles along the normal direction of wall and skin friction
coefficient distributions, etc. Compared with the SA model, the results show a reasonable accuracy
and better efficiency, which indicates the positive prospect of data-driven methods in turbulence
modeling.
