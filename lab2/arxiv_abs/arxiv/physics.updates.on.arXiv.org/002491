Solar ionizing factors, corpuscular and electromagnetic radiation, are key factors to understand
the modulation of interstellar neutral gas and its derivative populations inside the heliosphere.
We overview the current state of the knowledge about the solar ionizing factors inside the termination
shock. We discuss charge exchange with solar wind particles, photoionization, and electron impact
ionization. We compare the ionization rates for hydrogen, oxygen, neon, and helium for the last
three cycles of solar activity (from 1985 to 2018) both in the ecliptic plane and in the polar regions.
We discuss relations between ionization processes for a given species as a function of time, solar
distance, and latitude. We study similarities and differences of the total ionization rates among
the species within a consistent and homogeneous system of calculation of the ionization rates for
heliospheric particles inside the heliosphere. Among the species discussed, the highest total
ionization rates at 1 au in the ecliptic plane are for hydrogen and oxygen, and the lowest are for helium.
In the polar regions, the strongest ionization losses are for oxygen, regardless of the phase of
the solar activity. Photoionization is the dominant ionization reaction for helium and neon, and
a reaction of high significance for oxygen. Charge exchange with solar wind particles is the dominant
ionization reaction for hydrogen and the second important ionization reaction for oxygen. Electron
impact ionization is an important ionization reaction for Ne and He, with the contribution to the
total ionization rates stronger within 1 au and smaller outside 1 au. The total ionization rates
for He and Ne vary significantly in time with the solar activity, whereas the total ionization rates
for H and O follow the cyclic solar wind variations out of the ecliptic plane and aperiodic variations
in the ecliptic plane.
