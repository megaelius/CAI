The temporal modal and nonmodal growth of three-dimensional perturbations in the boundary-layer
flow over an infinite compliant flat wall is considered. Using a wall-normal velocity/wall-normal
vorticity formalism, the dynamic boundary condition at the compliant wall admits a linear dependence
on the eigenvalue parameter, as compared to a quadratic one in the canonical formulation of the problem.
This greatly simplifies the accurate calculation of the continuous spectrum by means of a spectral
method, thereby yielding a very effective filtering of the pseudospectra as well as a clear identification
of instability regions. The regime of global instability is found to be matching the regime of the
favorable phase of the forcing by the flow on the compliant wall so as to enhance the amplitude of the
wall. An energy-budget analysis for the least-decaying hydroelastic (static-divergence, traveling-wave-flutter
and near-stationary transitional) and Tollmien--Schlichting modes in the parameter space reveals
the primary routes of energy flow. Moreover, the flow exhibits a slower transient growth for the
maximum growth rate of a superposition of streamwise-independent modes due to a complex dependence
of the wall-boundary condition with the Reynolds number. The initial and optimal perturbations
are compared with the boundary-layer flow over a solid wall; differences and similarities are discussed.
Unlike the solid-wall case, viscosity plays a pivotal role in the transient growth. A slowdown of
the maximum growth rate with the Reynolds number is uncovered and found to originate in the transition
of the fluid-solid interaction from a two-way to a one-way coupling. Finally, a term-by-term energy
budget analysis is performed to identify the key contributors to the transient growth mechanism.
