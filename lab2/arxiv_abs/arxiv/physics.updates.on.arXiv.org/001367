In this paper the relaxed micromorphic material model for anisotropic elasticity is used to describe
the dynamical behavior of a band-gap metamaterial with tetragonal symmetry. Unlike other continuum
models, the relaxed micromorphic model is endowed to capture all the main microscopic and macroscopic
characteristics of the targeted metamaterial, namely, stiffness, anisotropy, dispersion and
band-gaps. The simple structure of our material model, which simultaneously lives on a micro-,
a meso- and a macroscopic scale, requires only the identification of a limited number of frequency-independent
and thus truly constitutive parameters, valid for both static and wave-propagation analyses in
the plane. The static macro- and micro- parameters are identified by numerical homogenization
in static tests on the unit-cell level. The 3 macro-parameters are obtained by imposing periodic
boundary conditions thus mimicking the structure at large. The 3 micro-parameters can be uniquely
identified from unit-cells, which (i) represent the unit-cells with maximal stiffness and (ii)
preserve its tetragonal symmetry. Both conditions (i) and (ii) are built on the inherent rationale
of the relaxed micromorphic model. The missing mesoscopic elastic parameters directly follow
from a recently developed harmonic-mean type micro-macro homogenization rule, which establishes
the general relation between the elasticities in the micromorphic model on its three scales. The
remaining inertia parameters for dynamical analyses are calibrated on the dispersion curves of
the same metamaterial as obtained by a classical Bloch-Floquet analysis for two wave directions.
We demonstrate via polar plots that the obtained material parameters describe very well the response
of the structural material for all wave directions in the plane, thus covering the complete panorama
of anisotropy of the targeted metamaterial.
