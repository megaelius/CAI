Biophysical modelling of diffusion MRI is necessary to provide specific microstructural tissue
properties. However, estimating model parameters from data with limited diffusion gradient strength,
such as clinical scanners, has proven unreliable due to a shallow optimization landscape. On the
other hand, estimation of diffusion kurtosis (DKI) parameters is more robust as the clinical acquisitions
typically probe a regime in which the associated 4th order cumulant expansion is adequate; however,
its parameters are not microstructurally specific a priori. Given an appropriate biophysical
model, its parameters may be connected to DKI parameters, but it was previously shown that at the
DKI level, it still does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine all model parameters.
Earlier work has shown that by neglecting axonal dispersion, this parameter degeneracy reduces
to the question of whether intra-axonal diffusivity is larger than or smaller than extra-axonal
diffusivity. Here we develop a model of diffusion in spinal cord white matter including axonal dispersion
and demonstrate stable estimation of all model parameters from DKI. By employing the recently developed
fast axisymmetric DKI, we use stimulated echo acquisition mode to collect data over an unprecedented
diffusion time range with very narrow diffusion gradient pulses, enabling finely resolved measurements
of diffusion time dependence of both net diffusion and kurtosis metrics, as well as model intra-
and extra-axonal diffusivities, and axonal dispersion. Our results demonstrate substantial
time dependence of all parameters except volume fractions, and the additional time dimension provides
support for intra-axonal diffusivity to be larger than extra-axonal diffusivity in spinal cord
white matter, although not unambiguously. We compare our findings to predictions from effective
medium theory.
