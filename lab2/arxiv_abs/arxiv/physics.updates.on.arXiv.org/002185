Active motion of molecules along filamentous structures is a crucial feature of cell biology and
is often modeled with the paradigmatic asymmetric simple exclusion process. Motivated by recent
experimental studies that have addressed the stepping behavior of kinesins on microtubules, we
investigate a lattice gas model for simultaneous transport of two species of active particles on
a cylinder. The species are distinguished by their different gaits: While the first species moves
straight ahead, the second follows a helical path. We show that the collective properties of such
systems critically differ from those of one-species transport in a way that cannot be accounted
for by standard models. This is most evident in a jamming transition far below full occupation, as
well as in non-equilibrium pattern formation. The altered behavior arises because - unlike the
case in single-species transport - any given position may be targeted by two particles from different
directions at the same time. However, a particle can leave a given position only in one direction.
This simple change in connectivity significantly amplifies the impact of steric interactions
and thus becomes a key determinant of mixed species transport. We computationally characterize
this type of hindrance and develop a comprehensive theory for collective two-species transport
along a cylinder. Our observations show high robustness against model extensions that account
for additional biomolecular features and demonstrate that even small fractions of a second species
can significantly alter transport. This suggests that our analysis is also relevant in a biological
context.
