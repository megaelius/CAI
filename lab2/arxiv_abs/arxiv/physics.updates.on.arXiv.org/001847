Chemical reactions are often associated with an energy barrier along the reaction pathway which
hinders the spontaneity of the reaction. Changing the energy barrier along the reaction pathway
allows one to modulate the performance of a reaction. We present a module, Python Algorithms for
Searching Transition stAtes (PASTA), to calculate the energy barrier and locate the transition
state of a reaction efficiently. The module is written in python and can perform nudged elastic band,
climbing image nudged elastic band and automated nudged elastic band calculations. These methods
require the knowledge of the potential energy surface (and its gradient along some direction).
This module is written such that it works in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) codes
to obtain this information. Presently it is interfaced with three well known DFT packages: Vienna
Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), Quantum Espresso and Spanish Initiative for Electronic Simulations
with Thousands of Atoms (SIESTA). This module is easily extendable and can be interfaced with other
DFT, force-field or empirical potential based codes. The uniqueness of the module lies in its user-friendliness.
For users with limited computing resources, this module will be an effective tool as it allows to
perform the calculations image by image. On the other hand, users with plentiful computing resources
(such as users in a high performance computing environment) can perform the calculations for large
number of images simultaneously. This module gives users complete flexibility, thereby enabling
them to perform calculations on large systems making the best use of the available resources.
