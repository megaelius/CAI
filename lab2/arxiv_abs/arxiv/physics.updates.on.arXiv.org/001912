One of the main challenges in Biophysics teaching consists on how to motivate students to appreciate
the beauty of theoretical formulations. This is crucial when the system modeling requires numerical
calculations to achieve realistic results. In this sense, due to the massive use of software, students
often become a mere users of computational tools without capturing the essence of formulation and
further problem solution. It is, therefore, necessary for instructors to find innovating ways,
allowing students developing of their ability to deal with mathematical modelling. To address
this issue one can highlight the use of Benford's law, thanks to its simple formulation, easy computational
implementation and wide possibility for applications. Indeed, this law enables students to carry
out their own data analysis with use of free software packages. This law is among the several power
or scaling laws found in biological systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, this law has not
been contemplated in Cell Biophysics yet. Beyond its vast applications in many fields, neuromuscular
junction represents a remarkable substrate for learning and teaching of complex system. Thus,
in this work, we applied both classical and a generalized form of Benford's Law, to examine if electrophysiological
data recorded from neuromuscular junction conforms the anomalous number law. The results indicated
that nerve-muscle communications conform the generalized Benford's law better than the seminal
formulation. From our electrophysiological measurements a biological scenario is used to interpret
the theoretical analysis.
