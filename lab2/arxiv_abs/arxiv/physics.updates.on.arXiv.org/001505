The social inclusion aspects of shopping malls and their effects on our understanding of urban spaces
have been a controversial argument largely discussed in the literature. Shopping malls offer an
open, safe and democratic version of the public space. Many of their detractors suggest that malls
target their customers in subtle ways, promoting social exclusion. In this work, we analyze whether
malls offer opportunities for social mixing by analyzing the patterns of shopping mall visits in
a large Latin-American city: Santiago de Chile. We use a large XDR (Data Detail Records) dataset
from a telecommunication company to analyze the mobility of $387,152$ cell phones around $16$ large
malls in Santiago de Chile during one month. We model the influx of people to malls in terms of a gravity
model of mobility, and we are able to predict the customer profile distribution of each mall, explaining
it in terms of mall location, the population distribution, and mall size. Then, we analyze the concept
of social attraction, expressed as people from low and middle classes being attracted by malls that
target high-income customers. We include a social attraction factor in our model and find that it
is negligible in the process of choosing a mall. We observe that social mixing arises only in peripheral
malls located farthest from the city center, which both low and middle class people visit. Using
a co-visitation model we show that people tend to choose a restricted profile of malls according
to their socio-economic status and their distance from the mall. We conclude that the potential
for social mixing in malls could be capitalized by designing public policies regarding transportation
and mobility.
