Parallel-tempering MD results for a CH$_3$(CH$_2$-O-CH$_2$)$_m$CH$_3$ chain in water are exploited
as a data-base for analysis of collective structural characteristics of the PEO globule with a goal
of defining models permitting statistical thermodynamic analysis of dispersants of Corexit type.
The chain structure factor, relevant to neutron scattering from a deuterated chain in neutral water,
is considered specifically. The traditional continuum-Gaussian structure factor is inconsistent
with the simple $k \rightarrow \infty$ behavior, but we consider a discrete-Gaussian model that
does achieve that consistency. Shifting-and-scaling the discrete-Gaussian model helps to identify
the low-$k$ to high-$k$ transition near $k \approx 2\pi/0.6 \mathrm{nm}$ when an empirically matched
number of Gaussian links is about one-third of the total number of effective-atom sites. This short
distance-scale boundary of 0.6 nm is directly verified with the $r$-space distributions, and this
distance is thus identified with a natural size for coarsened monomers. The probability distribution
of $R_g{}^2$ is compared with the classic predictions for both Gaussian model and freely-jointed
chains. $\left\langle R_g{}^2(j)\right\rangle$, the contribution of the $j$-th chain segment
to $\left\langle R_g{}^2\right\rangle$, depends on contour index about as expected for Gaussian
chains despite significant quantitative discrepancies which express the swelling of these chains
in water. Monomers central to the chain contour occupy the center of the chain globule. The density
profiles of chain segments relative to their center of mass can show distinctive density structuring
for smaller chains due close proximity of central elements to the globule center. But that density
structuring washes-out for longer chains where many chain elements additively contribute to the
density profiles.
