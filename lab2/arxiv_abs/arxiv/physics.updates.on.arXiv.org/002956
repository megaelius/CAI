With the increased application of large eddy simulation techniques, the generation of realistic
turbulence at inflow boundaries is crucial for the accuracy of a simulation. The Control Forced
Concurrent Precursor Method (CFCPM) proposed in this work combines an existing concurrent precursor
method and a mean flow forcing method with a new extension of the controlled forcing method to impose
turbulent inflow boundary conditions primarily, although not exclusively, for domains that require
periodic boundary conditions. Turbulent inflow boundary conditions are imposed through a region
of body forces added to the momentum equations of the main simulation that transfers the precursor
simulation into the main domain. Controlled forcing planes, which come into play as body forces
added to the momentum equations on planes perpendicular to the flow, located in the precursor simulation,
allow for specific Reynolds stress tensors and mean velocities to be imposed. The mean flow controlled
forcing method only modifies the mean velocity profiles, leaving the fluctuating velocity field
untouched. The proposed fluctuating flow controlled forcing methods extends the application
of the original controlled forcing method to multiple fluctuating velocity components and couples
their calculation in order to amplify the existing fluctuations present in the precursor flow field
so that prescribed anisotropic Reynolds stress tensors can be reproduced. The new method was tested
on high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer flow over a wall-mounted cube and low Reynolds
number turbulent boundary layer flow over a backward-facing step. It was found that the new extension
of the controlled forcing method reduced the development time for both test cases considered here
when compared to not using controlled forcing and only using the original controlled forcing method.
