When light propagates through an opaque scattering material, the spatial information it holds
becomes scrambled, but not necessarily lost. Two powerful classes of techniques have emerged in
recent years to recover this information, enabling us to see through opaque media. Firstly, the
scattering properties of a sample may be measured and subsequently cancelled out using transmission
matrix (TM) based approaches. These methods describe the scattering as a linear matrix operator
relating incident and transmitted fields. Secondly, optical memory effects reveal underlying
correlations between incident and transmitted light, which can be exploited to image through opaque
objects. Optical memory effects have been extensively studied in thin randomly scattering layers,
which exhibit shift and tilt correlations that can be leveraged for imaging. In this work we develop
a general framework describing the nature of optical memory effects in a broader class of structures
of more arbitrary geometry. We show how this framework, when combined with wavefront shaping driven
by feedback from a guide-star, enables estimation of an approximate transmission matrix (ATM)
describing the scattering properties of any of these systems. This highlights that guide-star
assisted imaging is possible regardless of the type of memory effect a scatterer exhibits. We study
multimode optical fibres (MMFs) within our general framework, and identify a 'quasi-radial' memory
effect. We experimentally demonstrate a new way to characterise and partially image through MMFs,
only requiring access to their proximal end, with potential applications to flexible ultra-thin
micro-endoscopes. These concepts broaden the applications of optical memory effects to a range
of novel imaging and optical communication scenarios.
