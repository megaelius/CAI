We report on experimental and theoretical investigations of the polarization dependence of magnetic
resonance generated by synchronous optical pumping. Magnetic resonances with narrow linewidth
are generated experimentally using a rubidium vapor cell with octade-cyltrichlorosilane (OTS)
antirelaxation coating on inner walls. We studied the effect of light ellipticity on the amplitudes
and widths of magnetic resonances by matching the light modulation frequency with 2 {\Omega}_L
(alignment) and {\Omega}_L(orientation) in a Bell-Bloom interaction geometry, where {\Omega}_L
corresponds to the Larmor frequency. Both 2 {\Omega}_L and \OmegaL resonance amplitudes showed
a strong dependence on the light ellipticity. In addition, we showed that the duty cycle of light
modulation changes the slope of amplitude variations in 2{\Omega}_L and {\Omega}_L resonances
with light ellipticity. As a potential application, we showed that the difference between 2{\Omega}_Land
{\Omega}_Lresonance amplitudes can be used for in situ measurement of light ellipticity. We also
studied the dependence of 2{\Omega}_L and {\Omega}_L resonance amplitudes on the polarization
angle of linearly polarized light. These amplitudes oscillate periodically with the polarization
angle. We found this oscillatory behavior to be sensitive to the tilt in magnetic field direction
from the polarization plane. Such a property could be used to realize a vector magnetometer. A density
matrix based theoretical model is developed to simulate the magnetic resonance spectrum for different
light polarizations. Our theoretical model accurately reproduces the above mentioned experimental
observations.
