The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a quantum relativistic effect that describes the appearance
of an additional electric current along a magnetic field. It is caused by an asymmetry between the
number densities of left- and right-handed fermions, which can be maintained at high energies when
the chirality flipping rate can be neglected, for example in the early Universe. The inclusion of
the CME in the Maxwell equations leads to a modified set of MHD equations. We discuss how the CME is
implemented in the PENCIL CODE. The CME plays a key role in the evolution of magnetic fields since
it results in a dynamo effect associated with an additional term in the induction equation. This
term is formally similar to the alpha effect in classical mean-field MHD. However, the chiral dynamo
can operate without turbulence and is associated with small spatial scales that can be, in the case
of the early Universe, orders of magnitude below the Hubble radius. A large-scale chiral alpha_mu
effect has also been identified in mean-field theory. It occurs in the presence of turbulence but
is not related to kinetic helicity. Depending on the plasma parameters, chiral dynamo instabilities
can amplify magnetic fields over many orders of magnitude. These instabilities can affect the propagation
of MHD waves, which is demonstrated by our DNS. We also study the coupling between the evolution of
the chiral chemical potential and the ordinary chemical potential, which is proportional to the
sum of the number densities of left- and right-handed fermions. An important consequence of this
coupling is the emergence of chiral magnetic waves (CMWs). We confirm numerically that linear CMWs
and MHD waves are not interacting. Our simulations suggest that the chemical potential has only
a minor effect on the non-linear evolution of the chiral dynamo.
