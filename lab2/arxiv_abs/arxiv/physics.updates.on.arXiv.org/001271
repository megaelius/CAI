Identifying blast-wave shocks, which can arise during CME formation, is a much more complex problem.
The difference from piston shocks is that a blast-wave shock originates from the explosions that
frequently accompany CME formation, and further propagates freely without any CME piston effects.
The bow shock of Earth is a piston shock. Behind the bow shock front there is a flow of the modified solar
wind plasma: transition layer, which also carries the modified magnetic field of solar wind. Velocity
and density of plasma as well as parameters of magnetic field of this current can be estimated if the
form of the bow shock front and of magnetopause are considered to be known. In this paper we assumed
them to be paraboloids of rotation. In this paper we have determined potential distribution along
magnetopause from the balance condition of substance coming into transition layer from the solar
wind on one side and leaving through the gap between magnetosphere and the bow shock front and through
magnetopause on another. To a first approximation this distribution differs from potential distribution
at the BS front only in a constant multiplier. We used the established potential distribution as
a boundary condition while solving the problem on potential distribution in the magnetosphere.
The first solution harmonic turned out to coincide in the form with the boundary condition on magnetopause.
We have constructed the full solution for electric field in the magnetosphere having limited ourselves
to the first harmonic and corotation field. We have obtained necessary equations to model processes
in the region of bow shock.
