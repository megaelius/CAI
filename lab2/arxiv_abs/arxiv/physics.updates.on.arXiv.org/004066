One of the major concerns of Schr\"odinger, Lorentz, Einstein, and many others about the wavefunction
is that it is defined on the $3\mathbf{N}$-dimensional configuration space, rather than on the
$3$-dimensional physical space. This gives the impression that quantum mechanics cannot have
a $3$D-space or spacetime ontology, even in the absence of quantum measurements. In particular,
this seems to affect interpretations which take the wavefunction as a physical entity, in particular
the many worlds and the spontaneous collapse interpretations, and some versions of the pilot wave
theory. Here, a representation of the many-particle states is given, as multi-layered fields defined
on the $3$-dimensional physical space. This representation is equivalent to the usual representation
on the configuration space, but it makes it explicit that it is possible to interpret the wavefunctions
as living in the physical space. As long as only unitary evolution is involved, the interactions
are local. I intended this representation to capture and formalize the non-explicit and informal
intuition of many working quantum physicists, who, by considering the wavefunction sometimes
to be defined on the configuration space, and sometimes on the physical space, may seem to researchers
in the foundations of quantum theory as adopting an inconsistent view about its ontology. This representation
does not aim to solve the measurement problem, and it allows for Schr\"odinger cats just like the
usual one. But it may help various interpretations to solve these problems, through inclusion of
the wavefunction as (part of) their primitive ontology. In an appendix, it is shown how the multi-layered
field representation can be extended to quantum field theory.
