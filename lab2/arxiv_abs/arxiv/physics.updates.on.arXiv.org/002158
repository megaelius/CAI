Perovskite solar cells are notorious for exhibiting transient behaviour not seen in conventional
inorganic semiconductor devices. Significant inroads have been made into understanding this
fact in terms of ion migration, now a well-established property of the prototype photovoltaic perovskite
MAPbI$_3$ and a likely feature in the newer mixed compositions. Here we study the manifestations
of ion migration in frequency-domain small-signal measurements, focusing on the popular technique
of Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). We provide new interpretations for a variety of previously
puzzling features, including giant photo-induced low-frequency capacitance and negative capacitance
in a variety of forms. We show that these apparently strange measurements can be rationalized by
the splitting of AC current into components associated with charge-storage and carrier recombination.
The recombination-induced contribution to the capacitance can take either a positive or a negative
sign, and is potentially very large when slow processes such as ion migration are at play. Using numerical
drift-diffusion semiconductor models, we show that the slow process of ion migration can manifest
as giant photo-induced capacitance, inductive loop features, and low-frequency negative capacitance,
all via the oft-neglected recombination contribution to the capacitance. In doing so, we unify
the understanding of EIS measurements with the comparably well-developed theory of rate dependent
current-voltage (I-V) measurements in perovskite cells. Comparing the two techniques, we argue
that EIS is more suitable for quantifying I-V hysteresis than conventional methods based on I-V
sweeps, and demonstrate this application on a variety of cell types.
