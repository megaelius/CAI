Purpose: To verify dose delivery and quality assurance of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)
for head and neck cancer. Method: The Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core Houston (IROC-H) head
and neck phantom with thermo- luminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and films, were imaged with computed
tomography scan and the reconstructed image was transferred to pinnacle treatment planning system
(TPS). On TPS the planning target volume (PTV), secondary target volume (STV) and organ at risk (OAR)
were delineated manually and a treatment plan was made. The dose constraints were determined for
the concerned organs according to IROC-H prescription. The treatment plan was optimized using
adoptive convolution algorithm to improve dose homogeneity and conformity. The dose calculation
was performed using C.C Convolution algorithm and a Varian True Beam linear accelerator was used
to deliver the treatment plan to the head and neck phantom. The delivered radiation dose to the phantom
was measured through TLDs and GafChromic EBT2 films. The dosimetric performance of the VMAT delivery
was studied by analysing percent dose difference, iso-dose line profile and gamma analysis of the
TPS computed dose and linac delivered doses. Result: the percent dose difference of 3.8\% was observed
between the planned and measured doses of TLDs and a 1.5mm distance to agreement (DTA) was observed
by comparing iso-dose line profiles. Passed the gamma criteria of 3\%/3 mm was with good percentages.
Conclusion: The dosimetric performance of VMAT delivery for a challenging head and neck radiotherapy
can be verified using TLDs and films imbedded in an anthropomorphic H\&N phantom.
