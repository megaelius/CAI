With the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical modeling of epidemics has been perceived
and used as a central element in understanding, predicting, and governing the pandemic event. However,
soon it became clear that long term predictions were extremely challenging to address. Moreover,
it is still unclear which metric shall be used for a global description of the evolution of the outbreaks.
Yet a robust modeling of pandemic dynamics and a consistent choice of the transmission metric is
crucial for an in-depth understanding of the macroscopic phenomenology and better-informed mitigation
strategies. In this study, we propose a Markovian stochastic framework designed to describe the
evolution of entropy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the instantaneous reproductive ratio. We
then introduce and use entropy-based metrics of global transmission to measure the impact and temporal
evolution of a pandemic event. In the formulation of the model, the temporal evolution of the outbreak
is modeled by the master equation of a nonlinear Markov process for a statistically averaged individual,
leading to a clear physical interpretation. We also provide a full Bayesian inversion scheme for
calibration. The time evolution of the entropy rate, the absolute change in the system entropy,
and the instantaneous reproductive ratio are natural and transparent outputs of this framework.
The framework has the appealing property of being applicable to any compartmental epidemic model.
As an illustration, we apply the proposed approach to a simple modification of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed
(SEIR) model. Applying the model to the Hubei region, South Korean, Italian, Spanish, German, and
French COVID-19 data-sets, we discover a significant difference in the absolute change of entropy
but highly regular trends for both the entropy evolution and the instantaneous reproductive ratio.
