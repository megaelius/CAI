Lithium ion batteries have been a central part of consumer electronics for decades. More recently,
they have also become critical components in the quickly arising technological fields of electric
mobility and intermittent renewable energy storage. However, many fundamental principles and
mechanisms are not yet understood to a sufficient extent to fully realize the potential of the incorporated
materials. The vast majority of concurrent lithium ion batteries make use of graphite anodes. Their
working principle is based on intercalation---the embedding and ordering of (lithium-) ions in
the two-dimensional spaces between the graphene sheets. This important process---it yields the
upper bound to a battery's charging speed and plays a decisive role for its longevity---is characterized
by multiple phase transitions, ordered and disordered domains, as well as non-equilibrium phenomena,
and therefore quite complex. In this work, we provide a simulation framework for the purpose of better
understanding lithium intercalated graphite and its behaviour during use in a battery. In order
to address the large systems sizes and long time scales required to investigate said effects, we
identify the highly efficient, but semi-empirical Density Funtional Tight Binding (DFTB) as a
suitable approach and combine particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the machine learning (ML)
based Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to obtain the necessary parameters. Using the resulting
parametrization, we are able to reproduce experimental reference structures at a level of accuracy
which is in no way inferior to much more costly ab initio methods. We finally present structural properties
and diffusion barriers for some exemplary system states.
