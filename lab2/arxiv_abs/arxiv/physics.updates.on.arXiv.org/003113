In this paper, an agent-based framework to quantify the seismic resilience of an Electric Power
Supply System (EPSS) and the community it serves is presented. Within the framework, the loss and
restoration of the EPSS power generation and delivery capacity and of the power demand from the served
community are used to assess the electric power deficit during the damage absorption and recovery
processes. Damage to the components of the EPSS and of the community built environment is evaluated
using the seismic fragility functions. The restoration of the community electric power demand
is evaluated using the seismic recovery functions. However, the post-earthquake EPSS recovery
process is modeled using an agent-based model with two agents, the EPSS Operator and the Community
Administrator. The resilience of the EPSS-Community system is quantified using direct, EPSS-related,
and societal, community-related, indicators. Parametric studies are carried out to quantify
the influence of different seismic hazard scenarios, agent characteristics, and power dispatch
strategies on the EPSS-Community seismic resilience. The use of the agent-based modeling framework
enabled a rational formulation of the post-earthquake recovery phase and highlighted the interaction
between the EPSS and the community in the recovery process not quantified in resilience models developed
to date. Furthermore, it shows that the resilience of different community sectors can be enhanced
by different power dispatch strategies. The proposed agent-based EPSS-Community system resilience
quantification framework can be used to develop better community and infrastructure system risk
governance policies.
