A theoretical study of ionization of the hydrogen atom due to an XUV pulse in the presence of an IR laser
is presented. Well-established theories are usually used to describe the problem of laser assisted
photoelectron effect. However, the well-known soft-photon approximation firstly posed by Maquet
et al in Journal of Modern Optics 54, 1847 (2007) and Kazansky's theory in Phys. Rev. A 82, 033420 (2010)
completely fails to predict the electron emission prependicularly to the polarization direction.
Making use of a simple semiclassical model, we study the angle-resolved energy distribution of
photoelectrons for the case that both fields are linearly polarized in the same direction. We thoroughly
analize and characterize two different emission regions in the angle-energy domain: (i) the parallel-like
region with contribution of two classical trajectories per optical cycle and (ii) the perpendicular-like
region with contribution of four classical trajectories per optical cycle. We show that our semiclassical
model is able to asses the interference patterns of the angle-resolved photoelectron spectrum
in the two different mentioned regions. Electron trajectories stemming from different optical
laser cycles give rise to angle-independent intercycle interference known as sidebands. These
sidebands are modulated by an angle-dependent coarse-grained structure coming from the intracycle
interference of the electron trajectories born during the same optical cycle. We show the accuracy
of our semiclassical model as a function of the time delay between the IR and the XUV pulses and also
as a function of the laser intensity by comparing the semiclassical predictions of the angle-resolved
photoelectron spectrum with the continuum-distorted wave strong field approximation and the
ab initio solution of the time dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
