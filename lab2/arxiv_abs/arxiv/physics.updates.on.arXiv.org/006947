The first definite interstellar object observed in our solar system was discovered in October of
2017 and was subsequently designated 1I/'Oumuamua. In addition to its extrasolar origin, observations
and analysis of this object indicate some unusual features which can only be explained by in-situ
exploration. For this purpose, various spacecraft intercept missions have been proposed. Their
propulsion schemes have been chemical, exploiting a Jupiter and Solar Oberth Maneuver (mission
duration of 22 years) and also using Earth-based lasers to propel laser sails (1-2 years), both with
launch dates in 2030. For the former, mission durations are quite prolonged and for the latter, the
necessary laser infrastructure may not be in place by 2030. In this study Nuclear Thermal Propulsion
(NTP) is examined which has yet to materialise as far as real missions are concerned, but due to its
research and development in the NASA Rover/NERVA programs, actually has a higher TRL than laser
propulsion. Various solid reactor core options are studied, using either engines directly derived
from the NASA programs, or more advanced options, like a proposed particle bed NTP system. With specific
impulses at least twice those of chemical rockets, NTP opens the opportunity for much higher {\Delta}V
budgets, allowing simpler and more direct, time-saving trajectories to be exploited. For example
a spacecraft with an upgraded NERVA/Pewee-class NTP travelling along an Earth-Jupiter-1I trajectory,
would reach 1I/'Oumuamua within 14 years of a launch in 2031. The payload mass to 1I/'Oumuamua would
be around 2.5metric tonnes, but even larger masses and shorter mission durations can be achieved
with some of the more advanced NTP options studied. In all 4 different proposed NTP systems and 5 different
trajectory scenarios are examined.
