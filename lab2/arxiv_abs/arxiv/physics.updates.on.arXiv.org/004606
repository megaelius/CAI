When the interaction between a molecular system and confined light modes in an optical or plasmonic
cavity is strong enough to overcome the dissipative process, hybrid light-matter states (polaritons)
become the fundamental excitations in the system. The mixing between the light and matter characters
modifies the photophysical and photochemical properties. Especially, it was reported that these
polaritons can be employed to control photochemical reactions, charge and energy transfer, and
other processes. In addition, according to recent studies, vibrational strong coupling can be
employed to resonantly enhance the thermally-activated chemical reactions. In this work, a theoretical
model and an efficient numerical method for studying the dynamics of molecules strongly interacting
with quantum light are developed based on non-adiabatic excited-state molecular dynamics. The
methodology was employed to study the \textit{cis-trans} photoisomerization of a realistic molecule
in a cavity. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the photochemical reactions can be controlled
by tuning the properties of the cavity. In the calculated example, the isomerization is suppressed
when polaritonic states develop a local minimum on the lower polaritonic state. Moreover, the observed
reduction of isomerization is tunable via the photon energy and light-molecule coupling strength.
But the fluctuation in transition dipole screens the effect of light-matter, which makes it harder
to tune the photochemical properties via the coupling strength. These insights suggest quantum
control of photochemical reactions is possible by specially designed photonic or plasmonic cavities.
