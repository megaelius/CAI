We elaborate on quantum geometric information flows, QGIFs, and emergent (modified) Einstein-Maxwell
and Kaluza--Klein, KK, theories formulated in Lagrange-Hamilton and general covariant variables.
There are considered nonholonomic deformations of Grigory Perelman's F- and W-functionals (originally
postulated for Riemannian metrics) for describing relativistic geometric flows, gravity and
matter field interactions, and associated statistical thermodynamic systems. We argue that the
concept of Perelman W-entropy presents more general and alternative possibilities to characterize
geometric flow evolution, GIF, and gravity models than the Bekenstein--Hawking and another area--holographic
type entropies. The geometric and classical and quantum thermodynamics methods allow us to understand
and describe important classical and quantum physical properties of more general classes of exact
solutions in modified gravity and geometric flow theories. Formulating the theory of QGIFs, a set
of fundamental geometric, probability and quantum concepts, and methods of computation, are reconsidered
for curved spacetime and (relativistic) phase spaces. Such generalized metric--affine spaces
are modelled as nonholonomic Lorentz manifolds, (co) tangent Lorentz bundles and associated vector
bundles. Using geometric and entropic and thermodynamic values, we define QGIF versions of the
von Neumann entropy, relative and conditional entropy, mutual information etc. There are analyzed
certain important inequalities and possible applications of G. Perelman and related entanglement
and R\'{e}nyi entropies to theories of KK QGIFs and emergent gravitational and electromagnetic
interactions.
