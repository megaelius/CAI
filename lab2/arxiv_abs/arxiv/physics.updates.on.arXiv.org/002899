Tropical cyclones that evolve from a non-tropical origin may pose a special challenge for predictions,
as they often emerge at the end of a multi-scale cascade of atmospheric processes. Climatological
studies have shown that the 'tropical transition' (TT) pathway plays a prominent role in cyclogenesis,
in particular over the North Atlantic Ocean. Here we use operational European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts ensemble predictions to investigate the TT of North Atlantic Hurricane Chris
(2012), whose formation was preceded by the merger of two potential vorticity (PV) maxima, eventually
resulting in the storm-inducing PV streamer. The principal goal is to elucidate the dynamic and
thermodynamic processes governing the predictability of cyclogenesis and subsequent TT. Dynamic
time warping is applied to identify ensemble tracks that are similar to the analysis track. This
technique permits small temporal and spatial shifts in the development. The formation of the pre-Chris
cyclone is predicted by those members that also predict the merging of the two PV maxima. The position
of the storm relative to the PV streamer determines whether the pre-Chris cyclone follows the TT
pathway. The transitioning storms are located inside a favorable region of high equivalent potential
temperatures that result from a warm seclusion underneath the cyclonic roll-up of the PV streamer.
A systematic investigation of consecutive ensemble forecasts indicates that forecast improvements
are linked to specific events, such as the PV merging. The present case exemplifies how a novel combination
of Eulerian and Lagrangian ensemble forecast analysis tool allows to infer physical causes of abrupt
changes in predictability.
