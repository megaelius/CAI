Using fully kinetic 3D simulations, the reconnection dynamics of asymmetric current sheets are
examined at the Earth's magnetopause. The plasma parameters are selected to match MMS magnetopause
diffusion region crossings with guide fields of 0.1, 0.4, and 1 of the reconnecting magnetosheath
field. In each case, strong drift-wave fluctuations are observed in the lower-hybrid frequency
range at the steep density gradient across the magnetospheric separatrix. These fluctuations
give rise to cross-field particle transport for both electron and ions. In addition, this turbulent
mixing leads to significantly enhanced electron parallel heating in comparison to 2D simulations.
We study three different methods of quantifying the anomalous dissipation produced by the drift
fluctuations, based on spatial averaging, temporal averaging, and temporal averaging followed
by integrating along magnetic field lines. Comparing the different methods reveals complications
that make identifying and measuring the anomalous dissipation unclear. Nevertheless, the anomalous
dissipation from short wavelength drift fluctuations appears weak for each case, and the reconnection
rates observed in 3D are nearly the same as in 2D models. The 3D simulations feature a number of interesting
new features that are consistent with recent MMS observations, including cold beams of sheath electrons
that penetrate into the hotter magnetospheric inflow, the related observation of decreasing temperature
in regions of increasing total density, and an effective turbulent diffusion coefficient that
agrees with quasi-linear theoretical predictions.
