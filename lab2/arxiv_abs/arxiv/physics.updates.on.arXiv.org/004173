Efficient monitoring of airborne particulate matter (PM), especially particles with aerodynamic
diameter less than 2.5 um (PM2.5), is crucial for improving public health. Reliable information
on the concentration, size distribution and chemical characteristics of PMs is key to evaluating
air pollution and identifying its sources. Standard methods for PM2.5 characterization require
sample collection from the atmosphere and post-analysis using sophisticated equipment in a laboratory
environment, and are normally very time-consuming. Although optical methods based on analysis
of scattering of free-space laser beams or evanescent fields are in principle suitable for real-time
particle counting and sizing, lack of knowledge of the refractive index in these methods not only
leads to inevitable sizing ambiguity but also prevents identification of the particle material.
In the case of evanescent wave detection, the system lifetime is strongly limited by adhesion of
particles to the surfaces. Here we report a novel technique for airborne particle metrology based
on hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. It offers in situ particle counting, sizing and refractive
index measurement with effectively unlimited device lifetime, and relies on optical forces that
automatically capture airborne particles in front of the hollow core and propel them into the fibre.
The resulting transmission drop, together with the time-of-flight of the particles passing through
the fibre, provide unambiguous mapping of particle size and refractive index with high accuracy.
The technique represents a considerable advance over currently available real-time particle
metrology systems, and can be directly applied to monitoring air pollution in the open atmosphere
as well as precise particle characterization in a local environment such as a closed room or a reaction
vessel.
