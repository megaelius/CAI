We re-considered the properties of electromagnetic waves excited by ring-beam electron in the
solar atmosphere as they are caused by magnetic reconnection. Due to the positive gradients in their
velocity distribution along the both parallel and perpendicular directions to the ambient magnetic
field, i.e., $u_{\parallel} \cdot df/du_{\parallel} > 0$ and $df /du_{\perp} > 0$, not only beam
instability but also so called electron cyclotron maser (ECM) instability can be excited, respectively,
which may generate escaping electromagnetic waves. In order to fully understand the properties
of the waves generated in the course of the propagation of such beams, we investigated the intensity
and polarization properties of these excited waves in dependence on the evolving beam density and
coronal magnetic field strength. For this sake, we utilized 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell
(PIC) code numerical simulations. We found that predominantly electrostatic plasma waves are
generated but also highly anisotropic and polarized electromagnetic whistler, Z, O and X-mode
waves. Their intensity anisotropy strongly depends on the number density ratio between the ring-beam
electrons and background electrons. Circular polarization degree (CPD) and spectrogram of the
escaping electromagnetic waves with $\omega > \omega_{pe}$ and $|c k/\omega| < 1$ are also strongly
anisotropic, but become more symmetric about the wave propagation direction $\theta = 90^{\circ}$
for denser ring-beam electron population. Meanwhile, with denser ring-beam electron population,
escaping waves are predominantly left-handed polarized over a wide range of propagation directions.
We discuss the consequences of our findings for using the solar radio burst observations to diagnose
the beam and plasma conditions at the sites of their generation.
