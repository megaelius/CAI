Image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling enables derivation of hemodynamic information,
which has become a paradigm in cardiovascular research and healthcare. Nonetheless, the predictive
accuracy largely depends on precisely specified boundary conditions and model parameters, which,
however, are usually uncertain in most patient-specific cases. Quantifying the uncertainties
in model predictions due to input randomness can provide predictive confidence and is critical
to promote the transition of CFD modeling in clinical applications. In the meantime, forward propagation
of input uncertainties often involves numerous expensive CFD simulations, which is computationally
prohibitive in most practical scenarios. This paper presents an efficient bi-fidelity surrogate
modeling framework for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in cardiovascular simulations, by leveraging
the accuracy of high-fidelity models and efficiency of low-fidelity models. Contrary to most data-fit
surrogate models with several scalar quantities of interest, this work aims to provide high-resolution,
full-field predictions. Moreover, a novel empirical error bound estimation approach is introduced
to evaluate the performance of the surrogate a priori. The proposed framework is tested on a number
of vascular flows with both standardized and patient-specific vessel geometries, and different
combinations of high- and low-fidelity models are investigated. The results show that the bi-fidelity
approach can achieve high predictive accuracy with a significant reduction of computational cost,
exhibiting its merit and effectiveness. Particularly, the uncertainties from a high-dimensional
input space can be accurately propagated to clinically relevant quantities of interest in the patient-specific
case using only a limited number of high-fidelity simulations, suggesting a good potential in practical
clinical applications.
