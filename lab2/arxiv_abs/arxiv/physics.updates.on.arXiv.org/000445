During the last decade, network approaches became a powerful tool to describe protein structure
and dynamics. Here, we describe first the protein structure networks of molecular chaperones,
then characterize chaperone containing sub-networks of interactomes called as chaperone-networks
or chaperomes. We review the role of molecular chaperones in short-term adaptation of cellular
networks in response to stress, and in long-term adaptation discussing their putative functions
in the regulation of evolvability. We provide a general overview of possible network mechanisms
of adaptation, learning and memory formation. We propose that changes of network rigidity play
a key role in learning and memory formation processes. Flexible network topology provides "learning
competent" state. Here, networks may have much less modular boundaries than locally rigid, highly
modular networks, where the learnt information has already been consolidated in a memory formation
process. Since modular boundaries are efficient filters of information, in the "learning competent"
state information filtering may be much smaller, than after memory formation. This mechanism restricts
high information transfer to the "learning competent" state. After memory formation, modular
boundary-induced segregation and information filtering protect the stored information. The
flexible networks of young organisms are generally in a "learning competent" state. On the contrary,
locally rigid networks of old organisms have lost their "learning competent" state, but store and
protect their learnt information efficiently. We anticipate that the above mechanism may operate
at the level of both protein-protein interaction and neuronal networks.
