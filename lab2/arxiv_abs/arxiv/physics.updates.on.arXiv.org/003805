A number of recent experimental studies have shown that solid-state complex organic molecules
(COMs) can form under conditions that are relevant to the CO freeze-out stage in dense clouds. In
this work, we show that alcohols can be formed well before the CO freeze-out stage (i.e., in the H2O-rich
ice phase). This joint experimental and computational investigation shows that the isomers, n-
and i-propanol (H3CCH2CH2OH and H3CCHOHCH3) and n- and i-propenol (H3CCHCHOH and H3CCOHCH2),
can be formed in radical-addition reactions starting from propyne (H3CCCH) + OH at the low temperature
of 10 K, where H3CCCH is one of the simplest representatives of stable carbon chains already identified
in the interstellar medium (ISM). The resulting average abundance ratio of 1:1 for n-propanol:i-propanol
is aligned with the conclusions from the computational work that the geometric orientation of strongly
interacting species is influential to the extent of which 'mechanism' is participating, and that
an assortment of geometries leads to an averaged-out effect. Three isomers of propanediol are also
tentatively identified in the experiments. It is also shown that propene and propane (H3CCHCH2
and H3CCH2CH3) are formed from the hydrogenation of H3CCCH. Computationally-derived activation
barriers give additional insight into what types of reactions and mechanisms are more likely to
occur in the laboratory and in the ISM. Our findings not only suggest that the alcohols studied here
share common chemical pathways and therefore can show up simultaneously in astronomical surveys,
but also that their extended counterparts that derive from polyynes containing H3C(CC)nH structures
may exist in the ISM. Such larger species, like fatty alcohols, are the possible constituents of
simple lipids that primitive cell membranes on the early Earth are thought to be partially composed
of.
