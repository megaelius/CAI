Initially, we present our original fast dynamo mechanism being potentially at work concerning
the Sun and the solar type stars. Then, based on this new prototype model, a dynamo action model explaining
the generation of the magnetic fields for A, Ap and Am type stars will be derived. We argue that their
magnetic behavior is essentially due to locally exotic plasma properties leading to large scale
charge separation in their interior. Their powerful magnetic fields are generated by the revolution
speed of these excess positive or negative charges tightly associated with the formation of one
or two so called Torus structures. The lifespan of the Torus charge defines the stellar activity
cycle. In the solar case, two Torus structures are formed preserving their charge for 11 years. The
Torus charging results from two processes: First, the stellar differential rotation with its shear
layers and second, the local plasma property that the plasma rotational speed (U) is equal or greater
than the local light speed (v) in the medium. If U is greater than v, then two nearby pocket charges
(initially formed by the stellar differential rotation) will be mutually attracted. That is, the
attractive magnetic force will be greater than the repulsive electric one. In addition, the same
poloidal field, in the subphotosphere shear layer, produces an excess charge generating the starspot
activity. The solar birthplace of Torus, within the tachocline, is positioned at 45 deg. latitudes.
Each Torus drifts equatorward increasing steadily its own rotational speed and, consequently,
its own strength of poloidal magnetic field. A single Torus, over the equatorial plane, is probably
formed in the interior of an Ap type star producing its strong and global dipole like magnetic field.
