We use direct numerical simulation to study the temporal evolution of a perturbation localized
on the turbulent layer that typically separates a cloud from the surrounding clear air. Across this
shearless layer, a turbulent kinetic energy gradient naturally forms. Here, a finite perturbation
in the form of a local initial temperature fluctuation is applied to simulate a hydrodynamic instability
inside the background turbulent air flow. A numerical initial value problem for two diametrically
opposite types of drop population distributions is then solved. Specifically, we consider a mono-disperse
population of droplets of 15 $\mu$m of radius and a poly-disperse distribution with radii in the
range 0.6 - 30 $\mu$m. For both distributions, it is observed that the evaporation and condensation
have a dramatically different weight inside the homogeneous cloudy region and the interfacial
anisotropic mixing region. It is observed that the dynamics of drop collisions is highly effected
by the turbulence structure of the host region. The two populations show a common aspect during their
energy decay transient. That is the increased probability of collisions in the interfacial layer
hat houses intense anisotropic velocity fluctuations. This layer, in fact, induces an enhanced
differentiation on droplets kinetic energy and sizes. Both polydisperse and monodisperse initial
particle distributions contain $10^7$ droplets, matching an initial liquid water content of $0.8
g/m^3$. An estimate of the turbulent collision kernel for geometric collisions used in the population
balance equations is given. A preliminary discussion is presented on the structure of the two unsteady
non ergodic collision kernels obtained inside the cloud interface region.
