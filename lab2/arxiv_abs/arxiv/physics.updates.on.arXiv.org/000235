Several mechanisms control male moth's navigation towards a female releasing sex pheromone. Optomotor
anemotaxis is a visual mechanism for the moth flight direction relative to the ground, mechanoreceptors
are used for calculating its speed relative to the air current and chemoreceptors on the antennae
for sampling the pheromone concentration in the air. All together result in a zigzagging flight
pattern of the male moth that depends on the characteristics of its encounters with the pheromone
plume. The zigzagging flight pattern includes constant counter-turnings across the wind line
in an angle up to 90 degree (casting). In this paper we address how air turbulence manifests the male
flight behavior in respect to the streamwise current that carries the pheromone, emphasizing a
relationship between the flight speed and the turbulent plume properties. The interaction between
the moth flight and the flow field characteristics was examined in a wind tunnel where moth trajectory
was recorded. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and scalar imaging technique were utilized for
measuring velocities and scalar concentration distribution in the tunnel. The role of turbulence
in the moth navigation was evaluated by calculating the correlation function of the moth trajectory
path, the velocity fluctuation in the streamwise and normal directions and the concentration fields.
We have found that the moth navigates in a manner which is directly correlated with the turbulent
flow characteristics: the upwind motion is related to the streamwise variations of the pheromone
concentration while the zigzagging motion is correlated with the cross-stream turbulent flow
fluctuations. This finding can explain how the angle of the counter-turning flights, in respect
to the main current, relates each encounter with the pheromone patch to the zigzagging flight pattern
