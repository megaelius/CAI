Colloidal Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) nanoplatelets (NPLs) are a recently developed class of efficient
luminescent nanomaterial suitable for optoelectronic device applications. A change in temperature
greatly affects their electronic bandstructure and luminescence properties. It is important
to understand how-and-why the characteristics of NPLs are influenced, particularly at elevated
temperature, where both reversible and irreversible quenching processes come into picture. Here
we present a study on the effect of elevated temperature on the characteristics of colloidal CdSe
NPLs. We used an effective-mass envelope function theory based 8-band k$\cdot$p model and density-matrix
theory considering exciton-phonon interaction. We observed the photoluminescence (PL) spectra
at various temperatures for their photon emission energy, PL linewidth and intensity by considering
the exciton-phonon interaction with both acoustic and optical phonons using Bose-Einstein statistical
factors. With rise in temperature we observed a fall in the transition energy (emission redshift),
matrix element, Fermi factor and quasi Fermi separation, with reduction in intraband state gaps
and increased interband coupling. Also, there was a fall in the PL intensity, along with spectral
broadening due to an intraband scattering effect. The predicted transition energy values and simulated
PL spectra at varying temperatures exhibit appreciable consistency with experimental results.
Our findings have important implications for application of NPLs in optoelectronic devices, such
as NPL lasers and LEDs, operating much above room temperature.
