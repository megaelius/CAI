An alternative way of deriving the Finite Difference Time Domain method (FDTD) for simulating the
dynamics of electromagnetic waves in matter for one dimensional systems with grid spacing and material
properties that vary with position is presented. This alternative derivation provides useful
insight into the physics of electromagnetic waves in matter and the properties of FDTD. The method
uses d'Alembert's splitting of waves into forward and backward pulses of arbitrary shape to solve
the one-dimensional wave equation. Constant velocity of waves in dispersionless dielectric materials,
partial reflection and transmission at boundaries between materials with different indices of
refraction, and partial reflection, transmission, and attenuation through conducting materials
are derived in the process of deriving the method so that real physics is learned simultaneously
with the numerics. The traditional FDTD equations are reproduced from a model of wave pulses partially
reflecting, transmitting, and attenuating through regions of constant current. The alternative
method therefore shows the physical effects of the finite difference approximation in a way that
is easy to visualize. The method allows for easy derivation of some results that are more complicated
to derive with the traditional method, such as showing that FDTD is exact for dielectrics when the
ratio of the spatial and temporal grid spacing is the wave speed, incorporating reflectionless
boundary conditions, and showing the method retains second order accuracy when the grid spacing
varies with position and the material parameters make sudden jumps across layer boundaries.
