It is known that rapidly rotating turbulent flows are characterized by the emergence of simultaneous
upscale and downscale energy transfer. Indeed, both numerics and experiments show the formation
of large-scale anisotropic vortices together with the development of small-scale dissipative
structures. However the organization of interactions leading to this complex dynamics remains
unclear. Two different mechanisms are known to be able to transfer energy upscale in a turbulent
flow. The first is characterized by two-dimensional interactions among triads lying on the two-dimensional,
three-component (2D3C) manifold, namely on the Fourier plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.
The second mechanism is three-dimensional and consists of interactions between triads with the
same sign of helicity (homochiral). Here, we present a detailed numerical study of rotating flows
using a suite of high Reynolds number direct numerical simulations within different parameter
regimes to analyze both upscale and downscale cascade ranges. We find that the upscale cascade at
wave numbers close to the forcing scale is generated by increasingly dominant homochiral interactions
which couple the three-dimensional bulk and the 2D3C plane. This coupling produces an accumulation
of energy in the 2D3C plane, which then transfers energy to smaller wave numbers thanks to the two-dimensional
mechanism. In the forward cascade range, we find that the energy transfer is dominated by heterochiral
triads and is dominated primarily by interaction within the fast manifold where $k_z\ne0$. We further
analyze the energy transfer in different regions in the real-space domain. In particular, we distinguish
high-strain from high-vorticity regions and we uncover that while the mean transfer is produced
inside regions of strain, the rare but extreme events of energy transfer occur primarily inside
the large-scale column vortices.
