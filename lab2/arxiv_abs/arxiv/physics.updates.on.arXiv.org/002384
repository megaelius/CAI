Tangentially viewing fast camera footage of the low-field side snowflake minus divertor in TCV
is analysed across a four point scan in which the proximity of the two X-points is varied systematically.
The motion of structures observed in the post- processed movie shows two distinct regions of the
camera frame exhibiting differing patterns. One type of motion in the outer scrape-off layer remains
present throughout the scan whilst the other, apparent in the inner scrape-off layer between the
two nulls, becomes increasingly significant as the X-points contract towards one another. The
spatial structure of the fluctuations in both regions is shown to conform to the equilibrium magnetic
field. When the X-point gap is wide the fluctuations measured in the region between the X-points
show a similar structure to the fluctuations observed above the null region, remaining coherent
for multiple toroidal turns of the magnetic field and indicating a physical connectivity of the
fluctuations between the upstream and downstream regions. When the X-point gap is small the fluctuations
in the inner scrape-off layer between the nulls are decorrelated from fluctuations upstream, indicating
local production of filamentary structures. The motion of filaments in the inter-null region differs,
with filaments showing a dominantly poloidal motion along magnetic flux surfaces when the X-point
gap is large, compared to a dominantly radial motion across flux-surfaces when the gap is small.
This demonstrates an enhancement to cross-field tranport between the nulls of the TCV low-field-side
snowflake minus when the gap between the nulls is small.
