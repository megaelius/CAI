Spectral and grating-based differential phase-contrast X-ray imaging are two emerging technologies
that offer additional information compared to conventional attenuation-based X-ray imaging.
In the case of spectral imaging, energy-resolved measurements allow the generation of material-specific
images by exploiting differences in the energy-dependent attenuation. Differential phase-contrast
imaging uses the phase shift that an X-ray wave exhibits when traversing an object as contrast generation
mechanism. Recently, we have investigated the combination of these two imaging techniques (spectral
differential phase-contrast imaging) and demonstrated potential advantages compared to spectral
imaging. In this work, we present a noise analysis framework that allows the prediction of (co-)
variances and noise power spectra for all three imaging methods. Moreover, the optimum acquisition
parameters for a particular imaging task can be determined. We use this framework for a performance
comparison of all three imaging methods. The comparison is focused on (projected) electron density
images since they can be calculated with all three imaging methods. Our study shows that spectral
differential phase-contrast imaging enables the calculation of electron density images with
strongly reduced noise levels compared to the other two imaging methods for a large range of clinically
relevant pixel sizes. In contrast to conventional differential phase-contrast imaging, there
are no long-ranging noise correlations for spectral differential phase-contrast imaging. This
means that excessive low frequency noise can be avoided. We confirm the analytical predictions
by numerical simulations.
