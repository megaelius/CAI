In this study we attempt to explore the consequences of surfactant coating on the electrohydrodynamic
manipulation of a drop motion in a plane Poiseuielle flow. In addition we consider bulk insoluble
surfactants and a linear dependency of the surface tension on the surfactant concentration. Subsequently
a double asymptotic perturbation method is used in terms of small electric Reynolds number and capillary
number in the limit of a diffusion-dominated surfactant transport mechanism. Also going beyond
the widely employed axisymmetric framework, the coupled system of governing differential equations
in three dimensions are then solved by adopting the `generalized Lamb solution technique'. The
expressions of key variables suggest that the flow curvature of the external flow, the electric
field effects and the surfactant effects are coupled in a non-trivial manner, well beyond a linear
superposition. A careful investigation shows that surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses interacts
with the electrohydrodynamic stresses in a highly coupled fashion. Owing to this, under different
combinations of electrical conductivity and permittivity ratios, the Mason number and the applied
electric field direction, the surfactants affect differently on the longitudinal as well as cross-stream
migration velocity of the drop. The present results may be of utmost importance in providing a deep
insight to the underlying complex physical mechanisms. Most importantly the ability of surfactants
in selectively controlling the drop motion in different directions, makes them suitable for achieving
a new degree of freedom in the electrical actuation of droplets in the microfluidic devices.
