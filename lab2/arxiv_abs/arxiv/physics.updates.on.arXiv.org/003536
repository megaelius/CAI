This paper aims to numerically verify the large Reynolds number asymptotic theory of magneto-hydrodynamic
(MHD) flows proposed in the companion paper Deguchi (2019). To avoid any complexity associated
with the chaotic nature of turbulence and flow geometry, nonlinear steady solutions of the viscous-resistive
magneto-hydrodynamic equations in plane Couette flow have been utilised. Two classes of nonlinear
MHD states, which convert kinematic energy to magnetic energy effectively, have been determined.
The first class of nonlinear states can be obtained when a small spanwise uniform magnetic field
is applied to the known hydrodynamic solution branch of the plane Couette flow. The nonlinear states
are characterised by the hydrodynamic/magnetic roll-streak and the resonant layer at which strong
vorticity and current sheets are observed. These flow features, and the induced strong streamwise
magnetic field, are fully consistent with the vortex/Alfv\'en wave interaction theory proposed
in Deguchi (2019). When the spanwise uniform magnetic field is switched off, the solutions become
purely hydrodynamic. However, the second class of `self-sustained shear driven dynamos' at the
zero-external magnetic field limit can be found by homotopy via the forced states subject to a spanwise
uniform current field. The discovery of the dynamo states has motivated the corresponding large
Reynolds number matched asymptotic analysis in Deguchi (2019). Here, the reduced equations derived
by the asymptotic theory have been solved numerically. The asymptotic solution provides remarkably
good predictions for the finite Reynolds number dynamo solutions.
