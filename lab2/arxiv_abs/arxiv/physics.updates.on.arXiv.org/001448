We investigate the time dependence of electromagnetic-field-to-plasma energy conversion in
the electron diffusion region of asymmetric magnetic reconnection. To do so, we consider the terms
in Poynting's theorem. In a steady state there is a perfect balance between the divergence of the
electromagnetic energy flux $\nabla \cdot \vec{S}$ and the conversion between electromagnetic
field and particle energy $\vec{J} \cdot \vec{E}$. This energy balance is demonstrated with a particle-in-cell
simulation of reconnection. We also evaluate each of the terms in Poynting's theorem during an observation
of a magnetopause reconnection region by Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS). We take the equivalence
of both sides of Poynting's theorem as an indication that the errors associated with the approximation
of each term with MMS data are small. We find that, for this event, balance between $\vec{J}\cdot\vec{E}=-\nabla\cdot\vec{S}$
is only achieved for a small fraction of the energy conversion region at/near the X-point. Magnetic
energy was rapidly accumulating on either side of the current sheet at roughly three times the predicted
energy conversion rate. Furthermore, we find that while $\vec{J}\cdot\vec{E}>0$ and $\nabla\cdot\vec{S}<0$
are observed, as is expected for reconnection, the energy accumulation is driven by the overcompensation
for $\vec{J}\cdot\vec{E}$ by $-\nabla\cdot\vec{S}>\vec{J}\cdot\vec{E}$. We note that due
to the assumptions necessary to do this calculation, the accurate evaluation of $\nabla\cdot\vec{S}$
may not be possible for every MMS-observed reconnection event; but if possible, this is a simple
approach to determine if reconnection is or is not in a steady-state.
