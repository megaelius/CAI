We theoretically investigated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of ultraviolet surface
plasmon modes in aluminum nanodisks. Using full-wave simulations, we studied the impact of diameter
on the resonant modes of the nanodisks. We found that the mode behavior can be separately classified
for two distinct cases: (1) flat nanodisks where the diameter is much less than the thickness; and
(2) thick nanodisks where the diameter is comparable to the thickness. While the multipolar edge
modes and breathing modes of flat nanostructures have previously been interpreted using intuitive,
analytical models based on surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes of a thin-film stack, it has been
found that the true dispersion relation of the multipolar edge modes deviates significantly from
the SPP dispersion relation. Here, we developed a modified intuitive model that uses effective
wavelength theory to accurately model this dispersion relation with significantly less computational
overhead compared to full-wave electromagnetic simulations. However, for the case of thick nanodisks,
this effective wavelength theory breaks down, and such intuitive models are no longer viable. We
found that this is because some modes of the thick nanodisks carry a polar (i.e. out of the substrate
plane, or along the electron beam direction) dependence and cannot be simply categorized as radial
breathing modes or angular (azimuthal) multipolar edge modes. This polar dependence leads to radiative
losses, motivating the use of simultaneous EELS and cathodoluminescence measurements when experimentally
investigating the complex mode behavior of thick nanostructures.
