Materials with acoustic quantities similar to soft-tissue are essential as tissue-mimicking
materials for diagnostic ultrasound (US). Acoustic quantity consists of the sound velocity (cus),
acoustic impedance (AI) and attenuation coefficient. In this work, the acoustic quantities of
neoprene rubber, beeswax, and Carbomer-gel were determined. The cus and attenuation coefficient
were estimated using the pulse-echo technique. The AI was calculated from the product of density
and cus. Results were compared with a benchmark based on the International Commission on Radiation
Units and Measurements Report-61, Tissue Substitutes, Phantoms and Computational Modelling
in Medical Ultrasound. The acceptance criteria were 1.043 g/cm3 (density), 1561 m/s (cus), 1.63
MRayls (AI) and attenuation coefficients within 0.5-0.7 dB/cm/MHz. Computerized tomography
(CT) and US images of specimens were obtained to compare with respective images of the human liver
(a clinical soft-tissue), to evaluate the similarities in image contrast and echogenicity. Results
of neoprene and beeswax were unsatisfactory.However, the acoustic quantities of Carbomer-gel
(density 1.03 g/cm3, cus 1567 m/s, and AI 1.61 MRayls, and attenuation coefficient 0.6 dB/cm/MHz)
were satisfactory within 2%. Carbomer-gel images could efficiently mimic the contrast and echogenicity
of liver images. The uncertainties in cus measurements were 0.36 %, 0.11 % and 0.28 % for neoprene-50,
beeswax and C-gel respectively. The attenuation coefficients had uncertainties 4.2 %, 1.9 %, and
2.6 % in these samples. The results of Carbomer-gel could resemble soft-tissue for US. It contains
95 % water, is effortless to prepare, and can support in developing a low-cost phantom for periodic
performance evaluation of US scanners and contribute to patient care.
