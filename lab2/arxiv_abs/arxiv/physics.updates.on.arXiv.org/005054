Plasmonic photocatalysis has facilitated rapid progress in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency
under visible light irradiation. Poor visible-light-responsive photocatalytic materials and
low photocatalytic efficiency remain major challenges. Plasmonic metal-semiconductor heterostructures
where both the metal and semiconductor are photosensitive are promising for light harvesting catalysis,
as both components can absorb solar light. Efficiency of photon capture can be further improved
by structuring the catalyst as a photonic crystal. Here we report the synthesis of photonic crystal
plasmonic photocatalyst materials using Au nanoparticle-functionalized inverse opal (IO) photonic
crystals. A catalyst prepared using a visible light responsive semiconductor (V2O5) displayed
over an order of magnitude increase in reaction rate under green light excitation ($\lambda$=532
nm) compared to no illumination. The superior performance of Au-V2O5 IO was attributed to spectral
overlap of the electronic band gap, localized surface plasmon resonance and incident light source.
Comparing the photocatalytic performance of Au-V2O5 IO with a conventional Au-TiO2 IO catalyst,
where the semiconductor band gap is in the UV, revealed that optimal photocatalytic activity is
observed under different illumination conditions depending on the nature of the semiconductor.
For the Au-TiO2 catalyst, despite coupling of the LSPR and excitation source at $\lambda$=532 nm,
this was not as effective in enhancing photocatalytic activity compared to carrying out the reaction
under broadband visible light, which is attributed to improved photon adsorption in the visible
by the presence of a photonic band gap, and exploiting slow light in the photonic crystal to enhance
photon absorption to create this synergistic type of photocatalyst.
