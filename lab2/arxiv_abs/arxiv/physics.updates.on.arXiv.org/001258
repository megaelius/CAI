The present study addresses the role of molecular non-equilibrium effects in thermal ignition
problems. We consider a single binary reaction of the form $A+B \rightarrow C+C$. Molecular dynamics
calculations were performed for activation energies ranging between RT and 7.5RT and heat release
of 2.5RT and 10RT. The evolution of up to 10,000 particles was calculated as the system undergoes
a thermal ignition at constant volume. Ensemble averages of 100 calculations for each parameter
set permitted to determine the ignition delay, along with a measure of the stochasticity of the process.
A well behaved convergence to large system sizes is also demonstrated. The ignition delay calculations
were compared with those obtained at the continuum level using rates derived from kinetic theory:
the standard rate assuming that the distribution of the speed of the particles is the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution, and the perturbed rates by Prigogine and Xhrouet [1] for an isothermal system, and
Prigogine and Mahieu [2] for an energy releasing reaction, obtained by the Chapman-Enskog perturbation
procedure. The molecular results were found in very good agreement with the latter at low temperatures,
confirming that non-equilibrium effects promote the formation of energetic particles, that serve
as seeds for subsequent reaction events: i.e., hot spots. This effect was found to lower the ignition
delay by up to 30%. At high temperatures, the ignition delay obtained from the standard equilibrium
rate was found to be up to 60% longer than the molecular calculations. This effect is due to the rapidity
of the reactive collisions that do not allow the system to equilibrate. For this regime, none of the
perturbation solutions obtained by the Chapman-Enskog procedure were valid. This study thus shows
the importance of non-equilibrium effects in thermal ignition problems, for all temperatures
of practical interest.
