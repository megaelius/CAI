The data by Q.Yang et al suggest absence of "ultrafast flow" of solvent across graphene oxide (GO)
membranes. The "ultrafast flow" is result of using unrealistic geometrical model with close packed
hole-free micrometer sized GO flakes providing only 0.1 % of area in each layer available for permeation.
The data by Q.Yang et all demonstrate that at least 3-5 % of total layer area are available for permeation
in real GO membranes due to holes between irregularly shaped flakes. At least 2-3 percent of area
also needs to be added to the permeation cross section due to holes and cracks in GO flakes, especially
abundant due to prolonged sonication of dispersions. Permeation of solutions mostly through pinholes
penetrating tens of GO layers suggests that "graphene capillaries" are not required to explain
water flow across the membrane. Taking into account realistic packing of GO flakes with holes between
the flakes and across the flakes, 2-3 orders of magnitude shorter permeation path should be formed.
Considering shorter zigzag permeation path between GO sheets and 5-10 % of area in each layer available
for permeation due to holes across and between GO flakes, permeation rates across GO membranes can
be explained by trivial diffusion. In absence of "graphene capillaries", the "ultra-precise sieving"
related to "cutoff" value of 4.5 \AA{} (hydration diameter) provided by "graphene capillaries"
has little meaning. As it is well known from earlier studies and now demonstrated by Q.Yang et al using
their own samples the swelling of GO membranes is different for different solutions, depends on
concentration of solutes and results in delamination in many solutions. Q.Yang et al provide controversial
data for stability of their GO membranes in water citing use of surfactant to prevent dissolving.
Oxidation state of GO membranes remains to be unknown due to incorrect analysis of XPS spectra.
