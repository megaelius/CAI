Forecasting the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been a subject of vigorous research due
to the important role of the phenomenon in climate dynamics and its worldwide socioeconomic impacts.
Over the past decades, numerous models for ENSO prediction have been developed, among which statistical
models approximating ENSO evolution by linear dynamics have received significant attention owing
to their simplicity and comparable forecast skill to first-principles models at short lead times.
Yet, due to highly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, such models have limited skill for longer-term
forecasts beyond half a year. To resolve this limitation, here we employ a new nonparametric statistical
approach based on analog forecasting, called kernel analog forecasting (KAF), which avoids assumptions
on the underlying dynamics through the use of for nonlinear kernel methods for machine learning.
Through a rigorous connection with Koopman operator theory for dynamical systems, KAF yields statistically
optimal predictions of future ENSO states as conditional expectations, given noisy and potentially
incomplete data at forecast initialization. Here, using industrial-era Indo-Pacific sea surface
temperature (SST) as training data, the method is shown to successfully predict the Nino 3.4 index
in a 1988-2017 verification period out to a 13-month lead, which corresponds to an increase of 6 months
over a benchmark linear inverse model (LIM), while significantly improving upon the ENSO predictability
"spring barrier". Additionally, analysis of a 1300-yr control integration of a comprehensive
climate model demonstrates that the enhanced skill of KAF holds over potentially much longer leads,
extending to 24 months versus 11 months in the benchmark LIM. Probabilistic forecasts for the occurrence
of El Nino/La Nina events are also performed, and assessed via information-theoretic metrics.
