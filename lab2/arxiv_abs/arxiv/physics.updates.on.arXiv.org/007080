The selection rule for angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) intensity of phonons from standard
group-theoretical method in isotropic materials would break down in anisotropic layered materials
(ALMs) due to birefringence and linear dichroism effects. The two effects result in depth-dependent
polarization and intensity of incident laser and scattered signal inside ALMs and thus make a challenge
to predict ARPR intensity at any laser incidence direction. Herein, taking in-plane anisotropic
black phosphorus as a prototype, we developed a so-called birefringence-linear-dichroism (BLD)
model to quantitatively understand its ARPR intensity at both normal and oblique laser incidences
by the same set of real Raman tensors for certain laser excitation. No fitting parameter is needed,
once the birefringence and linear dichroism effects are considered with the complex refractive
indexes. An approach was proposed to experimentally determine real Raman tensor and complex refractive
indexes, respectively, from the relative Raman intensity along its principle axes and incident-angle
resolved reflectivity by Fresnel$'$s law. The results suggest that the previously reported ARPR
intensity of ultrathin ALM flakes deposited on a multilayered substrate at normal laser incidence
can be also understood based on the BLD model by considering the depth-dependent polarization and
intensity of incident laser and scattered Raman signal induced by both birefringence and linear
dichroism effects within ALM flakes and the interference effects in the multilayered structures,
which are dependent on the excitation wavelength, thickness of ALM flakes and dielectric layers
of the substrate. This work can be generally applicable to any opaque anisotropic crystals, offering
a promising route to predict and manipulate the polarized behaviors of related phonons.
