Due to the emerging of new technologies, the whole electricity system is undergoing transformations
on ascale and pace never observed before. In particular, the decentralization of energy resources
and the smartgrid have changed the rules of the game and have forced utilities to rethink therelationships
with the customers. The so-called demand response (DR) seeks to adjust the demand for powerinstead
of adjusting the supply. However, DR business models rely on customer participation and are effectiveonly
if large numbers of customers in the same region of the power grid opt in. Here, we introduce a model
for the dynamics of service adoption, in which the behavior of a customer isinfluenced by its social
contacts but also depends on the specific spatial configuration of the other customersin close
proximity in the power grid. In particular, we use a multiplex networks with two layers, the sociallayer
among customers and the power grid connecting the households, which are coupled together. While
theadoption process runs on the social layer, the node- and time-dependent recovery rate of the
nodes dependson the states of their neighbors on the power-grid layer, so that the dynamics tends
to preserve clusters ofinfected individuals by making an infected node surrounded by nodes in the
same state less keen to recover.We find that strong local influence of the costumers actions leads
to a discontinuous transition where eitherno or all nodes in the network are infected, depending
on the infection rate, i.e. the advertisement force andsocial pressure to adopt. For high local
pressure to keep the adoption, we find that clusters of local earlyadopters help that eventually
all nodes adopt. This suggests direct marketing strategies on how to efficientlyestablish and
maintain new technologies such as demand response schemes.
