Drawing appropriate diagrams is a useful problem solving heuristic that can transform a problem
into a representation that is easier to exploit for solving it. One major focus while helping introductory
physics students learn effective problem solving is to help them understand that drawing diagrams
can facilitate problem solution. We conducted an investigation in which two different interventions
were implemented during recitation quizzes in a large enrollment algebra-based introductory
physics course. Students were either (i) asked to solve problems in which the diagrams were drawn
for them or (ii) explicitly told to draw a diagram. A comparison group was not given any instruction
regarding diagrams. We developed rubrics to score the problem solving performance of students
in different intervention groups and investigated ten problems. We found that students who were
provided diagrams never performed better and actually performed worse than the other students
on three problems, one involving standing sound waves in a tube (discussed elsewhere) and two problems
in electricity which we focus on here. These two problems were the only problems in electricity that
involved considerations of initial and final conditions, which may partly account for why students
provided with diagrams performed significantly worse than students who were not provided with
diagrams. In order to explore potential reasons for this finding, we conducted interviews with
students and found that some students provided with diagrams may have spent less time on the conceptual
analysis and planning stage of the problem solving process. In particular, those provided with
the diagram were more likely to jump into the implementation stage of problem solving early without
fully analyzing and understanding the problem, which can increase the likelihood of mistakes in
solutions.
