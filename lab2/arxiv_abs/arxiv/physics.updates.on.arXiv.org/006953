Non-Markovian dynamics pervades human activity and social networks and it induces memory effects
and burstiness in a wide range of processes including inter-event time distributions, duration
of interactions in temporal networks and human mobility. Here we propose a non-Markovian Majority-Vote
model (NMMV) that introduces non-Markovian effects in the standard (Markovian) Majority-Vote
model (SMV). The SMV model is one of the simplest two-state stochastic models for studying opinion
dynamics, and displays a continuous order-disorder phase transition at a critical noise. In the
NMMV model we assume that the probability that an agent changes state is not only dependent on the
majority state of his neighbors but it also depends on his {\em age}, i.e. how long the agent has been
in his current state. The NMMV model has two regimes: the aging regime implies that the probability
that an agent changes state is decreasing with his age, while in the anti-aging regime the probability
that an agent changes state is increasing with his age. Interestingly, we find that the critical
noise at which we observe the order-disorder phase transition is a non-monotonic function of the
rate $\beta$ of the aging (anti-aging) process. In particular the critical noise in the aging regime
displays a maximum as a function of $\beta$ while in the anti-aging regime displays a minimum. This
implies that the aging/anti-aging dynamics can retard/anticipate the transition and that there
is an optimal rate $\beta$ for maximally perturbing the value of the critical noise. The analytical
results obtained in the framework of the heterogeneous mean-field approach are validated by extensive
numerical simulations on a large variety of network topologies.
