Zonal jets in a barotropic setup emerge out of homogeneous turbulence through a flow-forming instability
of the homogeneous turbulent state (`zonostrophic instability') which occurs as the turbulence
intensity increases. This has been demonstrated using the statistical state dynamics (SSD) framework
with a closure at second order. Furthermore, it was shown that for small supercriticality the flow-forming
instability follows Ginzburg-Landau (G-L) dynamics. Here, the SSD framework is used to study the
equilibration of this flow-forming instability for small supercriticality. First, we compare
the predictions of the weakly nonlinear G-L dynamics to the fully nonlinear SSD dynamics closed
at second order for a wide ranges of parameters. A new branch of jet equilibria is revealed that is
not contiguously connected with the G-L branch. This new branch at weak supercriticalities involves
jets with larger amplitude compared to the ones of the G-L branch. Furthermore, this new branch continues
even for subcritical values with respect to the linear flow-forming instability. Thus, a new nonlinear
flow-forming instability out of homogeneous turbulence is revealed. Second, we investigate how
both the linear flow-forming instability and the novel nonlinear flow-forming instability are
equilibrated. We identify the physical processes underlying the jet equilibration as well as the
types of eddies that contribute in each process. Third, we propose a modification of the diffusion
coefficient of the G-L dynamics that is able to capture the asymmetric evolution for weak jets at
scales other than the marginal scale (side-band instabilities) for the linear flow-forming instability.
