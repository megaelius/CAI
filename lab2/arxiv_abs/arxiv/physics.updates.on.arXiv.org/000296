We present the results of the characterization of silicon pixel modules employing n-in-p planar
sensors with an active thickness of 150 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, produced at MPP/HLL, and 100-200 $\mathrm{\mu}$m
thin active edge sensor devices, produced at VTT in Finland. These thin sensors are designed as candidates
for the ATLAS pixel detector upgrade to be operated at the HL-LHC, as they ensure radiation hardness
at high fluences. They are interconnected to the ATLAS FE-I3 and FE-I4 read-out chips. Moreover,
the n-in-p technology only requires a single side processing and thereby it is a cost-effective
alternative to the n-in-n pixel technology presently employed in the LHC experiments. High precision
beam test measurements of the hit efficiency have been performed on these devices both at the CERN
SpS and at DESY, Hamburg. We studied the behavior of these sensors at different bias voltages and
different beam incident angles up to the maximum one expected for the new Insertable B-Layer of ATLAS
and for HL-LHC detectors. Results obtained with 150 $\mathrm{\mu}$m thin sensors, assembled with
the new ATLAS FE-I4 chip and irradiated up to a fluence of 4$\times$10$^{15}\mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{eq}}/\mathrm{cm}^2$,
show that they are excellent candidates for larger radii of the silicon pixel tracker in the upgrade
of the ATLAS detector at HL-LHC. In addition, the active edge technology of the VTT devices maximizes
the active area of the sensor and reduces the material budget to suit the requirements for the innermost
layers. The edge pixel performance of VTT modules has been investigated at beam test experiments
and the analysis after irradiation up to a fluence of 5$\times$10$^{15}\mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{eq}}/\mathrm{cm}^2$
has been performed using radioactive sources in the laboratory.
