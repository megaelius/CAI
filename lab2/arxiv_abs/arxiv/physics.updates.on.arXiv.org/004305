In this work, we investigate the formation of a magnetic flux rope (MFR) above the central polarity
inversion line (PIL) of NOAA Active Region 12673 during its early emergence phase. Through analyzing
the photospheric vector magnetic field, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and ultraviolet (UV) images,
extrapolated three-dimensional (3D) non-linear force-free fields (NLFFFs), as well as the photospheric
motions, we find that with the successive emergence of different bipoles in the central region,
the conjugate polarities separate, resulting in collision between the non-conjugated opposite
polarities. Nearly-potential loops appear above the PIL at first, then get sheared and merge at
the collision locations as evidenced by the appearance of a continuous EUV sigmoid on 2017 September
4, which also indicates the formation of an MFR. The 3D NLFFFs further reveal the gradual buildup
of the MFR, accompanied by the appearance of two elongated bald patches (BPs) at the collision locations
and a very low-lying hyperbolic flux tube configuration between the BPs. The final MFR has relatively
steady axial flux and average twist number of around $2.1\times 10^{20}$~Mx and -1.5, respective.
Shearing motions are found developing near the BPs when the collision occurs, with flux cancellation
and UV brightenings being observed simultaneously, indicating the development of a process named
as "collisional shearing" (firstly identified by Chintzoglou et al. 2019). The results clearly
show that the MFR is formed by "collisional shearing", i.e., through shearing and flux cancellation
driven by the collision between non-conjugated opposite polarities during their emergence.
