A theoretical and numerical study of complex sliding flows of yield-stress fluids is presented.
Yield-stress fluids are known to slide over solid surfaces if the tangential stress exceeds the
{\it sliding yield stress}. The sliding may occur due to various microscopic phenomena such as the
formation of a infinitesimal lubrication layer of the solvent and/or elastic deformation of the
suspended soft particles in the vicinity of the solid surfaces. This leads to a `stick-slip' law
which complicates the modelling and analysis of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the yield-stress
fluid flow. In the present study, we formulate the problem of sliding flow beyond one-dimensional
rheometric flows. Then, a numerical scheme based on the augmented Lagrangian method is presented
to attack these kind of problems. Theoretical tools are developed for analysing the flow/no-flow
limit. The whole framework is benchmarked in planar Poiseuille flow and validated against analytical
solutions. Then two more complex physical problems are investigated: slippery particle sedimentation
and pressure-driven sliding flow in porous media. The {\it yield limit} is addressed in detail for
both flow cases. In the particle sedimentation problem, method of characteristics---slipline
method---in the presence of slip is revisited from the perfectly-plastic mechanics and used as
a helpful tool in addressing the yield limit. Finally, flows through model and randomized porous
media are studied. The randomized configuration is chose to capture more sophisticated aspects
of the yield-stress fluid flows in porous media at the yield limit---channelization.
