This article consists of two parts. The main objectives of Part 1 are to postulate a new principle
of representation invariance (PRI), and to refine the unified field model of four interactions,
derived using the principle of interaction dynamics (PID). Intuitively, PID takes the variation
of the action functional under energy-momentum conservation constraint, and PRI requires that
physical laws be independent of representations of the gauge groups. One important outcome of this
field model is a natural duality between the interacting fields and the adjoint bosonic fields.
This duality predicts two Higgs particles of similar mass with one due to weak interaction and the
other due to strong interaction. The field model can be naturally decoupled to study individual
interactions, leading to 1) modified Einstein equations, giving rise to a unified theory for dark
matter and dark energy, 2) three levels of strong interaction potentials for quark, nucleon/hadron,
and atom respectively, and 3) two weak interaction potentials. These potential/force formulas
offer a clear mechanism for both quark confinement and asymptotic freedom. The main objectives
of Part 2 are 1) to propose a sub-leptons and sub-quark model, which we call weakton model, and 2) to
derive a mechanism for all sub-atomic decays and bremsstrahlung. The weakton model postulates
that all matter particles and mediators are made up of massless weaktons. The weakton model offers
a perfect explanation for all sub-atomic decays and all generation/annihilation precesses of
matter-antimatter. In particular, the precise constituents of particles involved in all decays
both before and after the reaction can now be precisely derived. In addition, the bremsstrahlung
phenomena can be understood using the weakton model. Also, the weakton model offers an explanation
to the baryon asymmetry problem.
