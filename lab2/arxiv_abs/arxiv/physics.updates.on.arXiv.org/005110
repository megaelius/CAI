Rumors flooding on rapidly-growing online social networks has geared much attention from many
fronts. Individuals can transmit rumors via numerous channels since they can be active on multiple
platforms. However, no systematic theoretical research of rumors containing dynamics on multiplex
networks has been conducted yet. In this study, we propose a family of containing strategies based
on the degree product $\mathcal{K}$ of each user on the multiplex networks. Then, we develop a heterogeneous
edge-based compartmental theory to comprehend the containing dynamics. The simulation results
demonstrate that strategies with preference to block users with large $\mathcal{K}$ can significantly
reduce the rumor outbreak size and enlarge the threshold. Besides, better performance can be expected
on heterogeneous multiplex networks with the increasing of preference intensity and degree heterogeneity.
Moreover, take the inter-layer degree correlations $r_s$ into consideration, the strategy performs
best on multiplex networks with $r_s=-1$, $r_s=1$ the second, and $r_s=0$ the last. On the contrary,
if we prefer to block users with small $\mathcal{K}$ rather than large $\mathcal{K}$, the containing
performance will be worse than that of blocking users randomly on most multiplex networks except
for uncorrelated multiplex networks with uniform degree distribution. We found that the blocking
preferences have no influence on the containing results on uncorrelated multiplex networks with
uniform degree distribution. Our theoretical analysis can well predict the rumors containing
results and performance differences in all the cases studied. The systematic theoretical research
of rumors containing dynamics on multiplex networks in this study will offer inspirations for further
investigations on this issue.
