In this study, a new framework of constructing very high order discontinuity-capturing schemes
is proposed for finite volume method. These schemes, so-called $\mathrm{P}_{n}\mathrm{T}_{m}-\mathrm{BVD}$
(polynomial of $n$-degree and THINC function of $m$-level reconstruction based on BVD algorithm),
are designed by employing high-order linear-weight polynomials and THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola
for INterface Capturing) functions with adaptive steepness as the reconstruction candidates.
The final reconstruction function in each cell is determined with a multi-stage BVD (Boundary Variation
Diminishing) algorithm so as to effectively control numerical oscillation and dissipation. We
devise the new schemes up to eleventh order in an efficient way by directly increasing the order of
the underlying upwind scheme using linear-weight polynomials. The analysis of the spectral property
and accuracy tests show that the new reconstruction strategy well preserves the low-dissipation
property of the underlying upwind schemes with high-order linear-weight polynomials for smooth
solution over all wave numbers and realizes $n+1$ order convergence rate. The performance of new
schemes is examined through widely used benchmark tests, which demonstrate that the proposed schemes
are capable of simultaneously resolving small-scale flow features with high resolution and capturing
discontinuities with low dissipation. With outperforming results and simplicity in algorithm,
the new reconstruction strategy shows great potential as an alternative numerical framework for
computing nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws that have discontinuous and smooth solutions
of different scales.
