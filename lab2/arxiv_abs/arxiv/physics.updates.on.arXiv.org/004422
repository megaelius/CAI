PET detectors provide the information of the position, the energy and the timing about the decay
events on the LOR. Traditional PET image reconstruction has not taken the timing information into
account, only used the timing information for coincidence judgments. The high timing resolution
PET detectors provide very precise TOF information, then TOF image reconstruction method which
utilizes the timing information of PET detectors is so crucial for the TOF PET system. We take advantage
of timing information provided by a pair of TOF PET detectors, and then reconstruct the activity
distribution from the limited-view projection data. Since the image reconstruction from the limited-view
data is an under-determined problem mathematically, conventional algorithms cannot achieve
the exact reconstruction of the limited-view problem. In this work, we propose a half-analytic
and half-iterative method named DF/LBM (Direct Fourier and Logarithmic Barrier Method) to solve
the limited-view problem with the TOF information. The least square solution is obtained via DFM
(Direct Fourier Method), and then a convex optimization method named logarithmic barrier method
is employed to correct the least square solution. The substance of the convex optimization is defining
the components in the null-space to satisfy some prior information (TV minimization), while the
least square solution has no components in the null-space. Applying this method to Zubal phantom,
the artifact generated by the least square solution is eliminated, and PSNR is 30.6112, 34.8751
and 38.8998 when the timing resolution is unused, 200ps and 100ps respectively and 16 views from
$-45$ to $45$ are adopted.
