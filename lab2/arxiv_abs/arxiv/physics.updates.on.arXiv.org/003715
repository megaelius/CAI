Interest in substitutional disordered alloys has recently reemerged with focus on the symmetry-sensitive
properties in the alloy such as topological insulation and Rashba effect. A substitutional random
alloy manifests a distribution of local environments, creating a polymorphous network. While
the macroscopic average (monomorphous) structure may have the original high symmetry of the constituent
compounds, many observable physical properties are sensitive to local symmetry, and are hence
$<P(S_i)>$ rather than $P(S_0)$=$P(<S_i>)$. The fundamental difference between polymorphous
$<P(S_i)>$ and monomorphous $P(S_0)$ led to the often-diverging results and the missing the atomic-scale
resolution needed to discern symmetry-related physics. A natural approach capturing the polymorphous
aspect is supercell model, which however suffers the difficulty of band folding ('spaghetti bands'),
rendering the E vs k dispersion needed in topology and Rashba physics and seen in experiments, practically
inaccessible. A solution that retains the polymorphous nature but restores the E vs k relation is
to unfold the supercell bands. This yields alloy Effective Band Structure (EBS), providing a 3D
picture of spectral density consisting of E- and k-dependent spectral weight with coherent and
incoherent features, all created naturally by the polymorphous distribution of many local environments.
We illustrate this EBS approach for CdTe-HgTe, PbSe-SnSe and PbS-PbTe alloys. We found properties
that are critical for e.g. topological phase transition and Rashba splitting but totally absent
in conventional monomorphous approaches, including (1) co-existing, wavevector- and energy-dependent
coherent band splitting and incoherent band broadening, (2) coherent-incoherent transition
along different k space directions, and (3) Rashba-like band splitting having both coherent and
incoherent features.
