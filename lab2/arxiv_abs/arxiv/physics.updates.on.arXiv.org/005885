Due to the inverse Primakoff effect it has been shown that when axions interact with a DC magnetic
B-field the resulting electrical action will produce an AC electromotive force which oscillates
at the Compton frequency of the axion, and may be modeled as an oscillating effective impressed magnetic
current boundary source. We use this result to calculate the sensitivity of new experiments to low-mass
axions using the quasi-static technique. First, we calculate the current induced in an electric
dipole antenna (straight conducting wire) when the DC B-field is spatially constant. We show that
an experiment based on the dipole antenna is not as sensitive as current low-mass experiments. Following
this we extend the topology by making use of the full extent of the spatially varying DC B-field. This
extension is achieved by transforming the 1D conducting wire to a 2D winding, to fully link the effective
magnetic current boundary source and thus couple to the full axion induced electrical action. In
this case the conductor becomes a coil winding where the voltage induced across the winding increases
proportionally to the number of windings. We investigate two different topologies: The 1st uses
a single winding, and couples to the effective short circuit current generated in the winding, which
is read out using a sensitive low impedance SQUID amplifier: The 2nd uses multiple windings, with
every turn effectively increasing the the voltage output proportional to the winding number. The
read out of this configuration is optimised by implementing a cryogenic low-noise high input impedance
voltage amplifier. The end result is a new Broadband Electrical Action Sensing Techniques with
orders of magnitude improved sensitivity, which is linearly proportional to the axion photon coupling
and capable of detecting QCD dark matter axions.
