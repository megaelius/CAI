This research aimed to identify indications of scientific literacy resulting from a didactic and
investigative interaction with Google Trends Big Data software by first-year students from a high-school
in Novo Hamburgo, Southern Brazil. Both teaching strategies and research interpretations lie
on four theoretical backgrounds. Firstly, Bunge's epistemology, which provides a thorough characterization
of Science that was central to our study. Secondly, the conceptual framework of scientific literacy
of Fives et al. that makes our teaching focus precise and concise, as well as supports one of our methodological
tool: the SLA (scientific literacy assessment). Thirdly, the "crowdledge" construct from dos
Santos, which gives meaning to our study when as it makes the development of scientific literacy
itself versatile for paying attention on sociotechnological and epistemological contemporary
phenomena. Finally, the learning principles from Papert's Constructionism inspired our educational
activities. Our educational actions consisted of students, divided into two classes, investigating
phenomena chose by them. A triangulation process to integrate quantitative and qualitative methods
on the assessments results was done. The experimental design consisted in post-tests only and the
experimental variable was the way of access to the world. The experimental group interacted with
the world using analyses of temporal and regional plots of interest of terms or topics searched on
Google. The control class did 'placebo' interactions with the world through on-site observations
of bryophytes, fungus or whatever in the schoolyard. As general results of our research, a constructionist
environment based on Big Data analysis showed itself as a richer strategy to develop scientific
literacy, compared to a free schoolyard exploration.
