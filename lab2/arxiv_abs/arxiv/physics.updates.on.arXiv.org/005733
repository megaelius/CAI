The present study is a prelude to applying different flow control devices on pitching and plunging
airfoils with the intention of controlling the growth of the leading edge vortex (LEV); hence, the
lift under unsteady stall conditions. As a pre-requisite, the parameters influencing the development
of the LEV topology must be fully understood, and this constitutes the main motivation of the present
experimental investigation. The aims of this study are twofold. First, an approach is introduced
to validate the comparability between flow fields and LEV characteristics of two different facilities
using water and air as working media by making use of a common baseline case. The motivation behind
this comparison is that with two facilities the overall parameter range can be greatly expanded.
This comparison includes an overview of the respective parameter ranges, control of the airfoil
kinematics and careful scrutiny of how post-processing procedures of velocity data from time-resolved
particle image velocimetry (PIV) influence the integral properties and topological features
used to characterise the LEV development. Second, and based on results coming from both facilities,
the appearance of secondary structures and their effect on LEV detachment over an extended parameter
range is studied. A Lagrangian flow field analysis, based on finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE)
ridges, allows precise identification of secondary structures and reveals that their emergence
is closely correlated to a vortex Reynolds number threshold computed from the LEV circulation.
This threshold is used to model the temporal onset of secondary structures. Further analysis indicates
that the emergence of secondary structures causes the LEV to stop accumulating circulation if the
shear layer angle at the leading edge of the flat plate has ceased to increase.
