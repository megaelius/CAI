Objective: Alterations of Young's modulus (YM) and Poisson's ratio (PR) in biological tissues
are often early indicators of the onset of pathological conditions. Knowledge of these parameters
has been proven to be of great clinical significance for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment
of cancers. Currently, however, there are no non-invasive modalities that can be used to image and
quantify these parameters in vivo without assuming incompressibility of the tissue, an assumption
that is rarely justified in human tissues. Methods: In this paper, we develop a new method to simultaneously
reconstruct YM and PR of a tumor and of its surrounding tissues, irrespective of the boundary conditions
and the shape of the tumor based on ellipsoidal approximation. This new non-invasive method allows
the generation of high spatial resolution YM and PR maps from axial and lateral strain data obtained
via ultrasound elastography. The method was validated using finite element (FE) simulations and
controlled experiments performed on phantoms with known mechanical properties. The clinical
feasibility of the developed method was also demonstrated in an orthotopic mouse model of breast
cancer. Results: Our results from simulations and controlled experiments demonstrate that the
proposed reconstruction technique is accurate and robust. Conclusion: Availability of the proposed
technique could address the clinical need of a non-invasive modality capable of imaging, quantifying
and monitoring the mechanical properties of tumors with high spatial resolution and in real time.
Significance: This technique can have a significant impact on the clinical translation of elasticity
imaging methods.
