Recent work considered the ultimate (quantum) limit of the precision of estimating the distance
between two point objects. It was shown that the performance gap between the quantum limit and that
of ideal continuum image-plane direct detection is the largest for highly sub-Rayleigh separation
of the objects, and that a pre-detection mode sorting could attain the quantum limit. Here we extend
this to a more general problem of estimating the length of an incoherently radiating extended (line)
object. We find, as expected by the Rayleigh criterion, the Fisher information (FI) per integrated
photon vanishes in the limit of small length for ideal image plane direct detection. Conversely,
for a Hermite-Gaussian (HG) pre-detection mode sorter, this normalized FI does not decrease with
decreasing object length, similar to the two point object case. However, unlike in the two-object
problem, the FI per photon of both detection strategies gradually decreases as the object length
greatly exceeds the Rayleigh limit, due to the relative inefficiency of information provided by
photons emanating from near the center of the object about its length. We evaluate the quantum Fisher
information per unit integrated photons and find that the HG mode sorter exactly achieves this limit
at all values of the object length. Further, a simple binary mode sorter maintains the advantage
of the full mode sorter at highly sub-Rayleigh length. In addition to this FI analysis, we quantify
improvement in terms of the actual mean squared error of the length estimate. Finally, we consider
the effect of imperfect mode sorting, and show that the performance improvement over direct detection
is robust over a range of sub-Rayleigh lengths.
