Dark matter may induce apparent temporal variations in the physical "constants", including the
electromagnetic fine-structure constant and fermion masses. In particular, a coherently oscillating
classical dark-matter field may induce apparent oscillations of physical constants in time, while
the passage of macroscopic dark-matter objects (such as topological defects) may induce apparent
transient variations in the physical constants. In this paper, we point out several new signatures
of the aforementioned types of dark matter that can arise due to the geometric asymmetry created
by the beam-splitter in a two-arm laser interferometer. These new signatures include dark-matter-induced
time-varying size changes of a freely-suspended beam-splitter and associated time-varying shifts
of the main reflecting surface of the beam-splitter that splits and recombines the laser beam, as
well as time-varying refractive-index changes in the freely-suspended beam-splitter and time-varying
size changes of freely-suspended arm mirrors. We demonstrate that existing ground-based experiments
already have sufficient sensitivity to probe extensive regions of unconstrained parameter space
in models involving oscillating scalar dark-matter fields and domain walls composed of scalar
fields. In the case of oscillating dark-matter fields, Michelson interferometers $-$ in particular,
the GEO600 detector $-$ are especially sensitive. The sensitivity of Fabry-Perot-Michelson interferometers,
including LIGO, VIRGO and KAGRA, to oscillating dark-matter fields can be significantly increased
by making the thicknesses of the freely-suspended Fabry-Perot arm mirrors different in the two
arms. We also discuss how small-scale Michelson interferometers, such as the Fermilab holometer,
could be used to perform resonant narrowband searches for oscillating dark-matter fields with
enhanced sensitivity to dark matter.
