We address a problem of potential motion of ideal incompressible fluid with a free surface and infinite
depth in two dimensional geometry with gravity forces and surface tension. A time-dependent conformal
mapping z(w,t) of the lower complex half-plane of the variable w into the area filled with fluid is
performed. We study the dynamics of singularities of both z(w,t) and the complex fluid potential
Pi(w,t) in the upper complex half-plane of w. We show the existence of solutions with an arbitrary
finite number N of complex poles in z_w(w,t) and Pi_w(w,t) which are the derivatives of z(w,t) and
Pi(w,t) over w. The orders of poles can be arbitrary for zero surface tension while all orders are
even for nonzero surface tension. We find that the residues of z_w(w,t) at these N points are new,
previously unknown constants of motion, see also Ref. V.E. Zakharov and A. I. Dyachenko, arXiv:1206.2046
(2012) for the preliminary results. All these constants of motion commute with each other in the
sense of underlying Hamiltonian dynamics. In absence of both gravity and surface tension, the residues
of Pi_w(w,t) are also the constants of motion while nonzero gravity g ensures a trivial linear dependence
of these residues on time. A Laurent series expansion of both z_w(w,t) and Pi_w(w,t) at each poles
position reveals an existence of additional integrals of motion for poles of the second order. If
all poles are simple then the number of independent real integrals of motion is 4N for zero gravity
and 4N-1 for nonzero gravity. For the second order poles we found 6N motion integral for zero gravity
and 6N-1 for nonzero gravity. We suggest that the existence of these nontrivial constants of motion
provides an argument in support of the conjecture of complete integrability of free surface hydrodynamics
in deep water.
