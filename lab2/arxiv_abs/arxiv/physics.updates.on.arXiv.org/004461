Starch based bio-films act as biodegradable packaging material for coating and wrapping food products,
which is alternate to the synthetic polymer. Nanoparticles (NPs) are also alternative to antibiotics
to target pathogens. Through interaction of nanoparticles with food packaging material the overall
quality of the packaged food also get enhanced. In this research work, ZnO NP embedded corn starch
films were developed. First, ZnO NP were synthesized by two approaches (a) Sol-gel approach and
(b) Green synthesis approach; and then ZnO NP embedded corn-starch bio-films were developed. In
sol-gel technique ZnO NP were synthesized at different pH ranging from 8 to 11, with an average crystallite
size of 28 to 53 nm. In green synthesis technique ZnO NP were synthesized by using Azadirachta indica
(Neem) at different concentration of 2\% and 3\% with an average crystallite size of 36 nm and 32 nm,
respectively. Characterization of synthesized ZnO NPs were done with XRD, UV-DRS, UV-VIS, FTIR
and FE-SEM. The functional properties of the ZnO embedded starch film were enhanced with addition
of 5\% citric acid solution(w/w) as cross-linker and 0.90 g glycerol(w/w) as plasticizer. Film-F1
embedded with chemically synthesized ZnO NP, Film-F2 embedded with biochemcially synthesized
ZnO NP and Film-F3 without being embedded by any NPs. Characterization of synthesized films were
done with SEM and XRD. Film solution of F2 showed higher antimicrobial effectiveness than F1; against
E.coli and S.aureus bacterial strains with an inhibition zone of 14 mm and 6 mm. 7days biodegradability
analysis of the films were also done. Along with this, their current application and future perspectives
in the food sector are also explored
