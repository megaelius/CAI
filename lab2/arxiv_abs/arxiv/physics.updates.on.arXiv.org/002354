Hydrodynamic interactions play a key role in the swimming behavior and power consumption of bio-inspired
and bio-mimetic micro-swimmers, Cybernetic or artificial alike. As micro-robotic devices, bio-inspired
micro-swimmers require fast and reliable numerical models for robust control in order to carry
out demanding therapeutic tasks as envisaged for more than sixty years. The fastest known numerical
model, the resistive force theory (RFT), incorporates local viscous force coefficients with the
local velocity of slender bodies in order to find the resisting hydrodynamic forces, however, omitting
the induced far field altogether. In this scheme, the forces are calculated for a pure fluid resistance,
however, at the expense of time-dependent hydrodynamic interaction effects. As a result, the power
requirement cannot be predicted accurately although the supply of necessary power is one of the
biggest obstacles impeding the micro-robotic efforts. In this study, an analysis strategy is proposed
to improve the RFT-based analysis, particularly for spermatozoa and spermatozoa-inspired micro-swimmers
with elastic slender tails, in order to present a practical solution to the problem. The required
analytical correction and the necessary correction coefficients are based on hydrodynamic impedance
analysis via intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, i.e., the time-dependent solution
of 3-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations incorporated with deforming mesh and subject to conservation
of mass. The CFD-based model results are then used to extract the correction coefficients with the
help of a cost function written based on the hydrodynamic power required to sustain the continuous
swimming of selected shape and design. The performance of the corrections embedded in the RFT model
is finally validated against the CFD model by means of hydrodynamic power comparisons.
