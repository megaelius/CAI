All of the basic microsopic physical laws are time reversible. In contrast, the second law of thermodynamics,
which is a macroscopic physical representation of the world, is able to describe irreversible processes
in an isolated system through the change of entropy S larger than 0. It is the attempt of the present
manuscript to bridge the microscopic physical world with its macrosocpic one with an alternative
approach than the statistical mechanics theory of Gibbs and Boltzmann. It is proposed that time
is discrete with constant step size. Its consequence is the presence of time irreversibility at
the microscopic level if the present force is of complex nature (i.e. not const). In order to compare
this discrete time irreversible mechamics (for simplicity a classical, single particle in a one
dimensional space is selected) with its classical Newton analog, time reversibility is reintroduced
by scaling the time steps for any given time step n by the variable sn leading to the Nose-Hoover Lagrangian.
The corresponding Nose-Hoover Hamiltonian comprises a term Ndf *kB*T*ln(sn) (with kB the Boltzmann
constant, T the temperature, and Ndf the number of degrees of freedom) which is defined as the microscopic
entropy Sn at time point n multiplied by T. Upon ensemble averaging this microscopic entropy Sn in
equilibrium for a system which does not have fast changing forces approximates its macroscopic
counterpart known from thermodynamics. The presented derivation with the resulting analogy between
the ensemble averaged microscopic entropy and its thermodynamic analog suggests that the original
description of the entropy by Boltzmann and Gibbs is just an ensemble averaging of the time scaling
variable sn which is in equilibrium close to 1, but that the entropy term itself has its root not in
statistical mechanics but rather in the discreteness of time.
