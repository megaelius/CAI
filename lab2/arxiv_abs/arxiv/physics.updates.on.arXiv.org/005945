A liquid droplet, immersed into a Newtonian fluid, can be propelled solely by internal flow. In a
simple model, this flow is generated by a collection of point forces, which represent externally
actuated devices or model autonomous swimmers. We work out the general framework to compute the
self-propulsion of the droplet as a function of the actuating forces and their positions within
the droplet. A single point force, F with general orientation and position, r_0, gives rise to both,
translational and rotational motion of the droplet. We show that the translational mobility is
anisotropic and the rotational mobility can be nonmonotonic as a function of | r_0|, depending on
the viscosity contrast. Due to the linearity of the Stokes equation, superposition can be used to
discuss more complex arrays of point forces. We analyse force dipoles, such as a stresslet, a simple
model of a biflagellate swimmer and a rotlet, representing a helical swimmer, driven by an external
magnetic field. For a general force distribution with arbitrary high multipole moments the propulsion
properties of the droplet depend only on a few low order multipoles: up to the quadrupole for translational
and up to a special octopole for rotational motion. The coupled motion of droplet and device is discussed
for a few exemplary cases. We show in particular that a biflagellate swimmer, modeled as a stresslet,
achieves a steady comoving state, where the position of the device relative to the droplet remains
fixed. In fact there are two fixpoints, symmetric with respect to the center of the droplet. A tiny
external force selects one of them and allows to switch between forward and backward motion.
