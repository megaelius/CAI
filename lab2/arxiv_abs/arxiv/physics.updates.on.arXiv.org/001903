There is consensus on the fact that one of the main limitations of the Li air batteries (LABs) is the
insulating character of Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$ and that it becomes crucial to explore new conduction
paths. Recent studies indicate that doping with chloride increases the ion conductivity of Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$,
although to a much lesser extent than expected if chloride is assumed as a donor dopant [Gerbig et
al., Adv. Mater.,2013, 25, 3129]. Subsequently, it has been shown that the addition of lithium chloride,
LiCl, to the battery electrolyte increases its discharge capacity while this effect is not observed
with other halogens [Matsuda et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2016, 120, 13360]. This fact was attributed
to an increase in the conductivity of Cl-doped Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$, but still the responsible mechanism
is not clear. In this work, we have performed first principle calculations to study the effect of
the different halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) as substitutional defects in the electronic and transport
properties of Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$. We have calculated the formation energies of the different defects
and impurities and we analysed how they affect the activation barriers and diffusion coefficients
. We have demonstrated that the chloride does not behave like a donor dopant, thus explaining the
meager increase of the ionic conductivity experimentally observed neither it promotes the polaron
formation and its mobility. We have also found that chloride does not present any special behaviour
among the halogen series. Our results reveal that all the studied configurations associated with
the halogen defects do not derive in metallic states nor extra polarons that would increase considerably
the electronic conductivity. This is mainly due to the ionic characteristics of the Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$
crystal and the capability of the oxygen dimers to adapt its valence rather than to the nature of the
dopant itself.
