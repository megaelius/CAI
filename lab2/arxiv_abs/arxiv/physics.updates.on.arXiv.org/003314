This article motivates and presents the scale relativistic approach to non-differentiability
in mechanics and its relation to quantum mechanics. It stems from the scale relativity proposal
to extend the principle of relativity to resolution-scale transformations, which leads to considering
non-differentiable dynamical paths. We first define a complex scale-covariant time-differential
operator and show that mechanics of non-differentiable paths is implemented in the same way as classical
mechanics but with the replacement of the time derivative and velocity with the time-differential
operator and associated complex velocity. With this, the generalized form of Newton's fundamental
relation of dynamics is shown to take the form of a Langevin equation in the case of stationary motion
characterized by a null average classical velocity. The numerical integration of the Langevin
equation in the case of a harmonic oscillator taken as an example reveals the same statistics as the
stationary solutions of the Schrodinger equation for the same problem. This motivates the rest
of the paper, which shows Schrodinger's equation to be a reformulation of Newton's fundamental
relation of dynamics as generalized to non-differentiable geometries and leads to an alternative
interpretation of the other axioms of standard quantum mechanics in a coherent picture. This exercise
validates the scale relativistic approach and, at the same time, it allows to envision macroscopic
chaotic systems observed at resolution time-scales exceeding their horizon of predictability
as candidates in which to search for quantum-like dynamics and structures.
