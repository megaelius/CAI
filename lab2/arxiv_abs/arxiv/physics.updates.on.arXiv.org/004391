In this work, we have considered the spherically symmetric stellar system in the contexts of Rastall-Rainbow
gravity theory in presence of isotropic fluid source with electromagnetic field. The Einstein-Maxwell's
field equations have been written in the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. The gravastar consists
of three regions: interior region, thin shell region and exterior region. In the interior region,
the gravastar follows the equation of sate (EoS) $p=-\rho$ and we have found the solutions of all
physical quantities like energy density, pressure, electric field, charge density, gravitational
mass and metric coefficients. In the exterior region, we have obtained the exterior Riessner-Nordstrom
solution for vacuum model ($p=\rho=0$). Since in the shell region, the fluid source follows the
EoS $p=\rho$ (ultra-stiff fluid) and the thickness of the shell of the gravastar is infinitesimal,
so by the approximation $h~(\equiv A^{-1})\ll 1$, we have found the analytical solutions within
the thin shell. The physical quantities like the proper length of the thin shell, entropy and energy
content inside the thin shell of the charged gravastar have been computed and we have shown that they
are directly proportional to the proper thickness of the shell ($\epsilon$) due to the approximation
($\epsilon\ll 1$). The physical parameters significantly depend on the Rastall parameter and
Rainbow function. Next we have studied the matching between the surfaces of interior and exterior
regions of the charged gravastar and using the matching conditions, the surface energy density
and the surface pressure have been obtained. Also the equation of state parameter on the surface,
mass of the thin shell, mass of the gravastar have been obtained. Finally, we have explored the stable
regions of the charged gravastar in Rastall-Rainbow gravity.
