A relational database has been developed based on the original ($n,n'\gamma$) work carried out
by A. M. Demidov et al., at the Nuclear Research Institute in Baghdad, Iraq ["Atlas of Gamma-Ray Spectra
from the Inelastic Scattering of Reactor Fast Neutrons", Nuclear Research Institute, Baghdad,
Iraq (Moscow, Atomizdat 1978)] for 105 independent measurements comprising 76 elemental samples
of natural composition and 29 isotopically-enriched samples. The information from this Atlas
includes: $\gamma$-ray energies and intensities; nuclide and level data corresponding to the
residual nucleus and meta data associated with the target sample that allows for the extraction
of the flux-weighted ($n,n'\gamma$) cross sections for a given transition relative to a defined
value. The fast-neutron flux-weighted partial $\gamma$-ray cross section from ENDF/B-VIII.0
for the production of the 846.8-keV $2^{+}_{1} \rightarrow 0^{+}_{\rm gs}$ transition in $^{56}$Fe,
$\sigma_{\gamma} = 329.46 \pm 37.55$ mb, is used for this purpose. This result takes into account
contributions from the $\beta^{-}$ decay of $^{56}$Mn formed in the $^{56}$Fe($n,p$) reaction.
However, different values for the adopted cross section can be readily implemented to accommodate
user preference based on revised determinations of this quantity. The Atlas ($n,n'\gamma$) data
has been compiled into a series of CSV-style ASCII data sets and a suite of Python scripts have been
developed to build and install the database locally. The database can then be accessed directly
through the SQLite engine, or using alternative methods such as the Jupyter Notebook Python-browser
interface. Several examples exploiting different interaction methodologies are distributed
with the complete software package.
