Learning quantum mechanics is challenging, even for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students.
Research-validated interactive tutorials that build on students' prior knowledge can be useful
tools to enhance student learning. We have been investigating student difficulties with quantum
mechanics pertaining to the double-slit experiment in various situations that appear to be counterintuitive
and contradict classical notions of particles and waves. For example, if we send single electrons
through the slits, they may behave as a "wave" in part of the experiment and as a "particle" in another
part of the same experiment. Here we discuss the development and evaluation of a research-validated
Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) which makes use of an interactive simulation to
improve student understanding of the double-slit experiment and strives to help students develop
a good grasp of foundational issues in quantum mechanics. We discuss common student difficulties
identified during the development and evaluation of the QuILT and analyze the data from the pretest
and post test administered to the upper-level undergraduate and first-year physics graduate students
before and after they worked on the QuILT to assess its effectiveness. These data suggest that on
average, the QuILT was effective in helping students develop a more robust understanding of foundational
concepts in quantum mechanics that defy classical intuition using the context of the double-slit
experiment. Moreover, the upper-level undergraduates outperformed physics graduate students
on the post test. One possible reason for this difference in performance may be the level of student
engagement with the QuILT due to the grade incentive. In the undergraduate course, the post test
was graded for correctness while in the graduate course, it was only graded for completeness.
