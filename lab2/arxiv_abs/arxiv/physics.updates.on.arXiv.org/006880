Co-locating horizontal- and vertical-axis wind turbines has been recently proposed as a possible
approach to enhance the land-area power density of wind farms. In this work, we aim to study the benefits
associated with such a co-location using large-eddy simulation (LES) and analytical wake models.
In this regard, small-scale vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) in triangular clusters are deployed
within a finite-size wind farm consisting of horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs). Wake flow
within the wind farm and the effect of VAWTs on the overall wind-farm efficiency are investigated
and quantified. The results show that the optimal deployment of small-scale VAWTs has a negligible
impact on the performance of HAWT arrays while increasing the total power production. For the particular
cases considered here, the power output of the co-located wind farm increases up to 21% compared
to the baseline case in which only the HAWTs are present. Also, by comparing to the LES results, it
is shown that the analytical framework proposed here is able to accurately predict the power production
of wind farms including both HAWTs and VAWTs. Next, as a real-world application, potential benefits
of deploying small-scale VAWTs inside the Horns Rev 1 wind farm are explored for various wind directions
using the calibrated wake model. The results show potential for about an 18% increase in the wind-farm
power production, averaged over all wind directions, for a particular VAWT layout investigated
in this study. The levelized cost of energy (LCoE) for the co-located wind farm is also assessed.
The simulations finds that meanwhile the installation of VAWTs increases the annual energy production
of the wind farm, it also increases the LCoE, which is caused by a) lack of operational data, and b)
a low technology readiness level for VAWTs and floating foundations.
