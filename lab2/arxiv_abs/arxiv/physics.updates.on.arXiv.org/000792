A new approach to prevent spurious behavior caused by conventional shock-capturing schemes when
solving stiff detonation waves problems is introduced in the present work. Due to smearing of discontinuous
solution by the excessive numerical dissipation, conventional shock-capturing schemes have
difficulties to obtain the correct location of detonation front without enough grids resolution.
To overcome the excessive numerical errors around discontinuities by traditional discretized
schemes used in non-reacting high speed compressible flow, we introduce a new shock-capturing
scheme in which besides linear function constructed by MUSCL (Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes
for Conservation Law) scheme, a step like THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing)
function is also employed as another candidate in the reconstruction process. The final reconstruction
function is determined by boundary variation diminishing (BVD) algorithm by which numerical dissipation
around discontinuities can be reduced significantly. The new resulted shock-capturing scheme
is named MUSCL-THINC-BVD. One- and two-dimensional comparative numerical tests about stiff detonation
waves problems are conducted with the 5th order WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) and
MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme respectively, which show MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme can capture the correct
position of detonation waves with improved resolution while WENO scheme, in spite of higher order,
produces spurious waves. Compared with other existing methods which involves extra treatments
by accepting the smeared out discontinuities profiles, the current method obtain the correct but
also sharp detonation front by fundamentally reducing numerical dissipation errors from shock-capturing
schemes. Thus the proposed approach is an effective but simple method to solve stiff detonation
problems.
