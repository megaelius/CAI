Link prediction can be used to extract missing information, identify spurious interactions as
well as forecast network evolution. Network embedding is a methodology to assign coordinates to
nodes in a low dimensional vector space. By embedding nodes into vectors, the link prediction problem
can be converted into a similarity comparison task. Nodes with similar embedding vectors are more
likely to be connected. Classic network embedding algorithms are random-walk-based. They sample
trajectory paths via random walks and generate node pairs from the trajectory paths. The node pair
set is further used as the input for a Skip-Gram model, a representative language model that embeds
nodes (which are regarded as words) into vectors. In the present study, we propose to replace random
walk processes by a spreading process, namely the susceptible-infected (SI) model, to sample paths.
Specifically, we propose two SI-spreading-based algorithms, SINE and TSINE, to embed static and
temporal networks, respectively. The performance of our algorithms is evaluated by the missing
link prediction task in comparison with state-of-the-art static and temporal network embedding
algorithms. Results show that SINE and TSINE outperform the baselines across all six empirical
datasets. We further find that the performance of SINE is mostly better than TSINE, suggesting that
temporal information does not necessarily improve the embedding for missing link prediction.
Moreover, we study the effect of the sampling size, quantified as the total length of the trajectory
paths, on the performance of the embedding algorithms. The better performance of SINE and TSINE
requires a smaller sampling size in comparison with the baseline algorithms. Hence, SI-spreading-based
embedding tends to be more applicable to large-scale networks.
