Considering variable density effect on mixing enhancement is inherently existed in application
of scramjet, the intrinsic coupling mechanism between variable density characteristic and mixing
is still unknown. In this paper, a canonical variable density (VD) mixing protocol that is shock
bubble interaction (SBI) abstracted from supersonic streamwise vortex, is studied by comparing
with a counterpart of passive scalar (PS) mixing. A concrete vortex is formed for both VD and PS case
expect that mixing of maximum concentration from vortical stretching decays much faster in VD than
in PS case regardless of the shock Mach number concerned. By investigating the azimuthal velocity
that stretches the bubble, besides the quasi-Lamb-Oseen type velocity distribution in PS case,
a local accelerated stretching relating to secondary barcolinic vorticity in VD SBI explains the
faster mixing enhancement and the increase of local mixing rate. Based on secondary baroclinic
vorticity production, the fundamental mechanism of the additional accelerated stretching is
modelled by inertial velocity difference between shocked light gas bubble and shocked heavy ambient
air.Through combining the baroclinic accelerated stretching model and initial compression from
shock, a new defined mixing time of VD SBI, $\widetilde{t}_m^*$, is theoretically proposed based
on solving advection-diffusion equation under the local accelerated azimuthal velocity. The
proposed mixing time further shows well prediction of mixing enhancement behavior in the range
of $Re=3000\sim10^5$ and $Pe=1500\sim5\times10^4$. A density stratification distribution
is raised accordingly from density inertial effect to control the mixing time behavior which implies
the novel method for mixing enhancement of supersonic streamwise vortex.
