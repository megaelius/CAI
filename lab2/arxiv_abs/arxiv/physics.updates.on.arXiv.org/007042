Quantum mechanically, photoionization can be fully described by the complex photoionization
amplitudes that describe the transition between the ground state and the continuum state. Knowledge
of the value of the phase of these amplitudes has been a central interest in photoionization studies
and newly developing attosecond science, since the phase can reveal important information about
phenomena such as electron correlation. We present a new attosecond-precision interferometric
method of angle-resolved measurement for the phase of the photoionization amplitudes, using two
phase-locked Extreme Ultraviolet pulses of frequency $\omega$ and $2\omega$, from a Free-Electron
Laser. Phase differences $\Delta \tilde \eta$ between one- and two-photon ionization channels,
averaged over multiple wave packets, are extracted for neon $2p$ electrons as a function of emission
angle at photoelectron energies 7.9, 10.2, and 16.6 eV. $\Delta \tilde \eta$ is nearly constant
for emission parallel to the electric vector but increases at 10.2 eV for emission perpendicular
to the electric vector. We model our observations with both perturbation and \textit{ab initio}
theory, and find excellent agreement. In the existing method for attosecond measurement, Reconstruction
of Attosecond Beating By Interference of Two-photon Transitions (RABBITT), a phase difference
between two-photon pathways involving absorption and emission of an infrared photon is extracted.
Our method can be used for extraction of a phase difference between single-photon and two-photon
pathways and provides a new tool for attosecond science, which is complementary to RABBITT.
