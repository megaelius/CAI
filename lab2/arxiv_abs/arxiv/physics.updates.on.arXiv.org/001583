Turbulent dynamical systems characterized by both a high-dimensional phase space and a large number
of instabilities are ubiquitous among many complex systems in science and engineering. The existence
of a strange attractor in the turbulent systems containing a large number of positive Lyapunov exponents
results in a rapid growth of small uncertainties, requiring naturally a probabilistic characterization
for the evolution of the turbulent system. Uncertainty quantification in turbulent dynamical
systems is a grand challenge where the goal is to obtain statistical estimates such as the change
in mean and variance for key physical quantities in their nonlinear responses to changes in external
forcing parameters or uncertain initial data. One central issue in contemporary research is the
development of a systematic methodology that can recover the crucial features of the natural system
in statistical equilibrium (model fidelity) and improve the imperfect model prediction skill
in response to various external perturbations (model sensitivity). A general mathematical framework
to construct statistically accurate reduced-order models that have skill in capturing the statistical
variability in the principal directions with largest energy of a general class of damped and forced
complex turbulent dynamical systems is discussed here. The methods are developed under a universal
class of turbulent dynamical systems with quadratic nonlinearity that is representative in many
applications in applied mathematics and engineering. The validity of general framework of reduced-order
models is demonstrated on instructive stochastic triad models. Recent applications to two-layer
baroclinic turbulence in the atmosphere and ocean with combinations of turbulent jets and vortices
are also surveyed.
