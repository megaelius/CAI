Tunnelling, one of the key features of quantum mechanics, ignited an ongoing debate about the value,
meaning and interpretation of 'tunnelling time'. Until recently the debate was purely theoretical,
with the process considered to be instantaneous for all practical purposes. This changed with the
development of ultrafast lasers and in particular, the 'attoclock' technique that is used to probe
the attosecond dynamics of electrons. Although the initial attoclock measurements hinted at instantaneous
tunnelling, later experiments contradicted those findings, claiming to have measured finite
tunnelling times. In each case these measurements were performed with multi-electron atoms. Atomic
hydrogen (H), the simplest atomic system with a single electron, can be 'exactly' (subject only
to numerical limitations) modelled using numerical solutions of the 3D-TDSE with measured experimental
parameters and acts as a convenient benchmark for both accurate experimental measurements and
calculations. Here we report the first attoclock experiment performed on H and find that our experimentally
determined offset angles are in excellent agreement with accurate 3D-TDSE simulations performed
using our experimental pulse parameters. The same simulations with a short-range Yukawa potential
result in zero offset angles for all intensities. We conclude that the offset angle measured in the
attoclock experiments originates entirely from electron scattering by the long-range Coulomb
potential with no contribution from tunnelling time delay. That conclusion is supported by empirical
observation that the electron offset angles follow closely the simple formula for the deflection
angle of electrons undergoing classical Rutherford scattering by the Coulomb potential. Thus
we confirm that, in H, tunnelling is instantaneous (with an upperbound of 1.8 as) within our experimental
and numerical uncertainty.
