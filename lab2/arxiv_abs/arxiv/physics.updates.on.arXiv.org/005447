Due to the interconnectedness of financial entities, estimating certain key properties of a complex
financial system (e.g. the implied level of systemic risk) requires detailed information about
the structure of the underlying network. However, since data about financial linkages are typically
subject to confidentiality, network reconstruction techniques become necessary to infer both
the presence of connections and their intensity. Recently, several "horse races" have been conducted
to compare the performance of the available financial network reconstruction methods. These comparisons,
however, were based on arbitrarily-chosen similarity metrics between the real and the reconstructed
network. Here we establish a generalised maximum-likelihood approach to rigorously define and
compare weighted reconstruction methods. Our generalization maximizes the conditional entropy
to solve the problem represented by the fact that the density-dependent constraints required to
reliably reconstruct the network are typically unobserved. The resulting approach admits as input
any reconstruction method for the purely binary topology and, conditionally on the latter, exploits
the available partial information to infer link weights. We find that the most reliable method is
obtained by "dressing" the best-performing binary method with an exponential distribution of
link weights having a properly density-corrected and link-specific mean value and propose two
unbiased (in the sense of maximum conditional entropy) variants of it. While the one named CReMA
is perfectly general (as a particular case, it can place optimal weights on a network whose topology
is known), the one named CReMB is recommended both in case of full uncertainty about the network topology
and if the existence of some links is certain. In these cases, the CReMB is faster and reproduces empirical
networks with highest generalised likelihood.
