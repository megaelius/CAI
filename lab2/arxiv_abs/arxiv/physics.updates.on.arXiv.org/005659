Lead-rubber seismic isolation bearings (LRB) have been installed in a number of essential and critical
structures, like hospitals, universities and bridges, located in earthquake-prone areas. The
purpose of using LRB is providing the structure with period lengthening and the capacity of dissipating
a considerable amount of earthquake energy to mitigate the damaging effects of strong ground motions.
Therefore, studying the damage mechanics of this kind of devices is fundamental to understand and
accurately describe their thermomechanical behavior, so that seismically isolated structures
can be designed more safely. Traditionally, up to this point, damage mechanics of LRB has been modeled
using Newtonian mechanics and empirical curve fitting degradation functions. The reason for using
empirical degradation polynomials is the fact that Newtonian mechanics lacks the capacity to account
for degradation of a system. In this paper, the Unified Mechanics Theory, which integrates laws
of Thermodynamics and Newtonian mechanics, is used to model stress-strain response of LRB. When
Unified Mechanics Theory is applied, there is no need for curve fitting techniques to describe the
degradation behavior of the material. Degradation at every point is calculated using the physics
based fundamental equations of the material along the Thermodynamics State Index (TSI) axis. A
finite element model of a lead-rubber bearing was constructed in ABAQUS, where a user material subroutine
UMAT was implemented to define the Unified Mechanics Theory equations and the viscoplastic constitutive
model for the lead core. Finite element analysis results were compared with experimental test data.
