The concept of a physical space, which actualizes Euclidean geometry, is not confined to the statics
of solids but extensible to the phenomena where Newtonian mechanics is valid, defining its concept
of time. The laws of propagation of electromagnetic disturbances modify Newtonian formalism for
sufficiently fast free motions within each spatial domain of its validity for slow motions and introduce
the extended concept of time by uniting those of Newtonian which can exist in different spatial domains
of their validity. A boost direction for a pair of physical spaces is that spatial direction in one
of the spaces along which the other space moves. Free motions of point particles make an instrumentation
for identifying the boost direction as well as events on a straight line along that direction. The
concept of a boost direction secures the physics-based formulation of the basic relativity effects,
which eventually results in the relation between two arbitrary spaces in terms of their position
vectors and time of a given event. The obtained transformation rules for the components of the position
vector differ from the vector-like relationship known in the literature because the latter actually
deals with column vectors made of Cartesian coordinates of true vectors and appears identical to
a coordinate transformation referred to as a boost. Within the physics-based approach, the transformation
of coordinates implies specifying coordinate systems in each frame in terms of physical objects/directions.
This yields a logically consistent and physically meaningful presentation of the coordinate transformations
commonly exploited in the special relativity theory, which makes manifestations of those transformations
evident. Specifically, for a Cartesian coordinate system subjected to a boost, the coordinate-free
technique of reasoning allows one to evaluate its apparent distortion easily.
