The "measurement problem" of quantum mechanics, and the "hard problem" of cognitive science are
the most profound open problems of the two research fields, and certainly among the deepest of all
unsettled conundrums in contemporary science in general. Occasionally, scientists from both
fields have suggested some sort of interconnectedness of the two problems. Here we revisit the main
motives behind such expectations and try to put them on more formal grounds. We argue not only that
such a relation exists, but that it also bears strong implications both for the interpretations
of quantum mechanics and for our understanding of consciousness. The paper consists of three parts.
In the first part, we formulate a "no-go-theorem" stating that a brain, functioning solely on the
principles of classical physics, cannot have any greater ability to induce subjective experience
than a process of writing (printing) a certain sequence of digits. The goal is to show, with an attempt
to mathematical rigor, why the physicalist standpoint based on classical physics is not likely
to ever explain the phenomenon of consciousness -- justifying the tendency to look beyond the physics
of the 19th century. In the second part, we aim to establish a clear relation, with a sort of correspondence
mapping, between attitudes towards the hard problem and interpretations of quantum mechanics.
Then we discuss these connections in the light of the no-go theorem, pointing out that the existence
of subjective experience might differentiate between otherwise experimentally indistinguishable
interpretations. Finally, the third part is an attempt to illustrate how quantum mechanics could
take us closer to the solution of the hard problem and break the constraints set by the no-go theorem.
