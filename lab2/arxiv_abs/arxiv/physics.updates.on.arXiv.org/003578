We consider a scale-free network of inhibitory Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) bursting neurons, and investigate
coupling-induced cluster burst synchronization by varying the average coupling strength $J_0$.
For sufficiently small $J_0$, non-cluster desynchronized states exist. However, when passing
a critical point $J^*_c~(\simeq 0.16)$, the whole population is segregated into 3 clusters via
a constructive role of synaptic inhibition to stimulate dynamical clustering between individual
burstings, and thus 3-cluster desynchronized states appear. As $J_0$ is further increased and
passes a lower threshold $J^*_l~(\simeq 0.78)$, a transition to 3-cluster burst synchronization
occurs due to another constructive role of synaptic inhibition to favor population synchronization.
In this case, HR neurons in each cluster exhibit burst synchronization. However, as $J_0$ passes
an intermediate threshold $J^*_m~(\simeq 5.2)$, HR neurons begin to make intermittent hoppings
between the 3 clusters. Due to the intermittent intercluster hoppings, the 3 clusters are integrated
into a single one. In spite of break-up of the 3 clusters, (non-cluster) burst synchronization persists
in the whole population, which is well visualized in the raster plot of burst onset times where bursting
stripes (composed of burst onset times and indicating burst synchronization) appear successively.
With further increase in $J_0$, intercluster hoppings are intensified, and bursting stripes also
become smeared more and more due to a destructive role of synaptic inhibition to spoil the burst synchronization.
Eventually, when passing a higher threshold $J^*_h~(\simeq 17.8)$ a transition to desynchronization
occurs via complete overlap between the bursting stripes. Finally, we also investigate the effects
of stochastic noise on both 3-cluster burst synchronization and intercluster hoppings.
