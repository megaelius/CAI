We develop an efficient parallel multiscale method that bridges the atomistic and mesoscale regimes,
from nanometer to micron and beyond, via concurrent coupling of atomistic simulation and mesoscopic
dynamics. In particular, we combine an all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) description for specific
atomistic details in the vicinity of the functional surface, with a dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) approach that captures mesoscopic hydrodynamics in the domain away from the functional surface.
In order to achieve a seamless transition in dynamic properties we endow the MD simulation with a
DPD thermostat, which is validated against experimental results by modeling water at different
temperatures. We then validate the MD-DPD coupling method for transient Couette and Poiseuille
flows, demonstrating that the concurrent MD-DPD coupling can resolve accurately the continuum-based
analytical solutions. Subsequently, we simulate shear flows over polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-grafted
surfaces (polymer brushes) for various grafting densities, and investigate the slip flow as a function
of the shear stress. We verify that a "universal" power law exists for the sliplength, in agreement
with published results. Having validated the MD-DPD coupling method, we simulate time-dependent
flows past an endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) in a microchannel. Coupled simulation results
elucidate the dynamics of EGL changing from an equilibrium state to a compressed state under shear
by aligning the molecular structures along the shear direction. MD-DPD simulation results agree
well with results of a single MD simulation, but with the former more than two orders of magnitude
faster than the latter for system sizes above one micron.
