Quantum mechanics places significant restrictions on the hydrodynamics of superfluid flows.
Despite this it has been observed that turbulence in superfluids can, in a statistical sense, share
many of the properties of its classical brethren; coherent bundles of superfluid vortices are often
invoked as an import feature leading to this quasi-classical behaviour. A recent experimental
study [E. Rusaouen, B. Rousset, and P.-E. Roche, "Detection of vortex coherent structures in superfluid
turbulence," EPL, vol. 118, no. 1, p. 14005, 2017] inferred the presence of these bundles through
intermittency in the pressure field, however direct visualization of the quantized vortices to
corroborate this finding was not possible. In this work we performed detailed numerical simulations
of superfluid turbulence at the level of individual quantized vortices through the vortex filament
model. Through course graining we find compelling evidence supporting the conclusions of [E. Rusaouen,
B. Rousset, and P.-E. Roche, "Detection of vortex coherent structures in superfluid turbulence,"
EPL, vol. 118, no. 1, p. 14005, 2017]. Elementary simulations of an isolated bundle show that the
number of vortices in a bundle can be directly inferred from the size of the pressure dip, with good
agreement between numerics and the HVBK equations. Full simulations of turbulent tangles show
strong correlation between course-grained vorticity and low pressure, with intermittent vortex
bundles appearing as deviations from the underlying Maxwellian (vorticity) and Gaussian (pressure)
distributions. Finally simulations of a random vortex tangle in an ultra-quantum regime show a
unique fingerprint in the pressure distributions, which we argue can be fully understood using
the HVBK framework.
