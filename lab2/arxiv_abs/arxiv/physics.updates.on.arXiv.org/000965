A Global Enhanced Vibrational Kinetic (GEVKM) model is presented for a new High Current Negative
Hydrogen Ion Source (HCNHIS) developed by Busek Co. Inc. and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
The HCNHIS consists of a high-pressure radio-frequency discharge (RFD) chamber where high-lying
vibrational states of the hydrogen molecules are produced, a bypass system, a nozzle, and a low-pressure
negative hydrogen ion production region where $\text{H}^-$ are generated by the dissociative
attachment of low energy electrons to rovibrationally excited hydrogen molecules. The GEVKM is
developed from moment equations for multi-temperature chemically reacting plasmas derived from
the Wang Chang-Uhlenbeck equations for a cylindrical geometry of an inductively coupled RFD chamber.
The species included into the model are $\text{H}(n), n=0-3, \text{H}_2(v), v=0-14, \text{H}^+,
\text{H}_2^+, \text{H}_3^+, \text{H}^-$, and $e$. The volume-averaged steady-state continuity
equations coupled with the electron energy equation, the total energy equation and heat transfer
to the chamber walls are solved simultaneously to obtain the volume-averaged number densities
of the plasma components, the electron, heavy-particle and wall temperatures. The GEVKM is supplemented
by a comprehensive set of surface and volumetric chemical processes governing vibrational and
ionization kinetics of hydrogen plasmas. Analytic boundary conditions developed for the flow
in the bypass tubes and in the nozzle take into account rarefaction effects and are validated by comparing
pressures predictions in the RFD chamber with the pressure measurements. The GEVKM is verified
and validated in the wide range of pressures and absorbed powers of different plasma reactors and
is used in a parametric investigation of the RFD chamber of the HCNHIS with hydrogen inlet flow rates
5-1000 sccm and absorbed powers 200-1000 W.
