We outline the fundamental coherent radiation emission processes from a bunched charged particles
beam. In contrast to spontaneous emission of radiation from a random electron beam that is proportional
to the number of particles, a pre-bunched electron beam can emit spontaneously coherent radiation
proportional to the number of particles - squared, through the process of (spontaneous) superradiance
(SP-SR) (in the sense of Dicke's). The coherent SP-SR emission of a bunched electron beam can be even
further enhanced by a process of stimulated-superradiance (ST-SR) in the presence of a seed injected
radiation field. In this review, these coherent radiation emission processes for both single bunch
and periodically bunched beams are considered in a model of radiation mode expansion. We also analyze
here the SP-SR and ST-SR processes in the nonlinear regime, in the context of enhanced undulator
radiation from a uniform undulator (wiggler) and in the case of wiggler Tapering-Enhanced Stimulated
Superradiant Amplification (TESSA). The processes of SP-SR and TESSA take place also in tapered
wiggler seed-injected FELs. In such FELs, operating in the X-Ray regime, these processes are convoluted
with other effects. However these fundamental emission concepts are useful guidelines in efficiency
enhancement strategy of wiggler tapering. Based on this model we review previous works on coherent
radiation sources based on SP-SR (coherent undulator radiation, synchrotron radiation, Smith-Purcell
radiation etc.), primarily in the THz regime and on-going works on tapered wiggler efficiency-enhancement
concepts in various frequency regimes.
