The COVID-19 epidemic that emerged in Wuhan China at the end of 2019 hit Italy particularly hard,
yielding the implementation of strict national lockdown rules (Phase 1). There is now a hot ongoing
debate in Italy and abroad on what the best strategy is to restart a country to exit a national lockdown
(Phase 2). Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting scenarios at the national
level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other nations around the world, is divided in administrative
regions who can independently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service. In
this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity between regions, is essential to understand
the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly, to design effective post Lock-Down strategies
to control the disease. To achieve this, we model Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the
model of each region on real data spanning almost two months from the initial outbreak. Using the
model, we confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national lockdown strategy implemented
so far by the Italian government to mitigate the spread of the disease and show its efficacy at the
regional level. We also propose that differentiated, albeit coordinated, regional interventions
can be effective in Phase 2 to restart the country and avoid future recurrence of the epidemic, while
avoiding saturation of the regional health systems and mitigating impact on costs. Our study and
methodology can be easily extended to other levels of granularity (provinces or counties in the
same region or states in other federal countries, etc.) to support policy- and decision-makers.
