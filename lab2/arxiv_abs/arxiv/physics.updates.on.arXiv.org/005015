It has long been known that large grounded conducting networks on the surface of Earth are affected
by solar activity and geomagnetic storms. Power networks are such extensive grounded conductors
and are susceptible to geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). GICs at any specific node in a power
network are assumed to be linearly related to the horizontal vector components of an induced plane-wave
geoelectric field by a pair of network parameters. These network parameters are not easily measured
in the network, but may be estimated empirically. In this work, we present a new approach of using
an ensemble of network parameters estimates. The ensembles include a huge number of parameter pair
estimates calculated from simultaneously solving pairs of time instances of the governing GIC
equation. Each individual estimate is not the true state of the system, but a possible state. Taking
the ensemble as a whole though gives the most probable parameter estimate. The most probable parameter
estimate for both network parameters, as defined by their respective ensembles, is used directly
in the modelling of GICs. The ensembles themselves however allow for further analysis into the nature
of GICs. An improvement is seen when comparing the out-of-sample performance of the ensemble estimates
with previous GIC modelling in the South African power network during the Halloween Storm of 2003.
For the first time, it is shown that errors in the GIC modelling chain are absorbed into the network
parameter estimates. Using a range of estimates from the ensemble, a GIC prediction band is produced.
This band corresponds to an error estimate for predicted GIC. Furthermore, it has been explicitly
shown that estimated network parameters vary with GIC magnitude during an event. This behaviour
is then used to refine the parameter estimation further and allow for real time dynamic network parameter
estimation.
