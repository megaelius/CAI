The time-independent projection-operator formalism of Brey et al. [Physica 109A, 425-444 (1981)]
for the derivation of Burnett equations is extended and considered in the context of multispecies
and magnetized plasmas. The procedure provides specific formulas for the transport coefficients
in terms of two-time correlation functions involving both two and three phase-space points. It
is shown how to calculate those correlation functions in the limit of weak coupling. The results
are used to demonstrate, with the aid of a particular nontrivial example, that previously derived
formulas from the two-time formalism [J. J. Brey, J. Chem. Phys. 79, 4585-598 (1983)] are consistent
with the Chapman-Enskog methodology employed later by Catto & Simakov (CS) [Phys. Plasmas 11, 90-102
(2004)] for the contributions to the parallel viscosity driven by temperature gradients. The work
serves to unify various previous work on plasma kinetic theory with formalism usually applied to
turbulence theory. Additional contributions include discussions of (i) Braginskii-order interspecies
momentum exchange from the point of view of two-time correlations; and (ii) a simple stochastic
model, unrelated to many-body theory, that exhibits Burnett effects. Insights from that model
emphasize the role of non-Gaussian statistics in the evaluation of Burnett transport coefficients,
including the effects calculated by CS that stem from the nonlinear collision operator. Together,
Parts I and II of this series provide a tutorial introduction to projection-operator methods that
should be broadly useful in theoretical plasma physics. A Supplement (bundled at the end of Part
II) provides some technical details of the reduction of the general Burnett equations of Brey et
al. (1981) to a one-component neutral fluid in order to support the result quoted by Brey (1983).
