The flow of an electrified liquid film down an inclined plane wall is investigated with the focus
on coherent structures in the form of travelling-wave solutions on the film surface, in particular,
single-hump solitary pulses and their interactions. The flow structures are analysed first using
a long-wave model derived on the basis of thin-film theory and second using the Stokes equations
for zero Reynolds number flow. Bifurcation diagrams of travelling-wave solutions for the long-wave
model are obtained for acute and obtuse wall inclination angles. For obtuse angles, gravity is destablising
and solitary pulses exist even in the absence of an electric field. For acute angles, spatially non-uniform
solutions exist only beyond a critical value of the electric field strength; moreover solitary-pulse
solutions are present only at sufficiently high supercritical electric field strengths. The electric
field increases the amplitude of the pulses, generate recirculation zones in the humps, and alters
the far-field decay of the pulse tails from exponential to algebraic. A weak-interaction theory
which incorporates long-range effects is developed to analyse attractions and repulsions and
the formation of bound states of pulses. The infinite sequence of bound-state solutions found for
non-electrified flow is shown to reduce to a finite set for electrified flow due to the algebraic
decay of the tails. The existence of single-hump pulse solutions and two-pulse bound states is confirmed
for the Stokes equations via boundary-element computations. An absolute-convective instability
analysis of single-hump pulse solutions is performed both for the long-wave model and for the Stokes
equations. The electric field is shown to trigger a switch from absolute instability to convective
instability, thereby regularising the dynamics, and this is confirmed by time-dependent simulations
of the long-wave model.
