A millimetric bouncing droplet sustained on a vibrating bath becomes a moving wave source (particle)
through periodically interacting with the local wave field it generates during droplet-bath impact.
By virtue of such particle-wave duality, the macroscopic hydrodynamic system imitates enigmatic
behaviors of the quantum realm. Here we show experimentally that it is possible to create an integrated
pilot-wave field to better prescribe the droplet trajectories, via amplified bath capillarity.
This is demonstrated with a liquid metal droplet-bath system in which the local wave field generated
by droplet bouncing is superposed by a global wave field induced by bath meniscus oscillation. The
resulted dual pilot-wave configuration enables a class of directional chasing motions of two bound
dissimilar droplets (heterodimers) in multilevel hydrodynamic traps (orbits) featuring two
quantized regime parameters, namely the inter-droplet binding distance and the orbit radius.
The peculiar features of the integrated pilot-wave field as well as the droplet-wave interactions
therein are discussed. It is revealed that a temporal bouncing phase shift between the two droplets
due to size mismatch gives rise to their horizontal propulsion while their spatial binding regime
exclusively determines the collective chasing direction. It is also evidenced that the horizontal
in-orbit chasing motion is directly related to vertical droplet bouncing. The findings unveil
integrated pilot-wave field as a trail towards improved droplet guiding, thereby extending the
hydrodynamic particle-wave analogy to optical systems and beyond.
