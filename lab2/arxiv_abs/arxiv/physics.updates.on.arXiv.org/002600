Two dimensional semiconductor such as single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (SL-TMD)
have attracted most attentions as an atomically thin layer semiconductor materials. Typically,
lattice point defects (sulfur vacancy) created by physical/chemical method during growth stages,
have disadvantages on electronic properties. However, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy
is conventionally used to characterize single-layer films but until now it has not been used to show
the presence of defects or estimate their population due to overall similarity of general feature
PL spectra. To find a feasible and robust method to determine the presence of point defects on single
layer ${\rm MoS_2}$ without changing the experimental setup, Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation
Analysis (MF-DFA) and Multifractal Detrended Moving Average Analysis (MF-DMA) are applied on
the PL spectrum of single layer ${\rm MoS_2}$. We compare the scaling behavior of PL spectrum of pristine
and defective single layer ${\rm MoS_2}$ determined by MF-DFA and MF-DMA. Our results reveal that
PL spectrum has multifractal nature and different various population of point defects (sulfur
vacancy) on single layer ${\rm MoS_2}$ change dramatically multifractality characteristics
(Hurst, H\"older exponents) of photoluminescence spectrum. It is exhibited creating more lattice
point leads to smaller fluctuations in luminescent light that it can help to design special defect
structure for light emitted devices. The relative populations of point defects are almost elucidated
without utilizing expensive characterization instruments such as scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM).
