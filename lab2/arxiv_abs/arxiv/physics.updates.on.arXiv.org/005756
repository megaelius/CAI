In the framework of the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach coupled with electrostatic equations,
we performed finite element modeling of the polarization behavior in a ferroelectric barium titanate
core covered with a tunable paraelectric strontium titanate shell placed in a polymer or liquid
medium. A stable two-dimensional vortex is formed in the core after a zero-field relaxation of an
initial random or poly-domain distribution of the polarization, where the vortex axis is directed
along one of the core crystallographic axes. Subsequently, sinusoidal pulses of a homogeneous
electric field with variable period, strength, and direction are applied. The field-induced changes
of the vortex structure consist in the appearance of an axial kernel in the form of a prolate nanodomain,
the kernel growth, an increasing orientation of the polarization along the field, and the onset
of a single-domain state. We introduced the term "kernel" to name the prolate nanodomain developed
near the vortex axis and polarized perpendicular to the vortex plane. In ferromagnetism, this region
is generally known as the vortex core. The vortex states with a kernel possess a manifold degeneracy,
appearing from three equiprobable directions of vortex axis, clockwise and counterclockwise
directions of polarization rotation along the vortex axis, and two polarization directions in
the kernel. This multitude of the vortex states in a single core are promising for applications of
core-shell nanoparticles and their ensembles as multi-bit memory and related logic units. The
rotation of a vortex kernel over a sphere, possible for the core-shell nanoparticles in a soft matter
medium with controllable viscosity, may be used to imitate qubit features.
