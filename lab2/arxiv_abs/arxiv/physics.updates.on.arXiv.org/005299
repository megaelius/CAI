Surveys of microbial biodiversity such as the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) and the Human Microbiome
Project (HMP) have revealed robust ecological patterns across different environments. A major
goal in ecology is to leverage these patterns to identify the ecological processes shaping microbial
ecosystems. One promising approach is to use minimal models that can relate mechanistic assumptions
at the microbe scale to community-level patterns. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this approach
by showing that the Microbial Consumer Resource Model (MiCRM) -- a minimal model for microbial communities
with resource competition, metabolic crossfeeding and stochastic colonization -- can qualitatively
reproduce patterns found in survey data including compositional gradients, dissimilarity/overlap
correlations, richness/harshness correlations, and nestedness of community composition. By
using the MiCRM to generate synthetic data with different environmental and taxonomical structure,
we show that large scale patterns in the EMP can be reproduced by considering the energetic cost of
surviving in harsh environments and HMP patterns may reflect the importance of environmental filtering
in shaping competition. We also show that recently discovered dissimilarity-overlap correlations
in the HMP likely arise from communities that share similar environments rather than reflecting
universal dynamics. We identify ecologically meaningful changes in parameters that alter or destroy
each one of these patterns, suggesting new mechanistic hypotheses for further investigation.
These findings highlight the promise of minimal models for microbial ecology.
