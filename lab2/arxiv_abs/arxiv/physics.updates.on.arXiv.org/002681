The main difference between 3D and 4D printed structures is one extra dimension that is smart evolution
over time. However, currently, there is no general formula to model and predict this extra dimension.
Here, by starting from fundamental concepts, we derive and validate a universal bi-exponential
formula that is required to model and predict the fourth D of 4D printed multi-material structures.
4D printing is a new manufacturing paradigm to elaborate stimuli-responsive materials in multi-material
structures for advanced manufacturing (and construction) of advanced products (and structures).
It conserves the general attributes of 3D printing (such as the elimination of molds, dies, and machining)
and further enables the fourth dimension of products and structures to provide intelligent behavior
over time. This intelligent behavior is encoded (usually by an inverse mathematical problem) into
stimuli-responsive multi-materials during printing and is enabled by stimuli after printing.
Here, we delve into the fourth dimension and reveal three general laws that govern the time-dependent
shape-shifting behaviors of almost all (photochemical-, photothermal-, solvent-, pH-, moisture-,
electrochemical-, electrothermal-, ultrasound-, enzyme-, etc.-responsive) multi-material
4D structures. We demonstrate that two different types of time-constants govern the shape-shifting
behavior of almost all the multi-material 4D printed structures over time. Our results starting
from the most fundamental concepts and ending with governing equations can serve as general design
principles for future research in the 4D printing field, where the time-dependent behaviors should
be understood, modeled, and predicted, correctly. Future software and hardware developments
in 4D printing can also benefit from these results.
