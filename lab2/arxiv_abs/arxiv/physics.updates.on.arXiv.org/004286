In turbulent flows subject to strong background rotation, the advective mechanisms of turbulence
are superseded by the propagation of inertial waves, as the effects of rotation become dominant.
While this mechanism has been identified experimentally, the conditions of the transition between
the two mechanisms are less clear. We tackle this question by means of an experiment where we track
the turbulent front away from a solid wall where fluid is injected in an otherwise quiescent fluid.
Without background rotation, this apparatus generates a turbulent front whose displacement recovers
the $z(t)\sim t^{1/2}$ law classically obtained with an oscillating grid and we further establish
the scale-independence of the associated transport mechanism. When the apparatus is rotating
at a constant velocity perpendicular to the wall where fluid is injected, not only does the turbulent
front become mainly transported by inertial waves, but advection itself is suppressed because
of the local deficit of momentum incurred by the propagation of these waves. Scale-by-scale analysis
of the displacement of the turbulent front reveals that the transition between advection and propagation
is local both in space and spectrally, and takes place when the Rossby number based on the considered
scale is of unity. The transition also took place during the evolution of the front: in almost all
experiments, we observed that at certain scales, given fluctuations where first advected by the
local velocity of fluid injection until the propagation of inertial waves exceeded the local velocity,
at which point propagation by inertial waves of that scale took over.
