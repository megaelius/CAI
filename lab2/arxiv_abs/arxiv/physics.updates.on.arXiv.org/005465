Liquid slip flow with a Knudsen number Kn = 0.001-0.1 plays a dominant role in confined flow channels.
Its physical origin can be attributed to the intermolecular fluid-solid (F-S) interaction force.
To this end, we propose herein continuous force functions (decaying either exponentially or by
a power law) between fluid particles and two confined flat walls in the framework of the mesoscopic
lattice Boltzmann model (LBM). The analytical solutions for density profile, velocity profile,
slip length, and permeability ratio are derived and related to the mesoscale F-S interaction parameters
and the size of the gap of the flow channel. Through nondimensionalization of the analytical solutions,
we obtain the dimensionless numbers that indicate the key feature of slip-flow systems for each
of the proposed force functions. The analytical solutions are strictly consistent with the LBM
solutions. We suggest reasonable ranges for the F-S interaction parameters based on the observed
range of density ratio (film fluid to bulk fluid) and the increasing permeability ratios with narrowing
gap size. Within the given range of interaction parameters, simple relationships between permeability
ratios and dimensionless numbers are provided by fitting. The curves for continuous F-S interaction
force with two free parameters are calibrated for a hydrophobic surface by using LBM simulations,
which were validated a priori by comparison with the slip velocity profile measured in a benchmark
flow experiment. The mesoscopic LBM model based on the proposed F-S interaction force functions
provides a robust framework to elucidate the physical process of liquid slip flow.
