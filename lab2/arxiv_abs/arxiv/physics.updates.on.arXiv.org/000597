Electron Cyclotron Emission (ECE) of different frequencies originates at different locations
in non-uniformly magnetized plasmas. For simultaneous observation of multiple ECE frequencies
from the outside edge of a toroidal plasma confinement device (e.g. a tokamak), the focal length
of the collecting optics should increase with the frequency to maximize the resolution on a line
of sight along the magnetic field gradient. Here we present the design and numerical study of a zoned
metamaterial lens with such characteristics, for possible deployment with the 83-130 GHz ECE radiometer
in the DIII-D tokamak. The lens consists of a concentric array of miniaturized element phase-shifters.
These were reverse-engineered starting from the desired Gaussian beam waist locations and further
optimized to account for diffraction and finite-aperture effects that tend to displace the waist.
At the same time we imposed high and uniform transmittance, averaged over all phase-shifters. The
focal length is shown to increase from 1.37 m to 1.97 m over the frequency range of interest, as desired
for low-field DIII-D discharges (B = -1.57 T). Retracting the lens to receded positions rigidly
moves the waists accordingly, resulting in a good match -within a fraction of the Rayleigh length-
of the EC-emitting layer positions at higher fields (up to B = -2.00 T). Further, it is shown how varying
the lens aperture might move the waists "non-rigidly" to better match the non-rigid movement of
the EC-emitting layers with the magnetic field. The numerical method presented is very general
and can be used to engineer any dependence of the focal length on the frequency, including zero or
minimal chromatic aberration.
