In this letter we consider two different models of our present universe. We choose the models which
are consisting different sets of two seperate fluids. The first one of each set tries to justify the
late time acceleration and the second one is barotropic fluid. The former model considers our present
time universe to be homogeneously filled up by Generalized Chaplygin Gas which is interacting with
barotropic fluid. On the other hand, the latter model considers that the cosmic acceleration is
generated by Modified Chaplygin Gas which is interacting with matter depicted by barotropic equation
of state. For both the models, we consider the interaction term to vary proportionally with Hubble's
parameter as well as with the exotic matter/dark energy's energy density. We find an explicit function
form of the energy density of the cosmos which is found to depend on different cosmological parameters
like scale factor, dark energy and barotropic fluid's EoS parameters and other constants like interacting
constants etc. We draw curves of effective EoS-s, different cosmological parameters like deceleration
parameter $q$, statefinder parameters $r$ and $s$ with repect to the redshift $z$ (for different
values of dark energy and barotopic fluid parameters) and study them thoroughly. We compare two
models as well as the nature of dependencies on these models' interaction coefficients. We point
out the particular redshift for which the universe may transit from a deceleration to acceleration
phase. We tally all these values with different observational data. Here we also analyse how this
value of particular redshift does change for different values of interaction coefficients and
different dark energy models.
