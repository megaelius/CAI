In this paper, we address the theoretical resolution of the Vlasov-Gauss system from the linear
regime to the strongly nonlinear one, when significant trapping has occurred. The electric field
is that of a sinusoidal electron plasma wave (EPW) which is assumed to grow from the noise level, and
to keep growing at least up to the amplitude when linear theory in no longer valid (while the wave evolution
in the nonlinear regime may be arbitrary). The ions are considered as a neutralizing fluid, while
the electron response to the wave is derived by matching two different techniques. We make use of
a perturbation analysis similar to that introduced to prove the Kolmogorov-Arnold- Moser theorem,
up to amplitudes large enough for neo-adiabatic results to be valid. Our theory is applied to the
growth and saturation of the beam-plasma instability, and to the three-dimensional propagation
of a driven EPW in a non-uniform and non-stationary plasma. For the latter example, we lay a special
emphasis on nonlinear collisionless dissipation. We provide an explicit theoretical expression
for the nonlinear Landau-like damping rate which, in some instances, is amenable to a simple analytic
formula. We also insist on the irreversible evolution of the electron distribution function, which
is nonlocal in the wave amplitude and phase velocity. This makes trapping an effective means of dissipation
for the electrostatic energy, and also makes the wave dispersion relation nonlocal. Our theory
is generalized to allow for stimulated Raman scattering, which we address up to saturation by accounting
for plasma inhomogeneity and non-stationarity, nonlinear kinetic effects, and interspeckle
coupling.
