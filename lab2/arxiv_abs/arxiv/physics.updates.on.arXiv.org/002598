This research investigates dynamic response of tunable periodic structures and homogenization
methods in magnetoelastic composites (MECs). The research on tunable periodic structures is focused
on the design, modeling and understanding of wave propagation phenomena and the dynamic response
of smart phononic crystals. High amplitude wrinkle formation is employed to study a one-dimensional
phononic crystal slab consists of a thin film bonded to a thick compliant substrate. Buckling induced
surface instability generates a wrinkly structure triggered by a compressive strain. It is demonstrated
that surface periodic pattern and the corresponding large deformation can control elastic wave
propagation in the low thickness composite slab. Simulation results show that the periodic wrinkly
structure can be used as a smart phononic crystal which can switch band diagrams of the structure
in a transformative manner. A magnetoactive phononic crystal is proposed which its dynamic properties
are controlled by combined effects of large deformations and an applied magnetic field. Finite
deformations and magnetic induction influence phononic characteristics of the periodic structure
through geometrical pattern transformation and material properties. A magnetoelastic energy
function is proposed to develop constitutive laws considering large deformations and magnetic
induction in the periodic structure. Analytical and finite element methods are utilized to compute
dispersion relation and band structure of the phononic crystal for different cases of deformation
and magnetic loadings. It is demonstrated that magnetic induction not only controls the band diagram
of the structure but also has a strong effect on preferential directions of wave propagation. Moreover,
a thermally controlled phononic crystal is designed using ligaments of bi-materials in the structure.
