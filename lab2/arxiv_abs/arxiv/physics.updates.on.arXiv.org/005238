Fundamental properties of macroscopic gene-mating dynamic evolutionary systems are investigated.
We focus on a single locus, any number of alleles in a two-gender dioecious population, for a large
class of systems within population genetics. Our governing equations are time-dependent differential
equations labeled by a set of genotype frequencies. Our equations are uniquely derived from 4 assumptions
within any population: (1) a closed system; (2) average-and-random mating process (mean-field
behavior); (3) Mendelian inheritance; (4) exponential growth/death. Although our equations
are nonlinear with time-evolutionary dynamics, we have obtained an exact analytic time-dependent
solution and an exactly solvable model. From the phenomenological viewpoint, any initial parameter
of genotype frequencies of a closed system will eventually approach a stable fixed point. Under
time evolution, we show (1) the monotonic behavior of genotype frequencies, (2) any genotype or
allele that appears in the population will never become extinct, (3) the Hardy-Weinberg law, and
(4) the global stability without chaos in the parameter space. To demonstrate the experimental
evidence for our theory, as an example, we show a mapping from the data of blood type genotype frequencies
of world ethnic groups to our stable fixed-point solutions. This fixed-point Hardy-Weinberg manifold,
attracting any initial point in any Euclidean fiber bounded within the genotype frequency space
to the fixed point where this fiber is attached. The stable base manifold and its attached fibers
form a fiber bundle, which fills in the whole genotype frequency space completely. We can define
the genetic distance of two populations as their geodesic distance on the equilibrium manifold.
The modification of our theory under the process of natural selection and mutation is addressed.
