We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model and state-of-art Monte Carlo sampling method to solve
the unfolding problem, i.e., to estimate the spectrum of an unknown neutron source from the data
detected by an organic scintillator. Inferring neutron spectra is important for several applications,
including nonproliferation and nuclear security, as it allows the discrimination of fission sources
in special nuclear material (SNM) from other types of neutron sources based on the differences of
the emitted neutron spectra. Organic scintillators interact with neutrons mostly via elastic
scattering on hydrogen nuclei and therefore partially retain neutron energy information. Consequently,
the neutron spectrum can be derived through deconvolution of the measured light output spectrum
and the response functions of the scintillator to monoenergetic neutrons. The proposed approach
is compared to three existing methods using simulated data to enable controlled benchmarks. We
consider three sets of detector responses. One set corresponds to a 2.5 MeV monoenergetic neutron
source and two sets are associated with (energy-wise) continuous neutron sources ($^{252}$Cf
and $^{241}$AmBe). Our results show that the proposed method has similar or better unfolding performance
compared to other iterative or Tikhonov regularization-based approaches in terms of accuracy
and robustness against limited detection events, while requiring less user supervision. The proposed
method also provides a posteriori confidence measures, which offers additional information regarding
the uncertainty of the measurements and the extracted information.
