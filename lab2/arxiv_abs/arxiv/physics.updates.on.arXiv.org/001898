In scalar turbulence it is sometimes the case that the scalar diffusivity is smaller than the viscous
diffusivity. The thermally-driven turbulent convection in water is a typical example. In such
a case the smallest scale in the problem is the Batchelor scale $l_b$, rather than the Kolmogorov
scale $l_k$, as $l_b = l_k/Sc^{1/2}$, where Sc is the Schmidt number (or Prandtl number in the case
of temperature). In the numerical studies of such scalar turbulence, the conventional approach
is to use a single grid for both the velocity and scalar fields. Such single-resolution scheme often
over-resolves the velocity field because the resolution requirement for scalar is higher than
that for the velocity field, since $l_b<l_k$ for $Sc>1$. In this paper we put forward an algorithm
that implements the so-called multiple-resolution method with a finite-volume code. In this scheme,
the velocity and pressure fields are solved in a coarse grid, while the scalar field is solved in a
dense grid. The central idea is to implement the interpolation scheme on the framework of finite-volume
to reconstruct the divergence-free velocity from the coarse to the dense grid. We demonstrate our
method using a canonical model system of fluid turbulence, the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection.
We show that, with the tailored mesh design, considerable speed-up for simulating scalar turbulence
can be achieved, especially for large Schmidt (Prandtl) numbers. In the same time, sufficient accuracy
of the scalar and velocity fields can be achived by this multiple-resolution scheme. Although our
algorithm is demonstrated with a case of an active scalar, it can be readily applied to passive scalar
turbulent flows.
