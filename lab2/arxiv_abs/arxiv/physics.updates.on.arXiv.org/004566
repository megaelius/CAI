Recent in-situ and remote observations suggest that the transport regime associated with shock
accelerated particles may be anomalous {i.e., the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) of such particles
scales non-linearly with time}. We use self-consistent, hybrid PIC plasma simulations to simulate
a quasi-parallel shock with parameters compatible with heliospheric shocks, and gain insights
about the particle transport in such a system. For suprathermal particles interacting with the
shock we compute the MSD separately in the upstream and downstream regions. Tracking suprathermal
particles for sufficiently long times up and/or downstream of the shock poses problems in particle
plasma simulations, such as statistically poor particle ensembles and trajectory fragments of
variable length in time. Therefore, we introduce the use of time-averaged mean square displacement
(TAMSD), which is based on single particle trajectories, as an additional technique to address
the transport regime for the upstream and downstream regions. MSD and TAMSD are in agreement for
the upstream energetic particle population, and both give a strong indication of superdiffusive
transport, consistent with interplanetary shock observations. MSD and TAMSD are also in reasonable
agreement downstream, where indications of anomalous transport are also found. TAMSD shows evidence
of heterogeneity in the diffusion properties of the downstream particle population, ranging from
subdiffusive behaviour of particles trapped in the strong magnetic field fluctuations generated
at the shock, to superdiffusive behaviour of particles transmitted and moving away from the shock.
