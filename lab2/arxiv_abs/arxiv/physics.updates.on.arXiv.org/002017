The solar corona and young solar wind may be characterized by critical surfaces -- the sonic, Alfv\'en,
and first plasma-$\beta$ unity surfaces -- that demarcate regions where the solar wind flow undergoes
certain crucial transformations. Global numerical simulations and remote sensing observations
offer a natural mode for the study of these surfaces at large scales, thus providing valuable context
for the high-resolution in-situ measurements expected from the soon-to-be-launched Parker Solar
Probe (PSP). The present study utilizes global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations
of the solar wind to characterize the critical surfaces and investigate the flow in propinquitous
regions. Effects of solar activity are incorporated by varying source magnetic dipole tilts and
employing magnetogram-based boundary conditions. A magnetohydrodynamic turbulence model is
self-consistently coupled to the bulk flow equations, enabling investigation of turbulence properties
of the flow in the vicinity of critical regions. The simulation results are compared with a variety
of remote sensing observations. A simulated PSP trajectory is used to provide contextual predictions
for the spacecraft in terms of the computed critical surfaces. Broad agreement is seen in the interpretation
of the present results in comparison with existing remote sensing results, both from heliospheric
imaging and from radio scintillation studies. The trajectory analyses show that the period of time
that PSP is likely to spend inside the $\beta=1$, sonic and Alfv\'en surfaces depends sensitively
on the degree of solar activity and the tilt of the solar dipole and location of the heliospheric current
sheet.
