Supercritical fluids near the critical point are characterized by liquid-like densities and gas-like
transport properties. These features are purposely exploited in different contexts ranging from
natural products extraction/fractionation to aerospace propulsion. Large part of studies concerns
this last context, focusing on the dynamics of supercritical fluids at high Mach number where compressibility
and thermodynamics strictly interact. Despite the widespread use also at low Mach number, the turbulent
mixing properties of slightly supercritical fluids have still not investigated in detail in this
regime. This topic is addressed here by dealing with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a coaxial
jet of a slightly supercritical Van der Waals fluid. Since acoustic effects are irrelevant in the
Low Mach number conditions found in many industrial applications, the numerical model is based
on a suitable low-Mach number expansion of the governing equation. According to experimental observations,
the weakly supercritical regime is characterized by the formation of finger-like structures--
the so-called ligaments --in the shear layers separating the two streams. The mechanism of ligament
formation at vanishing Mach number is extracted from the simulations and a detailed statistical
characterization is provided. Ligaments always form whenever a high density contrast occurs,
independently of real or perfect gas behaviors. The difference between real and perfect gas conditions
is found in the ligament small-scale structure. More intense density gradients and thinner interfaces
characterize the near critical fluid in comparison with the smoother behavior of the perfect gas.
A phenomenological interpretation is here provided on the basis of the real gas thermodynamics
properties.
