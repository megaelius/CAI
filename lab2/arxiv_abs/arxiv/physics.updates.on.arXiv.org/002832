The adsorption of three different polycations at the negatively charged surface of tubular J-aggregates
of the amphiphilic cyanine dye 3,3'-bis(2-sulfopropyl)-5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-dioctylbenzimidacarbocyanine
(C8S3) is investigated by means of cryogenic electron microscopy and optical absorption spectroscopy.
All three polycations could be adsorbed at the aggregates without flocculation or precipitation
when added in molar amounts of monomers sufficiently smaller than of the dye molecules. Preferably
the aggregates are either coated by the polycations in total or left completely uncoated. For the
coated aggregates, the adsorption leads to charge reversal of the aggregate surface as supported
by zeta-potential measurements. The morphology of the coating differs significantly for the three
polycations: The branched polycation polyethlyenimine (PEI) attaches to the tubular aggregate
by hit-and-stick adsorption of the coiled state in solution forming irregular clot-like coatings;
the flexible and weakly cationic poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) forms a more homogeneous
coating but destroys the integrity of the dye aggregate; the more hydrophobic and strong polycation
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) forms a thin and homogeneous layer, supposedly
by wrapping around the tubular aggregate. For the latter, growth of a second dye double layer of the
aggregates seems to grow. The different morphologies of the coatings are rather due to the details
of the chemical structure of the polycations than due to physical parameters. The possible adsorption
of polyelectrolytes at these amphiphilic tubular structures, stabilized by non-covalent bonds
only, is far from obvious but demonstrates an applicable route to the build-up of more complex nanostructures
by means of a self-assembly process.
