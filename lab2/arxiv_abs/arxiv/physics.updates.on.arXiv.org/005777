SARS-COV-2 identified as COVID-19 in Wuhan city of China in the month of December, 2019 has now been
declared as pandemic by World Health Organization whose transmission chain and cure both have emerged
as a tough problem for the medical fraternity. The reports pertaining to the treatment of this pandemic
are still lacking. We firmly believe that Nature itself provides a simple solution for any complicated
problem created in it which motivated us to carry out In Silico investigations on some bioactive
natural compounds reportedly found in the fruits and leaves of Anthocephalus Cadamba which is a
miraculous plant found on the earth aiming to predict the potential inhibitors against aforesaid
virus. Having modeled the ground state ligand structure of the such nine natural compounds applying
density functional theory at B3LYP/631+G (d, p) level we have performed their molecular docking
with SARS-COV-2 protease to calculate the binding affinity as well as to screen the binding at S-protein
site during ligand-protein interactions. Out of these nine studied naturally occurring compounds;
Oleanic Acid has been appeared to be potential inhibitor for COVID-19 followed by Ursolic Acid,
IsoVallesiachotamine,Vallesiachotamine,Cadambine,Vincosamide-N-Oxide, Isodihydroamino-cadambine,
Pentyle Ester of Chlorogenic Acid and D-Myo-Inositol. Hence these bioactive natural compounds
or their structural analogs may be explored as anti-COVID19 drug agent which will be possessing
the peculiar feature of cost-less synthesis and less or no side effect due to their natural occurrence.
The solubility and solvent-effect related to the phytochemicals may be the point of concern. The
In-vivo investigations on these proposed natural compounds or on their structural analogs are
invited for designing and developing the potential medicine/vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19
pandemic.
