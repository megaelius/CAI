Recent laser-plasma experiments report the existence of dynamically significant magnetic fields,
whose statistical characterisation is essential for understanding the physical processes these
experiments are attempting to investigate. In this paper, we show how a proton imaging diagnostic
can be used to determine a range of relevant magnetic field statistics, including the magnetic-energy
spectrum. To achieve this goal, we explore the properties of an analytic relation between a stochastic
magnetic field and the image-flux distribution created upon imaging that field. We conclude that
features of the beam's final image-flux distribution often display a universal character determined
by a single, field-scale dependent parameter - the contrast parameter - which quantifies the relative
size of the correlation length of the stochastic field, proton displacements due to magnetic deflections,
and the image magnification. For stochastic magnetic fields, we establish the existence of four
contrast regimes - linear, nonlinear injective, caustic and diffusive - under which proton-flux
images relate to their parent fields in a qualitatively distinct manner. As a consequence, it is
demonstrated that in the linear or nonlinear injective regimes, the path-integrated magnetic
field experienced by the beam can be extracted uniquely, as can the magnetic-energy spectrum under
a further statistical assumption of isotropy. This is no longer the case in the caustic or diffusive
regimes. We also discuss complications to the contrast-regime characterisation arising for inhomogeneous,
multi-scale stochastic fields, as well as limitations currently placed by experimental capabilities
on extracting magnetic field statistics. The results presented in this paper provide a comprehensive
description of proton images of stochastic magnetic fields, with applications for improved analysis
of given proton-flux images.
