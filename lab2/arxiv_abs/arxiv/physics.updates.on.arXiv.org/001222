Regional characterization of the continental crust has classically been performed through either
geologic mapping, geochemical sampling, or geophysical surveys. Rarely are these techniques
fully integrated, due to limits of data coverage, quality, and/or incompatible datasets. We combine
geologic observations, geochemical sampling, and geophysical surveys to create a coherent 3-D
geologic model of a 50 x 50 km upper crustal region surrounding the SNOLAB underground physics laboratory
in Canada, which includes the Southern Province, the Superior Province, the Sudbury Structure
and the Grenville Front Tectonic Zone. Nine representative aggregate units of exposed lithologies
are geologically characterized, geophysically constrained, and probed with 109 rock samples
supported by compiled geochemical databases. A detailed study of the lognormal distributions
of U and Th abundances and of their correlation permits a bivariate analysis for a robust treatment
of the uncertainties. A downloadable 3D numerical model of U and Th distribution defines an average
heat production of 1.5$^{+1.4}_{-0.7}$$\mu$W/m$^{3}$, and predicts a contribution of 7.7$^{+7.7}_{-3.0}$TNU
(a Terrestrial Neutrino Unit is one geoneutrino event per 10$^{32}$ target protons per year) out
of a crustal geoneutrino signal of 31.1$^{+8.0}_{-4.5}$TNU. The relatively high local crust geoneutrino
signal together with its large variability strongly restrict the SNO+ capability of experimentally
discriminating among BSE compositional models of the mantle. Future work to constrain the crustal
heat production and the geoneutrino signal at SNO+ will be inefficient without more detailed geophysical
characterization of the 3D structure of the heterogeneous Huronian Supergroup, which contributes
the largest uncertainty to the calculation.
