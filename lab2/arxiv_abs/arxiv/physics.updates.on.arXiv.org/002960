We present a theoretical and numerical study on the (in)stability of the interface between two immiscible
liquids, i.e., viscous fingering, in angled Hele-Shaw cells across a range of capillary numbers
($Ca$). We consider two types of angled Hele-Shaw cells: diverging cells with a positive depth gradient
and converging cells with a negative depth gradient, and compare those against parallel cells without
a depth gradient. A modified linear stability analysis is employed to derive a novel expression
for the growth rate of perturbations on the interface and for the critical capillary number ($Ca_c$)
for such a tapered Hele-Shaw cell. Based on these results, a three-regime theory is formulated to
describe the interface (in)stability: (i) in Regime I, the growth rate is always negative, thus
the interface is stable; (ii) in Regime II, the growth rate remains zero (parallel cells), changes
from negative to positive (converging cells), or from positive to negative (diverging cells),
thus the interface (in)stability possibly changes type at some location in the cell; (iii) in Regime
III, the growth rate is always positive, thus the interface is unstable. We conduct three-dimensional
direct numerical simulations of Navier--Stokes-based mixture theory to verify the theory and
explore the effect of depth gradient on the interface (in)stability. We demonstrate that the depth
gradient has only a slight influence in Regime I, and its effect is most pronounced in Regime III.
Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the stability diagram derived from theoretical considerations
versus the one obtained from direct numerical simulations.
