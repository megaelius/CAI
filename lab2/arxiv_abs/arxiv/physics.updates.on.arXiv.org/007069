Manipulating the topological phase transition of the photonic insulators will provide a unique
control for the interaction between light and matter, such as the exotic edge states with topological
protection. To data, the topological characteristics including invariant topological orders,
band inversion, and the edge states in the photonic insulators have been widely studied and experimentally
demonstrated. Whether people can take advantage of intriguing topological states in simple one-dimensional
systems to implement some practical applications is an issue which people are increasingly concerned
about. Specially, the edge states in the topological dimer chain have been proposed to realize the
topological robust lasers. In this work, based on a photonic dimer chain composed of ultra-subwavelength
resonators, we verify experimentally that the topological edge state is immune to the inner disorder
perturbation and can be used to realize the wireless power transfer (WPT) with high transmission
efficiency. This property of high transmission efficiency can be guaranteed even when the length
of chain changes. Moreover, to intuitively show the topological edge state can be used for WPT, a
power signal source is used to excitethe topological edge state. It can be clearly seen that the LED
lamps with 0.5-W at both ends of the structure corresponding to the edge state are lighted up. Inspired
by the long-range WPT implemented by the edge state in this work, it is expected to use more complex
topological structures to achieve more functional energy transmission, such as the WPT whose direction
can be selected flexibly in the quasiperiodic topological Harper chain.
