By combining density-functional theory (DFT) and wave function theory (WFT) via the range separation
(RS) of the interelectronic Coulomb operator, we obtain accurate fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo
(FN-DMC) energies with compact multi-determinant trial wave functions. In particular, we combine
here short-range exchange-correlation functionals with a flavor of selected configuration interaction
(SCI) known as \emph{configuration interaction using a perturbative selection made iteratively}
(CIPSI), a scheme that we label RS-DFT-CIPSI. One of the take-home messages of the present study
is that RS-DFT-CIPSI trial wave functions yield lower fixed-node energies with more compact multi-determinant
expansions than CIPSI, especially for small basis sets. Indeed, as the CIPSI component of RS-DFT-CIPSI
is relieved from describing the short-range part of the correlation hole around the electron-electron
coalescence points, the number of determinants in the trial wave function required to reach a given
accuracy is significantly reduced as compared to a conventional CIPSI calculation. Importantly,
by performing various numerical experiments, we evidence that the RS-DFT scheme essentially plays
the role of a simple Jastrow factor by mimicking short-range correlation effects, hence avoiding
the burden of performing a stochastic optimization. Considering the 55 atomization energies of
the Gaussian-1 benchmark set of molecules, we show that using a fixed value of $\mu=0.5$~bohr$^{-1}$
provides effective error cancellations as well as compact trial wave functions, making the present
method a good candidate for the accurate description of large chemical systems.
