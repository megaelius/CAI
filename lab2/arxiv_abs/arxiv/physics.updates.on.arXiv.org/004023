Purpose: To characterize the mean topographical shape of the human limbus of a normal eye and ascertain
whether it depends on age and refractive power. Setting: Academic institution. Design: Prospective
case series. Methods: 74 subjects aged from 20 to 84 years and with no previous ocular surgeries were
included in this study. The left eye was measured four times with a corneo scleral topographer (Eye
Surface Profiler). From the raw anterior eye height data of each measurement, topographical limbus
was demarcated and fitted in three dimensions to a circle, an ellipse and a Fourier series. Root mean
square error (RMSE) was calculated to evaluate the goodness of fit. In addition, white to white (WTW)
corneal diameter was taken from the readings of the measuring device and compared with the topographical
limbus. For statistical analysis, subjects were grouped as young and older, and also according
their equivalent sphere correction. Results: From the considered models, second order Fourier
series resulted in the most accurate model to describe the shape of the human limbus. The difference
between the topographical limbus diameter and the WTW corneal diameter amounted on average and
standard deviation to 0.33 mm and 0.24 mm. Statistically significant differences among eye quadrants
were found. No statistically significant difference in horizontal and vertical meridian between
age groups (P=0.71 and P=0.082, respectively) or between myopes and emmetropes (P=0.78 and P=0.68,
respectively) were found. Conclusions: Human limbus is not symmetrical and its shape is subject
dependent but not related to age and eye refractive power.
