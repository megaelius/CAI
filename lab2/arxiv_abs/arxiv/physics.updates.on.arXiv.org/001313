Dual Fabry-Perot cavity based optical refractometry (DFPC-OR) has a high potential for assessments
of gas density. However, drifts of the FP cavity often limit its performance. We show that by the use
of two narrow-linewidth fiber lasers locked to two high finesse cavities and Allan-Werle plots
that drift-free DFPC-OR can be obtained for short measurement times (for which the drifts of the
cavity can be disregarded). Based on this, a novel strategy, termed fast switching DFPC-OR (FS-DFPC-OR),
is presented. A set of novel methodologies for assessment of both gas density and flow rates (in particular
from small leaks) that are not restricted by the conventional limitations imposed by the drifts
of the cavity are presented. The methodologies deal with assessments in both open and closed (finite-sized)
compartments. They circumvent the problem with volumetric expansion, i.e. that the gas density
in a measurement cavity is not the same as that in the closed external compartment that should be assessed,
by performing a pair of measurements in rapid succession; the first one serves the purpose of assessing
the density of the gas that has been transferred into the measurement cavity by the gas equilibration
process, while the 2nd is used to automatically calibrate the system with respect to the relative
volumes of the measurement cavity and the external compartment. The methodologies for assessments
of leak rates comprise triple cavity evacuation assessments, comprising two measurements performed
in rapid succession, supplemented by a 3rd measurement a certain time thereafter. A clear explanation
of why the technique has such a small temperature dependence is given. It is concluded that FS-DFPC-OR
constitutes a novel strategy that can be used for precise and accurate assessment of gas number density
and gas flows under a variety of conditions, in particular non-temperature stabilized ones.
