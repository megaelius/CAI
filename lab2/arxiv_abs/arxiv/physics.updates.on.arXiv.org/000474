Particulate flows have been largely studied under the simplifying assumptions of one-way coupling
regime where the disperse phase do not react-back on the carrier fluid. In the context of turbulent
flows, many non trivial phenomena such as small scales particles clustering or preferential spatial
accumulation have been explained and understood. A more complete view of multiphase flows can be
gained calling into play two-way coupling effects, i.e. by accounting for the inter-phase momentum
exchange between the carrier and the suspended phase, certainly relevant at increasing mass loading.
In such regime, partially investigated in the past by the so-called Particle In Cell (PIC) method,
much is still to be learned about the dynamics of the disperse phase and the ensuing alteration of
the carrier flow. In this paper we present a new methodology rigorously designed to capture the inter-phase
momentum exchange for particles smaller than the smallest hydrodynamical scale, e.g. the Kolmogorov
scale in a turbulent flow. In fact, the momentum coupling mechanism exploits the unsteady Stokes
flow around a small rigid sphere where the transient disturbance produced by each particle is evaluated
in a closed form. The particles are described as lumped, point masses which would lead to the appearance
of singularities. A rigorous regularization procedure is conceived to extract the physically
relevant interactions between particles and fluid which avoids any "ah hoc" assumption. The approach
is suited for high efficiency implementation on massively parallel machines since the transient
disturbance produced by the particles is strongly localized in space around the actual particle
position. As will be shown, hundred thousands particles can therefore be handled at an affordable
computational cost as demonstrated by a preliminary application to a particle laden turbulent
shear flow.
