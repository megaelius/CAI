For single source medical Computed Tomography (CT), both Filtered-Back Projection (FBP) and statistical
iterative reconstruction have been investigated. However for dual source CT with flying focal
spot (DS-FFS CT), iterative reconstruction techniques that accurately model the scanner geometry
and acquisition physics have remained unexplored. Therefore, our purpose is to present a novel
physics based iterative reconstruction method for DS-FFS CT and assess its image quality. To implement
it, our algorithm uses novel physics models to reconstruct from the native cone-beam geometry and
interleaved dual source helical trajectory of a DS-FFS CT. To do so, we construct a noise physics
model to represent data acquisition noise and a prior image model to represent image noise and texture.
In addition, we design forward geometry physics models to compute the locations for deflected focal
spots, the dimension and sensitivity for voxels and detector units, as well as the length of intersection
between X-rays and voxels. The forward geometry models further represent the coordinated movement
between the dual sources by computing their X-ray coverage gaps and overlaps at an arbitrary helical
pitch. With the above models, we reconstruct images by using an advanced Consensus Equilibrium
(CE) numerical method to compute the maximum a posteriori estimate to a joint optimization problem
that simultaneously fits all models.Experiments show that by modeling a precise geometry and avoiding
data rebinning, completion or interpolation, our physics based reconstruction achieves a higher
spatial resolution and much fewer image artifacts with smaller magnitude than both FBP and Penalized
Weighted Least Squares (PWLS).
