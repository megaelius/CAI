Measurements of root-zone soil moisture across spatial scales of tens to thousands of meters have
been a challenge for many decades. The mobile application of Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS)
is a promising approach to measure field soil moisture non-invasively by surveying large regions
with a ground-based vehicle. Recently, concerns have been raised about a potentially biasing influence
of local structures and roads. We employed neutron transport simulations and dedicated experiments
to quantify the influence of different road types on the CRNS measurement. We found that the presence
of roads introduces a bias in the CRNS estimation of field soil moisture compared to non-road scenarios.
However, this effect becomes insignificant at distances beyond a few meters from the road. Measurements
from the road could overestimate the field value by up to 40 % depending on road material, width, and
the surrounding field water content. The bias could be successfully removed with an analytical
correction function that accounts for these parameters. Additionally, an empirical approach
is proposed that can be used on-the-fly without prior knowledge of field soil moisture. Tests at
different study sites demonstrated good agreement between road-effect corrected measurements
and field soil moisture observations. However, if knowledge about the road characteristics is
missing, any measurements on the road could substantially reduce the accuracy of this method. Our
results constitute a practical advancement of the mobile CRNS methodology, which is important
for providing unbiased estimates of field-scale soil moisture to support applications in hydrology,
remote sensing, and agriculture.
