The adsorption of anions from aqueous solution on the air/water interface controls important heterogeneous
chemistry in the atmosphere and is thought to have similar physics to anion adsorption at hydrophobic
interfaces more generally. While much theoretical and experimental work over the last 20 years
has made clear that the adsorption of large, polarizable anions is thermodynamically favorable,
determining the role of polarizability in adsorption has proven surprisingly challenging. Simple
physical models make clear that nonpolarizable anions will not adsorb, but trends in adsorption
are difficult to rationalize based on polarizability and in some theoretical approaches adsorption
is observed without change in anion polarization. Because there are no experimental studies of
interfacial anion polarizability, one possible explanation of these results is that theoretical
descriptions suffer from systematic error. In this study we use interface specific nonlinear optical
spectroscopy to extract the spectral response of the interfacial ClO$_{4}^{-}$ anion. We find
that (i) the interfacial environment induces a break in symmetry of the anion due to its solvation
anisotropy (ii) the Raman depolarization ratio, a measure of the ratio of the change in two components
of ClO$_{4}^{-}$'s polarizability tensor with change in nuclear positions, is $>2\times$ larger
than its value in the adjoining bulk phase and interfacial concentration dependent and (iii) using
a simple theoretical description we find that our measured changes in depolarization ratio are
consistent with known changes in surface potential and tension with small changes in bulk ClO$_{4}^{-}$
concentration. The notion that interfacial anion polarizability differs from that in bulk, and
that this polarizability is coverage dependent, is not accounted for in any current theoretical
treatment of ions at the air/water interface.
