Restarting public buildings activities in the "second phase" of COVID-19 emergency should be supported
by operational measures to avoid a second virus spreading. Buildings hosting the continuous presence
of the same users and significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices, universities)
are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with infectors. Beside individual's risk-mitigation
strategies performed (facial masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e.
occupants' load limitation (towards "social distancing") and access control. Simulators could
support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an Agent-Based Model to estimate
the virus spreading in the closed built environment. The model adopts a probabilistic approach
to jointly simulate occupants' movement and virus transmission according to proximity-based
and exposure-time-based rules proposed by international health organizations. Scenarios can
be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies and virus-related aspects. The
model is calibrated on experimental data ("Diamond Princess" cruise) and then applied to a relevant
case-study (a part of a university campus). Results demonstrate the model capabilities. Concerning
the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to reduce virus spreading
in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable infected people's number. The building
capacity limitation could support such measure by potentially moving from FFPk masks to surgical
masks use by occupants (thus improving users' comfort issues). A preliminary model to combine acceptable
mask filters-occupants' density combination is proposed. The model could be modified to consider
other recurring scenarios in other public buildings (e.g. tourist facilities, cultural buildings).
