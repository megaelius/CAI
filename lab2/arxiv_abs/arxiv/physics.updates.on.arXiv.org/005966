Central exclusive processes can be studied in CMS by combining the information of the central detector
with the Precision Proton Spectrometer (PPS). PPS detectors, placed symmetrically at more than
200 m from the interaction point, can detect the scattered protons that survive the interaction.
PPS has taken data at high luminosity while fully integrated in the CMS experiment. The total amount
of collected data corresponds to more than 100 fb$^{-1}$ during the LHC Run 2. PPS consists of 3D silicon
tracking stations as well as timing detectors that measure both the position and direction of protons
and their time-of-flight with high precision. The detectors are hosted in special movable vacuum
chambers, the Roman Pots, which are placed in the primary vacuum of the LHC beam pipe. The sensors
reach a distance of few mm from the beam. Detectors have to operate in vacuum and must be able to sustain
highly non-uniform irradiation: sensors used in Run 2 have accumulated an integrated dose with
a local peak of $\sim 5 \cdot 10^{15}$ protons/cm$^2$. The timing system is made with high purity
scCVD diamond sensors. A new architecture with two diamond crystals read out in parallel by the same
electronic channel has been used to enhance the detector performance. In this paper, after a general
overview of the PPS detector, we describe the timing system in detail. The sensor and the dedicated
amplification chain are described, together with the signal digitization technique. Performance
of the detector in Run 2 is reported. Recently the sensors used in Run 2 have been tested for efficiency
and timing performance in a dedicated test beam at DESY. Preliminary results on radiation damage
are reported. Important upgrades of the timing system are ongoing for the LHC Run 3, with the goal
of reaching an ultimate timing resolution better than 30 ps; they are also discussed here.
