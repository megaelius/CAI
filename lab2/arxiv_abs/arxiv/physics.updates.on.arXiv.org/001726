The duration, type and structure of connections between individuals in real-world populations
play a crucial role in how diseases invade and spread. Here, we incorporate the aforementioned heterogeneities
into a model by considering a dual-layer static-dynamic multiplex network. The static network
layer affords tunable clustering and describes an individual's permanent community structure.
The dynamic network layer describes the transient connections an individual makes with members
of the wider population by imposing constant edge rewiring. We follow the edge-based compartmental
modelling approach to derive equations describing the evolution of a susceptible - infected - recovered
(SIR) epidemic spreading through this multiplex network of individuals. We derive the basic reproduction
number, measuring the expected number of new infectious cases caused by a single infectious individual
in an otherwise susceptible population. We validate model equations by showing convergence to
pre-existing edge-based compartmental model equations in limiting cases and by comparison with
stochastically simulated epidemics. We explore the effects of altering model parameters and multiplex
network attributes on resultant epidemic dynamics. We validate the basic reproduction number
by plotting its value against associated final epidemic sizes measured from simulation and predicted
by model equations for a number of setups. Further, we explore the effect of varying individual model
parameters on the basic reproduction number. We conclude with a discussion of the significance
and interpretation of the model and its relation to existing research literature. We highlight
intrinsic limitations and potential extensions of the present model and outline future research
considerations, both experimental and theoretical.
