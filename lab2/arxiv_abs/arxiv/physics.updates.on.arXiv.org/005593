We present observations of oscillations in the shape of the temperature profile of the large-scale
circulation (LSC) of turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection. Temperature measurements are
broken down into Fourier moments as a function of $\theta-\theta_0$, where $\theta$ is the azimuthal
angle in a horizontal plane at mid-height, and $\theta_0$ is the LSC orientation. The oscillation
structure is dominated by a 3rd order sine moment and 3rd order cosine moment in a cubic cell. In contrast,
these moments are not found to oscillate in a cylindrical cell. This geometry-dependent behavior
can be explained by a model that assumes that the heat transported by the LSC is conducted from the
thermal boundary layers, and is proportional to pathlength of the LSC along boundary layers at the
top and bottom plates. In a non-circular cross-section cell, oscillations of the LSC orientation
$\theta_0$ result in an oscillation in the container shape in the reference frame of the LSC, resulting
in an oscillation in the pathlength of the LSC at a given $\theta-\theta_0$. In a square-cross-section
cell, this model predicts the dominant 3rd order sine moment and 3rd order cosine moment with magnitudes
within 50\% of measured values, when using the amplitude of the oscillation of $\theta_0$ as input.
A cylindrical cell is special in that the pathlength is independent of $\theta_0$, and so these oscillating
moments are not induced. In a cylindrical cell, the model reproduces the sinusoidal mean temperature
profile with a sloshing oscillation dominated by the 2nd order sine moment, consistent with previous
observations in that geometry.
