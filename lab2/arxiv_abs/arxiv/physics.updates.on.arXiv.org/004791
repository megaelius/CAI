We determine how prediction methods combine with optimization methods in two-stage knowledge-based
planning (KBP) pipelines to produce radiation therapy treatment plans. We trained two dose prediction
methods, a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a random forest (RF) with the same 130 treatment
plans. The models were applied to 87 out-of-sample patients to create two sets of predicted dose
distributions that were used as input to two optimization models. The first optimization model,
inverse planning (IP), estimates weights for dose-objectives from a predicted dose distribution
and generates new plans using conventional inverse planning. The second optimization model, dose
mimicking (DM), minimizes the sum of one-sided quadratic penalties between the predictions and
the generated plans using several dose-objectives. Altogether, four KBP pipelines (GAN-IP, GAN-DM,
RF-IP, and RF-DM) were constructed and benchmarked against the corresponding clinical plans using
clinical criteria; the error of both prediction methods was also evaluated. The best performing
plans were GAN-IP plans, which satisfied the same criteria as their corresponding clinical plans
(78%) more often than any other KBP pipeline. However, GAN did not necessarily provide the best prediction
for the second-stage optimization models. Specifically, both the RF-IP and RF-DM plans satisfied
all clinical criteria 25% and 15% more often than GAN-DM plans (the worst performing planning),
respectively. GAN predictions also had a higher mean absolute error (3.9 Gy) than those from RF (3.6
Gy). We find that state-of-the-art prediction methods when paired with different optimization
algorithms, produce treatment plans with considerable variation in quality.
