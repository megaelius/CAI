We present a technique for continuous generation of volumetric images during SBRT using periodic
kV imaging and an external respiratory surrogate signal to drive a patient-specific PCA motion
model. Using the on-board imager, kV radiographs are acquired every 3 seconds and used to fit the
parameters of a motion model so that it matches observed changes in internal patient anatomy. A multi-dimensional
correlation model is established between the motion model parameters and the external surrogate
position and velocity, enabling volumetric image reconstruction between kV imaging time points.
Performance of the algorithm was evaluated using 10 realistic eXtended CArdiac-Torso (XCAT) digital
phantoms including 3D anatomical respiratory deformation programmed with 3D tumor positions
measured with orthogonal kV imaging of implanted fiducial gold markers. The clinically measured
ground truth 3D tumor positions provided a dataset with realistic breathing irregularities, and
the combination of periodic on-board kV imaging with recorded external respiratory surrogate
signal was used for correlation modeling to account for any changes in internal-external correlation.
The three-dimensional tumor positions are reconstructed with an average root mean square error
(RMSE) of 1.47 mm, and an average 95th percentile 3D positional error of 2.80 mm compared with the
clinically measured ground truth 3D tumor positions. This technique enables continuous 3D anatomical
image generation based on periodic kV imaging of internal anatomy without the additional dose of
continuous kV imaging. The 3D anatomical images produced using this method can be used for treatment
verification and delivered dose computation in the presence of irregular respiratory motion.
