These lecture notes were presented by Allan N. Kaufman in his graduate plasma theory course and a
follow-on special topics course (Physics 242A, B, C and Physics 250 at the University of California
Berkeley). The notes follow the order of the lectures. The equations and derivations are as Kaufman
presented, but the text is a reconstruction of Kaufman's discussion and commentary. The notes were
transcribed by Bruce I. Cohen in 1971 and 1972, and word-processed, edited, and illustrations added
by Cohen in 2017 and 2018. The series of lectures are divided into four major parts: (1) collisionless
Vlasov plasmas (linear theory of waves and instabilities with and without an applied magnetic field,
Vlasov-Poisson and Vlasov-Maxwell systems, WKBJ eikonal theory of wave propagation); (2) nonlinear
Vlasov plasmas and miscellaneous topics (the plasma dispersion function, singular solutions
of the Vlasov-Poisson system, pulse-response solutions for initial-value problems, Gardiner's
stability theorem, gyroresonant effects, nonlinear waves, particle trapping in waves, quasi-linear
theory, nonlinear three-wave interactions); (3) plasma collisional and discreteness phenomena
(test-particle theory of dynamic friction and wave emission, classical resistivity, extension
of test-particle theory to many-particle phenomena and the derivation of the Boltzmann and Lenard-Balescu
equations, the Fokker-Planck collision operator, a general scattering theory, nonlinear Landau
damping, radiation transport, and Dupree's theory of clumps); (4) nonuniform plasmas (adiabatic
invariance, guiding center drifts, hydromagnetic theory, introduction to drift-wave stability
theory).
