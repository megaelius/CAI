We discuss effects of pairwise aligning interactions in an ensemble of central place foragers or
of searchers that are connected to a common home. In a wider sense, we also consider self moving entities
that are attracted to a central place such as, for instance, the zooplankton Daphnia being attracted
to a beam of light. Single foragers move with constant speed due to some propulsive mechanism. They
explore at random loops the space around and return rhytmically to their home. In the ensemble, the
direction of the velocity of a searcher is aligned to the motion of its neighbors. At first, we perform
simulations of this ensemble and find a cooperative behavior of the entities. Above an over-critical
interaction strength the trajectories of the searcher qualitatively changes and searchers start
to move along circles around the home position. Thereby, all searchers rotate either clockwise
or anticlockwise around the central home position as it was reported for the zooplankton Daphnia.
At second, the computational findings are analytically explained by the formulation of transport
equations outgoing from the nonlinear mean field Fokker-Planck equation of the considered situation.
In the asymptotic stationary limit, we find expressions for the critical interaction strength,
the mean radial and orbital velocities of the searchers and their velocity variances. We also obtain
the marginal spatial and angular densities in the under-critical regime where the foragers behave
like individuals as well as in the over-critical regime where they rotate collectively around the
considered home. We additionally elaborate the overdamped Smoluchowski-limit for the ensemble.
