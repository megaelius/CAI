Purpose: To develop a fast magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method for quantitative chemical
exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging. Methods: We implemented a CEST-MRF method to quantify
the chemical exchange rate and volume fraction of the N{\alpha}-amine protons of L-arginine (L-Arg)
phantoms and the amide and semi-solid exchangeable protons of in vivo rat brain tissue. L-Arg phantoms
were made with different concentrations (25-100 mM) and pH (pH 4-6). The MRF acquisition schedule
varied the saturation power randomly for 30 iterations (phantom: 0-6 {\mu}T; in vivo: 0-4 {\mu}T)
with a total acquisition time of <=2 minutes. The signal trajectories were pattern-matched to a
large dictionary of signal trajectories simulated using the Bloch-McConnell equations for different
combinations of exchange rate, exchangeable proton volume fraction, and water T1 and T2* relaxation
times. Results: The chemical exchange rates of the N{\alpha}-amine protons of L-Arg were significantly
(p<0.0001) correlated with the rates measured with the Quantitation of Exchange using Saturation
Power method. Similarly, the L-Arg concentrations determined using MRF were significantly (p<0.0001)
correlated with the known concentrations. The pH dependence of the exchange rate was well fit (R2=0.9186)
by a base catalyzed exchange model. The amide proton exchange rate measured in rat brain cortex (36.3+-12.9
Hz) was in good agreement with that measured previously with the Water Exchange spectroscopy method
(28.6+-7.4 Hz). The semi-solid proton volume fraction was elevated in white (11.2+-1.7%) compared
to gray (7.6+-1.8%) matter brain regions in agreement with previous magnetization transfer studies.
Conclusion: CEST-MRF provides a method for fast, quantitative CEST imaging.
