We apply an empirical, data-driven approach for describing crop yield as a function of monthly temperature
and precipitation by employing generative probabilistic models with parameters determined through
Bayesian inference. Our approach is applied to state-scale maize yield and meteorological data
for the US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2014 as an exemplar, but would be readily transferable to other crops,
locations and spatial scales. Experimentation with a number of models shows that maize growth rates
can be characterised by a two-dimensional Gaussian function of temperature and precipitation
with monthly contributions accumulated over the growing period. This approach accounts for non-linear
growth responses to the individual meteorological variables, and allows for interactions between
them. Our models correctly identify that temperature and precipitation have the largest impact
on yield in the six months prior to the harvest, in agreement with the typical growing season for US
maize (April to September). Maximal growth rates occur for monthly mean temperature 18-19$^\circ$C,
corresponding to a daily maximum temperature of 24-25$^\circ$C (in broad agreement with previous
work) and monthly total precipitation 115 mm. Our approach also provides a self-consistent way
of investigating climate change impacts on current US maize varieties in the absence of adaptation
measures. Keeping precipitation and growing area fixed, a temperature increase of $2^\circ$C,
relative to 1981-2014, results in the mean yield decreasing by 8\%, while the yield variance increases
by a factor of around 3. We thus provide a flexible, data-driven framework for exploring the impacts
of natural climate variability and climate change on globally significant crops based on their
observed behaviour. In concert with other approaches, this can help inform the development of adaptation
strategies that will ensure food security under a changing climate.
