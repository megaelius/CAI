Large-scale motions, also known as superstructures, are dynamically relevant coherent structures
in a wall-bounded turbulent flow, that span the entire domain in wall-normal direction and significantly
contribute to the global energy and momentum transport. Recent investigations in channel and Couette
flow, suggest that these large-scale motions are self-sustained, implying they are not driven
by small-scale motions at the wall. Whether large-scale motions are self-sustained has however
not yet been answered for open boundary layers, which are relevant for many applications. Here,
using the asymptotic suction boundary layer flow at the friction Reynolds number $Re_\tau = 1\,168$
as a testbed, we show that large-scale motions are self-sustained also in boundary layers. Together
with the previous investigations in confined flows, this observation provides strong evidence
of the robust and general nature of coherent self-sustained processes in turbulent wall-bounded
flows. The dynamics of the large-scale self-sustained process involving the growth, breakdown
and regeneration of quasi-streamwise coherent streaks and vortices within the boundary layer
shows temporal phase relations reminiscent of bursting as observed in buffer layer structures.
The dynamics however differs from the quasi-periodic large-scale streak-vortex regeneration
cycle observed in confined flows. Based on the similarity of the dynamics of large-scale motions
in boundary layers and of small-scale buffer layer structures, we conjecture that the bursting
behaviour is associated with the dynamical relevance of only one wall, while two confining walls
lead to the quasi-periodic cycle.
