This article is based on the Planckon densely piled vacuum model and the principle of cosmology.
With Planck era as initial conditions and including early inflation, we have solved the Einstein-Friedmann
equations to describe the evolution of the universe, a reasonable relation between dark energy
density and vacuum quantum fluctuation energy density is obtained. The main results are : 1) the
solution of Einstein-Friedmann equations has yielded the result $\frac{{{\rho}_{de}}}{{{\rho}_{vac}}}\sim{{(\frac{{{t}_{P}}}{{{T}_{0}}})}^{2}}\sim{{10}^{-122}}
$ (Planck time ${{t}_{P}}={{10}^{-43}}s$ and universe age ${{T}_{0}}={{10}^{18}}s$);2) at
inflation time ${{t}_{\inf}}={{10}^{-35}}s$, the calculated universe radiation energy density
is $\rho ({{t}_{\inf}})\sim{{10}^{-16}}{{\rho}_{vac}}$ and the corresponding temperature
is ${{E}_{c}}\sim{{10}^{15}}GeV$ consistent with GUT phase transition temperature;3) it is
showed that the expanding universe is a non-equilibrium open system constantly exchanging energy
with vacuum; during its expanding, the Planckons in universe lose quantum fluctuation energy and
create cosmic expansion quanta-cosmons, the energy of cosmons is the lost part of vacuum quantum
fluctuation energy and contributes to the total energy of the universe with the calculated value
${{E}_{\cos mos}}={{10}^{22}}{{M}_{\otimes}}{{c}^{2}}$ (${{M}_{\otimes}}$ is solar mass)
agreed with astronomic data; 4) the gravity potential and gravity acceleration of cosmons are derived
with the nature of repulsive force, indicating that the cosmon may be the candidate of dark energy
quantum; 5) solution to three well known cosmic problems of Big Bang model is presented.
