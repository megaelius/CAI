Observations suggest that the large-scale convective velocities obtained by solar convection
simulations might be over-estimated (convective conundrum). One plausible solution to this could
be the small-scale dynamo which cannot be fully resolved by global simulations. The small-scale
Lorentz force suppresses the convective motions and also the turbulent mixing of entropy between
upflows and downflows, leading to a large effective Prandtl number ($\Pr$). We explore this idea
in three-dimensional global rotating convection simulations at different thermal conductivity
($\kappa$), i.e., at different $\Pr$. In agreement with previous non-rotating simulations, the
convective velocity is reduced with the increase of $\Pr$ as long as the thermal conductive flux
is negligible. A subadiabatic layer is formed near the base of the convection zone due to continuous
deposition of low entropy plumes in low-$\kappa$ simulations. The most interesting result of our
low-$\kappa$ simulations is that the convective motions are accompanied by a change in the convection
structure that is increasingly influenced by small-scale plumes. These plumes tend to transport
angular momentum radially inward and thus establish an anti-solar differential rotation, in striking
contrast to the solar rotation profile. If such low diffusive plumes, driven by the radiative-surface
cooling, are present in the Sun, then our results cast doubt on the idea that a high effective $\Pr$
may be a viable solution to the solar convective conundrum. Our study also emphasizes that any resolution
of the conundrum that relies on the downward plumes must take into account angular momentum transport
as well as heat transport.
