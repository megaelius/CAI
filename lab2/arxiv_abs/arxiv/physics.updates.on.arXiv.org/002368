The two most fundamental processes describing change in biology -development and evolution- occur
over drastically different timescales, difficult to reconcile within a unified framework. Development
involves a temporal sequence of cell states controlled by a hierarchy of regulatory structures.
It occurs over the lifetime of a single individual, and is associated to the gene expression level
change of a given genotype. Evolution, by contrast entails genotypic change through the acquisition
or loss of genes, and involves the emergence of new, environmentally selected phenotypes over the
lifetimes of many individ- uals. Here we present a model of regulatory network evolution that accounts
for both timescales. We extend the framework of boolean models of gene regulatory network (GRN)-currently
only applicable to describing development-to include evolutionary processes. As opposed to one-to-one
maps to specific attractors, we identify the phenotypes of the cells as the relevant macrostates
of the GRN. A pheno- type may now correspond to multiple attractors, and its formal definition no
longer require a fixed size for the genotype. This opens the possibility for a quantitative study
of the phenotypic change of a genotype, which is itself changing over evolutionary timescales.
We show how the realization of specific phenotypes can be controlled by gene duplication events,
and how successive events of gene duplication lead to new regulatory structures via selection.
It is these structures that enable control of macroscale patterning, as in development. The proposed
framework therefore provides a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of regulatory structures
controlling development over evolutionary time.
