The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, an evolutionarily conserved
motif present in all eukaryotic cells, is involved in coordinating critical cell-fate decisions,
regulating protein synthesis, and mediating learning and memory. While the steady-state behavior
of the pathway stimulated by a time-invariant signal is relatively well-understood, we show using
a computational model that it exhibits a rich repertoire of transient adaptive responses to changes
in stimuli. When the signal is switched on, the response is characterized by long-lived modulations
in frequency as well as amplitude. On withdrawing the stimulus, the activity decays over timescales
much longer than that of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes, exhibiting reverberations
characterized by repeated spiking in the activated MAPK concentration. The long-term persistence
of such post-stimulus activity suggests that the cascade retains memory of the signal for a significant
duration following its removal, even in the absence of any explicit feedback or cross-talk with
other pathways. We find that the molecular mechanism underlying this behavior is related to the
existence of distinct relaxation rates for the different cascade components. This results in the
imbalance of fluxes between different layers of the cascade, with the repeated reuse of activated
kinases as enzymes when they are released from sequestration in complexes leading to one or more
spike events following the removal of the stimulus. The persistent adaptive response reported
here, indicative of a cellular "short-term" memory, suggests that this ubiquitous signaling pathway
plays an even more central role in information processing by eukaryotic cells.
