Routine applications of electronic structure theory to molecules and periodic systems need to
compute the electron density from given Hamiltonian and, in case of non-orthogonal basis sets,
overlap matrices. System sizes can range from few to thousands or, in some examples, millions of
atoms. Different discretization schemes (basis sets) and different system geometries (finite
non-periodic vs. infinite periodic boundary conditions) yield matrices with different structures.
The ELectronic Structure Infrastructure (ELSI) project provides an open-source software interface
to facilitate the implementation and optimal use of high-performance solver libraries covering
cubic scaling eigensolvers, linear scaling density-matrix-based algorithms, and other reduced
scaling methods in between. In this paper, we present recent improvements and developments inside
ELSI, mainly covering (1) new solvers connected to the interface, (2) matrix layout and communication
adapted for parallel calculations of periodic and/or spin-polarized systems, (3) routines for
density matrix extrapolation in geometry optimization and molecular dynamics calculations,
and (4) general utilities such as parallel matrix I/O and JSON output. The ELSI interface has been
integrated into four electronic structure code projects (DFTB+, DGDFT, FHI-aims, SIESTA), allowing
us to rigorously benchmark the performance of the solvers on an equal footing. Based on results of
a systematic set of large-scale benchmarks performed with Kohn-Sham density-functional theory
and density-functional tight-binding theory, we identify factors that strongly affect the efficiency
of the solvers, and propose a decision layer that assists with the solver selection process. Finally,
we describe a reverse communication interface encoding matrix-free iterative solver strategies
that are amenable, e.g., for use with planewave basis sets.
