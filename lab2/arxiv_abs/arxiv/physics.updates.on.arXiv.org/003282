Solar wind charge-changing reactions are of paramount importance to the physico-chemistry of
the atmosphere of a comet, mass-loading the solar wind through an effective conversion of fast light
solar wind ions into slow heavy cometary ions. To understand these processes and place them in the
context of a solar wind plasma interacting with a neutral atmosphere, numerical or analytical models
are necessary. Inputs of these models, such as collision cross sections and chemistry, are crucial.
Book-keeping and fitting of experimentally measured charge-changing and ionization cross sections
of hydrogen and helium particles in a water gas are discussed, with emphasis on the low-energy/low-velocity
range that is characteristic of solar wind bulk speeds ($< 20$ keV u$^{-1}$/$2000$ km s$^{-1}$).
We provide polynomial fits for cross sections of charge-changing and ionization reactions, and
list the experimental needs for future studies. We calculated Maxwellian-averaged cross sections
and fitted them with bivariate polynomials for solar wind temperatures ranging from $10^5$ to $10^6$
K ($12-130$ eV). Single- and double-electron captures by He$^{2+}$ dominate at typical solar wind
speeds. Correspondingly, single-electron capture by H$^+$ and single-electron loss by H$^-$
dominate at these speeds, resulting in the production of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). Ionization
cross sections all peak at energies above $20$ keV and are expected to play a moderate role in the total
ion production. The effect of solar wind Maxwellian temperatures is found to be maximum for cross
sections peaking at higher energies, suggesting that local heating at shock structures in cometary
and planetary environments may favor processes previously thought to be negligible.
