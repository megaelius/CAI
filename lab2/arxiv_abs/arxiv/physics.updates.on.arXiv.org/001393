Symplectic integrators offer many advantages for the numerical solution of Hamiltonian differential
equations, including bounded energy error and the preservation of invariant sets. Two of the central
Hamiltonian systems encountered in plasma physics --- the flow of magnetic field lines and the guiding
center motion of magnetized charged particles --- resist symplectic integration by conventional
means because the dynamics are most naturally formulated in non-canonical coordinates, i.e.,
coordinates lacking the familiar $(q, p)$ partitioning. Recent efforts made progress toward non-canonical
symplectic integration of these systems by appealing to the variational integration framework;
however, those integrators were multistep methods and later found to be numerically unstable due
to parasitic mode instabilities. This work eliminates the multistep character and, therefore,
the parasitic mode instabilities via an adaptation of the variational integration formalism that
we deem ``degenerate variational integration''. Both the magnetic field line and guiding center
Lagrangians are degenerate in the sense that their resultant Euler-Lagrange equations are systems
of first-order ODEs. We show that retaining the same degree of degeneracy when constructing a discrete
Lagrangian yields one-step variational integrators preserving a non-canonical symplectic structure
on the original Hamiltonian phase space. The advantages of the new algorithms are demonstrated
via numerical examples, demonstrating superior stability compared to existing variational integrators
for these systems and superior qualitative behavior compared to non-conservative algorithms.
