Heart is an electrically-connected network. Spiral wave dynamics of cardiac fibrillation shows
chaotic and disintegrated patterns while sinus rhythm shows synchronized excitation patterns.
To determine functional interactions between cardiomyocytes during complex fibrillation states,
we applied a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM) to the sequential electrical activity maps acquired
from the 2D computational simulation of human atrial fibrillation. Then, we constructed energy
landscape and estimated hierarchical structure among the different local minima (attractors)
to explain the dynamic properties of cardiac fibrillation. Four types of the wave dynamics were
considered: sinus rhythm; single stable rotor; single rotor with wavebreak; and multiple wavelet.
The MEM could describe all types of wave dynamics (both accuracy and reliability>0.9) except the
multiple random wavelet. Both of the sinus rhythm and the single stable rotor showed relatively
high pairwise interaction coefficients among the cardiomyocytes. Also, the local energy minima
had relatively large basins and high energy barrier, showing stable attractor properties. However,
in the single rotor with wavebreak, there were relatively low pairwise interaction coefficients
and a similar number of the local minima separated by a relatively low energy barrier compared with
the single stable rotor case. The energy landscape of the multiple wavelet consisted of a large number
of the local minima separated by a relatively low energy barrier, showing unstable dynamics. These
results indicate that the MEM provides information about local and global coherence among the cardiomyocytes
beyond the simple structural connectivity. Energy landscape analysis can explain stability and
transitional properties of complex dynamics of cardiac fibrillation, which might be determined
by the presence of 'driver' such as sinus node or rotor.
