Geochemically discriminating between magmatism in different tectonic settings remains a fundamental
part of understanding the processes of magma generation within the Earth's mantle. Here, we present
an approach where machine-learning (ML) methods are used for quantitative tectonic discrimination
and feature selection using global geochemical datasets containing data for volcanic rocks generated
in eight different tectonic settings. This study uses support vector machine, random forest, and
sparse multinomial regression (SMR) approaches. All these ML methods with data for 20 elements
and 5 isotopic ratios allowed the successful geochemical discrimination between igneous rocks
formed in eight different tectonic settings with a discriminant ratio better than 83% for all settings
barring oceanic plateaus and back-arc basins. SMR is a particularly powerful and interpretable
ML method because it quantitatively identifies geochemical signatures that characterize the
tectonic settings of interest and the characteristics of each sample as a probability of the membership
of the sample for each setting. We also present the most representative basalt composition for each
tectonic setting. The new data provide reference points for future geochemical discussions. Our
results indicate that at least 17 elements and isotopic ratios are required to characterize each
tectonic setting, suggesting that geochemical tectonic discrimination cannot be achieved using
only a small number of elemental compositions and/or isotopic ratios. The results show that volcanic
rocks formed in different tectonic settings have unique geochemical signatures, indicating that
both volcanic rock geochemistry and magma generation processes are closely connected to the tectonic
setting.
