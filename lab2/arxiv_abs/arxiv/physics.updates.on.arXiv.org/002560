In this paper we present the two-level homogenization of the flow in a deformable double-porous
structure described at two characteristic scales. The higher level porosity associated with the
mesoscopic structure is constituted by channels in a matrix made of a microporous material consisting
of elastic skeleton and pores saturated by a viscous fluid. The macroscopic model is derived by the
homogenization of the flow in the heterogeneous structure characterized by two small parameters
involved in the two-level asymptotic analysis, whereby a scaling ansatz is adopted to respect the
pore size differences. The first level upscaling of the fluid-structure interaction problem yields
a Biot continuum describing the mesoscopic matrix coupled with the Stokes flow in the channels.
The second step of the homogenization leads to a macroscopic model involving three equations for
displacements, the mesoscopic flow velocity and the micropore pressure. Due to interactions between
the two porosities, the macroscopic flow is governed by a Darcy-Brinkman model comprising two equations
which are coupled with the overall equilibrium equation respecting the hierarchical structure
of the two-phase medium. Expressions of the effective macroscopic parameters of the homogenized
double-porosity continuum are derived, depending on the characteristic responses of the mesoscopic
structure. Some symmetry and reciprocity relationships are shown and issues of boundary conditions
are discussed. The model has been implemented in the finite element code SfePy which is well-suited
for computational homogenization. A numerical example of solving a nonstationary problem using
mixed finite element method is included.
