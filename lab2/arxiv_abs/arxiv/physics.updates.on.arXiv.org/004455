We perform DNS of flow over finite-aspect-ratio NACA 0015 wings to characterize the tip effects
on the wake dynamics. This study focuses on the development of three-dimensional separated flow
over the wing, and discuss flow structures formed on the wing surface as well as in the far field wake.
Vorticity is introduced into the flow in a predominantly two-dimensional manner. The vortex sheet
from the wing tip rolls up around the free end to form the tip vortex. At its inception, the tip vortex
is weak and its effect is spatially confined. As the flow around the tip separates, the tip effects
extend farther in the spanwise direction, generating noticeable three dimensionality in the wake.
For low-aspect-ratio wings, the wake remains stable due to the strong downwash over the entire span.
Increasing the aspect ratio allows unsteady vortical flow to emerge away from the tip at sufficiently
high angles of attack. These unsteady vortices shed and form closed vortical loops. For higher-aspect-ratio
wings, the tip effects retard the near-tip shedding process, which desynchronizes from the two-dimensional
shedding over the mid-span region, yielding vortex dislocation. At high angles of attack, the tip
vortex exhibits noticeable undulations due to the strong interaction with the unsteady shedding
vortices. The spanwise distribution of force coefficients is related to the three-dimensional
wake dynamics and the tip effects. Vortical elements in the wake that are responsible for the generation
of lift and drag forces are identified through the force element analysis. We note that at high angles
of attack, a stationary vortical structure forms at the leading edge near the tip, giving rise to
locally high lift and drag forces. The analysis performed here reveals how the vortical flow around
the tip influences the separation physics, the global wake dynamics, and the spanwise force distributions.
