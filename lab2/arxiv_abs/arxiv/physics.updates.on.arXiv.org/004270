The pseudopotential multiphase lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is a popular model in the LB community
for simulating multiphase flows. When the multiphase modeling involves a solid boundary, a numerical
scheme is required to simulate the contact angle at the solid boundary. In this work, we aim at investigating
the implementation of contact angles in the pseudopotential LB simulations with curved boundaries.
In the pseudopotential LB model, the contact angle is usually realized by employing a solid-fluid
interaction or specifying a constant virtual wall density. However, it is shown that the solid-fluid
interaction scheme yields very large spurious currents in the simulations involving curved boundaries,
while the virtual-density scheme produces an unphysical thick mass-transfer layer near the solid
boundary although it gives much smaller spurious currents. We also extend the geometric-formulation
scheme in the phase-field method to the pseudopotential LB model. Nevertheless, in comparison
with the solid-fluid interaction scheme and the virtual-density scheme, the geometric-formulation
scheme is relatively difficult to implement for curved boundaries and cannot be directly applied
to three-dimensional space. By analyzing the features of the three schemes, we propose a modified
virtual-density scheme to implement contact angles in the pseudopotential LB simulations with
curved boundaries, which does not suffer from a thick mass-transfer layer near the solid boundary
and retains the advantages of the original virtual-density scheme, i.e., simplicity, easiness
for implementation, and low spurious currents.
