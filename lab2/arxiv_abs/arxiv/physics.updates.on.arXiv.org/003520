A literature review of studies investigating the topography of nano-indents in ion-implanted
materials reveals seemingly inconsistent observations, with report of both pile-up and sink-in.
This may be due to the crystallographic orientation of the measured sample point, which is often
not considered when evaluating implantation-induced changes in the deformation response. Here
we explore the orientation dependence of spherical nano-indentation in pure and helium-implanted
tungsten, considering grains with <001>, <110> and <111> out-of-plane orientations. Atomic force
microscopy (AFM) of indents in unimplanted tungsten shows little orientation dependence. However,
in the implanted material a much larger, more localised pile-up is observed for <001> grains than
for <110> and <111> orientations. Based on the observations for <001> grains, we hypothesise that
a large initial hardening due to helium-induced defects is followed by localised defect removal
and subsequent strain softening. A crystal plasticity finite element model of the indentation
process, formulated based on this hypothesis, accurately reproduces the experimentally-observed
orientation-dependence of indent morphology. The results suggest that the mechanism governing
the interaction of helium-induced defects with glide dislocations is orientation independent.
Rather, differences in pile-up morphology are due to the relative orientations of the crystal slip
systems, sample surface and spherical indenter. This highlights the importance of accounting
for crystallographic orientation when probing the deformation behaviour of ion-implanted materials
using nano-indentation.
