Assigning homogeneous boundary conditions, such as acoustic impedance, to the thermoviscous
wave equations (TWE) derived by transforming the linearized Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) to
the frequency domain yields a so-called Helmholtz solver, whose output is a discrete set of complex
eigenfunction and eigenvalue pairs. The proposed method--the inverse Helmholtz solver (iHS)--reverses
such procedure by returning the value of acoustic impedance at one or more unknown impedance boundaries
(IBs) of a given domain via spatial integration of the TWE for a given real-valued frequency with
assigned conditions on other boundaries. The iHS procedure is applied to a second-order spatial
discretization of the TWEs derived on an unstructured grid with staggered grid arrangement. The
momentum equation only is extended to the center of each IB face where pressure and velocity components
are co-located and treated as unknowns. One closure condition considered for the iHS is the assignment
of the surface gradient of pressure phase over the IBs. The iHS procedure is carried out independently
for each frequency in order to return the complete broadband complex impedance distribution at
the IBs in any desired frequency range. The iHS approach is first validated against Rott$'$s theory
for both inviscid and viscous, rectangular and circular ducts where the solver's capability to
return the value of tangential impedance is also assessed. The impedance of a geometrically complex
toy porous cavity is then reconstructed and verified against companion full compressible unstructured
Navier-Stokes simulations resolving the cavity geometry and one-dimensional impedance test
tube calculations based on time-domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC). The iHS methodology
is also shown to capture thermoacoustic effects, with reconstructed impedance values quantitatively
in agreement with thermoacoustic growth rates.
