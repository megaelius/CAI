Rock-paper-scissors games metaphorically model cyclic dominance in ecology and microbiology.
In a static environment, these models are characterized by fixation probabilities obeying two
different "laws" in large and small well-mixed populations. Here, we investigate the evolution
of these three-species models subject to a randomly switching carrying capacity modeling the endless
change between states of resources scarcity and abundance. Focusing mainly on the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors
game, equivalent to the cyclic Lotka-Volterra model, we study how the ${\it coupling}$ of demographic
and environmental noise influences the fixation properties. More specifically, we investigate
which species is the most likely to prevail in a population of fluctuating size and how the outcome
depends on the environmental variability. We show that demographic noise coupled with environmental
randomness "levels the field" of cyclic competition by balancing the effect of selection. In particular,
we show that fast switching effectively reduces the selection intensity proportionally to the
variance of the carrying capacity. We determine the conditions under which new fixation scenarios
arise, where the most likely species to prevail changes with the rate of switching and the variance
of the carrying capacity. Random switching has a limited effect on the mean fixation time that scales
linearly with the average population size. Hence, environmental randomness makes the cyclic competition
more egalitarian, but does not prolong the species coexistence. We also show how the fixation probabilities
of close-to-zero-sum rock-paper-scissors games can be obtained from those of the zero-sum model
by rescaling the selection intensity.
