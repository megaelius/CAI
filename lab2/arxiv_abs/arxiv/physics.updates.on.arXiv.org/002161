We demonstrate that the distribution of betweenness centrality (BC), a global structural metric
based on network flow, is an invariant quantity in most planar graphs. We confirm this invariance
through an empirical analysis of street networks from 97 of the most populous cities worldwide,
at scales significantly larger than previous studies. We also find that the BC distribution is robust
to major alterations in the network, including significant changes to its topology and edge weight
structure, indicating that the only relevant factors shaping the distribution are the number of
nodes and edges as well as the constraint of planarity. Through simulations of random planar graph
models and analytical calculations on Cayley trees, this invariance is demonstrated to be a consequence
of a bimodal regime consisting of an underlying tree structure for high BC nodes, and a low BC regime
arising from the presence of loops providing local path alternatives. Furthermore, the high BC
nodes display a non-trivial spatial dependence, with increasing spatial correlation as a function
of the number of edges, leading them to cluster around the barycenter at large densities. Our results
suggest that the spatial distribution of the BC is a more accurate discriminator when comparing
patterns across cities. Moreover, the BC being a static predictor of congestion in planar graphs,
the observed invariance and spatial dependence has practical implications for infrastructural
and biological networks. In particular, for the case of street networks, as long as planarity is
conserved, bottlenecks continue to persist, and the effect of planned interventions to alleviate
structural congestion will be limited primarily to load redistribution, a feature confirmed by
analyzing 200 years of data for central Paris.
