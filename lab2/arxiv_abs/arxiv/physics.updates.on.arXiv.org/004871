Calibration is one area in measurement where our country is still in the process of improvement.
The absence of confirmed approaches and actions for identifying the features of calibration baths
by numerous laboratories disallowed them to assess more the finest measurement ability and develop
their accurateness. In recent advances in technology, there is now a way of providing the best measurement
capability in temperature calibration by providing validated methods in characterizing calibration
baths that contributes to the uncertainty of measurement of the calibrated thermometer and is therefore
important to measure the extent of its contribution to the final uncertainty. This study adapted
the process from obtainable and current methods. Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT-Isotech)
and Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer (SPRT-Hart) which are interfaced to Precision Digital
Multimeters were used for measurements. Quite a few measurements were made at varying time durations
implemented on several known positions in an orderly measurement form which enclosed the whole
workspace. The uniformities and stabilities of the calibration bath were computed by getting the
range of the Minimum Difference with the Maximum Difference taken at every established temperature
point. Outcomes of measurements exhibited that the calibration bath stability at every temperature
setting are steadier at lesser temperatures and have a tendency to rise as the temperature approaches
250oC. The liquid bath was further unvarying at lesser temperatures. The variances found were insignificantly
distributed since the Standard Deviation ranged only from 0.005 to 0.013.
