Head motion is inevitable in the acquisition of diffusion-weighted images, especially for certain
motion-prone subjects and for data gathering of advanced diffusion models with prolonged scan
times. Deficient accuracy of motion correction cause deterioration in the quality of diffusion
model reconstruction, thus affecting the derived measures. This results in either loss of data,
or introducing bias in outcomes from data of different motion levels, or both. Hence minimizing
motion effects and reutilizing motion-contaminated data becomes vital to quantitative studies.
We have previously developed a 3-dimensional hierarchical convolution neural network (3D H-CNN)
for robust diffusion kurtosis mapping from under-sampled data. In this study, we propose to extend
this method to motion-contaminated data for robust recovery of diffusion model-derived measures
with a process of motion assessment and corrupted volume rejection. We validate the proposed pipeline
in two in-vivo datasets. Results from the first dataset of individual subjects show that all the
diffusion tensor and kurtosis tensor-derived measures from the new pipeline are minimally sensitive
to motion effects, and are comparable to the motion-free reference with as few as eight volumes retained
from the motion-contaminated data. Results from the second dataset of a group of children with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder demonstrate the ability of our approach in ameliorating spurious
group differences due to head motion. This method shows great potential for exploiting some valuable
but motion-corrupted DWI data which are likely to be discarded otherwise, and applying to data with
different motion level thus improving their utilization and statistic power.
