Astronomers have long tracked double stars in efforts to find those that are gravitationally-bound
binaries and then to determine their orbits. Early catalogues by the Herschels, Struves, and others
began with their own discoveries. In 1906 court reporter and amateur astronomer Sherburne Wesley
Burnham published a massive double star catalogue containing data from many observers on more than
13,000 systems. Lick Observatory astronomer Robert Grant Aitken produced a much larger catalogue
in 1932 and coordinated with Robert Innes of Johannesburg, who catalogued the southern systems.
Aitken maintained and expanded Burnham's records of observations on handwritten file cards, and
eventually turned them over to the Lick Observatory, where astrometrist Hamilton Jeffers further
expanded the collection and put all the observations on punched cards. With the aid of Frances M.
"Rete" Greeby he made two catalogues: an Index Catalogue with basic data about each star, and a complete
catalogue of observations, with one observation per punched card. He enlisted Willem van den Bos
of Johannesburg to add southern stars, and together they published the Index Catalogue of Visual
Double Stars, 1961.0. As Jeffers approached retirement he became greatly concerned about the disposition
of the catalogues. He wanted to be replaced by another "double star man," but Lick Director Albert
E. Whitford had the new 120-inch reflector, the world's second largest telescope, and he wanted
to pursue modern astrophysics instead. Jeffers was vociferously opposed to turning over the card
files to another institution, and especially against their coming under the control of Kaj Strand
of the United States Naval Observatory. The USNO got the files and has maintained the records ever
since, first under Charles Worley, and, since 1997, under Brian Mason. Now called the Washington
Double Star Catalog, it is online.
