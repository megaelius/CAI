In order to generate the valid numerical simulation model, the sufficient amount of gathered data
from the oil field is required. However, it is not always possible to acquire such data at the initial
stage of project development. Buckley and Leverett (1942) developed the analytical solution allowing
to assess the oil displacement efficiency. One of the main assumptions of this model is incompressibility
of oil and injected fluid. For slightly compressible water and oil such assumption is rational.
However, that is not always the case when the gas is injected. This research aims to identify the conditions
at which the usage of the incompressible gas model is appropriate. Likewise, the cases when the model
of compressible gas is required are also evaluated. To accomplish the goals of this research, the
comparative analysis between the injection of compressible and incompressible gases was undertaken
using the numerical solution of the correspondent reservoir engineering problem. The validation
of the numerical model was undertaken showing that it matches the analytical Buckley-Leverett
solution. The findings of this research indicate that the relative and absolute density change
with the pressure of the injected gas has the profound impact on the convergence between two models
under consideration. With the increase in the injection pressure, the discrepancy between the
models of compressible and incompressible gas raises for all the considered injection fluids (CO2,
CH4 and N2). Due to a steep slope of 'density-pressure' curve for CO2 at low initial reservoir pressure,
the incompressible model cannot accurately predict the oil displacement efficiency by this gas
at any reasonable injection pressure. All 1D results are also representative for 2D simulation.
However, the mismatch between two models increases considerably for 2D simulation scenarios.
