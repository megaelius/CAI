During the first years of life, the human brain undergoes dynamic spatially-heterogeneous changes,
involving differentiation of neuronal types, dendritic arborization, axonal ingrowth, outgrowth
and retraction, synaptogenesis and myelination. To better quantify these changes, this article
presents a method for probing tissue microarchitecture by characterizing water diffusion in a
spectrum of length scales, factoring out the effects of intra-voxel orientation heterogeneity.
Our method is based on the spherical means of the diffusion signal, computed over gradient directions
for a fixed set of diffusion weightings (i.e., b-values). We decompose the spherical mean series
at each voxel into a spherical mean spectrum (SMS), which essentially encodes the fractions of spin
packets undergoing fine- to coarse-scale diffusion processes, characterizing hindered and restricted
diffusion stemming respectively from extra- and intra-neurite water compartments. From the SMS,
multiple orientation distribution invariant indices can be computed, allowing for example the
quantification of neurite density, microscopic fractional anisotropy ($\mu$FA), per-axon axial/radial
diffusivity, and free/restricted isotropic diffusivity. We show maps of these indices for baby
brains, demonstrating that microscopic tissue features can be extracted from the developing brain
for greater sensitivity and specificity to development related changes. Also, we demonstrate
that our method, called spherical mean spectrum imaging (SMSI), is fast, accurate, and can overcome
the biases associated with other state-of-the-art microstructure models.
