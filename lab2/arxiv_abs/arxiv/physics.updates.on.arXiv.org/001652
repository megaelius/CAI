This paper deals with some of the methodologies used to construct polynomial surrogate models based
on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions for applications to uncertainty quantification
(UQ) in aerodynamic computations. A core ingredient in gPC expansions is the choice of a dedicated
sampling strategy, so as to define the most significant scenarios to be considered for the construction
of such metamodels. A desirable feature of the proposed rules shall be their ability to handle several
random inputs simultaneously. Methods to identify the relative "importance" of those variables
or uncertain data shall be ideally considered as well. The present work is more particularly dedicated
to the development of sampling strategies based on sparsity principles. Sparse multi-dimensional
cubature rules based on general one-dimensional Gauss-Jacobi-type quadratures are first addressed.
These sets are non nested, but they are well adapted to the probability density functions with compact
support for the random inputs considered in this study. On the other hand, observing that the aerodynamic
quantities of interest (outputs) depend only weakly on the cross-interactions between the variable
inputs, it is argued that only low-order polynomials shall significantly contribute to their surrogates.
This "sparsity-of-effects" trend prompts the use of reconstruction techniques benefiting from
the sparsity of the outputs, such as compressed sensing (CS). CS relies on the observation that one
only needs a number of samples proportional to the compressed size of the outputs, rather than their
uncompressed size, to construct reliable surrogate models. The results obtained with the test
case considered in this work corroborate this expected feature.
