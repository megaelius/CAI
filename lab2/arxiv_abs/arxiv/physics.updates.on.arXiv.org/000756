We study the linear spatiotemporal stability of an infinite row of equal point-vortices under symmetric
confinement between parallel walls. This serves to model the secondary pairing instability in
free shear layers, allowing us to study how confinement limits the growth of shear layers through
vortex pairings. Using a geometric construction akin to a Legendre transform on the dispersion
relation, we compute the growth rate of the instability in different reference frames as a function
of frame velocity. This new approach is verified and complemented with numerical computations
of the linear impulse response, fully characterizing the absolute/convective nature of the instability.
As for the primary instability of parallel tanh profiles, we observe a range of confinement in which
absolute instability is promoted. For a given parallel shear layer and channel width, the threshold
for absolute/convective instability of the pairing instability depends on the separation distance
between consecutive vortices, which is physically determined by the wavelength selected by the
previous (primary or pairing) instability. With counterflow and moderate to weak confinement,
small wavelength of the vortex row leads to absolute instability. In the present case, however,
the result of the secondary pairing instability is to regenerate the flow with an increased wavelength,
eventually leading to convective instability. This leads us to propose a wavelength selection
criteria, according to which a spatially developing row of vortices in a free shear layer with counterflow
can only occur if the distance between vortices is sufficiently large, in comparison to the channel
width, so that the pairing instability is convective. The proposed wavelength selection mechanism
can serve as a guideline for experimentally obtaining plane shear layers with counterflow, which
has remained an experimental challenge.
