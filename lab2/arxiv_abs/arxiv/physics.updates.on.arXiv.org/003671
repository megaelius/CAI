The polarization of political opinions among members of the U.S. legislative chambers measured
by their voting records is greater today than it was thirty years ago. Previous research efforts
to find causes of such increase have suggested diverse contributors, like growth of online media,
echo chamber effects, media biases, or disinformation propagation. Yet, we lack theoretic tools
to understand, quantify, and predict the emergence of high political polarization among voters
and their legislators. Here, we analyze millions of roll-call votes cast in the U.S. Congress over
the past six decades. Our analysis reveals the critical change of polarization patterns that started
at the end of 1980's. In earlier decades, polarization within each Congress tended to decrease with
time. In contrast, in the recent decades, the polarization has been likely to grow within each term.
To shed light on the reasons for this change, we introduce here a formal model for competitive dynamics
to quantify the evolution of polarization patterns in the legislative branch of the U.S. government.
Our model represents dynamics of polarization, enabling us to successfully predict the direction
of polarization changes in 28 out of 30 U.S. Congresses elected in the past six decades. From the evolution
of polarization level as measured by the Rice index, our model extracts a hidden parameter - polarization
utility which determines the convergence point of the polarization evolution. The increase in
the polarization utility implied by the model strongly correlates with two current trends: growing
polarization of voters and increasing influence of election campaign funders. Two largest peaks
of the model's polarization utility correlate with significant political or legislative changes
happening at the same time.
