It is foreseen to significantly increase the luminosity of the LHC in order to harvest the maximum
physics potential. Especially the Phase-II-Upgrade foreseen for 2023 will mean unprecedented
radiation levels, significantly beyond the limits of the Silicon trackers currently employed.
All-Silicon central trackers are being studied in ATLAS, CMS and LHCb, with extremely radiation-hard
Silicon sensors to be employed on the innermost layers. Within the RD50 Collaboration, a large R&D
program has been underway for more than a decade across experimental boundaries to develop Silicon
sensors with sufficient radiation tolerance for HL-LHC trackers. Key areas of recent RD50 research
include new sensor fabrication technologies such as HV-CMOS, exploiting the wide availability
of the CMOS process in the semiconductor industry at very competitive prices compared to the highly
specialized foundries that normally produce particle detectors on small wafers. We also seek for
a deeper understanding of the connection between the macroscopic sensor properties such as radiation-induced
increase of leakage current, doping concentration and trapping, and the microscopic properties
at the defect level. Another strong activity is the development of advanced sensor types like 3D
Silicon detectors, designed for the extreme radiation levels expected for the vertexing layers
at the HL-LHC. A further focus area is the field of LGADs, where a dedicated multiplication layer
to create a high field region is built into the sensor. LGADs are characterized by a high signal also
after irradiation and a very fast signal compared to traditional Silicon detectors with make them
ideal candidates for ATLAS and CMS timing layers in the HL-LHC. We will present the state of the art
in several Silicon detector technologies as outlined above and at radiation levels corresponding
to HL-LHC fluences and partially beyond.
