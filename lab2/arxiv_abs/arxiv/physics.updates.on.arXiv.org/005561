Measurement of gamma-ray polarization can provide valuable insight in different areas of physics.
A possible application is in Positron Emission Tomography, where annihilation quanta with orthogonal
polarizations are emitted. Since polarization can be measured via Compton scattering, the initial
orthogonality of polarizations can be translated to correlation of azimuthal scattering angles,
and this correlation may be exploited as an additional handle to identify the true coincidence events.
To examine the concept of using the polarization correlations in PET, we have used a system of two
compact, position and energy-sensitive Compton detectors in coincidence mode. Each consists
of a single matrix of scintillation pixels, read-out by an array of Silicon photomultipliers. The
Compton events in each module are clearly identified and the scattering angles are reconstructed
from the energy deposition and event topology. We have extracted the polarimetric modulation factors
from the distributions of the difference of the azimuthal angles of the two Compton-scattered gammas
and studied their dependence on Compton scattering angles $\theta$ and on azimuthal resolution
$\Delta\phi$. For scattering angles around $\theta_{1,2}=82^\circ$, where the maximum modulation
is expected, the modulation factors from $\mu=0.15\pm 0.01$ to $\mu=0.27\pm 0.02$ have been measured,
depending on the azimuthal resolution, which is governed by event topology in the detectors. Analogously,
for scattering around $\theta_{1,2}=70^\circ$, modulation factors from $\mu=0.12\pm 0.01$
to $\mu=0.21\pm 0.02$ have been obtained. The results show that the measurement of the polarization
correlations of annihilation quanta are feasible with compact single-layer, single-side read-out
detectors, which may be used to build cost-efficient systems for various applications where gamma-ray
polarization information is of interest.
