The role of internal motions and molecular geometry on $^1$H NMR relaxation times $T_{1,2}$ in hydrocarbons
is investigated using MD (molecular dynamics) simulations of the autocorrelation functions for
in{\it tra}molecular $G_R(t)$ and in{\it ter}molecular $G_T(t)$ $^1$H-$^1$H dipole-dipole
interactions arising from rotational ($R$) and translational ($T$) diffusion, respectively.
We show that molecules with increased molecular symmetry such as neopentane, benzene, and isooctane
show better agreement with traditional hard-sphere models than their corresponding straight-chain
$n$-alkane, and furthermore that spherically-symmetric neopentane agrees well with the Stokes-Einstein
theory. The influence of internal motions on the dynamics and $T_{1,2}$ relaxation of $n$-alkanes
are investigated by simulating rigid $n$-alkanes and comparing with flexible (i.e. non-rigid)
$n$-alkanes. Internal motions cause the rotational and translational correlation-times $\tau_{R,T}$
to get significantly shorter and the relaxation times $T_{1,2}$ to get significantly longer, especially
for longer-chain $n$-alkanes. Site-by-site simulations of $^1$H's along the chains indicate
significant variations in $\tau_{R,T}$ and $T_{1,2}$ across the chain, especially for longer-chain
$n$-alkanes. The extent of the stretched (i.e. multi-exponential) decay in the autocorrelation
functions $G_{R,T}(t)$ are quantified using inverse Laplace transforms, for both rigid and flexible
molecules, and on a site-by-site bases. Comparison of $T_{1,2}$ measurements with the site-by-site
simulations indicate that cross-relaxation (partially) averages-out the variations in $\tau_{R,T}$
and $T_{1,2}$ across the chain of long-chain $n$-alkanes. This work also has implications on the
role of nano-pore confinement on the NMR relaxation of fluids in the organic-matter pores of kerogen
and bitumen.
