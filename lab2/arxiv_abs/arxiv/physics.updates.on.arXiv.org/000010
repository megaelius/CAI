"The investigation into the possible effects of cosmic rays on living organisms will also offer
great interest." - Victor F. Hess, Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1936 High-energy radiation bursts
are commonplace in our Universe. From nearby solar flares to distant gamma ray bursts, a variety
of physical processes accelerate charged particles to a wide range of energies, which subsequently
reach the Earth. Such particles contribute to a number of physical processes occurring in the Earth
system. A large fraction of the energy of charged particles gets deposited in the atmosphere, ionizing
the atmosphere, causing changes in its chemistry and affecting the global electric circuit. Remaining
secondary particles contribute to the background dose of cosmic rays on the surface and parts of
the subsurface region. Life has evolved over the past ~ 3 billion years in presence of this background
radiation, which itself has varied considerably during the period. As demonstrated by the Miller-Urey
experiment, lightning plays a very important role in the formation of complex organic molecules,
which are the building blocks of more complex structures forming life. There is growing evidence
of increase in the lightning rate with increasing flux of charged particles. Is there a connection
between enhanced rate of cosmic rays and the origin of life? Cosmic ray secondaries are also known
to damage DNA and cause mutations, leading to cancer and other diseases. It is now possible to compute
radiation doses from secondary particles, in particular muons and neutrons. Have the variations
in cosmic ray flux affected the evolution of life on earth? We describe the mechanisms of cosmic rays
affecting terrestrial life and review the potential implications of the variation of high-energy
astrophysical radiation on the history of life on earth.
