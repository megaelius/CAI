With observations of IRIS, we study chromospheric heating and evaporation during an M1.6 flare
SOL2015-03-12T11:50. At the flare ribbons, the Mg II 2791.59 line shows quasi-periodic short-duration
red-wing enhancement, which is likely related to repetitive chromospheric condensation as a result
of episodic heating. On the contrary, the Si IV 1402.77 line reveals a persistent red-wing asymmetry
in both the impulsive and decay phases, suggesting that this line responds to both cooling downflows
and chromospheric condensation. The first two episodes of red-wing enhancement occurred around
11:42 UT and 11:45 UT, when two moving brightenings indicative of heating fronts crossed the IRIS
slit. The greatly enhanced red wings of the Si IV and Mg II lines at these occasions are accompanied
by an obvious increase in the line intensities and the HXR flux, suggesting two episodes of energy
injection into the lower atmosphere in the form of nonthermal electrons. The Mg II k/h ratio has a
small value of ~1.2 at the ribbons and decreases to ~1.1 at these two occasions. Correspondingly,
the Fe XXI 1354 line reveals two episodes of chromospheric evaporation, which is characterized
as a smooth decrease of the blue shift from ~300 km/s to nearly zero within ~3 minutes. The Fe XXI 1354
line is entirely blueshifted in the first episode, while appears to contain a nearly stationary
component and a blueshifted component in the second episode. More episodes of blueshifted Fe XXI
emission is found around the northern ribbon in the decay phase, though no obvious response is detected
in the Si IV and Mg II emission. We have also examined the Fe XXI emission at the flare loop top and identified
a secondary component with a ~200 km/s red shift, which possibly results from the downward moving
reconnection outflow. Our analysis also suggests a reference wavelength of 1354.0878 Angstrom
for this Fe XXI line.
