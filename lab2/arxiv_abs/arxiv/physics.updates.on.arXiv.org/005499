Sperm cell motility and morphology observed under the bright field microscopy are the only criteria
for selecting particular sperm cell during Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) procedure
of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). Several factors such as, oxidative stress, cryopreservation,
heat, smoking and alcohol consumption, are negatively associated with the quality of sperm cell
and fertilization potential due to the changing of sub-cellular structures and functions which
are overlooked. A bright field imaging contrast is insufficient to distinguish tiniest morphological
cell features that might influence the fertilizing ability of sperm cell. We developed a partially
spatially coherent digital holographic microscope (PSC-DHM) for quantitative phase imaging
(QPI) in order to distinguish normal sperm cells from sperm cells under different stress conditions
such as cryopreservation, exposure to hydrogen peroxide and ethanol without any labeling. Phase
maps of 10,163 sperm cells (2,400 control cells, 2,750 spermatozoa after cryopreservation, 2,515
and 2,498 cells under hydrogen peroxide and ethanol respectively) are reconstructed using the
data acquired from PSC-DHM system. Total of seven feedforward deep neural networks (DNN) were employed
for the classification of the phase maps for normal and stress affected sperm cells. When validated
against the test dataset, the DNN provided an average sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of
84.88%, 95.03% and 85%, respectively. The current approach DNN and QPI techniques of quantitative
information can be applied for further improving ICSI procedure and the diagnostic efficiency
for the classification of semen quality in regards to their fertilization potential and other biomedical
applications in general.
