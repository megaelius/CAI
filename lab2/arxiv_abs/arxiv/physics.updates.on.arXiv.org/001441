After the current shutdown, the LHC is about to resume operation for a new data-taking period, when
it will operate with increased luminosity, event rate and center of mass energy. The new conditions
will impose more demanding constraints on the ATLAS online trigger reconstruction and selection
system. To cope with such increased constraints, the ATLAS High-Level Trigger, placed after a first
hardware-based Level 1 trigger, has been redesigned by merging two previously separated software-based
processing levels. In the new joint processing level, the algorithms run in the same computing nodes,
thus sharing resources, minimizing the data transfer from the detector buffers and increasing
the algorithm flexibility. The jet trigger software selects events containing high transverse
momentum hadronic jets. It needs optimal jet energy resolution to help rejecting an overwhelming
background while retaining good efficiency for interesting jets. In particular, this requires
the CPU-intensive reconstruction of tridimensional energy deposits in the ATLAS calorimeter
to be used as the basic input to the jet finding algorithms. To allow this costly reconstruction step,
a partial detector readout scheme was developed, that effectively suppresses the low activity
regions of the calorimeter and significantly reduces the needed resources. In this paper we describe
the overall jet trigger software and its physics performance. We then focus on detailed studies
of the algorithm timing and the performance impact of the full and partial calorimeter readout schemes.
We conclude with an outlook of the jet trigger plans for the next LHC data-taking period.
