The steady state of a forced Taylor-Green flow is investigated in a rotating frame of reference.
The investigation involves the results of 184 numerical simulations for different Reynolds number
$\mathrm{Re}_{_{F}}$ and Rossby number $\mathrm{Ro}_{_F}$. The large number of examined runs
allows a systematic study that enables the mapping of the different behaviors observed to the parameter
space ($\mathrm{Re}_{_{F}},\mathrm{Ro}_{_{F}}$), and the examination of different limiting
procedures for approaching the large $\mathrm{Re}_{_{F}}$ small $\mathrm{Ro}_{_F}$ limit.
Four distinctly different states were identified: {\it laminar, intermittent bursts, quasi-2D
condensates, and weakly rotating turbulence}. These four different states are separated by power-law
boundaries $\mathrm{Ro}_{_F} \propto \mathrm{Re}_{_{F}}^{-\gamma}$ in the small $\mathrm{Ro}_{_F}$
limit. In this limit, the predictions of asymptotic expansions can be directly compared to the results
of the direct numerical simulations. While the first order expansion is in good agreement with the
results of the linear stability theory, it fails to reproduce the dynamical behavior of the quasi-2D
part of the flow in the nonlinear regime, indicating that higher order terms in the expansion need
to be taken in to account. The large number of simulations allows also to investigate the scaling
that relates the amplitude of the fluctuations with the energy dissipation rate and the control
parameters of the system for the different states of the flow. Different scaling was observed for
different states of the flow, that are discussed in detail. The present results clearly demonstrate
that the limits small Rossby and large Reynolds do not commute and it is important to specify the order
in which they are taken.
