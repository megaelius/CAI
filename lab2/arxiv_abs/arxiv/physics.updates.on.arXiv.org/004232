\displaystyle{Purpose: This paper describes a new method to apply deep-learning algorithms for
automatic segmentation of radiosensitive organs from 3D tomographic CT images before computing
organ doses using a GPU-based Monte Carlo code. Methods: A deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
for organ segmentation is trained to automatically delineate radiosensitive organs from CT. With
a GPU-based Monte Carlo dose engine (ARCHER) to derive CT dose of a phantom made from a subject's CT
scan, we are then able to compute the patient-specific CT dose for each of the segmented organs. The
developed tool is validated by using Relative Dose Error (RDE) against the organ doses calculated
by ARCHER with manual segmentation performed by radiologists. The dose computation results are
also compared against organ doses from population-average phantoms to demonstrate the improvement
achieved by using the developed tool. In this study, two datasets were used: The Lung CT Segmentation
Challenge 2017 (LCTSC) dataset, which contains 60 thoracic CT scan patients each with 5 segmented
organs, and the Pancreas-CT (PCT) dataset, which contains 43 abdominal CT scan patients each with
8 segmented organs. Five-fold cross-validation of the new method is performed on both datasets.
Results: Comparing with the traditional organ dose evaluation method that based on population-average
phantom, our proposed method achieved the smaller RDE range on all organs with -4.3%~1.5% vs -31.5%~33.9%
(lung), -7.0%~2.3% vs -15.2%~125.1% (heart), -18.8%~40.2% vs -10.3%~124.1% (esophagus) in the
LCTSC dataset and -5.6%~1.6% vs -20.3%~57.4% (spleen), -4.5%~4.6% vs -19.5%~61.0% (pancreas),
-2.3%~4.4% vs -37.8%~75.8% (left kidney), -14.9%~5.4% vs -39.9% ~14.6% (gall bladder), -0.9%~1.6%
vs -30.1%~72.5% (liver), and -23.0%~11.1% vs -52.5%~-1.3% (stomach) in the PCT dataset.}
