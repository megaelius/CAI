The conical self-similar vortex solution of Long (1961) is reconsidered, with a view toward understanding
what, if any, relationship exists between Long's solution and the more-recent similarity solutions
of Mayer and Powell (1992), which are a rotational-flow analogue of the Falkner-Skan boundary-layer
flows, describing a self-similar axisymmetric vortex embedded in an external stream whose axial
velocity varies as a power law in the axial (z) coordinate, with phi=r/z^n being the radial similarity
coordinate and n the core growth rate parameter. We show that, when certain ostensible differences
in the formulations and radial scalings are properly accounted for, the Long and Mayer-Powell flows
in fact satisfy the same system of coupled ordinary differential equations, subject to different
kinds of outer-boundary conditions, and with Long's equations a special case corresponding to
conical vortex core growth, n=1 with outer axial velocity field decelerating in a 1/z fashion, which
implies a severe adverse pressure gradient. For pressure gradients this adverse Mayer and Powell
were unable to find any leading-edge-type vortex flow solutions which satisfy a basic physicality
criterion based on monotonicity of the total-pressure profile of the flow, and it is shown that Long's
solutions also violate this criterion, in an extreme fashion. Despite their apparent nonphysicality,
the fact that Long's solutions fit into a more general similarity framework means that nonconical
analogues of these flows should exist. The far-field asymptotics of these generalized solutions
are derived and used as the basis for a hybrid spectral-numerical solution of the generalized similarity
equations, which reveal the existence of solutions for more modestly adverse pressure gradients
than those in Long's case, and which do satisfy the above physicality criterion.
