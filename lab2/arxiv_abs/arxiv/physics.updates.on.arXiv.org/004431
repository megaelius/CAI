Interaction of motile microrganisms with a nearby solid substrate is a well studied phenomenon.
However, the effects of hydrodynamic slippage on the substrate have received a little attention.
In the present study, within the framework of the squirmer model, we impose a tangential velocity
at the swimmer surface as a representation of the ciliatory propulsion and subsequently obtain
exact solution of the Stokes equation based on a combined analytical-numerical approach. We illustrate
how the near-wall swimming velocities are non-trivially altered by the interaction of wall slip
and hydrodynamic forces. We report a characteristic transition of swimming trajectories for both
puller and pusher type microswimmers by hydrodynamic slippage if the wall-slip length crosses
a critical value. In case of puller microswimmers that are propelled by a breast-stroke like action
of their swimming apparatus ahead of their cell body, the wall slip can cause wall-bound trapping
swimming states, either as periodic or damped periodic oscillations which would otherwise escape
from a no slip wall. The associated critical slip length has a non-monotonic dependence on the initial
orientation of the swimmer which is represented by novel phase diagrams. Pushers, which get their
propulsive thrust from posterior flagellar action, also show similar swimming state transitions
but in this case the wall slip mediated reorientation dynamics and the swimming modes compete in
a different fashion to that of the pullers. The present results pave the way for understanding the
motion characteristic of biological microswimmers near confinements with hydrophobic walls
or strategize the design of microfluidic devices used for sorting and motion rectification of artificial
swimmers by tailoring their surface wettability.
