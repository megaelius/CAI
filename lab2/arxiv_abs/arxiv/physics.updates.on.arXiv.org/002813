In recent years, coupled with the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, the large eddy
simulation (LES) models, and the hybrid RANS/LES models, the second-order gas-kinetic scheme
(GKS) has been used in the turbulent flow simulations. At the same time, high-order GKS has been developed,
such as the two-stage fourth-order scheme (S2O4), and used for laminar flow calculations. The S2O4
GKS achieves fourth-order accuracy in space and time and shows distinguishable robustness for
the discontinuous flows. In this paper, targeting on the three-dimensional turbulent flows, an
implicit high-order GKS with Lower-Upper Symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) technique is developed
under the S2O4 framework. Based on Vreman-type LES model and $k - \omega$ SST model, a turbulent relaxation
time is obtained and used for an enlarged particle collision time in the implicit high-order GKS
for the high-Reynolds number turbulent flows. Numerical experiments include Taylor-Green vortex
problem, incompressible decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence, incompressible high-Reynolds
number flat plate turbulent flow, and transonic high-Reynolds number ARA M100 wing-body flow.
Comparisons among the numerical solutions from current implicit high-order GKS, the explicit
high-order GKS, the second-order GKS, the second-order Navier-Stokes solver, and experimental
measurements, have been conducted. Through these examples, it is concluded that the current scheme
has high accuracy in space and time, and significant acceleration on computational efficiency,
as well as super robustness in simulating complex flows.This study also indicates that turbulence
modeling plays a dominant role in the capturing physical solution.
