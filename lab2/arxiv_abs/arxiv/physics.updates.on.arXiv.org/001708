Exponential integrators have been introduced as an efficient alternative to explicit and implicit
methods for integrating large stiff systems of differential equations. Over the past decades these
methods have been studied theoretically and their performance was evaluated using a range of test
problems. While the results of these investigations showed that exponential integrators can provide
significant computational savings, the research on validating this hypothesis for large scale
systems and understanding what classes of problems can particularly benefit from the use of the
new techniques is in its initial stages. Resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling is widely
used in studying large scale behavior of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. In many problems
numerical solution of MHD equations is a challenging task due to the temporal stiffness of this system
in the parameter regimes of interest. In this paper we evaluate the performance of exponential integrators
on large MHD problems and compare them to a state-of-the-art implicit time integrator. Both the
variable and constant time step exponential methods of EpiRK-type are used to simulate magnetic
reconnection and the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability in plasma. Performance of these methods,
which are part of the EPIC software package, is compared to the variable time step variable order
BDF scheme included in the CVODE (part of SUNDIALS) library. We study performance of the methods
on parallel architectures and with respect to magnitudes of important parameters such as Reynolds,
Lundquist, and Prandtl numbers. We find that the exponential integrators provide superior or equal
performance in most circumstances and conclude that further development of exponential methods
for MHD problems is warranted and can lead to significant computational advantages for large scale
stiff systems of differential equations such as MHD.
