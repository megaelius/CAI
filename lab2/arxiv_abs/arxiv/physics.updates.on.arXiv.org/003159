In this paper, an agent-based modeling framework to evaluate the seismic resilience of an integrated
system comprising the community and its civil infrastructure systems is proposed. Specifically,
an agent-based model of the recovery process of civil infrastructure systems is incorporated into
a previously developed compositional supply/demand seismic resilience quantification framework.
The proposed model represents the behavior of the operators of civil infrastructure systems as
they strive to recover their functionality in the aftermath of an earthquake as well as their mutual
interactions and the interactions with the community they provide services to. A case study of the
seismic resilience of a virtual system comprising the electric power supply system, the transportation
system and the community (EPSS-TS-Community system) is conducted using the proposed framework.
A parametric investigation is carried out to examine the effect of different earthquake magnitude
scenarios as well as different behaviors of the involved agents and their interaction on the seismic
resilience of the virtual system. It was demonstrated that the proposed agent-based modeling approach
is effective in representing the interactions among different participants in the recovery process.
It was also revealed that timely and well-planned intervention in the recovery process can be effective
in alleviating the post-earthquake lack of resilience resulting from the insufficient supply
of civil infrastructure service to meet the community demands. Therefore, the proposed framework
could be employed to formulate the recovery trajectory of the intertwined socio-technical system
subjected to different earthquake scenarios. The interplay among different agents, as well as
the interdependence between civil infrastructure systems is found to profoundly shape the recovery
path for this integrated EPSS-TS-Community system.
