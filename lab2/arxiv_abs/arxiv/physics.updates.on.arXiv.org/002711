The incorporation of even small amounts of strontium (Sr) into lead-based quadruple cation hybrid
perovskite solar cells results in a systematic increase of the open circuit voltage (Voc) in pin-type
perovskite solar cells. We demonstrate via transient and absolute photoluminescence (PL) experiments
how the incorporation of Sr significantly reduces the non-radiative recombination losses in the
neat perovskite layer and specifically at the perovskite/C60 interface. We show that Sr segregates
at the perovskite surface, where it induces important changes of morphology and energetics. Notably,
the Sr-enriched surface exhibits a wider band gap and a more n-type character, accompanied with
significantly stronger surface band bending. As a result, we observe a significant increase of
the quasi-Fermi level splitting in the neat perovskite by reduced surface recombination and more
importantly, a strong reduction of losses attributed to non-radiative recombination at the interface
to the C60 electron-transporting layer. The resulting solar cells exhibited a Voc of 1.18 V, which
could be further improved to nearly 1.23 V through addition of a thin polymer interlayer, bringing
the non-radiative voltage loss to only 110 meV. Our work shows that simply adding a small amount of
Sr to the precursor solutions induces a beneficial surface modification in the perovskite, without
requiring any post treatment, resulting in high efficiency solar cells with power conversion efficiency
(PCE) up to 20.3%. Our results demonstrate very high Voc values and efficiencies in Sr-containing
quadruple cation perovskite pin solar cells and highlight the imperative importance of addressing
and minimizing the recombination losses at the interface between perovskite and charge transporting
layer.
