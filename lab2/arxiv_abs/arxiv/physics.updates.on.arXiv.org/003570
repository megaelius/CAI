The metal to insulator transition (MIT) in Mott-Hubbard systems is one of the most important discoveries
in condensed matter physics, and results in abrupt orbital transitions from the insulating to metallic
phases by elevating temperature across a critical point (TMIT). Although the MIT was previously
expected to be mainly driven by the orbital Coulomb repulsion energy, the entropy contribution
to the orbital free energy that also determines the relative stability of the metallic and insulating
phases was largely overlooked. Herein, we demonstrate an orbital-entropy dominated reversible
electronic phase transition in the metastable perovskite family of correlated rare-earth nicklates
(ReNiO3), in addition to their previously known MIT driven by orbital Coulomb energies. In reverse
to MIT, the resistivity of ReNiO3 abruptly increases by 2-3 orders by elevating T across another
critical point (TR-MIT) below TMIT, and such transition is named as reverse-metal to insulator
transition (R-MIT). Combining the afterwards exponentially decreasing resistivity in the insulating
phase of ReNiO3 at further temperature elevation, a distinguished delta-temperatural transport
character is established, which is potentially applicable for locking the working temperatures
range for electric devices. The TR-MIT is shown to be enhanced via reducing the compositional complexity
and size of Re or imparting bi-axial compressive strains, and meanwhile the transition sharpness
of delta-temperatural transport is reduced. Our discovery indicates that temperature range for
a thermodynamically stable insulating phase of ReNiO3 is in between of TR-MIT and TMIT, while a new
conductive phase with high orbital entropy is formed by further descending temperature below TR-MIT.
