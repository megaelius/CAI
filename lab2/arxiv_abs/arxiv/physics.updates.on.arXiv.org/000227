A design study of a horizontal neutron reflectometer adapted to the general baseline of the long
pulse European Spallation Source (ESS) is presented. The instrument layout comprises solutions
for the neutron guide, high-resolution pulse shaping and beam bending onto a sample surface being
so far unique in the field of reflectometry. The length of this instrument is roughly 55 m, enabling
$\delta \lambda / \lambda$ resolutions from 0.5% to 10%. The incident beam is focussed in horizontal
plane to boost measurements of sample sizes of 1*1 cm{^2} and smaller with potential beam deflection
in both downward and upward direction. The range of neutron wavelengths untilized by the instrument
is 2 to 7.1 (12.2, ...) {\AA}, if every (second, ...) neutron source ulse is used. Angles of incidence
can be set between 0{\deg} and 9{\deg} with a total accessible q-range from 4*10^{-3} {\AA}^{-1}
up to 1 {\AA}^{-1}. The instrument operates both in {\theta}/{\theta} (free liquid surfaces) and
{\theta}/2{\theta} (solid/liquid, air/solid interfaces) geometry. The experimental setup
will in particular enable direct studies on ultrathin films (d ~ 10 {\AA}) and buried monolayers
to multilayered structures of up to 3000 {\AA} total thickness. The horizontal reflectometer will
further foster investigations of hierarchical systems from nm to micrometer length scale, as well
as their kinetics and dynamical properties, in particular under load (shear, pressure, external
fields). Polarization and polarization analysis as well as the GISANS option are designed as potential
modules to be implemented separately in the generic instrument layout. The instrument is highly
flexible layout and offers a variety of different measurement modes. With respect to its mechanical
components the instrument is exclusively based on current technology. Risks of failure for the
chosen setup are minimum.
