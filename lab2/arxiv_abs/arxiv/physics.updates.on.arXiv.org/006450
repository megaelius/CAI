As frame rates of X-ray pixel detectors continue to increase, photon counting will be replaced with
charge-integrating pixel array detectors for high dynamic range applications. The continued
desire for faster frame rates will also stress the ability of application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) designers to provide sufficient off-chip bandwidth to reach continuous frame rates
of 1 MHz. To move from the current 10 kHz to the 1 MHz frame rate regime, ASIC designers will continue
to pack as many power-hungry high-speed transceivers at the periphery of the ASIC as possible. In
this paper, however, we present new strategies to make the most efficient use of the off-chip bandwidth
by utilizing data compression schemes for X-ray photon-counting and charge-integrating pixel
detectors. In particular, we describe a novel in-pixel compression scheme that converts from analog
to digital converter units to encoded photon counts near the photon Poisson noise level which achieves
a compression ratio of 1.5x independent of the dataset. In addition, we describe a simple yet efficient
zero-suppression compression scheme called zeromask (ZM) located at the ASIC edge before streaming
data off the ASIC chip. ZM achieves an average compression ratios of >4x, >7x, and >8x for high-energy
X-ray diffraction, ptychography, and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy datasets, respectively.
We present the conceptual designs, register-transfer level (RTL) block diagrams, and the physical
ASIC implementation of these compression schemes in 65 nm CMOS. When combined, these two digital
compression schemes can increase off-chip bandwidth by a factor of 6-12x.
