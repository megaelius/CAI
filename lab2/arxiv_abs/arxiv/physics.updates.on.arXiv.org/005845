Urban traffic and transportation networks of both railways and roads proved to have fractal nature.
However, previous studies are mainly based on monofractal scaling. To reveal spatial complexity
of cities, this paper is devoted to exploring the multifractal scaling in the street networks of
12 Chinese cities. The city clustering algorithm (CCA) is employed to identify urban boundaries
and define street systems. Then, box-counting method is used to calculate generalized correlation
dimension and mass exponent, and the direct determination method based on miu-weight is utilized
to estimate singularity exponent and local fractal dimension. The basic algorithm of parameter
estimation is the fixed-intercept linear regression analysis. The results reflect the significant
multifractal structure of urban street networks. The global multifractal dimension spectrum,
i.e., the Dq-q spectrum, is an inverted S-shaped curve, while the local multifractal dimension
spectrum, i.e., the f(a)-a spectrum, is a right leaning unimodal curve. If the moment order q approaches
negative infinity, the generalized correlation dimension will exceed the embedding space dimension
2, and the scattered points on the log-log plots for local parameter estimation become disordered.
The conclusions can be reached as follows. Following multifractal scaling law, urban traffic networks
develop around urban center and sub-centers and form cascade structure. The principal characters
of street systems are spatial heterogeneity and asymmetric cascade structure. By optimizing the
traffic network of low density areas and edge areas, we can improve the accessibility and transportation
level of an urban system.
