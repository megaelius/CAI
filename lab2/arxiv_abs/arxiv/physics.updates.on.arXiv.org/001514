The flows behind a model wind turbine under two turbine operating regimes are investigated using
wind tunnel experiments and large-eddy simulations. Measurements from the model wind turbine
experiment reveal that the power coefficient and turbine wake are affected by the operating regime.
Simulations employing a new class of actuator surface methods which parameterize both the turbine
blades and nacelle with and without a nacelle model are carried out for each operating condition
to study the influence of the operating regime and nacelle. For simulations with a nacelle model,
the mean flow field is composed of an outer wake, caused by energy extraction from the incoming wind
by the turbine blades, and an inner wake directly behind the nacelle, while for the simulations without
a nacelle model, the central region of the wake is occupied by a jet. The simulations with the nacelle
model reveal an unstable helical hub vortex expanding outwards towards the outer wake; while the
simulations without a nacelle model show a stable and columnar hub vortex. The hub vortex for the
turbine operating in Region 3 remains in a tight helical spiral and intercepts the outer wake a few
diameters further downstream than for the turbine operating in Region 2. Wake meandering commences
in a region of high turbulence intensity for all simulations indicating that neither a nacelle model
nor an unstable hub vortex is a necessary requirement for wake meandering. However, further analysis
of the wake meandering using a filtering technique and dynamic mode decomposition show that the
unstable hub vortex energizes the wake meandering. The turbine operating regime affects the shape
and expansion of the hub vortex altering the location of the onset of the wake meandering and its oscillating
intensity. The unstable hub vortex promotes a energetic meandering which cannot be predicted without
a nacelle model.
