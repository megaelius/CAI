Aiming to measure the difference in arrival times of two coincident gamma-photons with an accuracy
in the order of 200 ps, time-of-flight positron emission tomography (ToF-PET) systems commonly
employ silicon-photomultipliers and high-resolution digitization electronics, application
specific integrated circuits (ASICs). This work evaluates the performance of the TOFPET2 ASIC
released by PETsys Electronics S.A. in 2017 in multi-channel measurements. SiPM arrays fabricated
by different vendors (KETEK, SensL, Hamamatsu, Broadcom) were tested in combination with the ASIC.
Scintillator arrays featuring different reflector designs, different materials for optical
coupling, and different configurations of the ASIC software parameters were evaluated. The benchtop
setup used is provided with the TOFPET2 ASIC evaluation kit by PETsys Electronics S.A.. In coincidence
experiments, the ASIC shows promising CRTs down to 219.9 ps with two Hamamatsu SiPM arrays (128 channels
read out, dE/E 13.08%) and 216.1 ps with two Broadcom SiPM arrays (32 channels read out, dE/E 9.46%).
As a side-effect of the dark count suppression scheme, satellite peaks appear in the time difference
spectra depending on the configuration of the delay period in the channel trigger circuit. These
peaks have been reported by us for prior single-channel experiments and can be reproduced. The length
of the trigger delay has an impact on the ASIC performance and can be configured to further improve
the CRTs. The integrator gain configuration has been investigated and allows an absolute improvement
of the energy resolution by up to 1% at the cost of the linearity of the energy spectrum. Measuring
up to the ToF performance of state-of-the-art PET systems while providing a uniform and stable readout
for multiple channels at the same time, the TOFPET2 ASIC is treated as promising candidate for the
integration in future ToF-PET systems.
