Composed of shocked solar wind, the Earth's magnetosheath serves as a natural laboratory to study
the transition of turbulence from low Alfv{\'e}n Mach number, $M_\mathrm{A}$, to high $M_\mathrm{A}$.
The simultaneous observations of magnetic field and plasma moments with unprecedented high temporal
resolution provided by NASA's \textit{Magnetospheric Multiscale} Mission enable us to study
the magnetosheath turbulence at both magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and sub-ion scales. Based on
1841 burst-mode segments of MMS-1 from 2015/09 to 2019/06, comprehensive patterns of the spatial
evolution of magnetosheath turbulences are obtained: (1) from the sub-solar region to the flanks,
$M_\mathrm{A}$ increases from $<$ 1 to $>$ 5. At MHD scales, the spectral indices of the magnetic-field
and velocity spectra present a positive and negative correlation with $M_\mathrm{A}$. However,
no obvious correlations between the spectral indices and $M_\mathrm{A}$ are found at sub-ion scales.
(2) from the bow shock to the magnetopause, the turbulent sonic Mach number, $M_{\mathrm{turb}}$,
generally decreases from $>$ 0.4 to $<$ 0.1. All spectra steepen at MHD scales and flatten at sub-ion
scales, representing a positive/negative correlations with $M_\mathrm{turb}$. The break frequency
increases by 0.1 Hz when approaching the magnetopause for the magnetic-field and velocity spectra,
while it remains at 0.3 Hz for the density spectra. (3) In spite of some differences, similar results
are found for the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath. In addition, the spatial
evolution of magnetosheath turbulence is found to be independent of the upstream solar wind conditions,
e.g., the Z-component of the interplanetary magnetic field and the solar wind speed.
