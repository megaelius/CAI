Inclined turbulent thermal convection by large Rayleigh numbers in extremely small-Prandtl-number
fluids is studied based on results of both, measurements and high-resolution numerical simulations.
The Prandtl number $Pr\approx0.0093$ considered in the experiments and the Large-Eddy Simulations
(LES) and $Pr=0.0094$ considered in the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) correspond to liquid
sodium, which is used in the experiments. Also similar are the studied Rayleigh numbers, which are,
respectively, $Ra=1.67\times10^7$ in the DNS, $Ra=1.5\times10^7$ in the LES and $Ra=1.42\times10^7$
in the measurements. The working convection cell is a cylinder with equal height and diameter, where
one circular surface is heated and another one is cooled. The cylinder axis is inclined with respect
to the vertical and the inclination angle varies from $\beta=0^\circ$, which corresponds to a Rayleigh-B\'enard
configuration (RBC), to $\beta=90^\circ$, as in a vertical convection (VC) setup. The turbulent
heat and momentum transport as well as time-averaged and instantaneous flow structures and their
evolution in time are studied in detail, for different inclination angles, and are illustrated
also by supplementary videos, obtained from the DNS and experimental data. To investigate the scaling
relations of the mean heat and momentum transport in the limiting cases of RBC and VC configurations,
additional measurements are conducted for about one decade of the Rayleigh numbers around $Ra=10^7$
and $Pr\approx0.009$. With respect to the turbulent heat transport in inclined thermal convection
by low $Pr$, a similarity of the global flow characteristics for the same value of $RaPr$ is proposed
and analysed, based on the above simulations and measurements and on complementary DNS for $Ra=1.67\times10^6$,
$Pr=0.094$ and $Ra=10^9$, $Pr=1$.
