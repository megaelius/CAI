Electron lenses are pulsed, magnetically confined electron beams whose current-density profile
is shaped to obtain the desired effect on the circulating beam in high-energy accelerators. They
were used in the Fermilab Tevatron collider for abort-gap clearing, beam-beam compensation, and
halo scraping. A beam-beam compensation scheme based upon electron lenses is currently being implemented
in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. This work is in support
of a conceptual design of hollow electron beam scraper for the Large Hadron Collider. It also applies
to the implementation of nonlinear integrable optics with electron lenses in the Integrable Optics
Test Accelerator at Fermilab. We consider the axial asymmetries of the electron beam caused by the
bends that are used to inject electrons into the interaction region and to extract them. A distribution
of electron macroparticles is deposited on a discrete grid enclosed in a conducting pipe. The electrostatic
potential and electric fields are calculated using numerical Poisson solvers. The kicks experienced
by the circulating beam are estimated by integrating the electric fields over straight trajectories.
These kicks are also provided in the form of interpolated analytical symplectic maps for numerical
tracking simulations, which are needed to estimate the effects of the electron lens imperfections
on proton lifetimes, emittance growth, and dynamic aperture. We outline a general procedure to
calculate the magnitude of the transverse proton kicks, which can then be generalized, if needed,
to include further refinements such as the space-charge evolution of the electron beam, magnetic
fields generated by the electron current, and longitudinal proton dynamics.
