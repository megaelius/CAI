We investigated the impact of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) on protein folding using a coarse-grained
model. The extent of the impact of hydrodynamic interactions, whether it accelerates, retards,
or has no effect on protein folding, has been controversial. Together with a theoretical framework
of the energy landscape theory (ELT) for protein folding that describes the dynamics of the collective
motion with a single reaction coordinate across a folding barrier, we compared the kinetic effects
of HI on the folding rates of two protein models that use a chain of single beads with distinctive topologies:
a 64-residue alpha/beta chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) protein, and a 57-residue beta-barrel
alpha-spectrin src-Homology 3 domain (SH3) protein. When comparing the protein folding kinetics
simulated with Brownian dynamics in the presence of HI to that in the absence of HI, we find that the
effect of HI on protein folding appears to have a crossover behavior about the folding temperature.
Meaning that at a temperature greater than the folding temperature, the enhanced friction from
the hydrodynamic solvents between the beads in an unfolded configuration results in lowered folding
rate; conversely, at a temperature lower than the folding temperature, HI accelerates folding
by the backflow of solvent toward the native folded state. Additionally, the extent of acceleration
depends on the topology of a protein: for a protein like CI2, where its folding nucleus is rather diffuse
in a transition state, HI channels the formation of contacts by favoring a major folding pathway
in a complex free energy landscape, thus accelerating folding. For a protein like SH3, where its
folding nucleus is already specific and less diffuse, HI matters less at a temperature lower than
the folding temperature. Our findings provide further theoretical insight to protein folding
kinetic experiments and simulations.
