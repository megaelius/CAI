Analysis of daily streamflow variability in space and time is important for water resources planning,
development, and management. The natural variability of streamflow is being complicated by anthropogenic
influences and climate change, which may introduce additional complexity into the phenomenological
records. To address this question for daily discharge data recorded during the period 1989-2016
at twelve gauging stations on Brazos River in Texas (USA), we use a set of novel quantitative tools:
Kolmogorov complexity (KC) with its derivative associated measures to assess complexity, and
Lyapunov time (LT) to assess predictability. We find that all daily discharge series exhibit long
memory with an increasing downflow tendency, while the randomness of the series at individual sites
cannot be definitively concluded. All Kolmogorov complexity measures have relatively small values
with the exception of the USGS (United States Geological Survey) 08088610 station at Graford, Texas,
which exhibits the highest values of these complexity measures. This finding may be attributed
to the elevated effect of human activities at Graford, and proportionally lesser effect at other
stations. In addition, complexity tends to decrease downflow, meaning that larger catchments
are generally less influenced by anthropogenic activity. The correction on randomness of Lyapunov
time (quantifying predictability) is found to be inversely proportional to the Kolmogorov complexity,
which strengthens our conclusion regarding the effect of anthropogenic activities, considering
that KC and LT are distinct measures, based on rather different techniques.
