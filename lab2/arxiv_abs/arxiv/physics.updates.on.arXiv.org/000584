A general circulation model of intermediate complexity with an idealized earthlike aquaplanet
setup is used to study the impact of changes in the oceanic heat transport on the global atmospheric
circulation. Focus is put on the Lorenz energy cycle and the atmospheric mean meridional circulation.
The latter is analysed by means of the Kuo-Eliassen equation. The atmospheric heat transport compensates
the imposed oceanic heat transport changes to a large extent in conjunction with significant modification
of the general circulation. Up to a maximum about 3PW, an increase of the oceanic heat transport leads
to an increase of the global mean near surface temperature and a decrease of its equator-to-pole
gradient. For larger transports, the gradient is reduced further but the global mean remains approximately
constant. This is linked to a cooling and a reversal of the temperature gradient in the tropics. A
larger oceanic heat transport leads to a reduction of all reservoirs and conversions of the Lorenz
energy cycle but of different relative magnitude for the individual components. The available
potential energy of the zonal mean flow and its conversion to eddy available potential energy are
affected most. Both Hadley and Ferrel cell show a decline for increasing oceanic heat transport
with the Hadley cell being more sensitive. Both cells exhibit a poleward shift of their maxima, and
the Hadley cell broadens for larger oceanic transports. The partitioning by means of the Kuo-Eliassen
equation reveals that zonal mean diabatic heating and friction are the most important sources for
changes of the Hadley cell while the behaviour of the Ferrell cell is mostly controlled by friction.
