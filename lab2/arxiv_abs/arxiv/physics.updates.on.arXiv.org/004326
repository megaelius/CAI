In this study, the fundamental framework of analytical micromechanics is generalized to consider
nano-composites with both interface stretching and bending effects. The interior and exterior
Eshelby tensors for a spherical nano-inclusion, with an interface defined by the Steigmann-Ogden
model, subjected to an arbitrary uniform eigenstrain are derived for the first time. Correspondingly,
the stress/strain concentration tensors for a spherical nano-inhomogeneity subjected to arbitrary
uniform far-field stress/strain loadings are also derived. Using the obtained concentration
tensors, the effective bulk and shear moduli are derived by employing the dilute approximation
and the Mori-Tanaka method, respectively, which can be used for both nano-composites and nano-porous
materials. An equivalent interface curvature parameter reflecting the influence of the interface
bending resistance is found, which can significantly simplify the complex expressions of the effective
properties. In addition to size-dependency, the closed form expressions show that the effective
bulk modulus is invariant to interface bending resistance parameters, in contrast to the effective
shear modulus. We also put forward for the first time a characteristic interface curvature parameter,
near which the effective shear modulus is affected significantly. Numerical results show that
the effective shear moduli of nano-composites and nano-porous materials can be greatly improved
by an appropriate surface modification. Finally, the derived effective modulus with the Steigmann-Ogden
interface model is provided in the supplemental MATLAB code, which can be easily executed, and used
as a benchmark for semi-analytical solutions and numerical solutions in future studies.
