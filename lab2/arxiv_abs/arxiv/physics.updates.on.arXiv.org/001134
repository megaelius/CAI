This paper extends our earlier approach [cf. Phys. Plasmas 17, 032503 (2010), 23, 022308 (2016)]
to obtaining \`a priori bounds on enstrophy in neutral fluids (R-Euler) and ideal magnetohydrodynamics
(R-MHD). This results in a far-reaching local, 3-dimensional, non-linear, dispersive generalization
of a KdV-type regularization to compressible dissipationless two-fluid plasmas and models derived
therefrom (quasi-neutral 2-fluid and Hall MHD). It involves the introduction of vortical and magnetic
`twirl' terms $\lambda_l^2 ({\bf w}_l + \frac{q_l}{m_l} {\bf B}) \times (\nabla \times {\bf w}_l)$
in the ion/electron momentum equations ($l = i,e$) where ${\bf w}_l = \nabla \times {\bf v}_l$ are
vorticities. The cut-off lengths $\lambda_l$ must be inversely proportional to the square-roots
of the number densities $(\lambda_l^2 n_l = C_l)$ and may be taken as Debye lengths or skin-depths.
A novel feature is that the `flow' current $\sum_l q_l n_l {\bf v}_l$ in Amp\`ere's law is augmented
by a solenoidal `twirl' current $\sum_l \nabla \times \nabla \times \lambda_l^2 {\bf j}_{{\rm
flow},l}$. The resulting equations imply conserved linear and angular momenta and a positive definite
swirl energy density ${\cal E}^*$ which includes an enstrophic contribution $\sum_l (1/2) \lambda_l^2
\rho_l {\bf w}_l^2$. It is shown that the equations admit a Hamiltonian-Poisson bracket formulation.
Furthermore, singularities in $\nabla \times {\bf B}$ are conservatively regularized by adding
$(\lambda_B^2/2 \mu_0) (\nabla \times {\bf B})^2$ to ${\cal E}^*$. Finally, it is proved that among
regularizations that admit a Hamiltonian formulation and preserve the continuity equations along
with the symmetries of the ideal model, the twirl term is unique and minimal in non-linearity and
space derivatives of velocities.
