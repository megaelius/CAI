In this chapter, we introduce digital holographic microscopy (DHM) as a marker-free method to determine
the refractive index of single, spherical cells in suspension. The refractive index is a conclusive
measure in a biological context. Cell conditions, such as differentiation or infection, are known
to yield significant changes in the refractive index. Furthermore, the refractive index of biological
tissue determines the way it interacts with light. Besides the biological relevance of this interaction
in the retina, a lot of methods used in biology, including microscopy, rely on light-tissue or light-cell
interactions. Hence, determining the refractive index of cells using DHM is valuable in many biological
applications. This chapter covers the main topics which are important for the implementation of
DHM: setup, sample preparation and analysis. First, the optical setup is described in detail including
notes and suggestions for the implementation. Following that, a protocol for the sample and measurement
preparation is explained. In the analysis section, an algorithm for the determination of the quantitative
phase map is described. Subsequently, all intermediate steps for the calculation of the refractive
index of suspended cells are presented, exploiting their spherical shape. In the last section,
a discussion of possible extensions to the setup, further measurement configurations and additional
analysis methods are given. Throughout this chapter, we describe a simple, robust, and thus easily
reproducible implementation of DHM. The different possibilities for extensions show the diverse
fields of application for this technique.
