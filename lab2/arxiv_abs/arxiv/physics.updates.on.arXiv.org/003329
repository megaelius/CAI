We review the state of the art and recently obtained theoretical and experimental results for two-
and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) solitons and related states, such as quantum droplets, in optical
systems, atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), and other fields - in particular, liquid crystals.
The central challenge is avoiding the trend of 2D and 3D solitary states supported by the ubiquitous
cubic nonlinearity to be strongly unstable - a property far less present in one-dimensional systems.
Many possibilities for the stabilization of multi-dimensional states have been theoretically
proposed over the years. Most strategies involve non-cubic nonlinearities or using different
sorts of potentials, including periodic ones. New important avenues have arisen recently in systems
based on two-component BEC with spin-orbit coupling, which have been predicted to support stable
2D and metastable 3D solitons. An important recent breakthrough is the creation of 3D quantum droplets.
These are self-sustained states existing in two-component BECs, which are stabilized by the presence
of Lee-Hung-Yang quantum fluctuations around the underlying mean-field states. By and large,
multi-dimensional geometries afford unique opportunities to explore the existence of complex
self-sustained states, including topologically rich ones, which by their very nature are not possible
in one-dimensional geometries. In addition to vortex solitons, these are hopfions, skyrmions,
and hybrid vortex-antivortex complexes, which have been predicted in different models. Here we
review recent landmark findings in this field and outline outstanding open challenges.
