We present and study two new Lagrangian numerical methods for solving the equations of hydrodynamics,
in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, SPH, and non-moving grid methods. The new methods
are designed to capture many advantages of both smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based
or adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume
coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume 'overlap.'
We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with coupled self-gravity
& cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO: this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum
conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods
we study; does not require 'artificial diffusion' terms; and allows fluid elements to move with
the flow so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and
find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some
advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The
new methods have many advantages vs. SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities,
dramatically reduced 'particle noise' & numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow
evolution, & sharp shock-capturing. Advantages vs. non-moving meshes include: automatic
adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors & numerical diffusion, velocity-independence
of errors, accurate coupling to N-body gravity solvers, good angular momentum conservation, and
elimination of 'grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous
disks, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. All of these differences are important
for a wide range of astrophysical problems.
