The issue of analytical derivation of the mean velocity profile in a near-wall turbulent flow is
revisited in the context of a two-dimensional channel flow. An approach based on the use of dispersion
relations for the flow velocity is developed. It is shown that for an incompressible flow conserving
vorticity, there exists a decomposition of the velocity field into rotational and potential components,
such that the restriction of the former to an arbitrary cross-section of the channel is a functional
of the vorticity and velocity distributions over that cross-section, while the latter is divergence-free
and bounded downstream thereof. By eliminating the unknown potential component with the help of
a dispersion relation, a nonlinear integro-differential equation for the flow velocity is obtained.
It is then analyzed within an asymptotic expansion in the small ratio v*/U of the friction velocity
to the mean flow velocity. Upon statistical averaging in the lowest nontrivial order, this equation
relates the mean velocity to the cross-correlation function of the velocity fluctuations. Analysis
of the equation reveals existence of two continuous families of solutions, one having the near-wall
asymptotic of the form U \sim ln^p (y/y0), where y is the distance to the wall, p>0 is arbitrary,
and the other, U \sim y^n, with n>0 also arbitrary except in the limit n \to 0 where it turns out to
be a universal function of the Reynolds number, n \sim 1/ln(Re). It is proved, furthermore, that
given a mean velocity distribution having either asymptotic, one can always construct a cross-correlation
function so as to satisfy the obtained equation. These results are discussed in the light of the existing
controversy regarding experimental verification of the law of the wall.
