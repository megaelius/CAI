Spatio-temporal pattern formation in natural systems presents rich nonlinear dynamics which
lead to the emergence of periodic nonequilibrium structures. One of the most successful equations
currently available for theoretically investigating the behavior of these structures is the Swift-Hohenberg
(SH), which contains a bifurcation parameter (forcing) that controls the dynamics by changing
the energy landscape of the system. Though a large part of the literature on pattern formation addresses
uniformly forced systems, nonuniform forcings are also observed in several natural systems, for
instance, in developmental biology and in soft matter applications. In these cases, an orientation
effect due to a forcing gradient is a new factor playing a role in the development of patterns, particularly
in the class of stripe patterns, which we investigate through the nonuniformly forced SH dynamics.
The present work addresses the stability of stripes, and the competition between the orientation
effect of the gradient and other bulk, boundary, and geometric effects taking part in the selection
of the emerging patterns. A weakly nonlinear analysis shows that stripes tend to align with the gradient,
and become unstable when perpendicular to the preferred direction. This analysis is complemented
by a numerical work that accounts for other effects, confirming that stripes align, or even reorient
from preexisting conditions. However, we observe that the orientation effect does not always prevail
in face of competing effects. Other than the cubic SH equation (SH3), the quadratic-cubic (SH23)
and cubic-quintic (SH35) equations are also studied. In the SH23 case, not only do forcing gradients
lead to stripe orientation, but also interfere in the transition from hexagonal patterns to stripes.
