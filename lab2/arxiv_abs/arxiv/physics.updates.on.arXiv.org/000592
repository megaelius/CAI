We present here the quantum model of a Ni solid-state electron spin qubit on a silicon surface with
the use of a density functional scheme for calculation of the exchange integrals in the non-collinear
spin configurations in the generalized spin Hamiltonian (GSH) with the anisotropic exchange couplings
parameters linking the nickel ions with a silicon substrate. In this article we offer the model of
the quantum solid-state N-spin qubit based on the studying of the spin structure and the spin-dynamics
simulations of the 3d-metal Ni clusters on a silicon surface. The solution of the problem of the entanglement
between a spin states in N-spin systems is becoming more interesting when considering clusters
or molecules with a spectral gap in their density of states. For quantifying the distribution of
the entanglement between the individual spin eigenvalues (modes) in the spin structure of the N-spin
system we use the density of entanglement. We have studied the Rabi oscillations to evaluate the
N-spin qubits system as a function of the time and the magnetic field. We have observed the stabilized
Rabi oscillations and have stabilized the quantum dynamical qubit state and Rabi driving after
a fixed time. The comparison of the energy pattern with the anisotropic exchange models conventionally
used for the analysis of this system and, with the results of the experimental XANES spectra, shows
that our complex investigations provide a good description of the pattern of the spin levels and
the spin structures of the nanomagnetic Ni7 qubit. The results are discussed in the view of the general
problem of the solid state spin qubits and the spin structure of the Ni cluster.
