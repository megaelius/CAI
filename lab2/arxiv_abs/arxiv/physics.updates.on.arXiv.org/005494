We study the hydrodynamic forces acting on a finite-size impurity moving in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein
condensate at non-zero temperature. The condensate is modeled by the damped- Gross Pitaevskii
(dGPE) equation and the impurity by a Gaussian repulsive potential giving the coupling to the condensate.
The width of the Gaussian potential is equal to the coherence length, thus the impurity can only emit
waves. Using linear perturbation analysis, we obtain analytical expressions corresponding to
different hydrodynamic regimes which are then compared with direct numerical simulations of the
dGPE equation and with the corresponding expressions for classical forces. For a non-steady flow,
the impurity experiences a time-dependent force that, for small coupling, is dominated by the inertial
effects from the condensate and can be expressed in terms of the local material derivative of the
fluid velocity, in direct correspondence with the Maxey and Riley theory for the motion of a solid
particle in a classical fluid. In the steady-state regime, the force is dominated by a self-induced
drag. Unlike at zero temperature, where the drag force vanishes below a critical velocity, at finite
temperatures, the drag force has a net contribution from the energy dissipated in the condensate
through the thermal drag at all velocities of the impurity. At low velocities this term is similar
to the Stokes' drag in classical fluids. There is still a critical velocity above which the main drag
pertains to energy dissipation by acoustic emissions. Above this speed, the drag behaves non-monotonically
with impurity speed, reflecting the reorganization of fringes and wake around the particle.
