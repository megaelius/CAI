We explore the relevance of the celebrated Central Limit Theorem (CLT) of statistics to citation
averages, namely, Impact Factors (IF). The CLT predicts that, first, due to random fluctuations,
the range of IF values that are statistically available to a journal of size $n$, follows a $1/\sqrt[]{n}$
behavior. Large journals, whose IF's vary within a narrower range, are thus penalized in IF rankings
because they cannot achieve high IF's. Second, a scale-dependent stratification of journals is
expected from the CLT in IF rankings, whereby small journals occupy the top, middle, {\it and} bottom
ranks; mid-sized journals occupy the middle ranks; and very large journals converge to a single
IF value characteristic of the wider population of papers being sampled. Third, we apply the CLT
to arrive at the {\it `Impact Factor uncertainty relation,'} a mathematical expression for the
range of IF values expected at a given journal size. We have confirmed all these three predictions
of the CLT by analyzing the complete set of 166,498 journals listed in the 1997--2016 Journal Citation
Reports of Clarivate Analytics, the top-cited portion of 276,000 physics papers published in 2014--2015,
as well as the citation distributions of an arbitrarily sampled list of physics journals. We have
also used the Impact Factor uncertainty relation to explain the individual IF variations from year
to year for the $\sim$13,000 unique journals in the 1997--2016 period. We conclude that the CLT---via
the Impact Factor uncertainty relation---is a good predictor of the range of IF values observed
in actual journals, while sustained deviations from the expected IF range is a mark of true, i.e.,
non-random, citation impact. Due to the strength of scale dependent effects, Impact Factor rankings
are misleading unless one compares like-sized journals or adjusts for these effects, and we suggest
one way to do that here.
