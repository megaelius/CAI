We build a general formalism to describe thin viscous jets as one-dimensional objects with an internal
structure. We present in full generality the steps needed to describe the viscous jets around their
central line, and we argue that the Taylor expansion of all fields around that line is conveniently
expressed in terms of symmetric trace-free tensors living in the two dimensions of the fiber sections.
We recover the standard results of axisymmetric jets and we report the first and second corrections
to the lowest order description, also allowing for a rotational component around the axis of symmetry.
When applied to generally curved fibers, the lowest order description corresponds to a viscous
string model with circular sections. However, when including the first corrections we find that
curved jets generically develop elliptic sections. Several subtle effects imply that the first
corrections cannot be described by a rod model, since it amounts to selectively discard some corrections.
For completeness, we also recover the constitutive relations for forces and torques in rod models
and exhibit a missing term in the lowest order expression of viscous torque. Given that our method
is based on tensors, the complexity of all computations has been beaten down by using an appropriate
tensor algebra package such as {\it xAct}, allowing us to obtain a one-dimensional description
of curved viscous jets with all the first order corrections consistently included. Finally, we
find a description for straight fibers with elliptic sections as a special case of these results,
and recover that ellipticity is dynamically damped by surface tension. An application to toroidal
viscous fibers is presented in the companion paper [Pitrou, Phys. Rev. E 97, 043116 (2018)].
