We study the effect on near-wall turbulence of displacing the apparent origins perceived by different
components of the overlying flow, a mechanism common to small-textured surfaces. For riblets,
Luchini et al. (1991) proposed that their effect could be reduced to an offset between the origins
perceived by the streamwise and spanwise velocities, the latter being the origin perceived by turbulence.
Later results on superhydrophobic surfaces suggest that the apparent origin for the wall-normal
velocity could also play a role. To study this, we conduct direct simulations imposing different
virtual origins for all three velocity components using Robin, slip-like boundary conditions,
and also include a tentative discussion on virtual origins in the context of opposition control.
Our results support that the relevant parameter is the offset between the origins perceived by the
mean flow and by turbulence. In our simulations with Robin conditions, the former is determined
by the streamwise slip length, but the latter results from the combined effect of the wall-normal
and spanwise slip lengths. The slip applied on the streamwise velocity fluctuations, in turn, has
a negligible effect on the virtual origin for turbulence, and hence the drag, at least in the regime
of drag reduction. This suggests that the origin perceived by the quasi-streamwise vortices, which
induce the cross-flow velocities at the surface, is key in determining the virtual origin for turbulence,
while that perceived by the near-wall streaks, which are associated with the streamwise velocity
fluctuations, plays a secondary role. Other than the shift in origin, turbulence remains essentially
smooth-wall-like, and a simple expression can predict the virtual origin for turbulence in this
regime. The effect can be reproduced a priori by introducing the virtual origins into a smooth-wall
eddy-viscosity framework for the mean flow.
