Gauss integral theorems for electric and magnetic fields, Faradays law of electromagnetic induction,
magnetic field circulation theorem, theorems on the flux and circulation of vector potential,
which are valid in curved spacetime, are presented in a covariant form. Covariant formulas for magnetic
and electric fluxes, for electromotive force and circulation of the vector potential are provided.
In particular, the electromotive force is expressed by a line integral over a closed curve, while
in the integral, in addition to the vortex electric field strength, a determinant of the metric tensor
also appears. Similarly, the magnetic flux is expressed by a surface integral from the product of
magnetic field induction by the determinant of the metric tensor. A new physical quantity is introduced
- the integral scalar potential, the rate of change of which over time determines the flux of vector
potential through a closed surface. It is shown that the commonly used four-dimensional Kelvin-Stokes
theorem does not allow one to deduce fully the integral laws of the electromagnetic field and in the
covariant notation requires the addition of determinant of the metric tensor, besides the validity
of the Kelvin-Stokes theorem is limited to the cases when determinant of metric tensor and the contour
area are independent from time. This disadvantage is not present in the approach that uses the divergence
theorem and equation for the dual electromagnetic field tensor. A new effect is predicted, according
to which the circulation of magnetic field can appear even in the absence of electric current and
with a constant electric field through the contour, if the area of this contour would change. By analogy
with electromagnetic induction, for the magnetic field circulation to appear it is important that
electric field flux that passes through the area of the contour would change over time.
