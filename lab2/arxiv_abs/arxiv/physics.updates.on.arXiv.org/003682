GDP of China is about 11 trillion dollars and GDP of the United States is about 18 trillion dollars.
Suppose that we know for the coming years, economy of the US will experience a real growth rate equal
to \%3 and economy of China will experience a real growth as of \%6. Now, the question is how long does
it take for economy of China to catch the economy of the United States. The early impression is that
the desired time is the answer of the equation $11\times1.06^X=18\times1.03^X$. The correct answer
however is quite different. GDP is not a simple number and the gap between two countries can not be
addressed simply through their sizes. It is rather a geometrical object. Countries pass different
paths in the space of production. The gaps between GDP of different countries depend on the path that
each country passes through and local metric. To address distance between economies of China and
of the US we need to know their utility preferences and the path that China passes to reach the US size.
The true gap then can be found if we calculate local metric along this path. It resembles impressions
about measurements in the General Theory of Relativity. Path dependency of aggregate indexes is
widely discussed in the Index Number Theory. Our aim is to stick to the geometrical view presented
in the General Relativity to provide a visual understanding of the matter. We show that different
elements in the general relativity have their own counterparts in economics. We claim that national
agencies who provide aggregate data resemble falling observers into a curved space time. It is while
the World Bank or international organizations are outside observers. The vision provided here,
leaves readers with a clear conclusion. If China keeps its growth rate, then the economy of China
should catch the economy of the United States sooner than what we expect.
