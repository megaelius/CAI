We use a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar wind to calculate cosmic
ray diffusion coefficients throughout the inner heliosphere ($2~R_\odot - 3$ AU). The simulation
resolves large-scale solar wind flow, which is coupled to small-scale fluctuations through a turbulence
model. Simulation results specify background solar wind fields and turbulence parameters, which
are used to compute diffusion coefficients and study their behavior in the inner heliosphere. The
parallel mean free path is evaluated using quasi-linear theory, while the perpendicular mean free
path is determined by non-linear guiding center theory with the random ballistic interpretation.
Several runs examine varying turbulent energy and different solar source dipole tilts. We find
that for most of the inner heliosphere, the radial mean free path (mfp) is dominated by diffusion
parallel to the mean magnetic field; the parallel mfp remains at least an order of magnitude larger
than the perpendicular mfp, except in the heliospheric current sheet, where the perpendicular
mfp may be a few times larger than the parallel mfp; in the ecliptic region, the perpendicular mfp
may influence the radial mfp at heliocentric distances larger than 1.5 AU; our estimations of the
parallel mfp in the ecliptic region at 1 AU agree well with the Palmer "consensus" range of $0.08 -
0.3$ AU; solar activity increases perpendicular diffusion and reduces parallel diffusion; the
parallel mfp varies with rigidity $(P)$ as $P^{.33}$, and the perpendicular mfp is weakly dependent
on $P$; the mfps are weakly influenced by the choice of long wavelength power spectra.
