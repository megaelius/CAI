Adequate fetal and neonatal development depend upon the presence of a normal acid-base environment
during pregnancy and the smooth transition from intra-uterine to extra-uterine life. Current
methods to assess fetal pH and acid-base status are invasive and carry significant maternal and
fetal risks. Given these limitations, obstetrical care providers developed the electronic fetal
monitoring (EFM) system, a non-invasive tool, which evaluates beat-to-beat fetal heart rate (FHR)
patterns in order to predict fetal oxygenation status in real-time. Every year, about 85 percent
of the approximately 4 million live births in the United States are evaluated using EFM. Unfortunately,
though there is ample physiological evidence that FHR patterns are inextricably linked to fetal
acid-base status, the use of EFM has not been shown to reliably predict neonatal pH, nor has it reduced
the incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes, including long-term neurological morbidity and
cerebral palsy (CP). The poor specificity associated with the current interpretation of the EFM
therefore leads to a paradox we have henceforth defined as the Obstetrical Paradox. In this study,
we develop and seek to determine whether a novel, non-invasive method known as the FETAL technique
(Fourier Evaluation of Tracings and Acidosis in Labor), which applies the Fourier Transform to
EFM tracings and determines the spectral frequency distributions of the FHR, improves the assessment
of the fetal pH in real time. We hypothesize that the improvement in the sensitivity and specificity
of the EFM with the use of the FETAL technique will lead to a significant reduction in the rate of neonatal
hypoxic injury and in the rate of caesarean deliveries for suspected fetal distress. The implications
of a successful application of the FETAL technique would have paradigm-shifting consequences
in the provision of modern obstetrical care.
