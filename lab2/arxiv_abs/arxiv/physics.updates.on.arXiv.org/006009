For accurate estimates of the falling time of water droplets in air, evaporation must be taken into
account, which involves different effects. For droplet radii in the range 100 nm < R < 60 $\mu$m, evaporation
can be described by the stagnant-flow approximation and is diffusion limited. For droplets smaller
than R=100 nm, evaporation becomes rate limited. For radii larger than 60 $\mu$m, the Stokes description
of the air-flow profile around the droplet becomes invalid and non-linear hydrodynamic effects
produce a flow boundary layer. Also, the air flow accelerates water diffusion away from the droplet,
which can be described by a concentration boundary layer. Thus, for droplets larger than R=60 $\mu$m,
the evaporation process is described by a double-boundary layer scenario, but stays diffusion-limited.
Analytical equations are presented for the droplet evaporation rate and the time-dependent droplet
size including the significant droplet cooling due to evaporation. For an initial height of 2 meters
and a relative humidity RH=1/2, droplets with radii below 49 $\mu$m shrink rapidly down to a minimal
radius due to evaporation during their descent to the floor and remain floating in air for a long time.
In the presence of non-volatile solutes in the droplets, the final droplet radius and thus the time
droplets remain floating in air, depends on the initial solute fraction. Low relative humidity,
as encountered inside buildings in winter and in airliners, speeds up evaporation and thus keeps
initially larger droplets suspended in air. Recent time-resolved laser light-scattering experiments
show that a large number of droplets of oral fluid are emitted into the air while speaking (1). For
a quantitative assessment of the lifetime of oral fluid droplets, it is important to measure the
time-resolved size distribution of emitted droplets while speaking and coughing and their virion
content.
