A near-field microwave imaging system attempts to reveal the presence of an object and/or an electrical
property distribution by measuring the scattered field from many positions surrounding the object.
Over the past few decades, both the hardware and software components of a near-field microwave imaging
system technology have attracted interest throughout the world. Due to limitations of hardware
technology (unavailability of data acquisition apparatus), experimental microwave imaging
is very challenging for the pioneers. However, Probably due to the hardware cost, most of the studies
(operating at a few GHz) were still focused on software only. The feasibility of using microwave
approaches to image different types of objects have been tested and verified by simulations in a
variety of applications. Further, work has been conducted on improving both quantitative and qualitative
algorithms to improve simulated reconstruction results. Nowadays, benefitting from the hardware
progress and reduction of their cost, researchers are eager to pursue real experimental validations
instead of simulations, and, more unique prototypes and commercial systems have been built for
various applications. These prototypes and systems are a result of years of dedicated work and it
is important to review the advancements in developed prototype systems. The article will provide
an overview of the many of the systems designed from different research groups throughout the world,
for applications of near-field microwave imaging. The article further outlines challenges faced
in current microwave near-field imaging, developmental tendencies of engineers and scientists,
and the future outlook.
