In this research work the quantum theory of Ur-alternatives of Carl Friedrich von Weizs\"acker
is considered. In This theory all objects and interactions in nature are constituted by abstract
purely quantum logical relations in time. Such structures can be devided into binary alternatives,
which are called Ur-Alternatives with respect to this principle meaning, and this leads to a tensor
space of many Ur-alternatives. The indistinguishability of the Ur-alternatives yields two Hilbert
spaces, the tensor space of symmetric and antisymmetric states under permutations of the Ur-alternatives.
It is shown how the structures in the symmetric space can be represented in a three dimensional real
position space connected to time according to special relativity. Accordingly this theory obtains
ultimately a deep understanding of the EPR-paradox, since logic is independent of topological
structures and causal relations in space. The antisymmetric space, which because of the Pauli principle
contains much less degress of freedem, yields the additional quantum numbers of the elementary
particles. Based on the demand for the highest possible symmetry in the tensor space, the Yang-Mills
gauge theories of the standard model as well as a translational gauge formulation of general relativity
in a purely quantum logical description are derived. The equations determine entanglements of
states containing many Ur-alternatives and this concept is the analogue to classical pointwise
interactions between separated objects. This means that the main structures of the SU(N)-interactions
of the standard model of elementary particle physics as well as gravitation according to general
relativiy are unified in a purely quantum theoretical conceptional framework. Finally it is derived
an extended version of the E8-group, the biggest exceptional Lie-group.
