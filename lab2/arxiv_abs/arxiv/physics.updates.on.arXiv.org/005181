NiO layers were grown on MgO(100), MgO(110), and MgO(111) substrates by plasma-assisted molecular
beam epitaxy under Ni-flux limited growth conditions. Single crystalline growth with a cube-on-cube
epitaxial relationship was confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements for all used growth conditions
and substrates except MgO(111). A detailed growth series on MgO(100) was prepared using substrate
temperatures ranging from 20 {\deg}C to 900 {\deg}C to investigate the influence on the layer characteristics.
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated close-to-stoichiometric layers with an oxygen
content of ~47 at. % and ~50 at. % grown under low and high O-flux, respectively. All NiO layers had
a root-mean-square surface roughness below 1 nm, measured by atomic force microscopy, except for
rougher layers grown at 900 {\deg}C or using molecular oxygen. Growth at 900 {\deg}C led to a significant
diffusion of Mg from the substrate into the film. The relative intensity of the quasi-forbidden
one-phonon Raman peak is introduced as a gauge of the crystal quality, indicating the highest layer
quality for growth at low oxygen flux and high growth temperature, likely due to the resulting high
adatom diffusion length during growth. The optical and electrical properties were investigated
by spectroscopic ellipsometry and resistance measurements, respectively. All NiO layers were
transparent with an optical bandgap around 3.6 eV and semi-insulating at room temperature. However,
changes upon exposure to reducing or oxidizing gases of the resistance of a representative layer
at elevated temperature were able to confirm p-type conductivity, highlighting their suitability
as a model system for research on oxide-based gas sensing.
