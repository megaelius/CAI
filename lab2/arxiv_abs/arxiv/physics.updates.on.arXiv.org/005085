Laser frequency actuation is critical in all applications using lasers for sensing, metrology
and communications, and is required for phase locking, laser stabilization and stability transfer
among multiple optical carriers. Soliton microcombs have emerged as chip-scale, broadband and
low-power-consumption frequency comb sources, and have been employed in several system-level
demonstrations. Yet, integrated microcombs relying on thermal heaters for on-chip actuation
all exhibit limited tuning capability of only kilohertz actuation bandwidth. Consequently, high-speed
actuation and locking of integrated microcombs have been attained only with off-chip bulk modulators.
Here, we demonstrate a monolithic approach for voltage-controlled soliton initiation, tuning
and stabilization, achieved by monolithically integrating piezoelectric AlN actuators on ultralow-loss
Si3N4 photonic waveguides. The AlN actuators feature bi-directional tuning with high linearity
and low hysteresis, and operate with 300 nW power consumption and flat actuation response up to 0.6
MHz. We use this novel capability to demonstrate a microcomb engine for parallel continuous-wave
frequency modulated LiDAR via synchronously tuning the laser and microresonator. By leveraging
high-overtone bulk acoustic resonances, our AlN actuators enable triangular modulation of soliton
microcombs with 18 MHz modulation rate at a CMOS-compatible driving voltage of 7.5 V. Our approach
endows soliton microcombs with integrated, ultralow-power-consumption, and fast actuation,
significantly expanding the repertoire of technological applications of microcombs.
