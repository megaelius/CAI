To process nonlinear and non-stationary signals, an extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition
(ESMD) method is developed. It can be seen as a new alternate of the well-known Hilbert-Huang transform
(HHT) method which is widely used nowadays. There are two parts for it. The first part is the decomposition
approach which yields a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) together with an optimal adaptive
global mean (AGM) curve, the second part is the direct interpolating (DI) approach which yields
instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies for the IMFs together with a time-varying energy. Relative
to the HHT method it has five characteristics as follows: (1) Different from constructing 2 outer
envelopes, its sifting process is implemented by the aid of 1, 2 or 3 inner interpolating curves;
(2) It does not decompose the signal to the last trend curve with at most one extreme point, it optimizes
the residual component to be an optimal AGM curve which possesses a certain number of extreme points;
(3) Its symmetry concept has wider extension than the envelop symmetry; (4) Its definition of IMF
is more general; (5) The Hilbert-spectral-analysis approach is substituted by the data-based
DI one. This new approach can not only yield clear distribution for instantaneous frequency and
amplitude but also reflect the time-variation of the total energy in a distinct way. Besides the
decomposition, the ESMD method also offers a good adaptive approach for finding the optimal global
mean fitting curve to a given data. It is superior to the commonly used least-square method and the
running-mean approach. We note here that the type of interpolation is not an essential factor, the
approach developed here is also suitable for envelop-symmetric scheme adopted by the HHT method.
