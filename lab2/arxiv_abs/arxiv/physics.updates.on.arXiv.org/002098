Markers of brittle faulting are widely used for recovering past deformation phases. Rocks often
have oriented magnetic fabrics, which can be interpreted as connected to ductile deformation before
cementation of the sediment. This paper reports a novel statistical procedure for simultaneous
evaluation of AMS (Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility) and fault-slip data.The new method
analyzes the AMS data, without linearization techniques, so that weak AMS lineation and rotational
AMS can be assessed that are beyond the scope of classical methods. This idea is extended to the evaluation
of fault-slip data. While the traditional assumptions of stress inversion are not rejected, the
method recovers the stress field via statistical hypothesis testing. In addition it provides statistical
information needed for the combined evaluation of the AMS and the mesotectonic (0.1 to 10m) data.
In the combined evaluation a statistical test is carried out that helps to decide if the AMS lineation
and the mesotectonic markers (in case of repeated deformation of the oldest set of markers) were
formed in the same or different deformation phases. If this condition is met, the combined evaluation
can improve the precision of the reconstruction. When the two data sets do not have a common solution
for the direction of the extension, the deformational origin of the AMS is questionable. In this
case the orientation of the stress field responsible for the AMS lineation might be different from
that which caused the brittle deformation. Although most of the examples demonstrate the reconstruction
of weak deformations in sediments, the new method is readily applicable to investigate the ductile-brittle
transition of any rock formation as long as AMS and fault-slip data are available.
