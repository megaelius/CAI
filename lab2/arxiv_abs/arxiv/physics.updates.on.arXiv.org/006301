Response modes computed via linear resolvent analysis of the turbulent mean-flow field have been
shown to qualitatively capture characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures
in both wall-bounded and free shear flows. To make such models predictive, the nonlinear forcing
term must be closed either by including a self-consistent set of triadic interactions or through
turbulence modeling. For the latter, several investigators have proposed using the mean-field
eddy viscosity acting linearly on the fluctuation field. In this study, a data-driven approach
is taken to quantitatively improve linear resolvent models by deducing an optimal eddy-viscosity
field that maximizes the projection of the dominant resolvent mode to the energy-optimal coherent
structure educed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity
simulations. We use large-eddy simulation databases for round isothermal jets at subsonic, transonic,
and supersonic conditions and show that the optimal eddy viscosity substantially improves the
alignment between resolvent and SPOD modes, reaching over 90% alignment at those frequencies where
the jet exhibits a low-rank response. We then consider a fixed model for the eddy viscosity and show
that with the calibration of a single constant, the results are generally close to the optimal one.
In particular, the use of a standard Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) eddy-viscosity
resolvent model, with a single scaling coefficient, provides substantial agreement between SPOD
and resolvent modes for three turbulent jets and across the most energetic wavenumbers and frequencies.
