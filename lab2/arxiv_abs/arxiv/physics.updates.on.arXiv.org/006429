Thanks to the broadband nature of the Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) measurement, a roadside
section of the Stanford DAS-2 array can record seismic signals from various sources. For example,
it measures the earth's quasi-static distortion caused by the weight of cars (<0.8 Hz), and Rayleigh
waves induced by earthquakes (<3 Hz) and by dynamic car-road interactions (3-20 Hz). We directly
utilize the excited surface waves for shallow shear-wave velocity inversion. Rayleigh waves induced
by passing cars have a consistent fundamental mode and a noisier first mode. By stacking dispersion
images of 33 passing cars, we obtain stable dispersion images. The frequency range of the fundamental
mode can be extended by adding the low-frequency earthquake-induced Rayleigh waves. Thanks to
the extended frequency range, we can achieve better depth coverage and resolution for shear-wave
velocity inversion. In order to assure clear separation from Love waves and aligning apparent velocity
with phase velocity, we choose an earthquake that is approximately in line with the array. The inverted
models match those obtained by a conventional geophone survey performed by a geotechnical service
company contracted by Stanford University using active sources from the surface until about 50
meters. In order to automate the Vs inversion process, we introduce a new objective function that
avoids manual dispersion curve picking. We construct a 2-D Vs profile by performing independent
1-D inversions at multiple locations along the fiber. From the low-frequency quasi-static distortion
recordings, we invert for a single Poisson's ratio at each location along the fiber. We observe spatial
heterogeneity of both Vs and Poisson's ratio profiles. Our approach is dramatically cheaper than
ambient field interferometry and reliable estimates can be obtained more frequently as no lengthy
cross-correlations are required.
