One of the directly measured quantities which are used in monitoring the orbital motions of many
of the S stars revolving around the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) in the Galactic Center (GC) is
their radial velocity (RV) $V$ obtained with near-infrared spectroscopy. Here, we devise a general
approach to calculate both the instantaneous variations $\Delta V\left(t\right)$ and the net
shifts per revolution $\left\langle\Delta V\right\rangle$ induced on such an observable by some
post-Keplerian (pK) accelerations. In particular, we look at the general relativistic Schwarzschild
(gravitoelectric) and Lense-Thirring (gravitomagnetic frame-dragging) effects, and the mass
quadrupole. It turns out that we may be on the verge of measuring the Schwarzschild-type 1pN static
component of the SMBH's field with the S2 star for which RV measurements accurate to about $\simeq
30-50~\textrm{km s}^{-1}$ dating back to $t_0 = 2003.271$ are currently available, and whose orbital
period amounts to $P_\textrm{b} = 16$ yr. Indeed, while its expected general relativistic RV net
shift per orbit amounts to just $\left\langle\Delta V^\textrm{GE}\right\rangle = -11.6~\textrm{km
s}^{-1}$, it should reach a peak value as large as $\Delta V_\textrm{max}^\textrm{GE}\left(t_\textrm{max}\right)
= 551~\textrm{km s}^{-1}$ at $t_\textrm{max} = 2018.35$. The periastron shift $\Delta\omega^\textrm{GE}$
of S2 over the same time span will not be larger than $0.2$ deg, while the current accuracy in estimating
such an orbital element for this star is of the order of $0.6$ deg. The frame-dragging and quadrupole-induced
RV shifts are far smaller for S2, amounting to, at most, $0.19~\textrm{km s}^{-1},0.0039~\textrm{km
s}^{-1}$, respectively. Further studies should be dedicated to the impact on the RV of possible
diffused mass distribution in the GC and of other individual stars inside and outside the orbit of
S2.
