Cold atmospheric plasmas (CAP) are weakly ionized gases that can be generated in ambient air. They
produce energetic species (e.g. electrons, metastables) as well as reactive oxygen species, reactive
nitrogen species, UV radiations and local electric field. Their interaction with a liquid such
as tap water can hence change its chemical composition. The resulting "plasma-activated liquid"
can meet many applications, including medicine and agriculture. Consequently, a complete experimental
set of analytical techniques dedicated to the characterization of long lifetime chemical species
has been implemented to characterize tap water treated using CAP process and intended to agronomy
applications. For that purpose, colorimetry and acid titrations are performed, considering acid-base
equilibria, pH and temperature variations induced during plasma activation. 16 species are quantified
and monitored: hydroxide and hydronium ions, ammonia and ammonium ions, orthophosphates, carbonate
ions, nitrite and nitrate ions and hydrogen peroxide. The related consumption/production mechanisms
are discussed. In parallel, a chemical model of electrical conductivity based on Kohlrausch's
law has been developed to simulate the electrical conductivity of the plasma-activated tap water
(PATW). Comparing its predictions with experimental measurements leads to a narrow fitting, hence
supporting the self-sufficiency of the experimental set. Finally, to evaluate the potential of
cold atmospheric plasmas for agriculture applications, tap water has been daily plasma-treated
to irrigate lentils seeds. Then, seedlings lengths have been measured and compared with untreated
tap water, showing an increase as high as 34.0% and 128.4% after 3 days and 6 days of activation respectively.
The interaction mechanisms between plasma and tap water are discussed as well as their positive
synergy on agronomic results.
