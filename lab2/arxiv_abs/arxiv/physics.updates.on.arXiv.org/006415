The article reports droplet evaporation kinetics on inclined substrates. Comprehensive experimental
and theoretical analyses of the droplet evaporation behaviour for different substrate declination,
wettability and temperatures have been presented. Sessile droplets with substrate declination
exhibit distorted shape and evaporate at different rates compared to droplets on the same horizontal
substrate and is characterized by more often changes in regimes of evaporation. The slip stick and
jump stick modes are prominent during evaporation. For droplets on inclined substrates, the evaporative
flux is also asymmetric and governed by the initial contact angle dissimilarity. Due to smaller
contact angle at the rear contact line, it is the zone of a higher evaporative flux. Particle image
velocimetry shows the increased internal circulation velocity within the inclined droplets.
Asymmetry in the evaporative flux leads to higher temperature gradients, which ultimately enhances
the thermal Marangoni circulation near the rear of the droplet where the evaporative flux is highest.
A model is adopted to predict the thermal Marangoni advection velocity, and good match is obtained.
The declination angle and imposed thermal conditions interplay and lead to morphed evaporation
kinetics than droplets on horizontal heated surfaces. Even weak movements of the TL alter the evaporation
dynamics significantly, by changing the shape of the droplet from ideally elliptical to almost
spherical cap, which ultimately reduces the evaporative flux. The life time of the droplet is modelled
by modifying available models for non-heated substrate, to account for the shape asymmetry. The
present findings may find strong implications towards microscale thermo-hydrodynamics.
