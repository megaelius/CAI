A series of direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, the flow in a fluid layer
heated from below and cooled from above, were conducted to investigate the effect of mixed insulating
and conducting boundary conditions on convective flows. Rayleigh numbers between $\text{Ra}=10^7$
and $\text{Ra}=10^9$ were considered, for Prandtl numbers $\text{Pr}=1$ and $\text{Pr}=10$.
The bottom plate was divided into patterns of conducting and insulating stripes. The size ratio
between these stripes was fixed to unity and the total number of stripes was varied. Global quantities
such as the heat transport and average bulk temperature and local quantities such as the temperature
just below the insulating boundary wall were investigated. For the case with the top boundary divided
into two halves, one conducting and one insulating, the heat transfer was found to be approximately
two thirds of the fully conducting case. Increasing the pattern frequency increased the heat transfer
which asymptotically approached the fully conducting case, even if only half of the surface is conducting.
Fourier analysis of the temperature field revealed that the imprinted pattern of the plates is diffused
in the thermal boundary layers, and cannot be detected in the bulk. With conducting-insulating
patterns on both plates, the trends previously described were similar, however, the half-and-half
division led to a heat transfer of about a half of the fully conducting case instead of two-thirds.
The effect of the ratio of conducting and insulating areas was also analyzed, and it was found that
even for systems with a top plate with only $25\%$ conducting surface, heat-transport of $60\%$
of the fully conducting case can be seen. Changing the 1D stripe pattern to 2D checkerboard tessellations
does not result in a significantly different response of the system.
