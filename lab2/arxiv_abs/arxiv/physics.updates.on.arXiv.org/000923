Room temperature operation is mandatory for any optoelectronics technology which aims to provide
low-cost compact systems for widespread applications. In recent years, an important technological
effort in this direction has been made in bolometric detection for thermal imaging$^1$, which has
delivered relatively high sensitivity and video rate performance ($\sim$ 60 Hz). However, room
temperature operation is still beyond reach for semiconductor photodetectors in the 8-12 $\mu$m
wavelength band$^2$, and all developments for applications such as imaging, environmental remote
sensing and laser-based free-space communication$^{3-5}$ have therefore had to be realised at
low temperatures. For these devices, high sensitivity and high speed have never been compatible
with high temperature operation$^{6, 7}$. Here, we show that a 9 $\mu$m quantum well infrared photodetector$^8$,
implemented in a metamaterial made of subwavelength metallic resonators$^{9-12}$, has strongly
enhanced performances up to room temperature. This occurs because the photonic collection area
is increased with respect to the electrical area for each resonator, thus significantly reducing
the dark current of the device$^{13}$. Furthermore, we show that our photonic architecture overcomes
intrinsic limitations of the material, such as the drop of the electronic drift velocity with temperature$^{14,
15}$, which constrains conventional geometries at cryogenic operation$^6$. Finally, the reduced
physical area of the device and its increased responsivity allows us, for the first time, to take
advantage of the intrinsic high frequency response of the quantum detector$^7$ at room temperature.
By beating two quantum cascade lasers$^{16}$ we have measured the heterodyne signal at high frequencies
up to 4 GHz.
