Wireless communication has become a standard solution to address ever-increasing demands for
information transfer in our modern society. Conventional systems work in an active way in the sense
that an active carrier signal is mandatorily required to transfer information from Alice to Bob.
Especially in the era of 5G6G and with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), an exponential growth
of users and connectivity confronts conventional systems with important challenges including
limited spectrum resources, information security, energy consumption and cost efficiency. Here,
we introduce the fundamentally different concept of passive wireless communication (PWC) which
has the potential to resolve the above-mentioned issues. PWC transfers digital information by
modulating demodulating already existing omnipresent ambient stray electromagnetic waves using
a programmable metasurface. We provide a theoretical framework for encoding decoding and modulating
demodulating in PWC and build a proof-of-principle prototype system leveraging existing commodity
2.4GHz Wi-Fi signals. We demonstrate information transfer from Alice to Bob with data rates on the
order of hundreds of Kbps using distinguishable information-carrying control coding patterns
of metasurface, neither necessitating an active carrier signal and its associated radio-frequency
chain nor affecting the background active wireless communication. The presented strategy is particularly
appealing for green IoT connectivity. At the same time, the concept is applicable to all types of
wave phenomena and provides a fundamentally new perspective on the design of future wireless communication
architectures.
