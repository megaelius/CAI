Localized orbitals are important for modeling and interpreting complicated electronic structures
of atoms and molecules in a chemically meaningful way. Here, we present the parameter-free procedure
for transforming delocalized molecular orbitals (either canonical self-consistent field orbitals,
or Lowdin natural orbitals obtained from a general wavefunction) into the localized property-optimized
orbitals (LPOs), which can be used for building the most accurate (in the Frobenius norm sense) approximation
to the first-order reduced density matrix in form of the sum of localized mono- and diatomic terms.
In this way any, any one-electron molecular property can be decomposed into contributions associated
with individual atoms and the pairs of atoms, with the upper bound for the decomposition acucracy
known in advance due to Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality. In addition, an algorithm is proposed
for obtaining 'the Chemist's LPOs' (CLPOs) set of localized orbitals containing a single orbital
per a pair of electrons and forming an idealized Lewis structure with the one-electron properties
which are closest to the properties obtained from the original many-electron wavefunction. The
computational algorithms for constructing LPOs and CLPOs as well as their underlying atomic hybrid
orbitals (AHOs and LHOs respectively) from the results of quantum-chemical calculations are presented
and their implementation within the open-source freeware program JANPA (this http URL ) is discussed.
The performance of the proposed orbital localization procedures is assessed using the test set
of density matrices of 33432 small molecules obtained at Hartree-Fock and 2-nd order Moller-Plesset
theory levels.
