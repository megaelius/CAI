A series of laboratory experiments on energy conserving gravity currents in a lock-exchange facility
are conducted for a range of Reynolds numbers, $Re= \frac{U_Fh}{\nu} =$ 485-12270. The velocity
and density fields are captured simultaneously using a PIV-PLIF system. A moving average method
is employed to compute the mean field and a host of turbulence statistics, namely, turbulent kinetic
energy ($K$), shear production ($P$), buoyancy flux ($B$), and energy dissipation ($\epsilon$)
during the slumping phase of the current. The subsequent findings are used to ascertain the quantitative
values of mixing efficiency, $Ri_{f}$, Ozmidov length-scale ($L_O$), Kolmogorov length-scale
($L_\kappa$), and eddy diffusivities of momentum ($\kappa_m$) and scalar ($\kappa_\rho$). Two
different forms of $Ri_{f}$ are characterized in this study, denoted by $Ri_{f}^I=\frac{B}{P}$
and $Ri_{f}^{II}=\frac{B}{B+\epsilon}$. The results cover the entire diffusive regime (3 $<Re_b<$
10) and a portion of the intermediate regime (10 $<Re_b<$ 50), where $Re_b=\frac{\epsilon}{\nu
N^2}$ is the buoyancy Reynolds number that measures the level of turbulence in a shear-stratified
flow. The values of $P$, $B$, and $\epsilon$ show a marked increase at the interface of the ambient
fluid and the current, owing to the development of a shear-driven mixed layer. Based on the changes
in the turbulence statistics and the length scales, it is inferred that the turbulence decays along
the length of the current. The mixing efficiency monotonically increases in the diffusive regime
($Re_{b}<$10), and is found to have an upper bound of $Ri_{f}^{I}\approx$ 0.15 and $Ri_{f}^{II}\approx$
0.2 in the intermediate regime. Using the values of $Ri_{f}$, the normalized eddy diffusivity of
momentum is parameterized as $\frac{\kappa_m}{\nu.Ri_{g}}$=1.2$Re_{b}$ and normalized eddy
diffusivity of scalar as $\frac{\kappa_{\rho}}{\nu}$=0.2$Re_{b}$
