This study uses a deep learning approach to forecast ozone concentrations over Seoul, South Korea
for 2017. We employ a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We apply this method to predict the
hourly ozone concentration on each day for the entire year using several predictors from the previous
day, including the wind fields, temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and precipitation,
along with in-situ ozone and NO2 concentrations. We refer to a history of all observed parameters
between 2014 and 2016 for training the predictive models. Model-measurement comparisons for the
25 monitoring sites for the year 2017 report average indexes of agreement (IOA) of 0.84-0.89 and
a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.74-0.81, indicating reasonable performance for the CNN
forecasting model. Although the CNN model successfully captures daily trends as well as yearly
high and low variations of the ozone concentrations, it notably underpredicts high ozone peaks
during the summer. The forecasting results are generally more accurate for the stations located
in the southern regions of the Han River, the result of more stable topographical and meteorological
conditions. Furthermore, through two separate daytime and nighttime forecasts, we find that the
monthly IOA of the CNN model is 0.05-0.30 higher during the daytime, resulting from the unavailability
of some of the input parameters during the nighttime. While the CNN model can predict the next 24 hours
of ozone concentrations within less than a minute, we identify several limitations of deep learning
models for real-time air quality forecasting for further improvement.
