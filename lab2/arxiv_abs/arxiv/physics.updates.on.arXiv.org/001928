Optics is limited in the 'ray-approximation'-inclusion of wave properties result in additional
phenomena and applications; interferometers and diffraction gratings are two manifestations
of such non-geometric, physical optics. Incidentally, the most precise measurement ever, at one
part per 10^21 in the (2017) Nobel winning discovery of gravitational waves was achieved with an
interferometer. Amendments to the properties of the medium promise negative refractive index
meta-materials, perfect imaging, light cloaking, and other ultra-natural marvels. Attention
to photon phase, correlations, statistics and wavelength independent phase shifts result in singular
optics, quantum optics and anholonomy. Here we present another possibility, namely 'Arago-optics'
to maximize the efficacy of a device by strategically deploying the key qualities along its perimeter.
For instance, in conventional sources, waves are generated with maximum intensity at the core;
whereas in an Arago-source, intensity is minimal or zero at the center, but highest on villus stretches
at the margins. We reason that for a given size and energy output, this radiation profile, produces
the highest concentration of energy at the focus, with the maximal confinement of the wave packet.
Likewise, the utmost detector resolution is attained when sensitivity is highest on the perimeter
and less at the center. This concept holds beyond ultra-focus and Gaussian beams, but generally
applies to beams of 'waves' that show constructive and destructive interference. The idea is particularly
well suited for a fresh integration of geometry and topology with electronics and materials into
real-time wave engineering.
