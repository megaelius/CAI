A sixteen channel millimeter-wave diagnostic system, covering the frequency range 30-75 GHz,
has been installed on MAST [B. Lloyd et al., Nucl. Fusion 43, 1665 (2003)] and has been successfully
used for both Doppler backscattering (DBS) and conventional (normal-incidence) fluctuation
reflectometry. DBS has become a well-established and versatile diagnostic technique for the measurement
of intermediate- k ($k_{\bot} \rho_i \sim 1$, and higher) density fluctuations and flows in magnetically
confined fusion experiments. The $180^{\circ}$ backscattering for DBS requires three dimensional
wave-vector matching between the launched beam and the plasma fluctuations inducing the scattering,
which are expected to be highly elongated along the magnetic field. The large pitch angle in MAST
means that DBS implementation depends strongly on the capability to accurately launch the probing
beam at a toroidal and poloidal angle that is matched to the magnetic field at the scattering location.
We report on the scattering considerations and ray tracing calculations used to optimize the design,
a description of the implementation including 2D beam steering, and present initial data demonstrating
measurement capabilities and comparing to optimization calculations. Initial results confirm
the applicability of the design and implementation approaches, showing the dependence of scattering
alignment on toroidal launch angle and demonstrating DBS is sensitive to the local magnetic field
pitch angle. We also present comparisons of DBS plasma velocity measurements with charge exchange
recombination and beam emission spectroscopy measurements, which show good agreement in most
cases. The 2D steering is shown to enable high-k measurements with DBS, at $k_{\bot}>20\ \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$
($k_{\bot} \rho_i>10$) for launch frequencies less than 75 GHz.
