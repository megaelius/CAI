Direct numerical simulations two-way coupled with inertial particles are used to investigate
the particle distribution and two-way coupling effect of low-inertia ($St_{LSM}=0.0625$, $St_{VLSM}=0.009$)
and high-inertia ($St_{LSM}=0.475$, $St_{VLSM}=0.069$) particles associated with the large-scale
motions (LSMs) and very-large-scale motions (VLSMs) in an open channel flow at a Reynolds number
of $Re_\tau = 550$. One method of filtering the VLSMs from the flow is via artificial domain truncation,
which alters the mean particle concentration profile and particle clustering due to the removal
of VLSMs from a large domain simulation. In order to exclude possible correlation of the turbulence
introduced by a small domain size with periodic boundary conditions, low- and high-pass filtering
is performed during the simulation to isolate the particle interaction with different spatial
scales. The results show that particle accumulation and turbophoresis are under-predicted without
VLSMs, whereas the particle clustering and two-way coupling effects are mainly determined by particle
coupling with LSMs. In the inner layer, the elongated streamwise anisotropic particle clustering
can be reproduced by particles coupling solely with LSMs for low Stokes number ($St_{LSM}=0.0625$)
particles. However, we do not observe similar particle clustering behavior in the outer layer as
seen in the full simulation by coupling particles with either LSMs or VLSMs for high Stokes number
($St_{VLSM}=0.069$) particles. This indicates that the organized particle structures are formed
by the joint action of LSMs and VLSMs, especially for high Stokes number particles in the outer layer.
