The energy consumption of buildings is increasing at a rapid pace due to urbanization, while net-zero
energy buildings powered by renewable sources offer a green and sustainable solution. However,
the limited rooftop space available on skyscrapers and multi-story buildings poses a challenge
for large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic modules. Conventional photovoltaics solutions
such as silicon solar panels block the visible light from entering the building rending them unfeasible
to cover all building surfaces. Here, we demonstrate a novel dielectric metasurface (based-on
silicon nitride grating) acting as a planar light concentrator. We integrate this functional device
onto a window glass transmitting visible light while simultaneously guiding the near infrared
portion (NIR) of sunlight to the edges of the glass window where it can be converted to electricity
by a small PV module. Utilizing the grating design flexibility, we tune the spectra to enable guiding
of the near NIR sunlight portion and realize polarization independence demonstrated using finite
difference time domain simulations. Experimentally, we observe about 5.25% of optical guiding
efficiency in the NIR region (700-1000 nm), leaving majority of the visible portion to be transmitted
for natural room lighting. Integrating the solar cell at the window edge, we find a power conversion
efficiency of about 4.2% of NIR light on a prototype of area 25 mm 2. We confirm that the majority of
the loss is due to the absorption, scattering and fabrication non-uniformity over large area which
can be further optimized in future. Such a functional window combining renewable energy generation,
with room lighting, and building-envelope reduction could mitigate urban heat-islanding issues
of modern cities.
