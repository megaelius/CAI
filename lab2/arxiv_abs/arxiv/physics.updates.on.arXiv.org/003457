In wide-field nonlinear microscopy, wavefront modulation by means of phase-only spatial light
modulators (SLMs) allows achieving simultaneous two-photon excitation and fluorescence emission
from specific region-of-interests (ROIs) of biological specimens. This is basically accomplished
at the illumination path of the microscope by the reconstruction of computer generated holograms
(CGHs) onto the sample plane. However, as two-photon absorption (TPA) is inherently an intensity-square
dependent process and iterative Fourier transform algorithms (IFTAs) can only approximate the
illumination of selected ROIs with the reconstructed CGHs, both signal acquisition and/or image
formation can be largely affected by the spatial irregularities of the illumination patterns.
In addition, the speckle associated with the superposition of coherent light at the selected ROIs
prevents illumination strategies based on CGHs to be successfully used for large-area (more than
50x50 $\mu$m2) excitation tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose an alternative complex
illumination method (CIM) able to generate simultaneous nonlinear excitation of large-area ROIs
with full control over the amplitude and phase of the optical wavefront. We experimentally demonstrate
spatially uniform illumination, as well as structured illumination with user-defined intensity
levels onto micrometric but large-area ROIs. Furthermore, a proof-of-concept experiment on wide-field
second harmonic generation (SHG) is provided. We believe that the proposed CIM could find applications
in wide-field nonlinear microscopy, particularly for speed up signal acquisition time or improve
two-photon image formation.
