The recently developed interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) decomposition is a powerful
way for compressing the redundant information in the set of orbital pairs, and has been used to accelerate
quantum chemistry calculations in a number of contexts. The key ingredient of the ISDF decomposition
is to select a set of non-uniform grid points, so that the values of the orbital pairs evaluated at
such grid points can be used to accurately interpolate those evaluated at all grid points. The set
of non-uniform grid points, called the interpolation points, can be automatically selected by
a QR factorization with column pivoting (QRCP) procedure. This is the computationally most expensive
step in the construction of the ISDF decomposition. In this work, we propose a new approach to find
the interpolation points based on the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) method, which offers
a much less expensive alternative to the QRCP procedure when ISDF is used in the context of hybrid
functional electronic structure calculations. The CVT method only uses information from the electron
density, and can be efficiently implemented using a K-Means algorithm. We find that this new method
achieves comparable accuracy to the ISDF-QRCP method, at a cost that is negligible in the overall
hybrid functional calculations. For instance, for a system containing $1000$ silicon atoms simulated
using the HSE06 hybrid functional on $2000$ computational cores, the cost of QRCP-based method
for finding the interpolation points costs $434.2$ seconds, while the CVT procedure only takes
$3.2$ seconds. We also find that the ISDF-CVT method also enhances the smoothness of the potential
energy surface in the context of \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with hybrid
functionals.
