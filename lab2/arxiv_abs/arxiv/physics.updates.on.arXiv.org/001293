We study strange stars in the framework of $f\left(R,\mathcal{T}\right)$ theory of gravity. To
provide exact solutions of the field equations it is considered that the gravitational Lagrangian
can be expressed as the linear function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the stress-energy
tensor $\mathcal{T}$, i.e. $f(R,\mathcal{T})=R+2\chi\mathcal{T}$, where $\chi$ is a constant.
We also consider that the strange quark matter (SQM) distribution inside the stellar system is governed
by the phenomenological MIT Bag model equation of state (EOS), given as $p_r=\frac{1}{3}\left(\rho-4\,B
\right)$, where $B$ is the Bag constant. Further, for a specific value of $B$ and observed values
of the strange star candidates we obtain the exact solution of the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
(TOV) equation in the framework of $f\left(R,\mathcal{T}\right)$ gravity and have studied in
detail the dependence of the different physical parameters, like the metric potentials, energy
density, radial and tangential pressures and anisotropy etc., due to the chosen different values
of $\chi$. To check the physical acceptability and stability of the stellar system based on the obtained
solutions we have performed different physical tests, viz., the energy conditions, Herrera cracking
concept, adiabatic index etc. In this work, we also have explained the effects, those are arising
due to the interaction between the matter and the curvature terms in $f\left(R,\mathcal{T}\right)$
gravity, on the anisotropic compact stellar system. It is interesting to note that as the values
of $\chi$ increase the strange stars become more massive and their radius increase gradually so
that eventually they gradually turn into less dense compact objects. For $\chi=0$ the standard
results of Einsteinian gravity are retrieved.
