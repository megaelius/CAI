I aim to clarify the physical content and significance of naturalness. Physicists' earliest understanding
of naturalness, as an autonomy of scales (AoS) requirement provides the most cogent definition
of naturalness and I will assert that i) this provides a uniform notion which undergirds a myriad
prominent naturalness conditions, ii) this is a reasonable criterion to impose on EFTs and iii)
the successes and violations of naturalness are best understood when adhering to this notion of
naturalness. I argue that this principle is neither an aesthetic nor a sociologically-influenced
principle. I contend that naturalness may only be plausibly argued to be an aesthetic/sociological
principle when formal measures of naturalness and their use in physics communities are conflated
with the central dogma of naturalness - the former may indeed be argued to be sociologically-influenced
and somewhat arbitrary - but these formal measures of naturalness are in fact less successful than
AoS naturalness. I put forward arguments as to why AoS naturalness is well-defined and why it was
reasonable for physicists to endorse this naturalness principle on both theoretical and empirical
grounds. Up to date, no compelling reasons have appeared as to why the laws of nature should generically
decoupling into quasi-autonomous physical domains. A decoupling of scales in the quantum realm
is often claimed to be entailed by the Decoupling Theorem (Cao and Schweber (1993)), yet I will show
that this theorem is too weak to underwrite quasi-autonomous physical domains in quantum field
theories because one should additionally impose that parameters be natural. Violations of naturalness
would then have ontological import - unnatural parameters would not be accurately described by
EFTs but rather by field theories exhibiting some kind of UV/IR interplay.
