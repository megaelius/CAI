Application of circularly polarized beams in interferometric illumination of colloid sphere
monolayers enables the direct fabrication of rectangular patterns consisting of circular nanohole
miniarrays in metal films. The spectral and near-field effects of complex rectangular patterns
made of a central nanoring and slightly rotated satellite nanocrescents were studied in azimuthal
orientations promoting the localized and propagating plasmon's coupling. To inspect the localized
modes separately, spectral responses and near-field phenomena of hexagonal patterns composed
of uniform nanorings and nanocrescents, that can be fabricated by a perpendicularly and obliquely
incident single homogeneous circularly polarized beam, were investigated. To uncover the interaction
of localized and propagating modes, artificial rectangular patterns composed of a singlet nanoring,
singlet horizontal nanocrescent and quadrumer of four slightly rotated nanocrescents were analyzed.
It was demonstrated that the interacting C2 and C1 localized resonances on the (approximately)
horizontal nanocrescents in C orientation (($16^{\circ}$) $0^{\circ}$ azimuthal angle) and
the azimuthal orientation (in)dependent localized resonance on the (nanorings) nanocrescents
coupled with propagating surface plasmon polaritons (close to) in U orientation (($106^{\circ}$)$90^{\circ}$
azimuthal angle) result in similar split spectra. The spectral response of the complex miniarray
pattern can be precisely tuned by varying the geometrical parameters of the moderately interacting
nanoholes and the pattern period. Enhancement of dipolar emitter's fluorescence is demonstrated
in appropriate configurations that have a potential application in bio-object detection.
