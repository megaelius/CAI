Functional protein-protein interactions are crucial in most cellular processes. They enable
multi-protein complexes to assemble and to remain stable, and they allow signal transduction in
various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the
interacting partners, and thus in correlations between their sequences. Pairwise maximum-entropy
based models have enabled successful inference of pairs of amino-acid residues that are in contact
in the three-dimensional structure of multi-protein complexes, starting from the correlations
in the sequence data of known interaction partners. Recently, algorithms inspired by these methods
have been developed to identify which proteins are functional interaction partners among the paralogous
proteins of two families, starting from sequence data alone. Here, we demonstrate that a slightly
higher performance for partner identification can be reached by an approximate maximization of
the mutual information between the sequence alignments of the two protein families. Our mutual
information-based method also provides signatures of the existence of interactions between protein
families. These results stand in contrast with structure prediction of proteins and of multi-protein
complexes from sequence data, where pairwise maximum-entropy based global statistical models
substantially improve performance compared to mutual information. Our findings entail that the
statistical dependences allowing interaction partner prediction from sequence data are not restricted
to the residue pairs that are in direct contact at the interface between the partner proteins.
