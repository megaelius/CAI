The injection and atomization of gasoline fuels are critical to the performance of gasoline direct
injection engines. Due to the complex nature of the primary breakup of the liquid jet in the near field,
high-level details are often difficult to measure in experiments. In the present study, detailed
numerical simulations are performed to investigate the primary breakup of a gasoline surrogate
jet under non-evaporative Spray G operating conditions. To focus the computational resources
on resolving the primary breakup, simplifications have been made on the injector geometry. The
effect of the internal flow on the primary breakup is modeled by specifying a nonzero injection angle
at the inlet. The nonzero injection angle results in an increase of the jet penetration speed and
also a deflection of the liquid jet. A parametric study on the injection angle is performed, and the
results are compared to the experimental data to identify the injection angle that best represents
the Spray G conditions. The nonzero injection angle introduces an azimuthally non-uniform velocity
in the liquid jet, which in turn influences the instability development on the jet surfaces and also
the deformation and breakup of the jet head. The asymmetric primary breakup dynamics eventually
lead to an azimuthal variation of droplet size distributions. The number of droplets varies significantly
with the azimuthal angle, but interestingly, the probability density functions (PDF) of droplet
size for different azimuthal angles collapse to a self-similar profile. Analysis has also been
conducted to estimate the percentage and statistics of the tiny droplets that are under resolved
in the present simulation. The PDF of the azimuthal angle is also presented, which is also shown to
exhibit a self-similar form. The PDF of the azimuthal angle is well represented by a hyperbolic tangent
function.
