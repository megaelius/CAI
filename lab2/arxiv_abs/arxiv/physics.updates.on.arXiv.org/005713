Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza are lipophilic, enveloped viruses, and are relatively
easy to inactivate by exposure to alcohols. The envelope mainly consists of the lipid bilayer, taken
from the host cells at assembly/budding stage of the viral life cycle. Therefore the constitution
of the lipid bilayer should be common in all SARS, MERS and influenza viruses, even after mutations,
and thus these closely-related viruses will be disinfected by exposure to ethanol with the same
concentration. Existing experimental data indicate that an ethanol concentration of 30~40 v/v%
is sufficient to inactivate Influenza-A viruses in solution[1,2,3]. The author suggests that
it may be possible to use alcoholic beverages of 16~20 v/v% concentration for this disinfection
process, such as Whisky (1:1 hot water dilution) or Japanese Sake, because they are readily available
and safe (non-toxic). By inhaling the alcohol vapor at 50~60$^\circ$C (122~140$^\circ$F) through
the nose for one or two minutes, it will condense on surfaces inside the respiratory tract; mainly
in the nasal cavity. The alcohol concentration will be intensified to ~36 v/v% by this process, which
is enough to disinfect the corona virus on the mucous membrane. This method also provides more moisture
into respiratory tract, and helps to clean the inside of the nasal cavity by stimulating blowing
of the nose, and also makes the mucous escalator work actively so that the self-clearing mechanism
in the trachea will remove viruses faster. An alternative prompt method is also discussed. We use
40 v/v% whisky or similar alcohol, dripping on a gauze, inhale the vapor slowly at room temperature.
This method works well for the front part of the nasal cavity. This is suitable for clinical workers,
because they may need to use prompt preventative measures at any time.
