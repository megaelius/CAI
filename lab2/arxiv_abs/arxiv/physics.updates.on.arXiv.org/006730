Strain engineering has been a ubiquitous paradigm to tailor the electronic band structure and harness
the associated new or enhanced fundamental properties in semiconductors. In this regard, semiconductor
membranes emerged as a versatile class of nanoscale materials to control lattice strain and engineer
complex heterostructures leading to the development of a variety of innovative applications.
Herein we exploit this quasi-two-dimensional platform to tune simultaneously the lattice parameter
and bandgap energy in group IV GeSn semiconductor alloys. As Sn content is increased to reach a direct
band gap, these semiconductors become metastable and typically compressively strained. We show
that the release and transfer of GeSn membranes lead to a significant relaxation thus extending
the absorption wavelength range deeper in the mid-infrared. Fully released Ge$_{0.83}$Sn$_{0.17}$
membranes were integrated on silicon and used in the fabrication of broadband photodetectors operating
at room temperature with a record wavelength cutoff of 4.6 $\mu$m, without compromising the performance
at shorter wavelengths down to 2.3 $\mu$m. These membrane devices are characterized by two orders
of magnitude reduction in dark current as compared to devices processed from as-grown strained
epitaxial layers. The latter exhibit a content-dependent, shorter wavelength cutoff in the 2.6-3.5
$\mu$m range, thus highlighting the role of lattice strain relaxation in shaping the spectral response
of membrane photodetectors. This ability to engineer all-group IV transferable mid-infrared
photodetectors lays the groundwork to implement scalable and flexible sensing and imaging technologies
exploiting these integrative, silicon-compatible strained-relaxed GeSn membranes.
