For real potentials and for arbitrary boundary conditions we point to previously noted paradoxes
in applications of the Ehrenfest and Hellmann-Feynman theorems, their resolution and the role
played on the consistency of quantum mechanical uncertainty relations. The paradoxes originate
from a hidden non-Hermitian character of the kinetic energy operator and are resolved if the proper
boundary terms (almost always discarded in the literature) are taken seriously. These non-Hermitian
contributions (reflections at a deeper level of topological anomalies) follow their own patterns
(for any dimensionality, for both Schroedinger and Dirac/Weyl Hamiltonians and for either continuous
or lattice (tight-binding) models): they can always be written as global fluxes of certain generalized
current densities. In continuous nonrelativistic cases, these have the forms that had earlier
been used by Chemists to describe atomic parts of polyatomic molecules while for Dirac/Weyl or lattice
models they appear to have the corresponding relativistic forms. In spite of the fact that these
boundary terms originate from a deep mathematical anomaly, we point out examples where such non-Hermiticities
have physical significance in Quantum Condensed Matter Physics (for both conventional and topologically
nontrivial materials). In all stationary state examples considered, these non-Hermitian boundary
terms have turned out to be quantized, this quantization being either of conventional or of a topological
(Quantum Hall Effect (QHE)-type) origin. The latter claim is substantiated through direct application
to a simple QHE arrangement (2-D Landau system in an external electric field). Finally, the non-Hermitian
terms are also shown to be crucial for the consistency of the standard uncertainty relations (of
Kennard/Robertson type) in multiply-connected space or, generally, in any system that satisfies
the Bloch theorem.
