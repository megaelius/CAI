We present a novel approach to hybrid RANS/LES wall modeling based on function enrichment, which
overcomes the common problem of the RANS-LES transition and enables coarse meshes near the boundary.
While the concept of function enrichment as an efficient discretization technique for turbulent
boundary layers has been proposed in an earlier article by Krank & Wall (J. Comput. Phys. 316 (2016)
94-116), the contribution of this work is a rigorous derivation of a new multiscale turbulence modeling
approach and a corresponding discontinuous Galerkin discretization scheme. In the near-wall
area, the Navier-Stokes equations are explicitly solved for an LES and a RANS component in one single
equation. This is done by providing the Galerkin method with an independent set of shape functions
for each of these two methods; the standard high-order polynomial basis resolves turbulent eddies
where the mesh is sufficiently fine and the enrichment automatically computes the ensemble-averaged
flow if the LES mesh is too coarse. As a result of the derivation, the RANS model is consistently applied
solely to the RANS degrees of freedom, which effectively prevents the typical issue of a log-layer
mismatch in attached boundary layers. As the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved in the boundary
layer, spatial refinement gradually yields wall-resolved LES with exact boundary conditions.
Numerical tests show the outstanding characteristics of the wall model regarding grid independence,
superiority compared to equilibrium wall models in separated flows, and achieve a speed-up by two
orders of magnitude compared to wall-resolved LES.
