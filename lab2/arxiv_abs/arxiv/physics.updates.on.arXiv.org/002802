Asymptotic multiple scale homogenisation allows to determine the effective behaviour of a porous
medium by starting from the pore-scale description, when there is a large separation between the
pore-scale and the macroscopic scale. When the scale ratio is "small but not too small," the standard
approach based on first-order homogenisation may break down since additional terms need to be taken
into account in order to obtain an accurate picture of the overall response of the medium. The effect
of low scale separation can be obtained by exploiting higher order equations in the asymptotic homogenisation
procedure. The aim of the present study is to investigate higher-order terms up to the third order
of the advective-diffusive model to describe advection-diffusion in a macroscopically homogeneous
porous medium at low scale separation. The main result of the study is that the low separation of scales
induces dispersion effects. In particular, the second-order model is similar to the most currently
used phenomenological model of dispersion: it is characacterized by a dispersion tensor which
can be decomposed into a purely diffusive component and a mechanical dispersion part, whilst this
property is not verifed in the homogenised dispersion model (obtained at higher P\'eclet number).
The third-order description contains second and third concentration gradient terms, with a fourth
order tensor of diffusion and with a third-order and an additional second-order tensors of dispersion.
The analysis of the macroscopic fluxes shows that the second and the third order macroscopic fluxes
are distinct from the volume means of the corresponding local fluxes and allows to determine expressions
of the non-local effects.
