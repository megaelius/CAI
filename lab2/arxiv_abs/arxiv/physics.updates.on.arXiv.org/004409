The Schr\"odinger spectrum of a hydrogen atom, modelled as a two-body system consisting of a point
electron and a point proton, interacting with a modification of Coulomb's law proposed, in the 1940s,
by Bopp, Land\'e--Thomas, and Podolsky (BLTP). The BLTP theory hypothesizes the existence of an
electromagnetic length scale of nature --- the Bopp length $\varkappa ^{-1}$ ---, to the effect
that the electrostatic pair interaction deviates significantly from Coulomb's law only for distances
much shorter than $\varkappa^{-1}$. Rigorous lower and upper bounds are constructed for the Schr\"odinger
energy levels of the hydrogen atom, $E_{\ell,n}(\varkappa)$, for all $\ell\in\{0,1,2,...\}$
and $n >\ell$. The energy levels $E_{0,1}(\varkappa)$, $E_{0,2}(\varkappa)$, and $E_{1,2}(\varkappa)$
are also computed numerically and plotted versus $\varkappa^{-1}$. It is found that the BLTP theory
predicts a non-relativistic correction to the splitting of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line in addition
to its well-known relativistic fine-structure splitting. Under the assumption, that this splitting
doesn't go away in a relativistic calculation, it is argued that present-day precision measurements
of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line suggest that $\varkappa^{-1}$ must be smaller than $\approx 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}$.
Finite proton size effects are found not to modify this conclusion. As a consequence, the electrostatic
field energy of an elementary point charge, although finite in BLTP electrodynamics, is much larger
than the empirical rest energy of an electron. If, as assumed in all `renormalized theories' of the
electron, the empirical rest mass of a physical electron is the sum of its bare rest mass plus its electrostatic
field energy ($/c^2$), then in BLTP electrodynamics the electron has to be assigned a negative bare
rest mass.
