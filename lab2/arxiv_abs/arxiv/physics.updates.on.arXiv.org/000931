Fluid flows in nature and applications are frequently subject to periodic velocity modulations.
Surprisingly, even for the generic case of flow through a straight pipe, there is little consensus
regarding the influence of pulsation on the transition threshold to turbulence: while most studies
predict a monotonically increasing threshold with pulsation frequency (i.e. Womersley number,
$\alpha$), others observe a decreasing threshold for identical parameters and only observe an
increasing threshold at low $\alpha$. In the present study we apply recent advances in the understanding
of transition in steady shear flows to pulsating pipe flow. For moderate pulsation amplitudes we
find that the first instability encountered is subcritical (i.e. requiring finite amplitude disturbances)
and gives rise to localized patches of turbulence ("puffs") analogous to steady pipe flow. By monitoring
the impact of pulsation on the lifetime of turbulence we map the onset of turbulence in parameter
space. Transition in pulsatile flow can be separated into three regimes. At small Womersley numbers
the dynamics are dominated by the decay turbulence suffers during the slower part of the cycle and
hence transition is delayed significantly. As shown in this regime thresholds closely agree with
estimates based on a quasi steady flow assumption only taking puff decay rates into account. The
transition point predicted in the zero $\alpha$ limit equals to the critical point for steady pipe
flow offset by the oscillation Reynolds number. In the high frequency limit puff lifetimes are identical
to those in steady pipe flow and hence the transition threshold appears to be unaffected by flow pulsation.
In the intermediate frequency regime the transition threshold sharply drops (with increasing
$\alpha$) from the decay dominated (quasi steady) threshold to the steady pipe flow level.
