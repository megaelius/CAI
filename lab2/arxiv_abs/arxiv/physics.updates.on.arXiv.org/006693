Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks for image recognition, has been recently
used in meteorology. One of the promising applications is developing a statistical surrogate model
that converts the output images of low-resolution dynamic models to high-resolution images. Our
study exhibits a preliminary experiment that evaluates the performance of a model that downscales
synoptic temperature fields to mesoscale temperature fields every 6 hours. The deep learning model
was trained with operational 22-km gridded global analysis surface winds and temperatures as the
input, operational 5-km gridded regional analysis surface temperatures as the desired output,
and a target domain covering central Japan. The results confirm that our deep convolutional neural
network (DCNN) is capable of estimating the locations of coastlines and mountain ridges in great
detail, which are not retained in the inputs, and providing high-resolution surface temperature
distributions. For instance, while the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 2.7 K between
the global and regional analyses at altitudes greater than 1000 m, the RMSE is reduced to 1.0 K, and
the correlation coefficient is improved from 0.6 to 0.9 by the surrogate model. Although this study
evaluates a surrogate model only for surface temperature, it probably can be improved by augmenting
the downscaling variables and vertical profiles. Surrogate models of DCNNs require only a small
amount of computational power once their training is finished. Therefore, if the surrogate models
are implemented at short time intervals, they will provide high-resolution weather forecast guidance
or environment emergency alerts at low cost.
