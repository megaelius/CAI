The current-carrying capacity of type-II superconductors is decisively determined by how well
material defect structures can immobilize vortex lines. In order to gain deeper insights into intrinsic
pinning mechanisms, we have explored the case of vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical
inclusions using large-scale simulations of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations.
We find that for a small density of particles having diameters of two coherence lengths, the vortex
lattice preserves its structure and the critical current $j_c$ decays with the magnetic field following
a power-law $B^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 0.66$, which is consistent with predictions of
strong pinning theory. For higher density of particles and/or larger inclusions, the lattice becomes
progressively more disordered and the exponent smoothly decreases down to $\alpha \approx 0.3$.
At high magnetic fields, all inclusions capture a vortex and the critical current decays faster
than $B^{-1}$ as would be expected by theory. In the case of larger inclusions with diameter of four
coherence length, the magnetic-field dependence of the critical current is strongly affected
by the ability of inclusions to capture multiple vortex lines. We found that at small densities,
the fraction of inclusions trapping two vortex lines rapidly grows within narrow field range leading
to a shallow peak in $j_c(B)$-dependence within this range. With increasing inclusion density,
this peak transforms into a plateau, which then smooths out. Using the insights gained from simulations,
we determine the limits of applicability of strong pinning theory and provide different routes
to describe vortex pinning beyond those bounds.
