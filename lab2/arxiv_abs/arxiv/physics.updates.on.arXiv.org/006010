BESIII is a multipurpose spectrometer optimized for physics in the tau-charm energy region. Both
detector and accelerator are undergoing an upgrade program, that will allow BESIII to run until
2029. A major upgrade is the replacement of the inner drift chamber with a new detector based on Cylindrical
Gas Electron Multipliers to improve both the secondary vertex reconstruction and the radiation
tolerance. The CGEM-IT will be composed of three coaxial layers of cylindrical triple GEMs, operating
in an Ar$\,$+$\,$iC$_4$H$_{10}$ (90:10) gas mixture with field and gain optimized to maximize
the spatial resolution. The new detector is readout with innovative TIGER electronics produced
in 110$\,$nm CMOS technology. The front end is a custom designed 64$\,$channel ASIC featuring a
fully digital output and operated in trigger-less mode. It can provide analog charge and time measurements
with a TDC time resolution better than 100$\,$ps, that will allow to operate in $\mu$TPC mode. Before
the installation inside BESIII, foreseen in 2021, a long standalone data taking is ongoing at the
Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing; currently, the first two cylindrical chambers are
available for the test, and are used to complete the integration between the detector and the electronics
and to assess the required performance. In this proceeding a description of the CGEM-IT project,
the TIGER features and performance, and the results of the analysis of first cosmic ray data taking
will be presented. Focus will be given on the strip analysis, from which it is possible to measure
the basic properties of the detector, and the cluster analysis. The first preliminary results on
efficiency and spatial resolution will be also presented.
