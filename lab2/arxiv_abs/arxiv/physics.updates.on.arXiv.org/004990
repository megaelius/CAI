Transverse 2D phase space distribution of a 2.1 MeV, 5 mA H$^-$ beam is measured at the PIPIT test accelerator
at Fermilab with an Allison scanner. The paper describes the design, calibration, and performance
of the scanner as well as the main results of the beam measurements. Analyses of the recorded phase
portraits are performed primarily in action-phase coordinates; the stability of the action under
linear optics makes it easier to compare measurements taken with different beamline conditions,
e.g. in various locations. The intensity of a single measured point (\pixel") is proportional to
the phase density in the corresponding portion of the beam. When the Twiss parameters are calculated
using only the high-phase density part of the beam, the pixel intensity in the beam core is found to
be decreasing exponentially with action and to be phase-independent. Outside of the core, the intensities
decrease with action at a significantly slower rate than in the core. This `tail' comprises 10-30%
of the beam, with 0.1% of the total measured intensity extending beyond the action 10-20 times larger
than the rms emittance. The transition from the core to the tail is accompanied by the appearance
of a strong phase dependence, which is characterized in action-phase coordinates by two `branches'
extending beyond the core. A set of selected measurements shows, in part, that there is no measurable
emittance dilution along the beam line in the main portion of the beam; the beam parameters are practically
constant over a 0.5 ms pulse; and scraping in various parts of the beam line is an effective way to decrease
the transverse tails by removing the branches.
