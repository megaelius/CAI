Purpose: The goal of this study was to assess the potential added benefit of accounting for partial
volume effects (PVE) in an automatic coronary lumen segmentation algorithm from coronary computed
tomography angiography (CCTA). Materials and methods: We assessed the potential added value of
PVE integration as a part of the automatic coronary lumen segmentation algorithm by means of segmentation
accuracy using the MICCAI 2012 challenge framework and by means of flow simulation overall accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values and the receiver operated
characteristic (ROC) area under the curve. We also evaluated the potential benefit of accounting
for PVE in automatic segmentation for flow-simulation for lesions that were diagnosed as obstructive
based on CCTA, which could have indicated a need for an invasive exam and revascularization. Results:
Our segmentation algorithm improves the maximal surface distance error by ~39% compared to previously
published method on the 18 datasets 50 from the MICCAI 2012 challenge with comparable Dice and mean
surface distance. Results with and without accounting for PVE were comparable. In contrast, integrating
PVE analysis into an automatic coronary lumen segmentation algorithm improved the flow simulation
specificity from 0.6 to 0.68 with the same sensitivity of 0.83. Also, accounting for PVE improved
the area under the ROC curve for detecting hemodynamically significant CAD from 0.76 to 0.8 compared
to automatic segmentation without PVE analysis with invasive FFR threshold of 0.8 as the reference
standard. The improvement in the AUC was statistically significant (N=76, Delong's test, p=0.012).
Conclusion: Accounting for the partial volume effects in automatic coronary lumen segmentation
algorithms has the potential to improve the accuracy of CCTA-based hemodynamic assessment of coronary
artery lesions.
