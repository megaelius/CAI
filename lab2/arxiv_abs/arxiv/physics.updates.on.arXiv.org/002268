The present investigation shows that a triad of three vortices, two co-rotating vortices (TCV)
and a secondary vortex lies beneath them and counter-rotating with them, is behind the quasi-periodic
self-sustained bursting and reformation of the laminar separation bubble (LSB) and its associated
low-frequency flow oscillation (LFO). The upstream vortex of the TCV (UV) is driven by the gradient
of the oscillating-velocity across the laminar portion of the separated shear layer and is faithfully
aligned with it. The secondary vortex acts as a roller support that facilitates the rotation and
orientation of the TCV. A global oscillation in the flow-field around the aerofoil is observed in
all of the investigated angles of attack, including at zero angle of attack. The flow switches between
an attached-phase against an adverse pressure gradient (APG) and a separated-phase despite a favourable
pressure gradient (FPG) in a periodic manner with some disturbed cycles. When the direction of the
oscillating-flow is clockwise, it adds momentum to the boundary layer and helps it to remain attached
against the APG and vice versa. The transition location along the separated shear layer moves upstream
when the oscillating-flow rotates in the clockwise direction causing early-transition and vice
versa. The best description of the mechanism is that of a whirligig. When the oscillating-flow rotates
in the clockwise direction, the UV whirls in the clockwise direction and store energy until it is
saturated, then the process is reversed. The present investigation paves the way for formulating
a time-accurate physics-based model of the LFO and stall prediction, and opens the door for control
of its undesirable effects.
