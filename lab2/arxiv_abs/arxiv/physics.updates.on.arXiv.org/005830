Coronavirus COVID-19 spreads through the population mostly based on social contact. To gauge the
potential for widespread contagion, to cope with associated uncertainty and to inform its mitigation,
more accurate and robust modelling is centrally important for policy making. We provide a flexible
modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made. We use this to analyse
different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation in the UK. We present a stochastic model
that captures the inherently probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The
computational nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and regions),
the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as medical pre-histories can
be incorporated with ease. We analyse different possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in
the UK. Our model is robust to small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal
with different scenarios. This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread
of an epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR). It is important
to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model, are not flexible enough and are also
not stochastic and hence should be used with extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity
and inherent uncertainty to be incorporated. Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw insights
by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources, including agreement on
average (mean field) with parameters in SIR-based models.
