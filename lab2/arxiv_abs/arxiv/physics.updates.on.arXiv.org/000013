The incorporation of bismuth (Bi) in GaAs results in a large reduction of the band gap energy (E$_g$)
accompanied with a large increase in the spin-orbit splitting energy ($\bigtriangleup_{SO}$),
leading to the condition that $\bigtriangleup_{SO} > E_g$ which is anticipated to reduce so-called
CHSH Auger recombination losses whereby the energy and momentum of a recombining electron-hole
pair is given to a second hole which is excited into the spin-orbit band. We theoretically investigate
the electronic structure of experimentally grown GaBi$_x$As$_{1-x}$ samples on (100) GaAs substrates
by directly comparing our data with room temperature photo-modulated reflectance (PR) measurements.
Our atomistic theoretical calculations, in agreement with the PR measurements, confirm that E$_g$
is equal to $\bigtriangleup_{SO}$ for $\textit{x} \approx$ 9$%$. We then theoretically probe
the inhomogeneous broadening of the interband transition energies as a function of the alloy disorder.
The broadening associated with spin-split-off transitions arises from conventional alloy effects,
while the behaviour of the heavy-hole transitions can be well described using a valence band-anticrossing
model. We show that for the samples containing 8.5% and 10.4% Bi the difficulty in identifying a clear
light-hole-related transition energy from the measured PR data is due to the significant broadening
of the host matrix light-hole states as a result of the presence of a large number of Bi resonant states
in the same energy range and disorder in the alloy. We further provide quantitative estimates of
the impact of supercell size and the assumed random distribution of Bi atoms on the interband transition
energies in GaBi$_{x}$As$_{1-x}$. Our calculations support a type-I band alignment at the GaBi$_x$As$_{1-x}$/GaAs
interface, consistent with recent experimental findings.
