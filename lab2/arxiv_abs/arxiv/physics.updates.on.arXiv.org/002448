We propose a novel model-free self-learning cluster-based control strategy for general nonlinear
feedback flow control technique, benchmarked for high-fidelity simulations of post-stall separated
flows over an airfoil. The present approach partitions the flow trajectories (force measurements)
into clusters, which correspond to characteristic coarse-grained phases in a low-dimensional
feature space. A feedback control law is then sought for each cluster state through iterative evaluation
and downhill simplex search to minimize power consumption in flight. Unsupervised clustering
of the flow trajectories for in-situ learning and optimization of coarse-grained control laws
are implemented in an automated manner as key enablers. Re-routing the flow trajectories, the optimized
control laws shift the cluster populations to the aerodynamically favorable states. Utilizing
limited number of sensor measurements for both clustering and optimization, these feedback laws
were determined in only $O(10)$ iterations. The objective of the present work is not necessarily
to suppress flow separation but to minimize the desired cost function to achieve enhanced aerodynamic
performance. The present control approach is applied to the control of two and three-dimensional
separated flows over a NACA 0012 airfoil with large-eddy simulations at an angle of attack of $9^\circ$,
Reynolds number $Re = 23,000$ and free-stream Mach number $M_\infty = 0.3$. The optimized control
laws effectively minimize the flight power consumption enabling the flows to reach a low-drag state.
The present work aims to address the challenges associated with adaptive feedback control design
for turbulent separated flows at moderate Reynolds number.
