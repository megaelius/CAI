In a two-person Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game, if we set a loss worth nothing and a tie worth 1, and
the payoff of winning (the incentive a) as a variable, this game is called as generalized RPS game.
The generalized RPS game is a representative mathematical model to illustrate the game dynamics,
appearing widely in textbook. However, how actual motions in these games depend on the incentive
has never been reported quantitatively. Using the data from 7 games with different incentives,
including 84 groups of 6 subjects playing the game in 300-round, with random-pair tournaments and
local information recorded, we find that, both on social and individual level, the actual motions
are changing continuously with the incentive. More expressively, some representative findings
are, (1) in social collective strategy transit views, the forward transition vector field is more
and more centripetal as the stability of the system increasing; (2) In the individual behavior of
strategy transit view, there exists a phase transformation as the stability of the systems increasing,
and the phase transformation point being near the standard RPS; (3) Conditional response behaviors
are structurally changing accompanied by the controlled incentive. As a whole, the best response
behavior increases and the win-stay lose-shift (WSLS) behavior declines with the incentive. Further,
the outcome of win, tie, and lose influence the best response behavior and WSLS behavior. Both as
the best response behavior, the win-stay behavior declines with the incentive while the lose-left-shift
behavior increase with the incentive. And both as the WSLS behavior, the lose-left-shift behavior
increase with the incentive, but the lose-right-shift behaviors declines with the incentive.
We hope to learn which one in tens of learning models can interpret the empirical observation above.
