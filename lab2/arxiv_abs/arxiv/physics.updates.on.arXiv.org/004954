We numerically investigate both single and multiple droplet dissolution with droplets consisting
of lighter liquid dissolving in a denser host liquid. The significance of buoyancy is quantified
by the Rayleigh number Ra which is the buoyancy force over the viscous damping force. In this study,
Ra spans almost four decades from 0.1 to 400. We focus on how the mass flux, characterized by the Sherwood
number Sh, and the flow morphologies depend on Ra. For single droplet dissolution, we first show
the transition of the Sh(Ra) scaling from a constant value to $Sh\sim Ra^{1/4}$, which confirms
the experimental results by Dietrich et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 794, 2016, pp. 45--67). The two
distinct regimes, namely the diffusively- and the convectively-dominated regime, exhibit different
flow morphologies: when Ra>=10, a buoyant plume is clearly visible which contrasts sharply to the
pure diffusion case at low Ra. For multiple droplet dissolution, the well-known shielding effect
comes into play at low Ra so that the dissolution rate is slower as compared to the single droplet case.
However, at high Ra, convection becomes more and more dominant so that a collective plume enhances
the mass flux, and remarkably the multiple droplets dissolve faster than a single droplet. This
has also been found in the experiments by Laghezza et al. (Soft Matter, vol. 12, 2016, pp. 5787--5796).
We explain this enhancement by the formation of a single, larger plume rather than several individual
plumes. Moreover, there is an optimal Ra at which the enhancement is maximized, because the single
plume is narrower at larger Ra, which thus hinders the enhancement. Our findings demonstrate a new
mechanism in collective droplet dissolution, which is the merging of the plumes, that leads to non-trivial
phenomena, contrasting the shielding effect.
