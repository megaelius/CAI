When considering performing an Introductory Physics for Life Sciences course transformation
for one's own institution, life science majors' achievement goals are a necessary consideration
to ensure the pedagogical transformation will be effective. However, achievement goals are rarely
an explicit consideration in physics education research topics such as metacognition. We investigate
a sample population of 218 students in a first-semester introductory algebra-based physics course,
drawn from 14 laboratory sections within six semesters of course sections, to determine the influence
of achievement goals on life science majors' attitudes towards physics. Learning orientations
that, respectively, pertain to mastery goals and performance goals, in addition to a learning orientation
that does not report a performance goal, were recorded from students in the specific context of learning
a problem-solving framework during an in-class exercise. Students' learning orientations, defined
within the context of students' self-reported statements in the specific context of a problem-solving-related
research-based course implementation, are compared to pre-post results on physics problem-solving
items in a well-established attitudinal survey instrument, in order to establish the categories'
validity. In addition, mastery-related and performance-related orientations appear to extend
to overall pre-post attitudinal shifts, but not to force and motion concepts or to overall course
grade, within the scope of an introductory physics course. There also appears to be differentiation
regarding overall course performance within health science majors, but not within biology majors,
in terms of learning orientations; however, health science majors generally appear to fare less
well on all measurements in the study than do biology majors, regardless of learning orientations.
