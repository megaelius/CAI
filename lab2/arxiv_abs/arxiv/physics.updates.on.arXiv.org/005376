On the basis of the evident ability of neuronal olfactory systems to evaluate the intensity of an
odorous stimulus and also recognize the identity of the odorant over a large range of concentrations,
a few biologically-realistic hypotheses on some of the underlying neural processes are made. The
mathematical implementation of such phenomenological postulates allows to infer quite simply
a functional relationship between the mean firing-rate of the neural population and the concentration
of any odorant as well as the statistical distribution of the sensitivity of any receptor neuron
to any odorant across the population; both of them turn out to be power-laws and an arithmetic, testable
relationship between the respective exponents naturally appears. In order to compare quantitatively
the prediction of power-law dependence of population mean firing-rate on odorant concentration,
a probabilistic model is created to extract information from data available in the experimental
literature which, inter alia, allows to pool together several data-sets and hence increase statistical
accuracy. The values of the free parameters of the model are estimated by a Bayesian maximum likelihood
inference which keeps into account the prior distribution of the parameters making use of theorems
from Information Geometry. The eventual goodness of fit is quantified by means of a distribution-independent
test. The probabilistic model results to be accurate, thus confirming the theoretical prediction
of a power-law dependence on odorant concentration. The experimental data available about the
distribution of sensitivities also agree with the other predictions, though they are not statistically
sufficient for a very stringent verification. The theory also suggests a possible explanation
for the range of values of the exponent of the sensitivity power-law found in experiments.
