Theta-nested gamma oscillations have been reported in many areas of the brain and are believed to
represent a fundamental mechanism to transfer information across spatial and temporal scales.
In a series of recent experiments in vitro it has been possible to replicate with an optogenetic theta
frequency stimulation several features of cross-frequency coupling among theta and gamma rhythms
observed in behaving animals. In order to reproduce the main findings of these experiments we have
considered a new class of neural mass models able to reproduce exactly the macroscopic dynamics
of spiking neural networks. In this framework, we have examined two set-ups able to support collective
gamma oscillations: the pyramidal interneuronal network gamma (PING) and the interneuronal network
gamma (ING). In both set-ups we observe the emergence of theta-nested gamma oscillations by driving
the system with a sinusoidal theta-forcing in proximity of a Hopf bifurcation. These mixed rhythms
display always phase amplitude coupling. However 2 different types of nested oscillations can
be identified: one characterized by a perfect phase locking between theta and gamma rhythms, corresponding
to an overall periodic behaviour; another one where the locking is imperfect and the dynamics is
quasi-periodic or even chaotic. From our analysis it emerges that the locked states are more frequent
in the ING set-up. In agreement with the experiments, we find theta-nested gamma oscillations for
forcing frequencies in the range [1:10] Hz, whose amplitudes grow proportionally to the forcing
one and which are clearly modulated by the theta phase. At variance with experimental findings,
the gamma-power peak does not shift to higher frequencies by increasing the theta frequency. This
effect can be obtained, in or model, only by incrementing, at the same time, also the noise or the forcing
amplitude.
