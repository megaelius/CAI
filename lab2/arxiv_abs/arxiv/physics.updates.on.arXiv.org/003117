Seismic phase association is a fundamental task in seismology that pertains to linking together
phase detections on different sensors that originate from a common earthquake. It is widely employed
to detect earthquakes on permanent and temporary seismic networks, and underlies most seismicity
catalogs produced around the world. This task can be challenging because the number of sources is
unknown, events frequently overlap in time, or can occur simultaneously in different parts of a
network. We present PhaseLink, a framework based on recent advances in deep learning for grid-free
earthquake phase association. Our approach learns to link phases together that share a common origin,
and is trained entirely on tens of millions of synthetic sequences of P- and S-wave arrival times
generated using a simple 1D velocity model. Our approach is simple to implement for any tectonic
regime, suitable for real-time processing, and can naturally incorporate errors in arrival time
picks. Rather than tuning a set of ad hoc hyperparameters to improve performance, PhaseLink can
be improved by simply adding examples of problematic cases to the training dataset. We demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of PhaseLink on a challenging recent sequence from southern
California, and synthesized sequences from Japan designed to test the point at which the method
fails. For the examined datasets, PhaseLink can precisely associate P- and S-picks to events that
are separated by ~12 seconds in origin time. This approach is expected to improve the resolution
of seismicity catalogs, add stability to real-time seismic monitoring, and streamline automated
processing of large seismic datasets.
