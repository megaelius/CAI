The pseudopotential method is one of the most popular extensions of the lattice Boltzmann method
(LBM) for phase change and multiphase flow simulation. One attractive feature of the original proposed
method consists on its simplicity of adding a force dependent on a nearest-neighbor potential function,
which became known as the Shan-Chen interaction force. Some of the well known drawbacks implied
by this method involves lack of thermodynamic consistency and impossibility to control the surface
tension independently. In order to correct these deficiencies, different approaches were developed
in the literature, such as multirange interactions potential, which involves larger stencils
than nearest-neighbor approach, and modified forcing schemes. In this work, a strategy is developed
to control the liquid-gas density ratio and the surface tension by means of an appropriate interaction
force field using only nearest-neighbor interactions. The proposed procedure is devised starting
from the desired pressure tensor, which allow for the control of the equilibrium multiphase properties
such as liquid-gas coexistence curve and surface tension. Then, it is shown how to derive an external
force field able to replicate the effects of this pressure tensor in the macroscopic conservation
equations. The final step of our procedure is implementing this external force in the LBE by using
the classical Guo forcing scheme. Numerical tests regarding static and dynamic flow conditions
were performed. Results obtained from simulations showed good agreement with expected analytical
values. Most divergent solution observed was the droplet oscillation period under certain flow
conditions, which deviated 9% from expected analytical result. The observed results corroborate
that the proposed method is able to replicate the desired macroscopic multiphase behaviour.
