PURPOSE: To update the Carleton Laboratory for Radiotherapy Physics (CLRP) TG-43 dosimetry database
for low-energy (< 50 keV) photon-emitting low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy sources utilizing
the open-source EGSnrc application egs_brachy rather than the BrachyDose application used previously
for 27 LDR sources in the 2008 CLRP version (CLRPv1). CLRPv2 covers 40 sources (Pd-103, I-125, Cs-131).
A comprehensive set of TG-43 parameters is calculated, including dose-rate constants, radial
dose functions with functional fitting parameters, 1D and 2D anisotropy functions, along-away
dose-rate tables, Primary-Scatter separation dose tables (for some sources), and mean photon
energies. The database also documents the source models which will become part of the egs_brachy
distribution. METHODS: Datasets are calculated after a systematic recoding of the source geometries
using the egs++ geometry package and its egs_brachy extensions. Full scatter water phantoms with
varying voxel resolutions in cylindrical coordinates are used for dose calculations. New statistical
uncertainties of source volume corrections for phantom voxels which overlap with brachytherapy
sources are implemented in egs_brachy, and all CLRPv2 data include these uncertainties. For validation,
data are compared to CLRPv1 and other data in the literature. DATA ACCESS/FORMAT: Data are available
at https://physics.carleton.ca/ clrp/egs_brachy/seed_database_v2. As well as being presented
graphically in comparisons to previous calculations, data are available in Excel (.xlsx) spreadsheets
for each source. APPLICATIONS: The database has applications in research, dosimetry, and brachytherapy
planning. This comprehensive update provides the medical physics community with more accurate
TG-43 dose evaluation parameters, as well as fully-benchmarked source models distributed with
egs_brachy.
