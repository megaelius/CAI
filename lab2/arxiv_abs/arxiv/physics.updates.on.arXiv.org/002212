We present magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of liquid sodium flow with the PLUTO compressible
MHD code. We investigate the influence of the remnant magnetic field orientation and intensity,
impinging velocity field due to Ekman pumping as well as the impeller dimensions on the magnetic
field collimation by helical flows in between the impeller blades. For a simplified cartesian geometry
we model the flow dynamics of a multi-blades impeller inspired by the Von-Karman-Sodium (VKS) experiment.
The study shows that a remnant magnetic field oriented in the toroidal direction is the less efficient
configuration to collimate the magnetic field, although if the radial or vertical components are
not negligible the collimation is significantly improved. If the intensity of the remnant magnetic
field increases the system magnetic energy is larger but the magnetic field collimation efficiency
is the same, so the gain of magnetic energy is smaller as the remnant magnetic field intensity increases.
The magnetic field collimation is modified if the impinging velocity field changes: the collimation
is weaker if the impinging velocity increases from Gamma=0.8 to 0.9, slightly larger if the impinging
velocity decreases from Gamma=0.8 to 0.7. The analysis of the impeller dimensions points out that
the most efficient configuration to collimate the magnetic field requires a ratio between impeller
blade height and base longitude between 0.375 - 0.5. The largest enhancement of the hypothetical
alpha^2 dynamo loop, compared to the hypothetical Omega-alpha dynamo loop, is observed for the
model that mimics TM 73 impeller configuration rotating in the unscooping direction with a remnant
magnetic field of 10^-3 T orientated in the radial or vertical direction. The optimization trends
obtained in the parametric analysis are also confirmed in simulations with higher resolution and
turbulence degree.
