Historical narratives are dominated by actions of powerful individuals as well as competitions
for power. Characterizing the origins, types and competitive strength of different kinds of power
may yield a scaffolding for understanding historical processes and mechanisms for winning or avoiding
conflicts. Michael Mann distinguished four types of power: political, military, economic, and
ideological. We show this framework is justified by four motivations of individuals to transfer
decisions to leaders: Desire to be a member of a collective, avoiding harm due to threat, gaining
benefit due to payment, acquiring a value system. Constructing models of societies based upon these
types of power enables distinguishing social systems and describing their dynamics. Dynamics
include (a) competition between power systems, (b) competition between powerful individuals,
and (c) the dynamics of values within a powerful individual. A historical trend is the progressive
separation of types of power to distinct groups of individuals. In ancient empires all forms of power
were concentrated in a single individual, e.g. Caesar during the Pax Romana period. In an idealized
modern democratic state, the four types of power are concentrated in distinct sets of individuals.
The progressive separation suggests that in some contexts this confers a "fitness" advantage in
an evolutionary process similar to the selection of biological organisms. However, individual
countries may not separate power completely. The influence of wealth in politics and regulatory
capture is a signature of economic leader dominance, e.g. the US. Important roles of political leaders
in economics and corruption are a signature of the political leader dominance, e.g. China. Ideological
leaders dominate in theocracies, e.g. Iran. Military leaders dominate in dictatorships or where
military leaders select leadership, e.g. Egypt.
