Transformation optics originating from the invariance of Maxwell's equations under the coordinate
mapping has enabled the design and demonstration of many fascinating electromagnetic devices
that were unconceivable or deemed impossible before [1-11], and has greatly contributed to the
advancement of modern electromagnetism and related researches assisted with the development
of metamaterials [12-15]. This technique has been extended to apply to other partial differential
equations governing different waves [16-23] or flux [24-28], and has produced various novel functional
devices such as acoustic cloaks [20-23] and Schrodinger's 'hat' [19]. In the present work we applied
the coordinate transformation to the time-dependent heat diffusion equation [24-28] and achieved
the manipulation of the heat flux by predefined diffusion paths. In the experiment we demonstrated
a transient thermal cloaking device engineered with thermal metamaterials and successfully hid
a centimeter sized strong 'scatter' (thermal disturber), i.e., a vacuum cavity. To facilitate
reliable fabrication we adopted the rescaled thermal diffusion equation for various ingredient
materials with nearly constant product of the density and heat capacity, and took the anisotropic
thermal diffusivities as the key parameters for the design. Our results unambiguously show the
practical possibility to implement the complex transformed thermal media with high accuracy and
acquire some unprecedented thermodynamic functions, which we believe will help to broaden the
current research and pave a new way to manipulate heat for novel device applications.
