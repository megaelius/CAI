Magnetic reconnection in the solar corona is thought to be unstable to the formation of multiple
interacting plasmoids, and previous studies have shown that plasmoid dynamics can trigger MHD
waves of different modes propagating outward from the reconnection site. However, variations
in plasma parameters and magnetic field strength in the vicinity of a coronal reconnection site
may lead to wave reflection and mode conversion. In this paper we investigate the reflection and
refraction of fast magnetoacoustic waves near a reconnection site. Under a justified assumption
of an analytically specified Alfv\'{e}n speed profile, we derive and solve analytically the full
wave equation governing propagation of fast mode waves in a non-uniform background plasma without
recourse to the small-wavelength approximation. We show that the waves undergo reflection near
the reconnection current sheet due to the Alfv\'en speed gradient and that the reflection efficiently
depends on the plasma-$\beta$ parameter as well as on the wave frequency. In particular, we find
that waves are reflected more efficiently near reconnection sites in a low-$\beta$ plasma which
is typical for the solar coronal conditions. Also, the reflection is larger for lower frequency
waves while high frequency waves propagate outward from the reconnection region almost without
the reflection. We discuss the implications of efficient wave reflection near magnetic reconnection
sites in strongly magnetized coronal plasma for particle acceleration, and also the effect this
might have on First Ionization Potential (FIP) fractionation by the ponderomotive force of these
waves in the chromosphere.
