Modern science is dominated by scientific productions from teams. Large teams have demonstrated
a clear advantage over small teams in applying for research funding, performing complicated research
tasks and producing research works with high impact. Recent research, however, shows that both
large and small teams have their own merits. Small teams tend to expand the frontier of knowledge
by creating disruptive research outcomes, while large teams are more apt to work in the established
field and develop existing problems. Given different roles of big and small teams in research, the
extent to which a country's scientific work is carried out by big/small teams is of great importance.
Here, we analyze over 26 million papers from Web of Science published from 2000 to 2017. We find that
China's research output is more dominated by big teams than the rest of the world. It is indeed a global
trend that more papers are done by big teams. However, the drop in small team output is much steeper
in China. More importantly, as research teams in China shift from small to large size, the team diversity
that is essential for innovative works does not increase as much as that in other countries. Papers
by big teams tend to receive more citations, but this alone is insufficient to explain the dominance
of big teams in China, because the citation boost is roughly the same in every country. However, using
the national average as the baseline, we find that the National Natural Science Foundation of China
(NSFC) supports fewer small team works than the National Science Foundation of U.S. (NSF) does,
implying that big teams are more preferred by grant agencies in China. Our finding provides new insights
into the concern of originality and innovation in China, which urges a need to balance small and big
teams.
