A new scheme using macroscopic coherence is proposed from a theoretical point to experimentally
determine the neutrino mass matrix, in particular the absolute value of neutrino masses, and the
mass type, Majorana or Dirac. The proposed process is a collective, coherent Raman scattering followed
by neutrino-pair emission from an excited state $|e\rangle$ of a long lifetime to a lower energy
state $|g\rangle$; $\gamma_0 + | e\rangle \rightarrow \gamma + \sum_{ij} \nu_i \bar{\nu_j} + |
g\rangle $ with $ \nu_i \bar{\nu_j}$ consisting of six massive neutrino-pairs. Calculated angular
distribution has six $(ij)$ thresholds of massive neutrino-pair emission which show up as steps
at different angles in the distribution. Angular locations of thresholds and event rates of the
angular distribution make it possible to experimentally determine the smallest neutrino mass
to the level of less than 1 meV (accordingly all three masses using neutrino oscillation data) , the
mass ordering pattern , normal or inverted, and to distinguish whether neutrinos are of Majorana
or Dirac type. Event rates of neutrino-pair emission, when the mechanism of macroscopic coherence
amplification works, may become large enough for realistic experiments by carefully selecting
certain types of target atoms or ions doped in crystals. The problem to be overcome is macro-coherently
amplified quantum electrodynamic background of the process, $\gamma_0 + | e\rangle \rightarrow
\gamma +\gamma_2 + \gamma_3+ | g\rangle $, when two extra photons, $\gamma_2\,, \gamma_3$, escape
detection. We illustrate our idea using neutral Xe and trivalent Ho ion doped in dielectric crystals.
