The objective of this work is to investigate the challenges encountered in Scale-Resolving Simulations
(SRS's) of turbulent wake flows driven by spatially-developing coherent structures. SRS's of
practical interest are expressly intended for efficiently computing such flows by resolving only
the most important features of the coherent structures and modelling the remainder as stochastic
field. The success of SRS methods depends upon three important factors: i) ability to identify key
flow mechanisms responsible for the generation of coherent structures; ii) determine the optimum
range of resolution required to adequately capture key elements of coherent structures; and iii)
ensure that the modelled part is comprised nearly exclusively of fully-developed stochastic turbulence.
This study considers the canonical case of the flow around a circular cylinder to address these three
key issues. It is first demonstrated using experimental evidence that the vortex-shedding instability
and flow-structure development involves four important stages. A series of SRS computations of
progressively increasing resolution are performed. An a priori basis for locating the origin of
the coherent structures development is proposed and examined. The criterion is based on the fact
that the coherent structures are generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. The most
important finding is that the key aspects of coherent structures can be resolved only if the effective
computational Reynolds number exceeds the critical value of the KH instability in laminar flows.
Finally, a quantitative criterion assessing the nature of the unresolved field based on the strain-rate
ratio of mean and unresolved fields is examined. The two proposed conditions and underlying rationale
offer a quantitative basis for develop "good practice" guidelines for SRS of complex turbulent
wake flows with coherent structures.
