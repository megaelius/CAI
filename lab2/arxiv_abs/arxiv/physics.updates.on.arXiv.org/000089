Of the different ways of representing a multi-unit system, the one afforded by networks is among
the most elegant and general. Endowing a system with a network representation requires defining
nodes and links connecting them. Often physical or virtual relationships between the elements
of the system, e.g. anatomic brain fibres or hyper-links between the pages of a web site, constrain
the way a link is defined. When such relationships are not clearly apparent, yet functional links
can be built as long as time evolving variables are associated to each node, as e.g. the time evolution
of a stock price, or of brain activity in a given region. We propose a third, novel, method which allows
treating collections of isolated, possibly heterogeneous, scalars, e.g. sets of biomedical tests,
as networked systems. The method builds a network where each node represents a feature, while each
pairing quantifies the deviation between those two features and the corresponding typical relationship
between them within a studied population. Topological characteristics can then be used to extract
important information about the system. In particular, atypical or pathological conditions correspond
to strongly heterogeneous networks, whereas typical or normative conditions are characterized
by sparsely connected networks with homogeneous nodes. Insofar as a network representation of
each instance or subject is constructed with reference to the population to which he is compared,
this technique is by its very nature a difference seeker. We apply the method to unveil the importance
of specific genes in the response of a plant, the {\it Arabidopsis thaliana}, to osmotic stress.
The most important genes turned out to be the nodes with highest centrality in the reconstructed
networks, such that, when they are knocked out, different phenotypes appear...
