In the treatment plan optimization for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), dose-deposition
coefficient (DDC) matrix is often pre-computed to parameterize the dose contribution to each voxel
in the volume of interest from each beamlet of unit intensity. However, due to the limitation of computer
memory and the requirement on computational efficiency, in practice matrix elements of small values
are usually truncated, which inevitably compromises the quality of the resulting plan. A fixed-point
iteration scheme has been applied in IMRT optimization to solve this problem, which has been reported
to be effective and efficient based on the observations of the numerical experiments. In this paper,
we aim to point out the mathematics behind this scheme and to answer the following three questions:
1) whether the fixed-point iteration algorithm converges or not? 2) when it converges, whether
the fixed point solution is same as the original solution obtained with the complete DDC matrix?
3) if not the same, whether the fixed point solution is more accurate than the naive solution of the
truncated problem obtained without the fixed-point iteration? To answer these questions, we first
performed mathematical analysis and deductions using a simplified fluence map optimization (FMO)
model. Then we conducted numerical experiments on a head-and-neck patient case using both the simplified
and the original FMO model. Both our mathematical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate
that with proper DDC matrix truncation, the fixed-point iteration can converge. Even though the
converged solution is not the one that we obtain with the complete DDC matrix, the fixed-point iteration
scheme could significantly improve the plan accuracy compared with the solution to the truncated
problem obtained without the fixed-point iteration.
