This paper presents the WDM, a method of evaluating partisan gerrymandering. The WDM measures a
state's districting plan by weighting each district according to vote share. A district with a vote
share beneficial to a party is rated higher by the WDM method while a district with a vote share harmful
to the party is rated lower. The average of these weights is the WDM result, and is a measure of gerrymandering.
The goal of a gerrymander is to manipulate district boundaries to produce safe seats for one party
and packed districts for the other. It is this behavior that the WDM measures The Weighted Districts
Method is similar to and will be compared to the Efficiency Gap method, which weights each district
by its number of wasted votes. The Efficiency Gap was introduced in 2014 and since that time there
have been a number of articles pointing out its flaws. The Weighted Districts Method essentially
corrects the two most glaring flaws and suggests a correction for a third. The first flaw, turnout-bias,
arises from the use of actual votes in wasted votes calculations and is the reason the Efficiency
Gap fails the Efficiency Principle. Turnout-bias is removed by using district vote percentages
instead of district vote totals when calculating wasted votes. The second and most glaring flaw,
the discontinuity in the weighting of districts around 50 percent vote-share, is the source of the
volatility in the Efficiency Gap results. The Weighted District Method avoids this flaw by deriving
its weighting function via a harm-benefit analysis, and through this lens, the origin of the Efficiency
Gap discontinuity is clarified. The third flaw, the slope of 2 used in the Efficiency Gap calculations,
is shown not to fit election data. It is suggested that the slope be changed to 3. This paper also explains
why the Efficiency Gap cannot be correctly plotted on a seats-votes curve.
