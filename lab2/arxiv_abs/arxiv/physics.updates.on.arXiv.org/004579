The evolution of cooperation among unrelated individuals in human and animal societies remains
a challenging issue across disciplines. It is an important subject also in the evolutionary game
theory to understand how cooperation arises. The subject has been extensively studied especially
in Prisoners' dilemma game(PD) but the emergence of cooperation is also an important subject in
public goods game(PGG). In this article, we consider coevolutionary PGG on complex networks where
both the topology of the networks and strategies that players adopt under the influence of game dynamics
varies. Though cooperators can contribute a fixed amount per game in PGG on networks in the previous
studies, the cooperators contribute a fixed amount per member of the group in PGG of this article.
The latter is seemed to be more natural than the former model. These models lead to great differences
in both PGGs. We study what effects on the evolution of player's strategies, defection and cooperation
and the average payoff does the interaction between the game dynamics and the network topology bring.
Moreover by comparing the models that do not depend on game dynamics to the models without topology
changing, we intend to uncover the effect of the topology chnage and the game dynamics on the promotion
of the cooperation. As result we intend to clear in what situations cooperation strategy is promoted
or preserved by investigating them by making computer simulations. We also investigate the relation
between the ratio of the cooperator and the average payoff over all players. Furthermore we study
how do the topology of initial networks have an influence on the cooperation and the average payoff.
