Rigid SUSY with gauge symmetry has a simple form for the Higgs potential. It is the positive semi--definite
sum of the squares of the auxiliary fields. Setting the potential to zero yields a set of equations
for the Vacuum Expectation Values (`VEVs') of the scalar fields. These VEVs yield zero vacuum energy
for the Higgs potential, even after gauge symmetry breaking (`GSB'). Nothing like this happens
in theories without SUSY. However, there are four problems that make this initially promising feature
look quite useless and ineffective: (1) SUSY has too many Higgs Fields. (2) SUSY predicts supermultiplets.
(3) Spontaneous breaking of SUSY looks contrived and it is unsuccessful anyway (because of the sum
rules and the huge auxiliary VEVs). (4) There are negative terms in the supergravity version of the
Higgs potential. These problems are normally considered to be an inevitable consequence of SUSY.
However, using a technique we call suppression of fields (or `flipping'), we can remove all four
problems, without disturbing the basic algebra of SUSY. We start with a conventional Grand Unified
Supergravity Theory (`GUST'), and its BRST Master Equation. The BRST Master Equation treats fields
and Zinn sources more or less like coordinates and momenta in the Classical Poisson Bracket, and
that suggests exchanging the fields and the Zinn sources, as in a canonical transfomation. We call
this flipping. The resulting new `suppressed' GUST has a simple quadratic Higgs potential, and
so it has a naturally zero cosmological constant after GSB (at tree level). It also has a Master Equation,
simply derived from the original GUST, that preserves its symmetry, and its unitarity.
