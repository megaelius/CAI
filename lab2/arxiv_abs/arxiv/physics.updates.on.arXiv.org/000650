In this paper, we consider the physical mechanism for the clustering of inertial particles in the
inertial range of isotropic turbulence. We analyze the exact, but unclosed, equation governing
the radial distribution function (RDF) and compare the mechanisms it describes for clustering
in the dissipation and inertial ranges. We demonstrate that in the limit ${St_r\ll1}$, where $St_r$
is the Stokes number based on the eddy turnover timescale at separation $r$, the clustering in the
inertial range can be understood to be due to the preferential sampling of the coarse-grained fluid
velocity gradient tensor at that scale. When ${St_r\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(1)}$ this mechanism gives
way to a non-local clustering mechanism. These findings reveal that the clustering mechanisms
in the inertial range are analogous to the mechanisms that we identified for the dissipation regime
(see \emph{New J. Phys.} \textbf{16}:055013, 2014). Further, we discuss the similarities and
differences between the clustering mechanisms we identify in the inertial range and the "sweep-stick"
mechanism developed by Coleman \& Vassilicos (Phys. Fluids 21:113301, 2009). We argue that
when ${St_r\ll1}$ the sweep-stick mechanism is equivalent to our mechanism in the inertial range
if the particles are suspended in Navier-Stokes turbulence, but that the sweep-stick mechanism
breaks down for ${St_r\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The argument also explains why the sweep-stick
mechanism is unable to predict particle clustering in kinematic simulations. We then consider
the closed, model equation for the RDF given in Zaichik \& Alipchenkov (Phys. Fluids. 19:113308,
2007) and use this, together with the results from our analysis, to predict the analytic form of the
RDF in the inertial range for ${St_r\ll1}$, which, unlike that in the dissipation range, is not scale-invariant.
The results are in good agreement with direct...
