Functionalizing colloids with reactive DNA linkers is a versatile way of programming self-assembly.
DNA selectivity provides direct control over colloid-colloid interactions allowing the engineering
of structures such as complex crystals or gels. However, self-assembly of localized and finite
structures remains an open problem with many potential applications. In this work, we present a
system in which functionalized surfaces initiate a cascade reaction between linkers leading to
self-assembly of crystals with a controllable number of layers. Specifically, we consider colloidal
particles functionalized by two families of complementary DNA linkers with mobile anchoring points,
as found in experiments using emulsions or lipid bilayers. In bulk, intra-particle linkages formed
by pairs of complementary linkers prevent the formation of inter-particle bridges and therefore
colloid-colloid aggregation. However, colloids interact strongly with the surface given that
the latter can destabilize intra-particle linkages. When in direct contact with the surface, colloids
are activated, meaning that they feature more unpaired DNA linkers ready to react. Activated colloids
can then capture and activate other colloids from the bulk through the formation of inter-particle
linkages. Using simulations and theory, validated by existing experiments, we clarify the thermodynamics
of the activation and binding process and explain how particle-particle interactions, within
the adsorbed phase, weaken as a function of the distance from the surface. The latter observation
underlies the possibility of self-assembling finite aggregates with controllable thickness
and flat solid-gas interfaces. Our design suggests a new avenue to fabricate heterogeneous and
finite structures.
