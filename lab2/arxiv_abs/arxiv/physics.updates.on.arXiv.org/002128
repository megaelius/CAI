Purpose: The aim of this phantom study was to evaluate the influence of patient alignment on the image
quality by a C-arm flat-panel detector computer tomography (CACT). Materials and Methods: An ACR
phantom placed in two opposite directions along the z-Axis was imaged using a CACT. Image acquisition
was performed by three different image acquisition protocols using fixed X-ray tube voltages of
81, 102 and 125 kVp. The images were reconstructed with four different convolution kernels, i.e.
normal, sharp, soft and very soft. Image quality was assessed in terms of high contrast image quality
using the modulation transfer function (MTF) and low contrast image quality by assessing the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) as well as reliability of density measurements.
Furthermore, the dose intensity profiles parallel and perpendicular to the patient support were
measured free-in-air. Results: The intensity profile of the CACT measured by the detector system
free-in-air showed that the anode heel effect is not in the longitudinal direction to the z-axis.
The image noises measured in Setup A for the air and bone inserts were systematically higher compared
to those measured in Setup B, in average about 3% and 4% for the air and bone inserts, respectively.
An opposite behavior has been observed for the polyethylene, water-equivalent and acrylic inserts.
The corresponding image noises were in average about 4%, 6% and 2% lower measured in Setup A compared
to those measured in Setup B. SNR for all inserts behaves inversely to the image noise. Conclusion:
The patient alignment has a minor influence on the image quality of CACT. This effect is not based
on the X-ray anode heel effect. It is caused mainly. This effect is caused mainly by the non-symmetrical
rotation of the CACT.
