We present a novel discontinuous Galerkin algorithm for the solution of a class of Fokker-Planck
collision operators. These operators arise in many fields of physics, and our particular application
is for kinetic plasma simulations. In particular, we focus on an operator often known as the `Lenard-Bernstein,'
or `Dougherty,' operator. Several novel algorithmic innovations are reported. The concept of
weak-equality is introduced and used to define weak-operators to compute primitive moments needed
in the updates. Weak-equality is also used to determine a reconstruction procedure that allows
an efficient and accurate discretization of the diffusion term. We show that when two integration
by parts are used to construct the discrete weak-form, and finite velocity-space extents are accounted
for, a scheme that conserves density, momentum and energy exactly is obtained. One novel feature
is that the requirements of momentum and energy conservation lead to unique formulas to compute
primitive moments. Careful definition of discretized moments also ensure that energy is conserved
in the piecewise linear case, even though the $v^2$ term is not included in the basis-set used in the
discretization. A series of benchmark problems are presented and show that the scheme conserves
momentum and energy to machine precision. Empirical evidence also indicates that entropy is a non-decreasing
function. The collision terms are combined with the Vlasov equation to study collisional Landau
damping and plasma heating via magnetic pumping. We conclude with an outline of future work, in particular
with some indications of how the algorithms presented here can be extended to use the Rosenbluth
potentials to compute the drag and diffusion coefficients.
