Cybersecurity attacks are a major and increasing burden to economic and social systems globally.
Here we analyze the principles of security in different domains and demonstrate an architectural
flaw in current cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is inherently weak because it is missing the ability
to defend the overall system instead of individual computers. The current architecture enables
all nodes in the computer network to communicate transparently with one another, so security would
require protecting every computer in the network from all possible attacks. In contrast, other
systems depend on system-wide protections. In providing conventional security, police patrol
neighborhoods and the military secures borders, rather than defending each individual household.
Likewise, in biology, the immune system provides security against viruses and bacteria using primarily
action at the skin, membranes, and blood, rather than requiring each cell to defend itself. We propose
applying these same principles to address the cybersecurity challenge. This will require: (a)
Enabling pervasive distribution of self-propagating securityware and creating a developer community
for such securityware, and (b) Modifying the protocols of internet routers to accommodate adaptive
security software that would regulate internet traffic. The analysis of the immune system architecture
provides many other principles that should be applied to cybersecurity. Among these principles
is a careful interplay of detection and action that includes evolutionary improvement. However,
achieving significant security gains by applying these principles depends strongly on remedying
the underlying architectural limitations.
