The mechanical integrity of arteries is of prime importance, for a proper oxygen and nutrients delivery
to all organs. To optimize their mechanical properties, healthy arteries exhibit a complex hierarchical
microstructure which ensures a sufficient compliance at low stresses and which stiffens at higher
stresses, preventing over-dilatation. In this article, we propose a vast literature survey on
how the mechanical properties of arteries are related to structural features. We first review the
characteristics of arterial microstructure and composition and then we review the mechanical
behavior of arteries. This allows evidencing, for the first time, the strong correlation existing
between elastin and collagen contents within the arterial wall. However, bringing together most
of the available mechanical tests on arterial walls shows the important variability of the mechanical
arterial response. The presentation is organized at three different scales: at the tissue (macroscopic)
scale, at the (micrometer) scale of the fiber networks, and at the (submicrometer) fibrillar and
cellular scale. Glossary: Autoclave: pressure chamber used to carry out processes requiring elevated
temperature and pressure different from ambient air pressure. In the sequel, autoclaving is used
to separate soluble proteins (such as collagen) from non-soluble proteins (such as elastin). Constitutive
relation: in mechanics, material-specific relation between stress and strain that characterizes
the response of the material to an applied mechanical loading. In vivo pre stretch and pre stress:
The in vivo state of the arterial tissue is not free of mechanical loading; in particular, it is subjected
to an axial elongation and residual stresses. Staining: auxiliary technique used in microscopy
to highlight structures in materials. For biological tissues, it involves the use of structure-specific
dyes. Nomenclature: not needed
