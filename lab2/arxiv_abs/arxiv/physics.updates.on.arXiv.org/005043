Knowledge of the mechanical properties of the aorta is essential as important concerns regarding
the treatment of aortic pathologies, such as atherosclerosis, aneurysms and dissections, are
fundamentally mechanobiological. A comprehensive review is presented in the current chapter.
As the function of arteries is to carry blood to the peripheral organs, the main biomechanical properties
of interest are elasticity and rupture properties. Regarding elastic properties, an essential
parameter remains the physiological linearized elastic modulus in the circumferential direction,
although sophisticated constitutive equations including hyperelasticity are available to model
the complex coupled roles played by collagen, elastin and smooth muscle cells in the mechanics of
the aorta. Regarding rupture properties, tensile strengths in the axial and circumferential directions
are on the order of 1.5 MPa in the thoracic aorta and the radial strength, which is important regarding
dissections, is about 0.1 MPa. All these properties may vary spatially and change with the adaptation
of the aortic wall to different conditions through growth and remodelling. The progression of diseases,
such as aneurysms and atherosclerosis, also manifests with alterations of these material properties.
After presenting how the mechanical properties of elastic arteries, including the aorta, can be
measured and how they can be used in models to predict the biomechanical response of same under different
circumstances, a section will focus on the biomechanics of the ascending thoracic aorta and the
chapter will end with current challenges regarding predictive numerical simulations for personalized
medicine.
