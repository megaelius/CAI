This paper presents numerical simulations of dual-frequency second-order ultrasound field (SURF)
reverberation suppression transmit-pulse complexes. Such propagation was previously studied
in a homogeneous medium. Here instead the propagation path includes a strongly aberrating body-wall
modeled by a sequence of delay-screens. The applied SURF transmit pulse complexes each consist
of a high-frequency imaging 3.5 MHz pulse combined with a low-frequency 0.5 MHz sound speed manipulation
pulse. Furthermore, the feasibility of two signal post-processing methods are investigated using
the aberrated transmit SURF beams. These methods are previously shown to adjust the depth of maximum
SURF reverberation suppression within a homogeneous medium. The request of the study arises because
imaging situations where reverberation suppression is useful are also likely to produce pulse
wave-front distortion (aberration). Such distortions could potentially produce time-delays
that cancel the accumulated propagation time-delay needed for the SURF reverberation suppression
technique. Results show that both the generation of synthetic SURF reverberation suppression
imaging transmit-beams, and the following post-processing adjustments, are attainable even
when a body-wall introduces time-delays which are larger than previously reported delays measured
on human body-wall specimens. The peer-reviewed version of this paper is published in IEEE Transactions
