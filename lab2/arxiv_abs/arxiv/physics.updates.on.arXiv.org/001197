We study the propagation of finite bubbles in a Hele-Shaw channel, where a centred occlusion (termed
a rail) is introduced to provide a small axially-uniform depth constriction. For bubbles wide enough
to span the channel, the system's behaviour is similar to that of semi-infinite fingers and a symmetric
static solution is stable. Here, we focus on smaller bubbles, in which case the symmetric static
solution is unstable and the static bubble is displaced towards one of the deeper regions of the channel
on either side of the rail. Using a combination of experiments and numerical simulations of a depth-averaged
model, we show that a bubble propagating axially due to a small imposed flow rate can be stabilised
in a steady symmetric mode centred on the rail through a subtle interaction between stabilising
viscous forces and destabilising surface tension forces. However, for sufficiently large capillary
numbers Ca, the ratio of viscous to surface tension forces, viscous forces in turn become destabilising
thus returning the bubble to an off-centred propagation regime. With decreasing bubble size, the
range of Ca for which steady centred propagation is stable decreases, and eventually vanishes through
the coalescence of two supercritical pitchfork bifurcations. The depth-averaged model is found
to accurately predict all the steady modes of propagation observed experimentally, and provides
a comprehensive picture of the underlying steady bifurcation structure. However, for sufficiently
large imposed flow rates, we find that initially centred bubbles do not converge onto a steady mode
of propagation. Instead they transiently explore weakly unstable steady modes, an evolution which
results in their break-up and eventual settling into a steady propagating state of changed topology.
