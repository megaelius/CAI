Many snakes live in deserts, forests, and river valleys and traverse challenging 3-D terrain like
rocks, felled trees, and rubble, with obstacles as large as themselves and variable surface properties.
By contrast, apart from branch cantilevering, burrowing, swimming, and gliding, laboratory studies
of snake locomotion focused on that on simple flat surfaces. Here, to begin to understand snake locomotion
in complex 3-D terrain, we study how the variable kingsnake, a terrestrial generalist, traversed
a large step of variable surface friction and step height (up to 30% snout-vent length). The snake
traversed by partitioning its body into three sections with distinct functions. Body sections
below and above the step oscillated laterally on horizontal surfaces for propulsion, while the
body section in between cantilevered in a vertical plane to bridge the large height increase. As
the animal progressed, these three sections traveled down its body, conforming overall body shape
to the step. In addition, the snake adjusted the partitioned gait in response to increase in step
height and decrease in surface friction, at the cost of reduced speed. As surface friction decreased,
body movement below and above the step changed from a continuous lateral undulation with little
slip to an intermittent oscillatory movement with much slip, and initial head lift-off became closer
to the step. Given these adjustments, body partitioning allowed the snake to be always stable, even
when initially cantilevering but before reaching the surface above. Such a partitioned gait may
be generally useful for diverse, complex 3-D terrain.
