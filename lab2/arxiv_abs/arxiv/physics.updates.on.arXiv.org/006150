Given the challenges in data acquisition and modeling at the stage of detailed exploration, it is
difficult to develop a prospectivity model, particularly for disseminated ore deposits. Recently,
the weights of evidence (WofE) method has demonstrated a high efficiency for modeling such deposits.
In this study, we propose a framework for creating a three-dimensional (3D) weights of evidence-based
prospectivity model of the Nochoun porphyry Cu deposit in the Urmia-Dokhtar magmatic arc of Iran.
The input data include qualitative geological and quantitative geochemical information obtained
from boreholes and field observations. We combine ordinary and fuzzy weights of evidence for integrating
qualitative and quantitative exploration criteria in a 3D space constrained by a metallogenic
model of the study area for identifying a deep-seated ore body. Ordinary weights of evidence are
determined for geological data, including lithology, alteration, rock type, and structure. Moreover,
we determine the fuzzy weight of evidence for each class of continuous geochemical models created
based on Fe, Mo, and Zn concentration values derived from boreholes. We integrate the input evidential
models using WofE and create two prospectivity models (i.e., posterior and studentized posterior
probability). We also determine anomalous voxels in the probability models using concentration-volume
fractal models and validate them using prediction-volume plots. The modeling results indicate
that the studentized posterior probability model is more efficient in identifying voxels representing
copper mineralized rock volumes. We provide open source software for the proposed framework which
can be used for exploring deep-seated ore bodies in other regions.
