Based on several recent developments in relativistic astrophysics and observational cosmology,
this article discusses prospects of (1) theoretical structure of General Relativity (GR) in the
new era and (2) submission of GR to new and previously unanticipated tests. It explores the internal
theoretical challenges experienced by the theory and challenges produced by it in the otherwise
successful journey of 100 years. Gravitational collapse, geometrization of laws of physics, absence
of strong field astronomical tests, the dark components of the universe (Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
+ Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$ ) or something similar) and cosmological inflation have not
only created serious challenges for the theory but also have ignited contemplation for alternatives
and attempts for constraining them through observations. The article first explains the nature
of the theory and how it was perceived by scientific community a century ago. It then highlights certain
perspectives from cosmology and quantum gravity, the ultimate applications of the theory. With
the advent of modern observing techniques, the theory has been experiencing tug of war with several
tests. Our true journey with the theory has started only recently, thanks to the development of gravitational
wave astronomy and extremely large telescopes some of which are and will be dedicated to test the
theory by exploring previously uncharted regions of the universe. Incorporating several aspects
of observational astronomy and cosmology, gravitational wave research and theoretical physics
the article presents the new challenges created by the theory and also their prospects.
