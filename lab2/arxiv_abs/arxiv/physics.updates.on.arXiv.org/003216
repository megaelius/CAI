We report measurements of the floating potential of magnetic and non-magnetic spherical probes
immersed in a magnetized rf discharge plasma. The discharge is ignited between a transparent indium
tin coated (TIO) glass electrode and a metal electrode after applying an rf signal (13.56 MHz). A
strong superconducting electromagnet (0 to 4 T) with Helmholtz coils configuration is used to magnetize
the plasma species. In this study, the size of the spherical probes are taken either in the range of
or greater than the Debye length. To determine the surface potential, the plasma potential is measured
using an emissive probe. The surface potential of the spherical probe first increases, i.e. becomes
more negative, at low magnetic field, attains a maximum value at some field strength, and after that
it starts to decrease with increasing magnetic field. The rate of increase and decrease of the surface
potential mainly depends on the magnetized plasma environment and types of materials (magnetic
or non-magnetic) of the object. The surface potential of the magnetic spherical probe in the plasma
is found to be higher (more negative) than that of the non-magnetic spherical probe in the presence
of a magnetic field. In other words, the non-magnetic probe collects less negative charges on its
surface than a smaller sized magnetic probe in the magnetic field. Also, the magnetic probes show
less size dependence in the presence of a magnetic field. The variation of the floating potential
or negative charge of the spherical probes is understood on the basis of a modification of the collection
currents to the spherical object due to charge confinement and cross field diffusion in the presence
of an external magnetic field.
