Magnetic clouds (MCs) are twisted magnetic structures ejected from the Sun and probed by in situ
instruments. They are typically modeled as flux ropes (FRs). The determination of the FR global
characteristics requires the estimation of the FR axis orientation. Among the developed methods,
the minimum variance (MV) is the most flexible, and features only a few assumptions. However, as
other methods, MV has biases. We aim to investigate the limits of the method and extend it to a less
biased method. We first identified the origin of the biases by testing the MV method on cylindrical
and elliptical models with a temporal expansion comparable to the one observed in MCs. Then, we developed
an improved MV method to reduce these biases. In contrast with many previous publications we find
that the ratio of the MV eigenvalues is not a reliable indicator of the precision of the derived FR
axis direction. Next, we emphasize the importance of the FR boundaries selected since they strongly
affect the deduced axis orientation. We have improved the MV method by imposing that the same amount
of azimuthal flux should be present before and after the time of closest approach to the FR axis. We
emphasize the importance of finding simultaneously the FR axis direction and the location of the
boundaries corresponding to a balanced magnetic flux, so as to minimize the bias on the deduced FR
axis orientation. This method can also define an inner flux-balanced sub-FR. We show that the MV
results are much less biased when a compromise in size of this sub-FR is achieved. For weakly asymmetric
field temporal profiles, the improved MV provides a very good determination of the FR axis orientation.
The main remaining bias is moderate (lower than 6 degrees) and is present mostly on the angle between
the flux rope axis and the plane perpendicular to the Sun-Earth direction.
