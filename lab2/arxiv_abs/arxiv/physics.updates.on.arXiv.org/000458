Two isotopic chemical reactions, $\mathrm{Ne}^*$ + NH$_3$, and $\mathrm{Ne}^*$ + ND$_3$, have
been studied at low collision energies by means of a merged beams technique. Partial cross sections
have been recorded for the two reactive channels, namely $\mathrm{Ne}^*$ + NH$_3$ $\rightarrow$
Ne + NH$_3^+$ + $e^-$, and $\mathrm{Ne}^*$ + NH$_3$ $\rightarrow$ Ne + NH$_2^+$ + H + $e^-$, by detecting
the NH$_3^+$ and NH$_2^+$ product ions, respectively. The cross sections for both reactions were
found to increase with decreasing collision energy, $E_{coll}$, in the range 8 $\mu$eV$<E_{coll}<$
20 meV. The measured rate constant exhibits a curvature in a log(k)-log($E_{coll}$) plot from which
it is concluded that the Langevin capture model does not properly describe the $\mathrm{Ne}^*$
+ NH$_3$ reaction in the entire range of collision energies covered here. Calculations based on
multichannel quantum defect theory were performed to reproduce and interpret the experimental
results. Good agreement was obtained by including long range van der Waals interactions combined
with a 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential. The branching ratio between the two reactive channels, $\Gamma
= \frac{[NH_2^+]}{[NH_2^+]+[NH_3^+]}$, is relatively constant, $\Gamma\approx 0.3$, in the
entire collision energy range studied here. Possible reasons for this observation are discussed
and rationalised in terms of relative time scales of the reactant approach and the molecular rotation.
Isotopic differences between the $\mathrm{Ne}^*$ + NH$_3$ and $\mathrm{Ne}^*$ + ND$_3$ reactions
are small, as suggested by nearly equal branching ratios and cross sections for the two reactions.
