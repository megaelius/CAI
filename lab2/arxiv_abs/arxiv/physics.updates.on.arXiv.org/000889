Creating tetrahedral meshes with anatomically accurate surfaces is critically important for
a wide range of model-based neuroimaging modalities. However, computationally efficient brain
meshing algorithms and software are greatly lacking. Here, we report a fully automated open-source
software to rapidly create high-quality tetrahedral meshes from brain segmentations. Built upon
various open-source meshing utilities, the proposed meshing workflow allows robust generation
of complex head and brain mesh models from multi-label volumes, tissue probability maps, surface
meshes and their combinations. The quality of the complex tissue boundaries is preserved through
a surface-based approach, allowing fine-grained control over the sizes and quality of the mesh
elements through explicit user-defined meshing criteria. The proposed meshing pipeline is highly
versatile and compatible with many commonly used brain analysis tools, including SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer,
and BrainSuite. With this mesh-generation pipeline, we demonstrate that one can generate 3D full-head
meshes that combine scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, white matter, and air cavities
with a typical processing time of less than 40 seconds. This approach can also incorporate highly
detailed cortical and white matter surface meshes derived from FSL and FreeSurfer with tissue segmentation
data. Finally, a high-quality brain atlas mesh library for different age groups, ranging from infants
to elderlies, was built to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed workflow, as well as to serve
as a common platform for simulation-based brain studies. Our open-source meshing software "brain2mesh"
