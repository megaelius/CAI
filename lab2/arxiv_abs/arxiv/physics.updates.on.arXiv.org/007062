This work experimentally studies silicon-cored tungsten nanowire selective metamaterial absorber
to enhance solar-thermal energy harvesting, simply fabricated by conformally coating a thin tungsten
layer onto a commercial silicon nanowire stamp. Scanning electron microscopy is used to characterize
the morphology change before and after the tungsten deposition, while optical spectroscopy is
carried out to measure the spectral absorptance (or emittance) in the broad wavelength range from
solar spectrum to infrared. It is shown that the tungsten nanowire absorber exhibits almost the
same total solar absorptance around 0.85 as the silicon nanowire but with greatly reduced total
emittance down to 0.18, which could significantly suppress the infrared emission heat loss. A lab-scale
solar-thermal test apparatus is used to measure the solar-thermal efficiency of the tungsten nanowire
absorbers from 1 up to 20 suns, experimentally demonstrating the improved performance due to excellent
spectral selectivity over the silicon nanowire and black absorbers. With detailed heat transfer
analysis, it is found that the tungsten nanowire absorber achieves an experimental efficiency
of 41% at temperature 203degC during the solar-thermal test with stagnation temperature 273degC
under 6.3 suns. It is projected to reach 74% efficiency at same temperature 203degC with stagnation
temperature of 430degC for practical application without parasitic radiative losses from side
and bottom surfaces, greatly outperforming the silicon nanowire and black absorbers. The results
would facilitate the development of novel metamaterial selective absorbers at low cost for highly-efficient
solar thermal energy systems.
