Photodissociation by ultraviolet radiation is the key destruction pathway for CS in photon-dominated
regions, such as diffuse clouds. However, the large uncertainties of photodissociation cross
sections and rates of CS, resulting from a lack of both laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations,
limit the accuracy of calculated abundances of S-bearing molecules by modern astrochemical models.
Here we show a detailed \textit{ab initio} study of CS photodissociation. Accurate potential energy
curves of CS electronic states were obtained by choosing an active space CAS(8,10) in MRCI+Q/aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z
calculation with additional diffuse functions, with a focus on the \(B\) and \(C\,^1\Sigma^+\)
states. Cross sections for both direct photodissociation and predissociation from the vibronic
ground state were calculated by applying the coupled-channel method. We found that the \(C-X\)
\((0-0)\) transition has extremely strong absorption due to a large transition dipole moment in
the Franck-Condon region and the upper state is resonant with several triplet states via spin-orbit
couplings, resulting in predissociation to the main atomic products C \((^3P)\) and S \((^1D)\).
Our new calculations show the photodissociation rate under the standard interstellar radiation
field is \(2.9\ee{-9}\)\,s\(^{-1}\), with a 57\% contribution from \(C-X\) \((0-0)\) transition.
This value is larger than that adopted by the Leiden photodissociation and photoionization database
by a factor of 3.0. Our accurate \textit{ab initio} calculations will allow more secure determination
of S-bearing molecules in astrochemical models.
