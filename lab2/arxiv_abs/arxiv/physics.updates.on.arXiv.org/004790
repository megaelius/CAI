Spin-echo functional MRI (SE-fMRI) has the potential to improve spatial specificity when compared
to gradient-echo fMRI. However, high spatiotemporal resolution SE-fMRI with large slice-coverage
is challenging as SE-fMRI requires a long echo time (TE) to generate blood oxygenation level-dependent
(BOLD) contrast, leading to long repetition times (TR). The aim of this work is to develop an acquisition
method that enhances the slice-coverage of SE-fMRI at high spatiotemporal resolution. An acquisition
scheme was developed entitled Multisection Excitation by Simultaneous Spin-echo Interleaving
(MESSI) with complex-encoded generalized SLIce Dithered Enhanced Resolution (cgSlider). MESSI
utilizes the dead-time during the long TE by interleaving the excitation and readout of two slices
to enable 2x slice-acceleration, while cgSlider utilizes the stable temporal background phase
in SE-fMRI to encode and decode two adjacent slices simultaneously with a phase-constrained reconstruction
method. The proposed cgSlider-MESSI was also combined with Simultaneous Multi-Slice (SMS) to
achieve further slice-acceleration. This combined approach was used to achieve 1.5mm isotropic
whole-brain SE-fMRI with a temporal resolution of 1.5s and was evaluated using sensory stimulation
and breath-hold tasks at 3T. Compared to conventional SE-SMS, cgSlider-MESSI-SMS provides four-fold
increase in slice-coverage for the same TR, with comparable temporal signal-to-noise ratio. Corresponding
fMRI activation from cgSlider-MESSI-SMS for both fMRI tasks were consistent with those from conventional
SE-SMS. Overall, cgSlider-MESSI-SMS achieved a 32x encoding-acceleration by combining RinplanexMBxcgSliderxMESSI=4x2x2x2.
High-quality, high-resolution whole-brain SE-fMRI was acquired at a short TR using cgSlider-MESSI-SMS.
