Stochastic parametrisations are used in weather and climate models to improve the representation
of unpredictable unresolved processes. When compared to a deterministic model, a stochastic model
represents `model uncertainty', i.e., sources of error in the forecast due to the limitations of
the forecast model. We present a technique for systematically deriving new stochastic parametrisations
or for constraining existing stochastic approaches. A high-resolution model simulation is coarse-grained
to the desired forecast model resolution. This provides the initial conditions and forcing data
needed to drive a Single Column Model (SCM). By comparing the SCM parametrised tendencies with the
evolution of the high resolution model, we can estimate the error in the SCM tendencies that a stochastic
parametrisation seeks to represent. We use this approach to assess the physical basis of the widely
used Stochastically Perturbed Parametrisation Tendencies (SPPT) scheme. We find justification
for the multiplicative nature of SPPT, and for the use of spatio-temporally correlated stochastic
perturbations. We find evidence that the stochastic perturbation should be positively skewed,
indicating that occasional large-magnitude positive perturbations are physically realistic.
However other key assumptions of SPPT are less well justified, including coherency of the stochastic
perturbations with height, coherency of the perturbations for different physical parametrisation
schemes, and coherency for different prognostic variables. Relaxing these SPPT assumptions allows
for an error model that explains a larger fractional variance than traditional SPPT. In particular,
we suggest that independently perturbing the tendencies associated with different parametrisation
schemes is justifiable, and would improve the realism of the SPPT approach.
