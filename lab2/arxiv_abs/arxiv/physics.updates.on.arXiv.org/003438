What kind of problem-solving instruction can help students apply what they have learned to solve
the new and unfamiliar problems they will encounter in the future? We propose that mathematical
sensemaking, the practice of seeking coherence between formal mathematics and conceptual understanding,
is a key target of successful physics problem-solving instruction. However, typical assessments
tend to measure understanding in more disjoint ways. To capture coherence-seeking practices in
student problem solving, we introduce an assessment framework that highlights opportunities
to use these problem-solving approaches more flexibly. Three assessment items embodying this
calculation-concept crossover framework illustrate how coherence can drive flexible problem-solving
approaches that may be more efficient, insightful, and accurate. These three assessment items
were used to evaluate the efficacy of an instructional approach focused on developing mathematical-sensemaking
skills. In a quasi-experimental study, three parallel lecture sections of first-semester, introductory
physics were compared: two mathematical sensemaking sections, with one having an experienced
instructor (MS) and one a novice instructor (MS-nov), and a traditionally-taught section acted
as a control group (CTRL). On the three crossover assessment items, mathematical sensemaking students
used calculation-concept crossover approaches more and generated more correct solutions than
CTRL students. Student surveyed epistemological views toward problem-solving coherence at the
end of the course predicted their crossover approach use but did not fully account for the differences
in crossover approach use between the MS and CTRL groups. These results illustrate new instructional
and assessment frameworks for research on mathematical sensemaking and adaptive problem-solving
expertise.
