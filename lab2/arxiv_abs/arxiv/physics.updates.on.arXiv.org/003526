Silicon pad sensors are proposed as active material in highly granular sampling calorimeters of
future collider experiments such as the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) or the International Linear
Collider (ILC). The electromagnetic section of these designs often include O(1000 m$^2$) of silicon
pad sensors. For the luminosity measurement, a dedicated forward calorimeter called LumiCal is
foreseen. More recently, the CMS experiment has decided to adopt the same concept in its endcap calorimeter
upgrade for the HL-LHC. The sensors are typically produced from 6- or 8-inch wafers and consist of
a few hundred smaller cells, each with an area of O(0.1 to 1 $\text{cm}^2$). For the prototyping phase
of these projects, several design choices have to be evaluated while for mass production, thousands
of sensors have to be tested for quality control. For the electrical characterisation of these sensors,
it is important to bias them under realistic conditions. To fulfil these requirements, ARRAY, a
compact, modular and cost efficient system for large area silicon pad sensor characterisation
has been developed and successfully commissioned. It consists of two plugin printed circuit boards:
an active switching matrix with 512 input channels that holds all controls and a passive probe card
that connects to the sensor. The latter can then be adapted to any sensor geometry. All design files
are open source. The system has been used to measure currents ranging from 500 pA to 5 $\mu$A and capacitances
between 5 pF and 100 pF. A precision of better than 0.2 pF on capacitance measurements in that range
can be achieved. Examples of calibration and measurement results for leakage current and capacitance
are presented.
