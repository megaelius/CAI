We investigate the possibility that sufficiently large electric fields and/or ionization during
geomagnetic disturbed conditions may invalidate the assumptions applied in the retrieval of neutral
horizontal winds from meteor and/or lidar measurements. As per our knowledge, the possible errors
in the wind estimation have never been reported. In the present case study, we have been using co-located
meteor radar and sodium resonance lidar zonal wind measurements over Andenes (69.27$^{\circ}$N,
16.04$^{\circ}$E) during intense substorms in the declining phase of the January 2005 solar proton
event (21-22 January 2005). In total, 14 h of measurements are available for the comparison, which
covers both quiet and disturbed conditions. For comparison, the lidar zonal wind measurements
are averaged over the same time and altitude as the meteor radar wind measurements. High cross correlations
($\sim$0.8) are found in all height regions. The discrepancies can be explained in light of differences
in the observational volumes of the two instruments. Further, we extended the comparison to address
the electric field and/or ionization impact on the neutral wind estimation. For the periods of low
ionization, the neutral winds estimated with both instruments are quite consistent with each other.
During periods of elevated ionization, comparatively large differences are noticed at the highermost
altitude, which might be due to the electric field and/or ionization impact on the wind estimation.
At present, one event is not sufficient to make any firm conclusion. Further study with more co-located
measurements are needed to test the statistical significance of the result.
