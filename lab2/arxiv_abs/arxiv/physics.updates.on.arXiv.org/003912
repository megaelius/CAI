We report on the design and performance of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) "Screener", a small liquid scintillator
detector consisting of $\approx 23$ kg of LAB-based gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator (GdLS)
to be used in the LZ Outer Detector. The Outer Detector will be filled with 17.3 tonnes of GdLS and will
surround the central liquid xenon time projection chamber of LZ. Its primary function will be to
veto neutron single-scatter events in the liquid xenon which could mimic a WIMP dark matter signal.
To meet the requirements for the Outer Detector, the radioimpurity levels in the GdLS must be kept
below $\lesssim0.07$ mBq/kg. This background level corresponds to a rate of $\approx50$ Hz above
an energy threshold of 100 keV. The Screener was operated in the ultra-low-background environment
of the former LUX water shield in the Davis Laboratory at the Sanford Underground Research Facility
for radioassay of the GdLS. Careful selection of detector materials and use of ultra-low-background
PMTs allows the measurement of a variety of radioimpurities. The $^{14}\textrm{C}$/$^{12}\textrm{C}$
ratio in the scintillator is measured to be $(2.83\pm0.06\textrm{(stat.)}\pm0.01\textrm{(sys.)})
\times 10^{-17}$. Use of pulse shape discrimination allows the concentration of isotopes throughout
the $^{238}\textrm{U}$, $^{235}\textrm{U}$, and $^{232}\textrm{Th}$ chains to be measured
by fitting the collected spectra from $\alpha$ and $\beta$ events. We find that equilibrium is broken
in the $^{238}\textrm{U}$ and $^{232}\textrm{Th}$ chains and that a significant portion of the
contamination in the GdLS results from decays in the $^{227}\textrm{Ac}$ subchain of the $^{235}\textrm{U}$
series. Predictions for the singles rate in the Outer Detector are presented. The rate from radioimpurities
above 100 keV in the GdLS is estimated to be $97.9\pm6.4$ Hz, with $65.5\pm1.9$ Hz resulting from
$\alpha$-decays.
