Proper utilization of geothermal energy for power generation is still ignored in India even after
having it's enough potential as much as the equivalent to the other nonconventional energy resources
of the country. A major thrust is required in this field of technology. The source of geothermal energy
is the decay of the radio-nuclei, such as Uranium, Thorium, and Potassium inside the Earth's crust
apart from the primordial heat source. The noble gas 4He is also produced during the radioactive
disintegration process. Therefore, measuring the amount of 4He gas generated in the terrestrial
radioactive process along with some other geochemical parameters in an Indian geothermal reservoir,
the potential of the reservoir can be evaluated without performing conventional and detailed geochemical
& geophysical techniques. Mathematical calculations relating to the radioactive disintegration
to estimate the geothermal potential of the Bakreswar geothermal area at eastern India utilizing
the concept of the 4He exploration technique has been described here. The study showed that the heat
energy generated by the radioactive decay of 238Th, 238U and 235U inside Bakreswar geothermal reservoir
was evaluated as 38 MW only considering the He emanated from the Agni Kunda hot spring. In addition,
the depth of the geothermal reservoir was also evaluated to be about 1,100 m using some geophysical
characteristics of the reservoir at the study area. Furthermore, the suitable locations of deep
drilling for the installation of the probable geothermal power plant are also identified by investigating
the resistivity survey profile of the study area.
