The high design luminosity of the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider is expected to result in
challenging levels of beam-induced backgrounds in the interaction region. Properly simulating
and mitigating these backgrounds is critical to the success of the Belle~II experiment. We report
on measurements performed with a suite of dedicated beam background detectors, collectively known
as BEAST II, during the so-called Phase 1 commissioning run of SuperKEKB in 2016, which involved
operation of both the high energy ring (HER) of 7 GeV electrons as well as the low energy ring (LER)
of 4 GeV positrons. We describe the BEAST II detector systems, the simulation of beam backgrounds,
and the measurements performed. The measurements include standard ones of dose rates versus accelerator
conditions, and more novel investigations, such as bunch-by-bunch measurements of injection
backgrounds and measurements sensitive to the energy spectrum and angular distribution of fast
neutrons. We observe beam-gas, Touschek, beam-dust, and injection backgrounds. We do not observe
significant synchrotron radiation, as expected. Measured LER beam-gas backgrounds and Touschek
backgrounds in both rings are slightly elevated, on average three times larger than the levels predicted
by simulation. HER beam-gas backgrounds are on on average two orders of magnitude larger than predicted.
Systematic uncertainties and channel-to-channel variations are large, so that these excesses
constitute only 1-2 sigma level effects. Neutron background rates are higher than predicted and
should be studied further. We will measure the remaining beam background processes, due to colliding
beams, in the imminent commissioning Phase 2. These backgrounds are expected to be the most critical
for Belle II, to the point of necessitating replacement of detector components during the Phase
3 (full-luminosity) operation of SuperKEB.
