We use the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to understand the underlying attenuation mechanism in
granular media, with special applicability to the measurements of the so-called effective mass
developed earlier. We consider that the particles interact via Hertz-Mindlin elastic contact
forces and that the damping is describable as a force proportional to the velocity difference of
contacting grains. We determine the behavior of the complex-valued normal mode frequencies using
1) DEM, 2) direct diagonalization of the relevant matrix, and 3) a numerical search for the zeros
of the relevant determinant. All three methods are in strong agreement with each other. The real
and the imaginary parts of each normal mode frequency characterize the elastic and the dissipative
properties, respectively, of the granular medium. We demonstrate that, as the interparticle damping,
$\xi$, increases, the normal modes exhibit nearly circular trajectories in the complex frequency
plane and that for a given value of $\xi$ they all lie on or near a circle of radius $R$ centered on the
point $-iR$ in the complex plane, where $R\propto 1/\xi$. We show that each normal mode becomes critically
damped at a value of the damping parameter $\xi \approx 1/\omega_n^0$, where $\omega_n^0$ is the
(real-valued) frequency when there is no damping. The strong indication is that these conclusions
carry over to the properties of real granular media whose dissipation is dominated by the relative
motion of contacting grains. For example, compressional or shear waves in unconsolidated dry sediments
can be expected to become overdamped beyond a critical frequency, depending upon the strength of
the intergranular damping constant.
