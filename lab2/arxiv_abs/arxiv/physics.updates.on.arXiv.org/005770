Emerging technologies based on tailorable interactions between photons and phonons promise new
capabilities ranging from high-fidelity microwave signal processing to non-reciprocal optics
and quantum state control. While such light-sound couplings have been studied in a variety of physical
systems, many implementations rely on non-standard materials and fabrication schemes that are
challenging to co-implement with standard integrated photonic circuitry. Notably, despite significant
advances in integrated electro-optic modulators, related acousto-optic modulator concepts
have remained relatively unexplored in silicon photonics. In this article, we demonstrate direct
acousto-optic modulation within silicon waveguides using electrically-driven surface acoustic
waves (SAWs). By co-integrating SAW transducers in piezoelectric AlN with a standard silicon-on-insulator
photonic platform, we harness silicon's strong elasto-optic effect to mediate linear light-sound
coupling. Through lithographic design, acousto-optic phase and single-sideband amplitude modulators
in the range of 1-5 GHz are fabricated, exhibiting index modulation strengths comparable to existing
electro-optic technologies. Extending this traveling-wave, acousto-optic interaction to cm-scales,
we create electrically-driven non-reciprocal modulators in silicon. Non-reciprocal operation
bandwidths of >100 GHz and insertion losses <0.6 dB are achieved. Building on these results, we show
that unity-efficiency non-reciprocal modulation, necessary for a robust acousto-optic isolator,
is within reach. The acousto-optic modulator design is compatible with both CMOS fabrication and
existing silicon photonic device technologies. These results represent a promising new approach
to implement compact and scalable acousto-optic modulators, frequency-shifters, and non-magnetic
optical isolators and circulators in integrated photonic circuits.
