Media featuring both optical gain and disorder, such as random lasers, represent formidable challenges
as subjects of research due to the high complexity of the light propagation within them; however,
dramatic advances in this nascent field have been furnished by the paradigm of applying wavefront
shaping techniques to the beam pumping the system. We present here a theoretical and experimental
study employing this approach in a gain medium where the disorder arises not from random scattering
but rather from the multimodality of a waveguide: an amplifying multimode fiber. The shaping of
the core-guided pump prior to its injection affects the complex, speckle-like patterns of excitation
within the fiber volume. Thus we are offered the intriguing prospect of manipulating the spatially
heterogeneous gain in a system where the disorder, albeit highly complex, may be fully understood
in terms of the discrete eigenmodes of a well-known waveguide. We study our medium in two different
configurations: as an optical amplifier, and as a fiber laser. In the first configuration we show
that dependence upon the pump configuration, of the amplifier transmission function, surprisingly
survives several physical mechanisms which at first sight would appear to severely limit it. This
insight is then carried on to the lasing cavity configuration, where we find striking parallels
between the behavior of the system and that of random lasers; more importantly, the pump shaping
shows a strong ability to control the complex emission, in particular - to selectively favor individual
spectral lines and stabilize single-mode operation.
