Achieving societal goals of reduced emissions and increasing energy efficiency is driving development
of new materials in two directions. One direction is lightweight materials (Mg,Al,reinforced
plastics) for low temperature applications such as transportation. The second direction is high
temperature damage-tolerant materials for increased combustion efficiency and reduced pollution
(superalloys,TiAl). Among the emerging class of `high entropy alloys', some body-centered-cubic
(BCC) HEAs have been shown to possess exceptional strengths at temperatures up to 1900K, far above
the limits of existing superalloys. These BCC-HEAs combine refractory elements Mo,Nb,Ta,V, and/or
W at near equal concentrations with the different atom types occupying the crystalline BCC lattice
sites at random. The underlying physical origins of this enabling behavior in these high-complexity
alloys are unknown. The possibility of discovering new compositions with even better performance
is intriguing. Here we show that the motion of edge dislocations through the BCC structure is strongly
inhibited by large energy barriers created by natural fluctuations in the random alloy and that
edge dislocations are predicted to control strength in these refractory BCC HEAs at high temperatures.
This is surprising because non-screw dislocations play essentially no role in strengthening of
BCC metals and dilute alloys, and screw dislocations control strength in some other types of BCC
HEAs. The theory enables a search over 600,000 compositions in the Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W family to identify
new alloys predicted to have even higher strength or strength/weight ratios. Many other compositions
with comparable strengths are predicted, and can satisfy additional performance requirements.
Overall, these insights and theory open a new direction for theory-guided design of advanced high-temperature
materials based on the high-entropy concept.
