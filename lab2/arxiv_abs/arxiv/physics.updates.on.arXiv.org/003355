Sensors are measuring tools. In any measurement, we have at least two different kinds of interactants.
We never know all there are to know about any one of these interactants and the interaction processes
that are mostly invisible. Yet, our engineering innovation driven evolution is persisting for
over five million years. It is then important to articulate explicitly our Interaction Process
Mapping Thinking, or IPMT, which we keep applying in the real world without formally recognizing
it. We present how the systematic application of IPMT removes century old wave-particle duality
by introducing a model of hybrid photon. It seamlessly bridges the quantum and the classical worlds.
Photons are discrete energy packets only at the moment of emission; then they evolve diffractively
and propagate as classical waves. We apply IPMT to improve the photoelectric equation & we obtain
Non-Interaction of Wave, or NIW. NIW was recognized by Huygens when postulating his secondary spherical
wavelets, which is now integrated into Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral, a staple for modern
optical science and engineering. Maxwell wave equation accepts HF integral as its solution. Systematic
application of IPMT to our causal and working mathematical equations, along with NIW in interferometric
experiments, reveal that Superposition Effects can emerge only when the interacting material
dipoles respond, whether classically or quantum mechanically, to the joint stimulations due to
all the simultaneously superposed waves. This indicates the non-causality of our belief that a
single indivisible photon can interfere by itself. We would not have a causally evolving universe
had any stable elementary particle were to change itself through self-interference. Further,
our working superposition equations always contain two or more terms representing two or more independently
evolving entities.
