Over the past several decades, naturally occurring and man-made mass casualty incidents (MCI)
have increased in frequency and number, worldwide. To test the impact of such event on medical resources,
simulations can provide a safe, controlled setting while replicating the chaotic environment
typical of an actual disaster. A standardised method to collect and analyse data from mass casualty
exercises is needed, in order to assess preparedness and performance of the healthcare staff involved.
We report on the use of wearable proximity sensors to measure proximity events during a MCI simulation.
We investigated the interactions between medical staff and patients, to evaluate the time dedicated
by the medical staff with respect to the severity of the injury of the victims depending on the roles.
We estimated the presence of the patients in the different spaces of the field hospital, in order
to study the patients' flow. Data were obtained and collected through the deployment of wearable
proximity sensors during a mass casualty incident functional exercise. The scenario included
two areas: the accident site and the Advanced Medical Post (AMP), and the exercise lasted 3 hours.
A total of 238 participants simulating medical staff and victims were involved. Each participant
wore a proximity sensor and 30 fixed devices were placed in the field hospital. The contact networks
show a heterogeneous distribution of the cumulative time spent in proximity by participants. We
obtained contact matrices based on cumulative time spent in proximity between victims and the rescuers.
Our results showed that the time spent in proximity by the healthcare teams with the victims is related
to the severity of the patient's injury. The analysis of patients' flow showed that the presence
of patients in the rooms of the hospital is consistent with triage code and diagnosis, and no obvious
bottlenecks were found.
