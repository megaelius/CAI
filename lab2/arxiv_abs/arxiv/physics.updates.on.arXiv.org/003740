As molecular scientists have made progress in their ability to engineer nano-scale molecular structure,
we are facing new challenges in our ability to engineer molecular dynamics (MD) and flexibility.
Dynamics at the molecular scale differs from the familiar mechanics of everyday objects, because
it involves a complicated, highly correlated, and three-dimensional many-body dynamical choreography
which is often non-intuitive even for highly trained researchers. We recently described how interactive
molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) can help to meet this challenge, enabling researchers
to manipulate real-time MD simulations of flexible structures in 3D. In this article, we outline
efforts to extend immersive technologies to the molecular sciences, and we introduce 'Narupa',
a flexible, open-source, multi-person iMD-VR software framework which enables groups of researchers
to simultaneously cohabit real-time simulation environments to interactively visualize and
manipulate the dynamics of molecular structures with atomic-level precision. We outline several
application domains where iMD-VR is facilitating research, communication, and creative approaches
within the molecular sciences, including training machines to learn reactive potential energy
surfaces (PESs), biomolecular conformational sampling, protein-ligand binding, reaction discovery
using 'on-the-fly' quantum chemistry, and transport dynamics in materials. We touch on iMD-VR's
various cognitive and perceptual affordances, and how these provide research insight for molecular
systems. By synergistically combining human spatial reasoning and design insight with computational
automation, technologies like iMD-VR have the potential to improve our ability to understand,
engineer, and communicate microscopic dynamical behavior, offering the potential to usher in
a new paradigm for engineering molecules and nano-architectures.
