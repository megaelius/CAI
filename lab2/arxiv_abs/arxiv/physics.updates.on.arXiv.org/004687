Free-space optical communication is a promising means to establish versatile, secure and high-bandwidth
communication for many critical point-to-point applications. While the spatial modes of light
offer an additional degree of freedom to increase the information capacity of an optical link, atmospheric
turbulence can introduce severe distortion to the spatial modes and lead to data degradation. Here,
we propose and demonstrate a vector-beam-based, turbulence-resilient communication protocol,
namely spatial polarization differential phase shift keying (SPDPSK), that can encode a large
number of information levels using orthogonal spatial polarization states of light. We show experimentally
that the spatial polarization profiles of the vector modes are resilient to atmospheric turbulence,
and therefore can reliably transmit high-dimensional information through a turbid channel without
the need of any adaptive optics for beam compensation. We construct a proof-of-principle experiment
with a controllable turbulence cell. Using 34 vector modes, we have measured a channel capacity
of 4.84 bits per pulse (corresponding to a data error rate of 4.3\%) through a turbulent channel with
a scintillation index larger than 1. Our SPDPSK protocol can also effectively transmit 4.02 bits
of information per pulse using 18 vector modes through even stronger turbulence with a scintillation
index of 1.54. Our study provides direct experimental evidence on how the spatial polarization
profiles of vector beams are resilient to atmospheric turbulence and paves the way towards practical,
high-capacity, free-space communication solutions with robust performance under harsh turbulent
environments.
