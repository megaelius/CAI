Multilevel self-assembly involving small structured groups of nano-particles provides new routes
to development of functional materials with a sophisticated architecture. Apart from the inter-particle
forces, the geometrical shapes and compatibility of the building blocks are decisive factors in
each phase of growth. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of these processes is essential
for the design of large assemblies of desired properties. Here, we introduce a computational model
for cooperative self-assembly with simultaneous attachment of structured groups of particles,
which can be described by simplexes (connected pairs, triangles, tetrahedrons and higher order
cliques) to a growing network, starting from a small seed. The model incorporates geometric rules
that provide suitable nesting spaces for the new group and the chemical affinity $\nu$ of the system
to accepting an excess number of particles. For varying chemical affinity, we grow different classes
of assemblies by binding the cliques of distributed sizes. Furthermore, to characterise the emergent
large-scale structures, we use the metrics of graph theory and algebraic topology of graphs, and
4-point test for the intrinsic hyperbolicity of the networks. Our results show that higher Q-connectedness
of the appearing simplicial complexes can arise due to only geometrical factors, i.e., for $\nu
= 0$, and that it can be effectively modulated by changing the chemical potential and the polydispersity
of the size of binding simplexes. For certain parameters in the model we obtain networks of mono-dispersed
clicks, triangles and tetrahedrons, which represent the geometrical descriptors that are relevant
in quantum physics and frequently occurring chemical clusters.
