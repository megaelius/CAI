Micro-bubbles are of significant interest due to the long-living signature they leave behind naval
ships. In order to numerically model and predict these bubbles in naval applications, subgrid-scale
models are required because of the extreme separation of length- and time-scales between the macroscopic
geometries and the physical processes leading to the formation of these bubbles. Yet, there is much
that is unknown about the mechanism behind the entrainment of such bubbles. Furthermore, quantitative
information regarding their size distribution and dependence on flow parameters is very limited.
Impact events are hypothesized to be the main contributor to the generation of micro-bubbles. This
is due to a phenomenon known as Mesler entrainment, which has been observed in the context of the drop-pool
impact problem. Namely, when a water droplet with diameter of $\mathcal{O}(1mm)$ impacts a deep
water pool with an impact velocity of $\mathcal{O}(1m/s)$, hundreds of air micro-bubbles are entrained
into the pool. These bubbles have been found to be remnants of a very thin air film entrapped between
the two liquid bodies. These films have extremely high aspect ratios and after being punctured,
shed micro-bubbles while retracting on time scales much shorter than the outer flow time scales.
This separation of time-scales, along with a lacking of studies on retracting thin gas films has
motivated us to study this fundamental problem with numerical simulations in two and three dimensions.
Using a diffuse interface method, we perform two-phase simulations of retracting thin gas films
in initially static liquid backgrounds to gain understanding regarding this problem and gather
statistics that can be potentially used in a subgrid-scale model to predict micro-bubble shedding
from a thin gas film. Coupling a model like this to a model that predicts the thin film characteristics
