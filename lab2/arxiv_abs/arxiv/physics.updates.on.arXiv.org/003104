The transport of self-propelled particles such as bacteria and phoretic swimmers through crowded
heterogeneous environments is relevant to many natural and engineering processes, from biofilm
formation and contamination processes to transport in soils and biomedical devices. While there
has been experimental progress, a theoretical understanding of mean transport properties in these
systems has been lacking. In this work, we apply generalized Taylor dispersion theory to analyze
the long-time statistics of an active self-propelled Brownian particle transported under an applied
flow through the interstices of a periodic lattice that serves as an idealization of a porous medium.
Our theoretical model, which we validate against Brownian dynamics simulations, is applied to
unravel the roles of motility, fluid flow, and lattice geometry on asymptotic mean velocity and
dispersivity. In weak flows, transport is dominated by active dispersion, which results from self-propulsion
in the presence of noise and is hindered by the obstacles that act as entropic barriers. In strong
flows, shear-induced Taylor dispersion becomes the dominant mechanism for spreading, with pillars
now acting as regions of shear production that enhance dispersion. The interplay of these two effects
leads to complex and unexpected trends, such as a non-monotonic dependence of axial dispersivity
on flow strength and a reduction in dispersion due to swimming activity in strong flows. Brownian
dynamics are used to cast light on the pre-asymptotic regime, where tailed distributions are observed
in agreement with recent experiments on motile micro-organisms. Our results also highlight the
subtle effects of pillar shape, which can be used to control the magnitude of dispersion and to drive
a net particle migration in quiescent systems.
