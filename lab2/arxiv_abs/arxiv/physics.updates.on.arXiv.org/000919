As power electronics shrinks down to sub-micron scale, the thermal transport from a solid surface
to environment becomes significant. Under circumstances when the device works in rare gas environment,
the scale for thermal transport is comparable to the mean free path of molecules, and is difficult
to characterize. In this work, we present an experimental study about thermal transport around
a microwire in rare gas environment by using a steady state hot wire method. Unlike conventional
hot wire technique of using transient heat transfer process, this method considers both the heat
conduction along the wire and convection effect from wire surface to surroundings. Convection
heat transfer coefficient from a platinum wire in diameter 25 um to air is characterized under different
heating power and air pressures to comprehend the effect of temperature and density of gas molecules.
It is observed that convection heat transfer coefficient varies from 14 Wm-2K-1 at 7 Pa to 629 Wm-2K-1
at atmosphere pressure. In free molecule regime, Nusselt number has a linear relationship with
inverse Knudsen number and the slope of 0.274 is employed to determined equivalent thermal dissipation
boundary as 7.03E10-4 m. In transition regime, the equivalent thermal dissipation boundary is
obtained as 5.02E10-4 m. Under a constant pressure, convection heat transfer coefficient decreases
with increasing temperature, and this correlation is more sensitive to larger pressure. This work
provides a pathway for studying both heat conduction and heat convection effect at micro/nanoscale
under rare gas environment, the knowledge of which is essential for regulating heat dissipation
in various industrial applications.
