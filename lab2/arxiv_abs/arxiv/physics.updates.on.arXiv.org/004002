The teleconnection between European climate and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) remains
difficult to isolate in observations because of internal variability and anthropogenically-forced
signals. Using model sensitivity experiments proposed within the CMIP6/DCPP-C framework, the
wintertime AMV/Europe teleconnection is investigated in large ensembles of pacemaker-type simulations
in the CNRM-CM5 global circulation model. To evaluate the sensitivity of the model response to the
AMV amplitude, experiments with AMV-forcing pattern multiplied by 2 and 3 (hereafter 2xAMV and
3xAMV, respectively) are performed in complement to the reference ensemble (1xAMV). Based on a
flow analog method, the AMV-forced atmospheric circulation is found to cool down the European continent,
whereas the residual signal, mostly including thermodynamical processes, contributes to warming.
In 1xAMV, both terms cancel each other, explaining the overall weak AMV-forced atmospheric signal.
In 2xAMV and 3xAMV, the thermodynamical contribution overcomes the dynamical cooling and is responsible
for milder and wetter conditions. The thermodynamical term includes the advection of warmer and
more humid oceanic air penetrating inland and the modification of surface radiative fluxes linked
to (i) altered cloudiness and (ii) snow-cover reduction acting as a positive feedback with the AMV
amplitude. The dynamical anomalous circulation combines (i) a remote response to enhanced diabatic
heating acting as a Rossby-wave source in the western tropical Atlantic and (ii) a local response
associated with warmer SST over the subpolar gyre favorizing an anomalous High. The weight between
the tropical-extratropical processes and associated feedbacks is speculated to partly explain
the nonlinear sensibility of the response to the AMV-forcing amplitude, challenging thus the use
of the so-called pattern-scaling technique.
