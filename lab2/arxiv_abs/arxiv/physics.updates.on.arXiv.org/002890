Characterizing the gap eigenmode of shear Alfv\'{e}n waves (SAW) and its interaction with energetic
ions is important to the success of magnetically confined fusion. Previous studies have reported
an experimental observation of the spectral gap of SAW on LAPD (Zhang et al 2008 Phys. Plasmas 15 012103),
a linear large plasma device (Gekelman et al 1991 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 62 2875) possessing easier diagnostic
access and lower cost compared with traditional fusion devices, and analytical theory and numerical
gap eigenmode using ideal conditions (Chang 2014 PhD Thesis at Australian National University).
To guide experimental implementation, the present work models the gap eigenmode of SAW using exact
LAPD parameters. A full picture of the wave field for previous experiment reveals that the previously
observed spectral gap is not global but an axially local result. To form a global spectral gap, the
number of magnetic mirrors has to be increased and stronger static magnetic field makes it more clear.
Such a spectral gap is obtained for the magnetic field of $B_0(z)=1.2+0.6\cos[2\pi (z-33.68)/3.63]$
with $7.74$~m magnetic beach. By introducing two types of local defects (corresponding to $E_\theta(z_0)=0$
and $E_\theta'(z_0)=0$ respectively), odd-parity and even-parity discrete eigenmodes are formed
clearly inside the gap. The strength of these gap eigenmodes decreases significantly with collision
frequency, which is consistent with previous studies. Parameter scans show that these gap eigenmodes
can be even formed successfully for the field strength of $B_0(z)=0.2+0.1\cos[2\pi (z-33.68)/3.63]$
and with only $4$ magnetic mirrors, which are achievable by LAPD at its present status. This work
can serve as a strong motivation and direct reference for the experimental implementation of the
gap eigenmode of SAW on LAPD and other linear plasma devices.
