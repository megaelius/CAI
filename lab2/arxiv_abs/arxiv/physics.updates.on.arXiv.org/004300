We analyse the entrainment and energetics of equal and opposite axisymmetric turbulent air plumes
in a vertically confined space at a Rayleigh number of $5.7\times 10^{6}$ using theory and direct
numerical simulation. On domains of sufficiently large aspect ratio, the steady-state consists
of turbulent plumes penetrating an interface between two layers of approximately uniform buoyancy.
As described by Baines & Turner (J. Fluid. Mech. vol. 37, 1969, pp. 51-80), on penetrating the interface
the flow in the plumes becomes forced and behaves like a constant-momentum jet, due to a reduction
in its mean buoyancy relative to the local environment. To observe the behaviour of the plumes we
partition the domain into sub-domains corresponding to each plume. Domains of relatively small
aspect ratio produce a single primary mean-flow circulation between the sub-domains that is maintained
by entrainment into the plumes. At larger aspect ratios the mean flow bifurcates and exhibits secondary
circulations between sub-domains within each layer, associated with entrainment into the jets.
To study the flow's energetics we use a local definition of available potential energy (APE). For
plumes with Gaussian velocity and buoyancy profiles, the theory we develop suggests that the dissipation
of kinetic energy is split equally between the jets and the plumes and, collectively, accounts for
almost half of the input of APE at the boundaries. In contrast, $1/4$ of the dissipation of APE occurs
in the jets, with the remaining $3/4$ occurring in the plumes. These bulk theoretical predictions
agree with the simulation data to within $1\%$ and form the basis of a similarity solution that models
the vertical dependence of APE dissipation. Unlike results concerning the dissipation of buoyancy
variance, the model for the flow's energetics does not depend on an entrainment coefficient.
