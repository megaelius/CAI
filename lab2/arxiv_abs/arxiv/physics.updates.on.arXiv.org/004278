Electron density maps must be accurately estimated to achieve valid dose calculation in MR-only
radiotherapy. The goal of this study is to assess whether two deep learning models, the conditional
generative adversarial network (cGAN) and the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network
(cycleGAN), can generate accurate abdominal synthetic CT (sCT) images from 0.35T MR images for
MR-only liver radiotherapy. A retrospective study was performed using CT images and 0.35T MR images
of 12 patients with liver (n=8) and non-liver abdominal (n=4) cancer. CT images were deformably
registered to the corresponding MR images to generate deformed CT (dCT) images for treatment planning.
Both cGAN and cycleGAN were trained using MR and dCT transverse slices. Four-fold cross-validation
testing was conducted to generate sCT images for all patients. The HU prediction accuracy was evaluated
by voxel-wise similarity metric between each dCT and sCT image for all 12 patients. dCT-based and
sCT-based dose distributions were compared using gamma and dose-volume histogram (DVH) metric
analysis for 8 liver patients. sCTcycleGAN achieved the average mean absolute error (MAE) of 94.1
HU, while sCTcGAN achieved 89.8 HU. In both models, the average gamma passing rates within all volumes
of interest were higher than 95% using a 2%, 2 mm criterion, and 99% using a 3%, 3 mm criterion. The average
differences in the mean dose and DVH metrics were within +/-0.6% for the planning target volume and
within +/-0.15% for evaluated organs in both models. Results demonstrated that abdominal sCT images
generated by both cGAN and cycleGAN achieved accurate dose calculation for 8 liver radiotherapy
plans. sCTcGAN images had smaller average MAE and achieved better dose calculation accuracy than
sCTcyleGAN images. More abdominal patients will be enrolled in the future to further evaluate two
models.
