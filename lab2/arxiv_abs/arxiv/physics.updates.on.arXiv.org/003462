Setbacks are an integral part of a scientific career, yet little is known about whether an early-career
setback may augment or hamper an individual's future career impact. Here we examine junior scientists
applying for U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 grants. By focusing on grant proposals
that fell just below and just above the funding threshold, we compare "near-miss" with "near-win"
individuals to examine longer-term career outcomes. Our analyses reveal that an early-career
near miss has powerful, opposing effects. On one hand, it significantly increases attrition, with
one near miss predicting more than a 10% chance of disappearing permanently from the NIH system.
Yet, despite an early setback, individuals with near misses systematically outperformed those
with near wins in the longer run, as their publications in the next ten years garnered substantially
higher impact. We further find that this performance advantage seems to go beyond a screening mechanism,
whereby a more selected fraction of near-miss applicants remained than the near winners, suggesting
that early-career setback appears to cause a performance improvement among those who persevere.
Overall, the findings are consistent with the concept that "what doesn't kill me makes me stronger."
Whereas science is often viewed as a setting where early success begets future success, our findings
unveil an intimate yet previously unknown relationship where early-career setback can become
a marker for future achievement, which may have broad implications for identifying, training and
nurturing junior scientists whose career will have lasting impact.
