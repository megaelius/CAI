Time-resolved, pulsed excitation methods are widely used to deduce optoelectronic properties
of semiconductors, including now also Halide Perovskites (HaPs), especially transport properties.
Howev-er, as yet no evaluation of their amenability and justification for the use of the results
for the above-noted purposes has been reported. To check if we can learn from pulsed measurement
results about steady-state phototransport properties, we show here that, although pulsed measurements
can be useful to extract information on the recombination kinetics of HaPs, great care should be
taken. One issue is that no changes in the material are induced during or as a result of the excitation,
and another one concerns in how far pulsed excitation-derived data can be used to find relevant steady-state
pa-rameters. To answer the latter question, we revisited pulsed excitation, and propose a novel
way to compare between pulsed and steady state measurements at different excitation intensities.
We per-formed steady-state photoconductivity and ambipolar diffusion length measurements,
as well as pulsed TR-MC and TR-PL measurements as function of excitation intensity on the same samples
of dif-ferent MAPbI3 thin films, and find good quasi-quantitative agreement between the results,
explaining them with a generalized single level recombination model that describes the basic physics
of photo-transport of HaP absorbers. Moreover, we find the first experimental manifestation of
the boundaries between several effective recombination regimes that exist in HaPs, by analyzing
their phototransport behavior as a function of excitation intensity.
