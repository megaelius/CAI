A slender filament moving in a fluid at low Reynolds number experiences a force per unit length due
to the relative motion of the particle and the local fluid velocity that is $O(1/ln(2A))$. Here,
aspect ratio ($A=l/a_0$) is defined as the ratio of the size of the particle ($l$) and the cross-sectional
dimension ($a_0$). Using a regular perturbation of the inner solution for a slightly non-circular
cross-section, we demonstrate that a slender filament can experience a force per unit length of
$O(\alpha/(ln(2A)A))$ driven by the gradient in the imposed fluid velocity. Here, $\alpha$ is
the amplitude of the non-circular perturbation. Our theory also evaluates a contribution to the
additional force per unit length of $O(\alpha/ln^2(2A))$, discovered first by Batchelor (1970),
which arises from the flow field generated by the force per unit length of the unperturbed circular
cross-section and therefore driven by the motion of the particle relative to the local fluid velocity.
We elucidate the features of the cross-sectional shape that affects the force per unit length in
a given imposed field. We propose a two-dimensional Stokes flow calculation to extend the perturbation
analysis for cross-sections that deviate significantly from a circle (i.e. $\alpha \sim O(1)$).
We illustrate the ability of our method to compute the resistance to translation and rotation of
a slender triaxial ellipsoid. We also demonstrate the dynamics of a self-dispersing rod that translates
diffusively and rotates chaotically in a simple shear flow. Finally, we show that the force per unit
length driven by the velocity gradient acting on a ring can lead to migration of the particle orientation
relative to the periodic trajectories of a torus, while the force per unit length driven by the relative
motion of the ring and the local fluid can lead to migration across streamlines.
