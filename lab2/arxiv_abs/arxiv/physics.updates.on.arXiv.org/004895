In the analysis of neutron scattering measurements of condensed matter structure, it normally
suffices to treat the incident and scattered neutron beams as if composed of incoherent distributions
of plane waves with wavevectors of different magnitudes and directions which are taken to define
an instrumental resolution. However, despite the wide-ranging applicability of this conventional
treatment, there are cases in which the wave function of an individual neutron in the beam must be
described more accurately by a spatially localized packet, in particular with respect to its transverse
extent normal to its mean direction of propagation. One such case involves the creation of orbital
angular momentum (OAM) states in a neutron via interaction with a material device of a given size.
It is shown in the work reported here that there exist two distinct measures of coherence of special
significance and utility for describing neutron beams in scattering studies of materials in general.
One measure corresponds to the coherent superposition of basis functions and their wavevectors
which constitute each individual neutron packet state function whereas the other measure can be
associated with an incoherent distribution of mean wavevectors of the individual neutron packets
in a beam. Both the distribution of the mean wavevectors of individual packets in the beam as well
as the wavevector components of the superposition of basis functions within an individual packet
can contribute to the conventional notion of instrumental resolution. However, it is the transverse
spatial extent of packet wavefronts alone that determines the area within which a coherent scattering
process can occur in the first place. This picture is shown to be consistent with standard quantum
theory. It is also demonstrated that these two measures of coherence can be distinguished from one
another experimentally.
