With the advent of modern astronomy, humans might now have acquired the technological and intellectual
requirements to communicate with other intelligent beings beyond the solar system, if they exist.
Radio signals have been identified as a means for interstellar communication about 60 years ago.
And the Square Kilometer Array will be capable of detecting extrasolar radio sources analogous
to terrestrial high-power radars out to several tens of light years. The ultimate question is: will
we be able to understand the message, or, vice versa, if we submit a message to extraterrestrial intelligence
first, how can we make sure that they understand us? Here I report on the largest blind experiment
of a pretend radio message received on Earth from beyond the solar system. I posted a sequence of about
two million binary digits ("0" and "1") to the social media that encoded a configuration frame, two
slides with mathematical content, and four images along with spatial and temporal information
about their contents. Six questions were asked that would need to be answered to document the successful
decryption of the message. Within a month after the posting, over 300 replies were received in total,
including comments and requests for hints, 66 of which contained the correct solutions. About half
of the solutions were derived fully independently, the other half profited from public online discussions
and spoilers. This experiment demonstrates the power of the world wide web to help interpreting
possible future messages from extraterrestrial intelligence and to test decryptability of our
own deliberate interstellar messages.
