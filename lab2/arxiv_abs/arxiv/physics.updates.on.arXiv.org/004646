When analyzing temporal networks, a fundamental task is the identification of dense structures
(i.e., groups of vertices that exhibit a large number of links), together with their temporal span
(i.e., the period of time for which the high density holds). In this paper we tackle this task by introducing
a notion of temporal core decomposition where each core is associated with two quantities, its coreness,
which quantifies how densely it is connected, and its span, which is a temporal interval: we call
such cores span-cores. For a temporal network defined on a discrete temporal domain $T$, the total
number of time intervals included in $T$ is quadratic in $|T|$, so that the total number of span-cores
is potentially quadratic in $|T|$ as well. Our first main contribution is an algorithm that, by exploiting
containment properties among span-cores, computes all the span-cores efficiently. Then, we focus
on the problem of finding only the maximal span-cores, i.e., span-cores that are not dominated by
any other span-core by both their coreness property and their span. We devise a very efficient algorithm
that exploits theoretical findings on the maximality condition to directly extract the maximal
ones without computing all span-cores. Finally, we introduce the problem of temporal community
search, where a set of query vertices is given as input, and the goal is to find a set of densely-connected
subgraphs containing the query vertices and covering the whole underlying temporal domain $T$.
We derive a connection between this problem and the problem of finding (maximal) span-cores. Based
on this connection, we show how temporal community search can be solved in polynomial-time via dynamic
programming, and how the maximal span-cores can be profitably exploited to significantly speed-up
the basic algorithm.
