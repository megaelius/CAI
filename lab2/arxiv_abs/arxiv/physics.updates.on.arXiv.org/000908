The Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC is the central hadronic calorimeter
designed for reconstruction of hadrons, jets, tau-particles and missing transverse energy. TileCal
is a scintillator-steel sampling calorimeter and it covers the region of $|\eta| < 1.7$. The scintillation
light produced in the scintillator tiles is transmitted by wavelength shifting fibers to photomultiplier
tubes (PMTs). The analog signals from the PMTs are amplified, shaped and digitized by sampling the
signal every 25 ns. The TileCal frontend electronics reads out the signals produced by about 10000
channels measuring energies ranging from ~30 MeV to ~2 TeV. Each stage of the signal production from
scintillation light to the signal reconstruction is monitored and calibrated. The performance
of the calorimeter has been studied in-situ employing cosmic ray muons and a large sample of proton-proton
collisions acquired during the operations of the LHC. Prompt isolated muons of high momentum from
electroweak bosons decays are employed to study the energy response of the calorimeter at the electromagnetic
scale. The calorimeter response to hadronic particles is evaluated with a sample of isolated hadrons
and the modelling of the response by the Monte Carlo simulation is discussed. The calorimeter timing
calibration and resolutions are studied with jets. Results on the calorimeter operation and performance
are presented, including the calibration, stability, absolute energy scale, uniformity and time
resolution. These results show that the TileCal performance is within the design requirements
and has given essential contribution to reconstructed objects and physics results.
