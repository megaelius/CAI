A new 1D divertor plasma code, SD1D, has been used to examine the role of recombination, radiation,
and momentum exchange in detachment. Neither momentum or power losses by themselves are found to
be sufficient to produce a reduction in target ion flux in detachment (flux rollover); radiative
power losses are required to a) limit and reduce the ionization source and b) access low-target temperature,
T_target, conditions for volumetric momentum losses. Recombination is found to play little role
at flux rollover, but as T_target drops to temperatures around 1eV, it becomes a strong ion sink.
In the case where radiative losses are dominated by hydrogen, the detachment threshold is identified
as a minimum gradient of the energy cost per ionisation with respect to T_target. This is also linked
to thresholds in T_target and in the ratio of upstream pressure to power flux. A system of determining
the detached condition is developed such that the divertor solution at a given T_target (or lack
of one) is determined by the simultaneous solution of two equations for target ion current - one dependent
on power losses and the other on momentum. Depending on the detailed momentum and power loss dependence
on temperature there are regions of T_target where there is no solution and the plasma 'jumps' from
high to low T_target states. The novel analysis methods developed here provide an intuitive way
to understand complex detachment phenomena, and can potentially be used to predict how changes
in the seeding impurity used or recycling aspects of the divertor can be utilised to modify the development
of detachment.
