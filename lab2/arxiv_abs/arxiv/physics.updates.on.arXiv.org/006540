In the absence of neither an effective treatment or vaccine and with an incomplete understanding
of the epidemiological cycle, Govt. has implemented a nationwide lockdown to reduce COVID-19 transmission
in India. To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model
on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases
from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important
parameters as well as the basic reproduction number ($R_{0}$). Combining the mechanistic mathematical
model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations
for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine
the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also
on $R_{0}$. Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher
percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19
mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high
rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the
trend of the effective reproduction number ($R_{t}$) during the projection period indicates if
the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may
be seen in those locations. Finally, combining our results, we provided an effective lockdown policy
to reduce future COVID-19 transmission in India.
