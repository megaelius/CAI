Wind forcing of the ocean generates a spectrum of inertia-gravity waves that is sharply peaked near
the local inertial (or Coriolis) frequency. The corresponding near-inertial waves (NIWs) are
highly energetic and play a significant role in the slow, large-scale dynamics of the ocean. To analyse
this role, we develop a new model of the nondissipative interactions between NIWs and balanced motion.
The model is derived using the generalised-Lagrangian-mean (GLM) framework (specifically, the
glm variant of Soward & Roberts (2010)), taking advantage of the time-scale separation between
the two types of motion to average over the short NIW period. We combine Salmon's (2013) variational
formulation of GLM with Whitham averaging to obtain a system of equations governing the joint evolution
of NIWs and mean flow. Assuming that the mean flow is geostrophically balanced reduces this system
to a simple model coupling Young & Ben Jelloul's (1997) equation for NIWs with a modified quasi-geostrophic
equation. In this coupled model, the mean flow affects the NIWs through advection and refraction;
conversely, the NIWs affect the mean flow by modifying the potential-vorticity inversion - the
relation between advected potential vorticity and advecting mean velocity - through a quadratic
wave term. Our variational derivation ensures that the coupled model is Hamiltonian. Conservation
laws, for wave action and energy in particular, prove illuminating: on their basis, we identify
a new interaction mechanism whereby NIWs forced at large scales extract energy from the balanced
flow as their horizontal scale is reduced by differential advection and refraction so that their
potential energy increases. A rough estimate suggests that this mechanism could provide a significant
sink of energy for mesoscale motion and play a part in the global energetics of the ocean.
