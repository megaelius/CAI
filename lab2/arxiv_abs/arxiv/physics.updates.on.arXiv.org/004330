Manned Mars missions planned in the near future are of very low solar activity period and hence higher
than acceptable radiation doses mainly due to the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) that would require
special techniques and technological development for maintaining the good health of the astronauts.
The present study is to make an assessment and characterise the coming years in terms of solar activity
and space radiation environment especially due to the abundance of highly energetic heavy-ions
also known as HZE charged particles. These particle fluxes constitute a major hazard to the astronauts
and also to the critical electronic components of the spacecraft. Recent data on the HZE species
(from $B$ to $Ni$) obtained from Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft shows a clear enhancement
of the particle fluxes between the solar cycle 23 and solar cycle 24 (between sunspot number peaks
of 2002 and 2014) due to the persisting low sunspot numbers of the latter cycle. The peak values of
these cosmic ray fluxes occur with a time lag of about a year of the corresponding minimum value of
the sunspots of a particular 11-year cycle which is pseudo-periodic in nature. This is demonstrated
by the Fourier and Wavelet transform analyses of the long duration (1700-2018) yearly mean sunspot
number data. The same time series data is also used to train a Hybrid Regression Neural Network (HRNN)
model to generate the predicted yearly mean sunspot numbers for the solar cycle 25 ($\approx$ 2019-2031).
The wavelet analysis of this new series of annual sunspot numbers including the predictions up to
the end of 2031 shows a continuation of the low solar activity trend and hence continuation of very
high HZE fluxes prevailing in solar cycle 24 into the solar cycle 25 and perhaps beyond.
