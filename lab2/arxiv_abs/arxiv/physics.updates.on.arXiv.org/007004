Simulations of turbulent fluid flow around long cylindrical structures are computationally expensive
because of the vast range of length scales, requiring simplifications such as dimensional reduction.
Current dimensionality reduction techniques such as strip-theory and depth-averaged methods
do not take into account the natural flow dissipation mechanism inherent in the small-scale three-dimensional
(3-D) vortical structures. We propose a novel flow decomposition based on a local spanwise average
of the flow, yielding the spanwise-averaged Navier-Stokes (SANS) equations. The SANS equations
include closure terms accounting for the 3-D effects otherwise not considered in 2-D formulations.
A supervised machine-learning (ML) model based on a deep convolutional neural network provides
closure to the SANS system. A-priori results show up to 92% correlation between target and predicted
closure terms; more than an order of magnitude better than the eddy viscosity model correlation.
The trained ML model is also assessed for different Reynolds regimes and body shapes to the training
case where, despite some discrepancies in the shear-layer region, high correlation values are
still observed. The new SANS equations and ML closure model are also used for a-posteriori prediction.
While we find evidence of known stability issues with long time ML predictions for dynamical systems,
the closed SANS simulations are still capable of predicting wake metrics and induced forces with
errors from 1-10%. This results in approximately an order of magnitude improvement over standard
2-D simulations while reducing the computational cost of 3-D simulations by 99.5%.
