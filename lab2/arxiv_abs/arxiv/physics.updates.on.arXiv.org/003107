Achieving high spatial resolution is the goal of many imaging systems. Designing a high-resolution
lens with diffraction-limited performance over a large field of view remains a difficult task in
imaging system design. On the other hand, creating a complex speckle pattern with wavelength-limited
spatial features is effortless and can be implemented via a simple random diffuser. With this observation
and inspired by the concept of near-field ptychography, we report a new imaging modality, termed
near-field Fourier ptychography, for tackling high-resolution imaging challenges in both microscopic
and macroscopic imaging settings. The meaning of 'near-field' is referred to placing the object
at a short defocus distance. Instead of directly resolving fine spatial features via a high-resolution
lens, we project a speckle pattern with fine spatial features on the object. We then translate the
object (or speckle) to different positions and acquire the corresponding images using a low-resolution
lens. A ptychographic phase retrieval process is used to recover the complex object, the unknown
speckle pattern, and the coherent transfer function at the same time. We achieve a ~7-fold resolution
gain in both a microscopic and a macroscale photographic imaging setting. The final achievable
resolution is not determined by the collection optics. Instead, it is determined by the feature
size of the speckle pattern, similar to our recent demonstration in fluorescence imaging settings
(Guo et al., Biomed. Opt. Express, 9(1), 2018). The reported imaging modality can be employed in
light, coherent X-ray, and transmission electron imaging systems to increase resolution and provide
quantitative absorption and phase contrast of the object.
