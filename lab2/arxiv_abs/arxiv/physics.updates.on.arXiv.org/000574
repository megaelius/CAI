Purpose: Very fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of proton transport have been implemented recently
on GPUs. However, these usually use simplified models for non-elastic (NE) proton-nucleus interactions.
Our primary goal is to build a GPU-based proton transport MC with detailed modeling of elastic and
NE collisions. Methods: Using CUDA, we implemented GPU kernels for these tasks: (1) Simulation
of spots from our scanning nozzle configurations, (2) Proton propagation through CT geometry,
considering nuclear elastic scattering, multiple scattering, and energy loss straggling, (3)
Modeling of the intranuclear cascade stage of NE interactions, (4) Nuclear evaporation simulation,
and (5) Statistical error estimates on the dose. To validate our MC, we performed: (1) Secondary
particle yield calculations in NE collisions, (2) Dose calculations in homogeneous phantoms,
(3) Re-calculations of head and neck plans from a commercial treatment planning system (TPS), and
compared with Geant4.9.6p2/TOPAS. Results: Yields, energy and angular distributions of secondaries
from NE collisions on various nuclei agree well with the Geant4 Bertini and Binary cascade models.
The 3D-gamma pass rate at 2\%-2 mm for treatment plan simulations is typically 98\%. The net calculation
time on a NVIDIA GTX680 card, including all data transfers, is $\sim$20 s for $1\times10^7$ proton
histories. Conclusions: Our GPU-based MC is the first of its kind to include a detailed nuclear model
to handle NE interactions of protons with any nucleus. Dosimetric calculations are in very good
agreement with Geant4/TOPAS. Our MC is being used to perform fast routine clinical QA of pencil-beam
based treatment plans, and has also been adopted as the dose engine in a clinically-applicable MC-based
IMPT TPS. The detailed nuclear modeling will allow us to perform very fast linear energy transfer
and neutron dose estimates on the GPU.
