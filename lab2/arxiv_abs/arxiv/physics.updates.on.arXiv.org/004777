Ion transport in perm-selective media has been extensively investigated in recent years owing
to its applications in advancements of fundamental understanding of nanoscale electrokinetics
as well as innovative engineering applications. A key phenomenon in this context is ion concentration
polarization (ICP) that occurs near perm-selective nanoporous membranes or nanochannels under
dc bias. In classical settings, involving voltage-driven transport of ions through perm-selective
membranes, concentration polarization is well understood as formation of steep concentration
drop to reach near zero concentration (depletion layer) at the anodic side of cation-selective
membranes. In contrast to this classical description, we demonstrate here that when ICP is driven
in a microchannel and coupled with electroosmotic flows a long-tailed fluorescent layer in front
of diffusion layer is formed, which can be characterized as an additional plateau in the concentration
profile. Using a micro/nanofluidic platform, in situ visualizations, and local concentration
measurements by microelectrode arrays we quantify that this plateau layer has a concentration
of 60 % of bulk electrolyte concentration, regardless of the bulk concentration itself. Using a
mathematical analysis of conservation laws for flow, charge, and salt, we demonstrate that this
plateau region is related to the formation of a flow stagnation point due to the competition between
electro-osmotic and induced pressure driven flows. Consistent with the experiments, this analysis
predicts the plateau concentration to be 60% of the bulk electrolyte. Thus, this plateau concentration
region completes the picture of ICP in microchannels which has drawn significant attention from
the fields of electrokinetics and micro/nanofluidics.
