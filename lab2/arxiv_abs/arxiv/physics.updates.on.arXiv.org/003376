The vibrational theory of olfaction was posited to explain subtle effects in the sense of smell inexplicable
by models in which molecular structure alone determines an odorant's smell. Amazingly, behavioral
and neurophysiological evidence suggests that humans and some insects can be trained to distinguish
isotopologue molecules which are related by the substitution of isotopes for certain atoms, such
as a hydrogen-to-deuterium substitution. How is it possible to smell a neutron? The physics of olfaction
may explain this isotopomer effect. Inelastic electron transfer spectroscopy (IETS) has been
proposed as a candidate mechanism for such subtle olfactory effects: the vibrational spectrum
of an appropriately-quantized odorant molecule may enhance a transfer rate in a discriminating
electron transfer (ET) process. In contrast to other semi-classical or quantum-master-equation-based
models of olfactory IETS, the model presented here explicitly treats the dynamics of a dominant
odorant vibrational mode, which provides an indirect dissipative path from the electron to the
thermal environment. A direct dissipative path to the environment also is included. Within this
model, a calculation of ET rate is developed, along with a calculation of power dissipation to the
thermal environment. Under very weak direct dissipative coupling, spectroscopic behaviors of
the indirect path are revealed, and the resulting ET rate exhibits resonant peaks at certain odorant
frequencies. Resonant peaks in ET rate also correlate to peaks in power dissipation. Spectroscopic
behaviors are masked by strong direct dissipative coupling. Results support a rate-based discrimination
between a preferred ligand and an isotopomer if indirect dissipative coupling dominates.
