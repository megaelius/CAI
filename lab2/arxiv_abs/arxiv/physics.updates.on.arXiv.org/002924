The methyl groups in hexamethylbenzene C$_6$(CH$_3$)$_6$ become magnetically ordered at the
molecular level below 118 K. This is also near the temperature at which the system structurally transitions
from triclinic to a unique near-cubic phase. High-precision measurements of the near-static dielectric
constant reveal that the structural phase transition is actually comprised of four successive
transformations upon cooling at T$_1$=110.7 K, T$_2$=109.5 K, T$_3$=109.1 K and T$_4$=107.8 K.
In contrast to warming, only two transitions occur at T'$_4$=119.2 K and T'$_1$=120.9 K. The methyl
groups in the near-cubic phase become slightly distorted according to existing neutron powder
diffraction measurements. Analysis of the 2$^6$=64 possible spin orientation configurations
of the methyl groups reveal a 20-fold ground state degeneracy presiding in each molecule rendering
the system to become highly unstable. From such, it is interpreted that T$_1$ and T$_2$ are temperatures
at which the molecules successively lower their symmetry to remove the energy degeneracy which
involve methyl group elongation and further out-of-plane tilting. This triggers the system to
phase transition into the near-cubic phase which involves a shearing of the molecular planes and
partial rotation of the methyl groups at T$_3$ and T$_4$. We interpret the low temperature near-cubic
phase to be a manifestation of Jahn-Teller distortions based on energy degeneracies of the orbital
motion of protons in each molecule and suggest that the metastable nature of the phase transition
originates from the methyl groups requiring a larger amount of energy to order than to disorder.
Our findings help explain why many unusual structural phase transitions occur at low temperatures
in other molecular crystals possessing periodic motion of protons.
