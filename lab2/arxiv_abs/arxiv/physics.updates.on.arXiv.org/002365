We report the first photoacoustic detection scheme using an optical frequency comb - the optical
frequency comb photoacoustic spectroscopy (OFC-PAS). OFC-PAS combines the broad spectral coverage
and the high resolution of OFCs with the small sample volume of cantilever-enhanced PA detection.
In OFC-PAS, a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) is used to modulate the intensity of the exciting
comb source at a frequency determined by its scanning speed. One of the FTS outputs is directed to
the PA cell and the other is measured simultaneously with a photodiode and used to normalize the PA
signal. The cantilever-enhanced PA detector operates in a non-resonant mode, enabling detection
of broadband frequency response. The broadband and the high-resolution capabilities of OFC-PAS
are demonstrated by measuring the rovibrational spectra of the fundamental C-H stretch band of
CH${_4}$, with no instrumental line shape distortions, at total pressures of 1000 mbar, 650 mbar,
and 400 mbar. In this first demonstration, a spectral resolution two orders of magnitude higher
than previously reported with broadband PAS is obtained, limited by the pressure broadening. A
limit of detection of 0.8 ppm of methane in N${_2}$ is accomplished in a single interferogram measurement
(200 s measurement time, 1000 MHz resolution, 1000 mbar total pressure) for an exciting power spectral
density of 42 {\mu}W/cm${^{-1}}$. A normalized noise equivalent absorption of 8x10${^{-10}}$
W cm${^{-1}}$ Hz${^{-1/2}}$ is obtained, which is only a factor of three higher than the best reported
with PAS based on continuous wave lasers. A wide dynamic range of up to four orders of magnitude and
a very good linearity (limited by the Beer-Lambert law) over two orders of magnitude are realized.
OFC-PAS extends the capability of optical sensors for multispecies trace gas analysis in small
sample volume with high resolution and selectivity.
