In this paper, we have initiated an attempt to develop and understand the driving mechanisms that
underlie fourth-generation warfare. We have undertaken this from a perspective of endeavoring
to understand the drivers of these events from a Complexity perspective by using a threshold-type
percolation model. We propose to integrate this strategic level model with tactical level Big Data,
behavioral, statistical projections via a fractal operational level model and to construct a hierarchical
framework that allows dynamic prediction. Our initial study concentrates on this strategic level,
i.e. a percolation model. Our main conclusion from this initial study is that extremist terrorist
events are not solely driven by the size of a supporting population within a socio-geographical
location but rather a combination of ideological factors that also depends upon the involvement
of the host population. This involvement, through the social, political and psychological fabric
of society, not only contributes to the active participation of terrorists within society but also
directly contributes to and increases the likelihood of the occurrence of terrorist events. Our
calculations demonstrate the links between Islamic extremist terrorist events, the ideologies
within the Muslim and non-Muslim population that facilitates these terrorist events (such as Anti-Zionism)
and anti-Semitic occurrences of violence against the Jewish population. In a future paper, we hope
to extend the work undertaken to construct a predictive model and extend our calculations to other
forms of terrorism such as Right Wing fundamentalist terrorist events within the USA.
