Soil thermal conductivity is an important physical parameter in modeling land surface processes.
Previous studies on evaluations of parameterization schemes of soil thermal conductivity are
mostly based on specific experimental conditions or local soil samples, and their recommendations
may not be the optimal schemes for land surface model (LSMs). In this work, seven highly recommended
soil thermal conductivity schemes are evaluated for their applicability in LSMs. With the consideration
of both scheme estimations and land process simulations by incorporation into the Common Land Model,
the Balland and Arp [2005] scheme is found to consistently perform best among all the schemes, and
thus can be recommended as a superior scheme for land modeling use. Uncertainty analyses by in-situ
simulations demonstrate that, over relatively dry regions, the inter-scheme variations of soil
thermal conductivity can lead to significant differences of simulated soil temperature, especially
at deep layers, due to changes of downward soil heat conduction and the associated freeze-thaw cycles.
However, few effects appear over wet regions, likely due to the high soil heat capacity induced by
high soil moisture levels, which increases the heat inertia in soil thermodynamics. Global comparisons
show the similar relationships that soil thermal conductivity significantly affects the simulated
soil temperature and other related thermal and hydraulic variables over arid and semi-arid regions
in mid- and high-latitudes. These results display the role of soil thermal conductivity in LSM,
and suggest the importance of the evaluation and further development of thermal conductivity schemes
with respect to land modelling applications.
