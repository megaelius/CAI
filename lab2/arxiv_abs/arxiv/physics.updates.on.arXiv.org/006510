The electric field of a uniformly accelerated charge shows a plane of discontinuity, where the field
extending only on one side of the plane, terminates abruptly on the plane with a finite value. This
indicates a non-zero divergence of the electric field in a source-free region, implying a violation
of Gauss law. In order to make the field compliant with Maxwell's equations everywhere, an additional
field component, proportional to a $\delta$-function at the plane of discontinuity, is required.
Such a ``$\delta$-field'' might be the electromagnetic field of the charge, moving with a uniform
velocity approaching $c$, the speed of light, prior to the imposition of acceleration at infinity.
However, some attempts to derive this $\delta$-field for such a case, have not been entirely successful.
Some of the claims of the derivation involve elaborate calculations with some not-so-obvious mathematical
approximations. Since the result to be derived is already known from the constraint of its compliance
with Maxwell's equations, and the derivation involves the familiar text-book expressions for
the field of a uniformly moving charge, one would expect an easy, simple approach, to lead to the correct
result. Here, starting from the electromagnetic field of a uniformly accelerated charge in the
instantaneous rest frame, in terms of the position and motion of the charge at the retarded time,
we derive this $\delta$-field, consistent with Maxwell's equations, in a fairly simple manner.
This is followed by a calculation of the energy in the $\delta$-field, in an analytical manner without
making any approximation, where we show that this energy is exactly the one that would be lost by the
charge because of the radiation reaction on the charge, proportional to its rate of change of acceleration,
that was imposed on it at a distant past.
