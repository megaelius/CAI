To mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, it is key to slow down the spreading of the life-threatening coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-2). This spreading mainly occurs through virus-laden droplets expelled at speaking,
coughing, sneezing, or even breathing. To reduce infections through such respiratory droplets,
authorities all over the world have introduced the so-called "2-meter distance rule" or "6-foot
rule". However, there is increasing empirical evidence, e.g. through the analysis of super-spreading
events, that airborne transmission of the coronavirus over much larger distances plays a major
role with tremendous implications for the risk assessment of coronavirus transmission. Here we
employ direct numerical simulations of a typical respiratory aerosol in a turbulent jet of the respiratory
event within a Lagrangian-Eulerian approach with 5000 droplets, coupled to the ambient velocity,
temperature, and humidity fields to allow for exchange of mass and heat and to realistically account
for the droplet evaporation under different ambient conditions. We found that for an ambient relative
humidity RH of 50% the lifetime of the smallest droplets of our study with initial diameter of 10 um
gets extended by a factor of more than 30 as compared to what is suggested by the classical picture
of Wells, due to collective effects during droplet evaporation and the role of the respiratory humidity,
while the larger droplets basically behave ballistically. With increasing ambient RH the extension
of the lifetimes of the small droplets further increases and goes up to 150 times for 90% RH, implying
more than two meters advection range of the respiratory droplets within one second. Smaller droplets
live even longer and travel further. Our results may explain why COVID-19 superspreading events
can occur for large ambient RH such as in cooled-down meat-processing plants or in pubs with poor
ventilation.
