Objective: This study aims to develop and validate a novel framework, iPhantom, for automated creation
of patient-specific phantoms or digital-twins (DT) using patient medical images. The framework
is applied to assess radiation dose to radiosensitive organs in CT imaging of individual patients.
Method: From patient CT images, iPhantom segments selected anchor organs (e.g. liver, bones, pancreas)
using a learning-based model developed for multi-organ CT segmentation. Organs challenging to
segment (e.g. intestines) are incorporated from a matched phantom template, using a diffeomorphic
registration model developed for multi-organ phantom-voxels. The resulting full-patient phantoms
are used to assess organ doses during routine CT exams. Result: iPhantom was validated on both the
XCAT (n=50) and an independent clinical (n=10) dataset with similar accuracy. iPhantom precisely
predicted all organ locations with good accuracy of Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) >0.6 for
anchor organs and DSC of 0.3-0.9 for all other organs. iPhantom showed less than 10% dose errors for
the majority of organs, which was notably superior to the state-of-the-art baseline method (20-35%
dose errors). Conclusion: iPhantom enables automated and accurate creation of patient-specific
phantoms and, for the first time, provides sufficient and automated patient-specific dose estimates
for CT dosimetry. Significance: The new framework brings the creation and application of CHPs to
the level of individual CHPs through automation, achieving a wider and precise organ localization,
paving the way for clinical monitoring, and personalized optimization, and large-scale research.
