Recent studies have highlighted interesting structural properties of empirical cultural states:
collections of cultural traits sequences of real individuals. Matrices of similarity between
individuals may be constructed from these states, allowing for further structural insights to
be gained using concepts from random matrix theory, approach first exploited in this study. For
generating random matrices that are appropriate as a structureless reference, we propose a null
model that enforces, on average, the empirical occurrence frequency of each possible trait. With
respect to this null model, the empirical matrices show deviating eigenvalues, which may be signatures
of subtle cultural groups. However, they can conceivably also be artifacts of arbitrary redundancies
between cultural variables. We first study this possibility in a highly simplified setting, using
a toy model that enforces a certain level of redundancy in a minimally-biased way, in parallel with
another toy model that enforces group structure. By analyzing and comparing cultural states generated
with these toy models, we show that a deviating eigenvalue can indeed be a redundancy signature,
which can be distinguished from a grouping signature by evaluating the uniformity of the entries
of the respective eigenvector, as well as the uniformity-based compatibility with the null model.
For empirical data, the eigenvector uniformities of all deviating eigenvalues are shown to be compatible
with the null model, apparently suggesting that we are not dealing with genuine group structure.
However, we demonstrate that some deviating eigenvalues might actually be due to authentic groups
that are internally non-uniform. A generic procedure for distinguishing such groups from redundancy
artifacts requires further research.
