Artificial Intelligence (AI) is necessary to address the large and growing deficit in retina and
healthcare access globally. And mobile AI diagnostic platforms running in the Cloud may effectively
and efficiently distribute such AI capability. Here we sought to evaluate the feasibility of Cloud-based
mobile artificial intelligence for detection of retinal disease. And to evaluate the accuracy
of a particular such system for detection of subretinal fluid (SRF) and macula edema (ME) on OCT scans.
A multicenter retrospective image analysis was conducted in which board-certified ophthalmologists
with fellowship training in retina evaluated OCT images of the macula. They noted the presence or
absence of ME or SRF, then compared their assessment to that obtained from Fluid Intelligence, a
mobile AI app that detects SRF and ME on OCT scans. Investigators consecutively selected retinal
OCTs, while making effort to balance the number of scans with retinal fluid and scans without. Exclusion
criteria included poor scan quality, ambiguous features, macula holes, retinoschisis, and dense
epiretinal membranes. Accuracy in the form of sensitivity and specificity of the AI mobile App was
determined by comparing its assessments to those of the retina specialists. At the time of this submission,
five centers have completed their initial studies. This consists of a total of 283 OCT scans of which
155 had either ME or SRF ("wet") and 128 did not ("dry"). The sensitivity ranged from 82.5% to 97% with
a weighted average of 89.3%. The specificity ranged from 52% to 100% with a weighted average of 81.23%.
CONCLUSION: Cloud-based Mobile AI technology is feasible for the detection retinal disease. In
particular, Fluid Intelligence (alpha version), is sufficiently accurate as a screening tool
for SRF and ME, especially in underserved areas. Further studies and technology development is
needed.
