The influence of the ambient pressure on the breakup process is investigated by means of PIV and shadowgraphy
in the configuration of a planar prefilming airblast atomizer. The ambient pressure is varied from
1 to 8 bar. Other investigated parameters are the gas velocity and the film loading. From single-phase
PIV measurements, it is found that the gas velocity in the vicinity of the prefilmer partly matches
the analytical profile from the near-wake theory. The characteristics of the liquid accumulation
are extracted from the shadowgraphy images of the liquid phase directly downstream of the prefilmer.
Two different characteristic lengths, as well as the ligament velocity and a breakup frequency
are determined. In addition, the droplets generated directly downstream of the liquid accumulation
are captured. Hence, the spray Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) and the mean droplet velocity are given
for each operating point. The novelty of this study is that a scaling law of these quantities with
regard to ambient pressure is derived. A correlation is observed between the characteristic length
of the accumulation and the SMD, thus reinforcing the idea that the liquid accumulation determines
the primary spray characteristics. In this paper, a threshold to distinguish the zones between
primary and secondary breakup is proposed based on an objective criterion. It is also shown that
taking non-spherical droplets into account significantly modifies the shape of the dropsize distribution,
thus stressing the need to use shadowgraphy when investigating primary breakup. Additionally,
the ambient pressure and the velocity are varied accordingly to keep the aerodynamic stress $\rho_g
U_g^2$ constant. This leads to almost identical liquid accumulation and spray characteristics.
