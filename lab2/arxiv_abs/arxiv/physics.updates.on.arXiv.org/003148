We are concerned with the Prandtl-Meyer reflection configurations of unsteady global solutions
for supersonic flow impinging onto a solid wedge. Prandtl (1936) first employed the shock polar
analysis to show that there are two steady configurations: the steady weak/strong shock solutions,
when a steady supersonic flow impinges onto the wedge whose angle is less than the detachment angle,
and then conjectured that the steady weak shock solution is physically admissible. The fundamental
issue of whether one or both of the steady weak/strong shocks are physically admissible has been
vigorously debated over the past seven decades. On the other hand, the Prandtl-Meyer reflection
configurations are core configurations in the structure of global entropy solutions of the 2-D
Riemann problem, while the Riemann solutions are local building blocks and determine local structures,
global attractors, and large-time asymptotic states of general entropy solutions. In this sense,
we have to understand the reflection configurations in order to understand fully the global entropy
solutions of 2-D hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, including the admissibility issue for
the entropy solutions. In this paper, we address this longstanding open issue and present our analysis
to establish the stability theorem for the steady weak shock solutions as the long-time asymptotics
of the Prandtl-Meyer reflection configurations for unsteady potential flow for all the physical
parameters up to the detachment angle. To achieve these, we first reformulate the problem as a free
boundary problem involving transonic shocks and then obtain delicate monotonicity properties
and sophisticated uniform {\it a priori} estimates for admissible solutions, which allow us to
employ the Leray-Schauder degree argument to complete the theory for all the physical parameters
up to the detachment angle.
