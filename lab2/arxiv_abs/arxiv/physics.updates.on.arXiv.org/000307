This paper describes the deployment of a large study designed to collect data about human interactions
with unprecedented temporal resolution and depth, both in terms of duration and number of distinct
channels. To collect this data, we use state-of-the-art smartphones as social sensors. We collect
data on face-to-face interactions, telecommunication, social networks, geolocation, and background
information for a densely connected and coherent population of 1,000 individuals. From a basic
science perspective, our motivation is to advance the understanding of highly connected social
systems. Building from our densely sampled system, we are interested understanding what working
on subsamples implies for results on social network analysis; we explore this topic by comparing
single-channel information with our layered picture of interactions. In terms of network science,
we aim to expand our understanding of the dynamics of the social network, how it changes over time,
and the causes and implications of the processes in play. Further, we want to understand how information
- in various forms - spreads in such dynamic networks, to better model contagion, influence, and
cooperation. Underlying the basic science agenda, is the technical component: custom energy-efficient
data collection software running on the phones, database design needed to store the collected data,
research and development focused on analyzing and interpreting the signals emerging from the phones
in terms of human social interactions. The final area of interest addressed is privacy in such massive
sensor-driven data collection from human participants, understood as tools, methods, and philosophy
designed to make the data useful and sharable without compromising the privacy of the study participants.
We go over motivation, results, challenges, and details on the initial deployments this study (SensibleDTU).
