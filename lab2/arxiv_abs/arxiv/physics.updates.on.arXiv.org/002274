Structural balance in social network theory starts from signed networks with active relationships
(friendly or hostile) to establish a hierarchy between four different types of triadic relationships.
The lack of an active link also provides information about the network. To exploit the information
that remains uncovered by structural balance, we introduce the inactive relationship that accounts
for both neutral and nonexistent ties between two agents. This addition results in ten types of triads,
with the advantage that the network analysis can be done with complete networks. To each type of triadic
relationship, we assign an energy that is a measure for its average occupation probability. Finite
temperatures account for a persistent form of disorder in the formation of the triadic relationships.
We propose a Hamiltonian with three interaction terms and a chemical potential (capturing the cost
of edge activation) as an underlying model for the triadic energy levels. Our model is suitable for
empirical analysis of political networks and allows to uncover generative mechanisms. It is tested
on an extended data set for the standings between two classes of alliances in a massively multi-player
on-line game (MMOG) and on real-world data for the relationships between countries during the Cold
War era. We find emergent properties in the triadic relationships between the nodes in a political
network. For example, we observe a persistent hierarchy between the ten triadic energy levels across
time and networks. In addition, the analysis reveals consistency in the extracted model parameters
and a universal data collapse of a derived combination of global properties of the networks. We illustrate
that the model has predictive power for the transition probabilities between the different triadic
states.
