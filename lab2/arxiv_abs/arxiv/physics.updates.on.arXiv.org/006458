In this work, we propose a free-breathing magnetic resonance fingerprinting method that can be
used to obtain $B_1^+$-robust quantitative maps of the abdomen in a clinically acceptable time.
A three-dimensional MR fingerprinting sequence with a radial stack-of-stars trajectory was implemented
for quantitative abdominal imaging. The k-space acquisition ordering was adjusted to improve
motion-robustness. The flip angle pattern was optimized using the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound, and
the encoding efficiency of sequences with 300, 600, 900, and 1800 flip angles was evaluated. To validate
the sequence, a movable multicompartment phantom was developed. Reference multiparametric maps
were acquired under stationary conditions using a previously validated MRF method. Periodic motion
of the phantom was used to investigate the motion-robustness of the proposed sequence. The best
performing sequence length (600 flip angles) was used to image the abdomen during a free-breathing
volunteer scan. When using a series of 600 or more flip angles, the estimated $T_1$ values in the stationary
phantom showed good agreement with the reference scan. Phantom experiments revealed that motion-related
artefacts can appear in the quantitative maps, and confirmed that a motion-robust k-space ordering
is essential in preventing these artefacts. The in vivo scan demonstrated that the proposed sequence
can produce clean parameter maps while the subject breathes freely. Using this sequence, it is possible
to generate $B_1^+$-robust quantitative maps of proton density, $T_1$, and $B_1^+$ under free-breathing
conditions at a clinically usable resolution within 5 minutes.
