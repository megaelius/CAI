Processes based on electrostatic projection are used extensively in industry, e.g. for mineral
separations, electrophotography or manufacturing of coated abrasives, such as sandpaper. Despite
decades of engineering practice, there are still unanswered questions. In this paper, we present
a comprehensive experimental study of projection process of more than 1500 individual spherical
alumina particles with a nominal size of 500 $\mu$m, captured by high-speed video imaging and digital
image analysis. Based on flight trajectories of approximately 1100 projected particles, we determined
the acquired charge and dynamics as a function of relative humidity (RH) and electric field intensity
and compared the results with classical theories. For RH levels of 50\% and above, more than 85\%
of disposed particles were projected, even when the electric field intensity was at its minimum
level. This suggests that, beyond a critical value of electric field intensity, relative humidity
plays a more critical role in the projection process. We also observed that the charging time is reduced
dramatically for RH levels of 50\% and above, possibly due to the build-up of thin water films around
the particles which can facilitate charge transfer. In contrast, projected particles at 30\% RH
level exhibited an excessive amount of electric charge, between two to four times than that of saturation
value, which might be attributed to triboelectric charging effects. Finally, the physics of electrostatic
projection is compared and contrasted with those of induced-charge electrokinetic phenomena,
which share similar field-square scaling, as the applied field acts on its own induced charge to
cause particle motion.
