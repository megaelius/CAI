Einstein said that gravity is an acceleration like any other acceleration. But gravity causes relativistic
effects at non-relativistic speeds; so gravity could have relativistic origins. And since the
strong force is thought to cause most of mass, and mass is proportional to gravity; the strong force
is therefore also proportional to gravity. The strong force could thus cause relativistic increases
of mass through the creation of virtual gluons; along with a comparable contraction of space around
nucleons; and then be diluted by the relatively large volume of atoms. The strong force would thus
indirectly cause the spatial contraction known as gravity. And since gravity would thus not be a
true force, and there would then be no gravitons. And the electro- weak and strong forces would therefore
be the only two forces of nature. A unifying equation was developed: E=(Ml+Mh/D)C^2; where E = the
electroweak and strong forces; Ml = lepton masses; Mh = hadron masses; and D = (1-V^2/C^2), as a spatial
contraction equaling 75.3982 fold. Einstein's formulas for excess radius Re = GM/3C^2, and for
gravity Gab = 8 G/C^2 Tab; both relate mass to space curvature, and differ by 3x8 = 75.3982. And the
same difference is found between the observed proton mass, and the experimentally determined mass
of a proton's quark masses, at 12.5 MeV. So a revision of Einstein's equation for gravity is Gab = GD/3C^2
Tab, where 8 = D/3 reveals the relativistic origins of both 8 and of gravity. The early universe containing
only energy, would therefore have contained no matter; and so, would have contained little gravity.
And the inflationary period in the early universe would thus have been due the lack of gravity before
matter had formed.
