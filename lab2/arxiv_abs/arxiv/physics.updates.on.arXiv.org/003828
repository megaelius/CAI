Observations of the time lag between the last deglaciation and a surge in volcanic activity in Iceland
constrain the average melt ascent velocity to be $\geq50$ $\mathrm{m/yr}$. Although existing
theoretical work has explained why the surge in eruption rates increased $5$-$30$ fold from the
steady-state rates during the last deglaciation, they cannot account for large variations of Rare
Earth Element (REE) concentrations in the Icelandic lavas. Lavas erupted during the last deglaciation
are depleted in REEs by up to $70\%$; whereas, existing models, which assume instantaneous melt
transport, can only produce at most $20\%$ depletion. Here, we develop a numerical model with finite
melt ascent velocity and show that the variations of REEs are strongly dependent on the melt ascent
velocity. When the average melt ascent velocity is $100$ $\mathrm{m/yr}$, the variation of $\mathrm{La}$
calculated by our model is comparable to that of the observations. In contrast, when the melt ascent
velocity is $1,000$ $\mathrm{m/yr}$ or above, the model variation of $\mathrm{La}$ becomes significantly
lower than observed, which explains why previous models with instantaneous melt transport did
not reproduce the large variations. We provide the first model that takes account of the diachronous
response of volcanism to deglaciation. We show by comparing our model calculations of the relative
volumes of different eruption types (subglacial, finiglacial and postglacial) and the timing
of the bursts in volcanic eruptions with the observations across different volcanic zones that
the Icelandic average melt ascent velocity during the last deglaciation is likely to be $\sim100$
$\mathrm{m/yr}$.
