Bursts of tremor accompany a moving slip pulse in Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) events. The sources
of this non-volcanic tremor (NVT) are largely unknown. We have developed a model describing the
mechanism of NTV generation. According to this model, NTV is a reflection of resonant-type oscillations
excited in a fault at certain depth ranges. From a mathematical viewpoint, tremor (phonons) and
slip pulses (solitons) are two different solutions of the sine-Gordon equation describing frictional
processes inside a fault. In an ETS event, a moving slip pulse generates tremor due to interaction
with structural heterogeneities in a fault and to failures of small asperities. Observed tremor
parameters, such as central frequency and frequency attenuation curve, are associated with fault
parameters and conditions, such as elastic modulus, effective normal stress, penetration hardness
and friction. Model prediction of NTV frequency content is consistent with observations. In the
framework of this model it is possible to explain the complicated pattern of tremor migration, including
rapid tremor propagation and reverse tremor migration. Migration along the strike direction is
associated with movement of the slip pulse. Rapid tremor propagation in the slip-parallel direction
is associated with movement of kinks along a 2D slip pulse. A slip pulse, pinned in some places, can
fragment into several pulses, causing tremor associated with some of these pulse fragments to move
opposite to the main propagation direction. The model predicts that the frequency content of tremor
during an ETS event is slightly different from the frequency content of ambient tremor and tremor
triggered by earthquakes.
