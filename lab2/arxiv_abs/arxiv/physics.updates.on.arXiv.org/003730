We present a framework for simulating the relaxation dynamics through a conical intersection of
an open quantum system that combines a set of methods to approximate the motion of degrees of freedom
with disparate time and energy scales. In the vicinity of a conical intersection, a few degrees of
freedom render the nuclear dynamics nonadiabatic with respect to the electronic degrees of freedom.
We treat these strongly coupled modes by evolving their wavepacket dynamics in the absence of additional
coupling exactly. The remaining weakly coupled nuclear degrees of freedom are partitioned into
modes that are fast relative to the nonadiabatic coupling and those that are slow. The fast degrees
of freedom can be traced out and treated with second order perturbation theory in the form of the time-convolutionless
master equation. The slow degrees of freedom are assumed to be frozen over the ultrafast relaxation,
and treated as sources of static disorder. In this way, we adopt the recently developed frozen-mode
extension to second order quantum master equations. We benchmark this approach in a model of pyrazine
internal conversion and rhodopsin photoisomerization by comparing to numerically exact results.
We use this framework to study the dependence of the quantum yield on the system bath coupling strength
and the charactoristic timescale of the bath, in a two-mode model of photoisomerization. We find
that the yield is monotonically increasing for a Markovian bath, but monotonically decreasing
for a non-Markovian bath. This reflects the subtle interplay between dissipation and decoherence
in conical intersection dynamics in the condensed phase.
