Modelling flow and acoustics in a constricted duct at low Mach numbers is important for investigating
many physiological phenomena such as phonation, generation of arterial murmurs, and pulmonary
conditions involving airway obstruction. The objective of this study is to validate computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational aero-acoustics (CAA) simulations in a constricted tube
at low Mach numbers. Different turbulence models were employed to simulate the flow field. Models
included Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS), Detached eddy simulation (DES) and Large eddy
simulation (LES). The models were validated by comparing study results with laser doppler anemometry
(LDA) velocity measurements. The comparison showed that experimental data agreed best with the
LES model results. Although RANS Reynolds stress transport (RST) model showed good agreement with
mean velocity measurements, it was unable to capture velocity fluctuations. RANS shear stress
transport (SST) k-{\omega} model and DES models were unable to predict the location of high fluctuating
flow region accurately. CAA simulation was performed in parallel with LES using Acoustic Perturbation
Equation (APE) based hybrid CAA method. CAA simulation results agreed well with measured wall sound
pressure spectra. The APE acoustic sources were found in jet core breakdown region downstream of
the constriction, which was also characterized by high flow fluctuations. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
(POD) is used to study the coherent flow structures at the different frequencies corresponding
to the peaks of the measured sound pressure spectra. The study results will help enhance our understanding
of sound generation mechanisms in constricted tubes including biomedical applications.
