Starch based scaffolds are considered as promising biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.
In this study, a highly porous starch/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based nanocomposite scaffold with
a gradient pore structure was made by incorporating different bio-additives, including citric
acid, cellulose nanofibers, and hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles. The scaffold was prepared
by employing unidirectional and cryogenic freeze-casting and subsequently freeze-drying methods.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the cross-linking of starch and PVA
molecules through multiple esterification phenomenon in presence of citric acid as a cross-linking
agent. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) observations showed formation of
aligned lamellar pores with a gradient pore width in the range of 80 to 292 um, which well meets the
pore size requirement for bone regeneration, and also well dispersion of cellulose and HA nanofillers
within the scaffold matrix. Based on the mechanical testing results, the cellulose-HA reinforced
scaffold possesses sufficient compressive modulus and yield strength for non-load bearing applications
in the dry state; and also it presents fast responsive shape recovery in the wet state. According
to in-vitro assessments, apatite phase mineralization was extensively induced in the presence
of HA nanoparticles as heterogeneous nucleating sites. Also, it was revealed that cellulose and
HA nanofillers decelerate and accelerate the scaffold biodegradation rate, respectively. MTT
assay proved good cytocompatibility of the nanocomposite scaffold with osteoblast cells. Finally,
it was shown that the introduced scaffold provides a suitable platform for the cells adhesion.
