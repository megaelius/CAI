The need for real-time processing fast moving objects in machine vision requires the cooperation
of high frame rate camera and a large amount of computing resources. The cost, high detection bandwidth
requirements, data and computation burden limit the wide applications of high frame rate machine
vision. Compressive Video Sensing (CVS) allows capturing events at much higher frame rate with
the slow camera, by reconstructing a frame sequence from a coded single image. At the same time, complex
frame sequence reconstruction algorithms in CVS pose challenges for computing resources. Even
though the reconstruction process is low computational complexity, image-dependent machine
vision algorithms also suffers from a large amount of computing energy consumption. Here we present
a novel CVS camera termed Temporal Ghost Fourier Compressive Inference Camera (TGIC), which provides
a framework to minimize the data and computational burden simultaneously. The core of TGIC is co-design
CVS encoding and machine vision algorithms both in optical domain. TGIC acquires pixel-wise temporal
Fourier spectrum in one frame, and applies simple inverse fast Fourier transform algorithm to get
the desired video. By implementing pre-designed optical Fourier sampling schemes, specific machine
vision tasks can be accomplished in optical domain. In fact, the data captured by TGIC is the results
of traditional machine vision algorithms derived from the video, therefore the computation resources
will be greatly saved. In the experiments, we can recover 160 frames in 0.1s single exposure with
16x frame rate gain (periodic motion up to 2002 frames, 1000x frame rate gain), and typical machine
vision applications such as moving object detection, tracking and extraction are also demonstrated.
