The generation of electrical power from Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) of a cylinder is investigated
numerically. The cylinder is free to oscillate in the direction transverse to the incoming flow.
The cylinder is attached to a magnet that can move along the axis of a coil made from conducting wire.
The magnet and the coil together constitute a basic electrical generator. When the cylinder undergoes
VIV, the motion of the magnet creates a voltage across the coil, which is connected to a resistive
load. By Lenz's law, induced current in the coil applies a retarding force to the magnet. Effectively,
the electrical generator applies a damping force on the cylinder with a spatially varying damping
coefficient. For the initial investigation reported here, the Reynolds number is restricted to
Re < 200, so that the flow is laminar and two-dimensional (2D). The incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes
equations are solved using an extensively validated spectral-element based solver. The effects
of the electromagnetic (EM) damping constant xi_m, coil dimensions (radius a, length L), and mass
ratio on the electrical power extracted are quantified. It is found that there is an optimal value
of xi_m (xi_opt) at which maximum electrical power is generated. As the radius or length of the coil
is increased, the value of xi_opt is observed to increase. Although the maximum average power remains
the same, a larger coil radius or length results in a more robust system in the sense that a relatively
large amount of power can be extracted when xi_m is far from xi_opt, unlike the constant damping ratio
case. The average power output is also a function of Reynolds number, primarily through the increased
maximum oscillation amplitude that occurs with increased Reynolds number at least within the laminar
range, although the general qualitative findings seem likely to carry across to high Reynolds number
VIV.
