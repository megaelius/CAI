The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the visibility and artifacts of commercially
available fiducial markers in order to optimize their selection for image-guided stereotactic
body radiation therapy (SBRT). From six different vendors, we selected 11 fiducials commonly used
in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT); the fiducials varied in material composition (gold,
platinum, carbon), shape (cylindrical, notched/linear, coiled, ball-like, step), and size measured
in terms of diameter (0.28-1.0 mm) and length (3.0-20.0 mm). Each fiducial was centered in 4-mm bolus
within a 13-cm-thick water-equivalent phantom. Fiducials were imaged with use of a simulation
computed tomography (CT) scanner, a CT-on-rails system, and an onboard cone-beam CT system. Acquisition
parameters were set according to clinical protocols. Visibility was assessed in terms of contrast
and the Michelson visibility metric. Artifacts were quantified in terms of relative standard deviation
and relative streak artifacts level (rSAL). Twelve radiation oncologists ranked each fiducial
in terms of clinical usefulness. Contrast and artifacts increased with fiducial size. For CT imaging,
maximum contrast (2722 HU) and artifacts (rSAL=2.69) occurred for the largest-diameter (0.75
mm) platinum fiducial. Minimum contrast (551 HU) and reduced artifacts (rSAL=0.65) were observed
for the smallest-diameter (0.28 mm) gold fiducial. Carbon produced the least severe artifacts
(rSAL = 0.29). The survey indicated that physicians preferred gold fiducials with a 0.35- to 0.43-mm
diameter, 5- to 10-mm length, and a coiled or cylindrical shape that balanced contrast and artifacts.
We evaluated 11 different fiducials in terms of visibility and artifacts. The results of this study
may assist radiation oncologists who seek to maximize contrast, minimize artifacts, and/or balance
contrast versus artifacts by fiducial selection.
