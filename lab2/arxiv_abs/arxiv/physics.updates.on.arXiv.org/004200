Since time immemorial, life has been viewed as being fragile, yet over the past few decades it has
been found that many extreme environments are inhabited by organisms known as extremophiles.Knowledge
of their emergence, adaptability, and limitations seems to provide a guideline for the search of
extra-terrestrial life, since some extremophiles presumably can survive in extreme environments
such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus. Due to physicochemical constraints, the first life necessarily
came into existence at the lower limit of lifes conceivable complexity.Thus, the first life could
not have been an extremophile, furthermore, since biological evolution occurs over time, then
the dual knowledge regarding what specific extremophiles are capable of, and to the analogue environment
on extreme worlds, will not be sufficient as a search criterion.This is because, even though an extremophile
can live in an extreme environment here-and-now, its ancestor however could not live in that very
same environment in the past, which means that no contemporary extremophiles exist in that environment.Furthermore,
extremophiles are in many ways still special life in comparison to general life. A theoretical framework
should be able to predict whether extremophiles can be considered a special or general case in the
galaxy.Thus, a question is raised: does Earths continuous inhabitability represent an extreme
or average value for planets? Thus, dependent on whether it is difficult or easy for worlds to maintain
this inhabitability, the search for extra-terrestrial life with a focus on extremophiles will
either represent a search after dying worlds, or a search after special life on living worlds, where
one focus too narrowly on extreme values.
