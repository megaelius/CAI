This study is concerned with modeling detrimental deformations of the binder phase within lithium-ion
batteries that occur during cell assembly and usage. A two-dimensional poroviscoelastic model
for the mechanical behavior of porous electrodes is formulated and posed on a geometry corresponding
to a thin rectangular electrode, with a regular square array of microscopic circular electrode
particles, stuck to a rigid base formed by the current collector. Deformation is forced both by (i)
electrolyte absorption driven binder swelling, and; (ii) cyclic growth and shrinkage of electrode
particles as the battery is charged and discharged. The governing equations are upscaled in order
to obtain macroscopic effective-medium equations. A solution to these equations is obtained,
in the asymptotic limit that the height of the rectangular electrode is much smaller than its width,
that shows the macroscopic deformation is one-dimensional. The confinement of macroscopic deformations
to one dimension is used to obtain boundary conditions on the microscopic problem for the deformations
in a 'unit cell' centered on a single electrode particle. The resulting microscale problem is solved
using numerical (finite element) techniques. The two different forcing mechanisms are found to
cause distinctly different patterns of deformation within the microstructure. Swelling of the
binder induces stresses that tend to lead to binder delamination from the electrode particle surfaces
in a direction parallel to the current collector, whilst cycling causes stresses that tend to lead
to delamination orthogonal to that caused by swelling. The differences between the cycling-induced
damage in both: (i) anodes and cathodes, and; (ii) fast and slow cycling are discussed. Finally,
the model predictions are compared to microscopy images of nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathodes
and a qualitative agreement is found.
