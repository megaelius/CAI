The relativistic particle Lagrangian justifies the importance of Reparametrization-Invariant
Systems - in particular, the first-order homogeneous Lagrangians in the velocities. Such systems
are studied from the point of view of the Lagrangian and extended Hamiltonian formalism. The extended
Hamiltonian formulation is using an extended Poisson bracket that is generally co-variant and
applicable to reparametrization-invariant systems. The extended Poisson bracket is defined
over the phase-space-time and includes the coordinate time and the energy in a way consistent with
the Canonical Quantization formalism. The corresponding extended Hamiltonian $\boldsymbol{H}$
defines the classical phase space-time of the system via the Hamiltonian constraint $\boldsymbol{H}=
0$ and guarantees that the Classical Hamiltonian $H$ corresponds to $p_0$ - the energy of the particle
when the parametrization $\lambda = t$ is chosen. When the extended Hamiltonian for a classical
system is quantized ($\boldsymbol{H}\rightarrow\boldsymbol{\hat{H}}$) by following the Canonical
Quantization formalism and the corresponding Hilbert space is defined by the extended quantum
Hamiltonian so that $\boldsymbol{\hat{H}}{\Psi} = 0$ then the Schrdinger's equation emerges
naturally. The usual gravitational term and the principle of finite speed justify the Minkowski
space-time physical reality with only one time-like coordinate. The causal structure and the freedom
of time-like parametrization for a process justify the observed common Arrow of Time and the non-negative
masses of particles. A connection has been demonstrated between the positivity of the energy and
the normalizability of the wave function by using the extended Hamiltonian that is relevant for
the proper-time parametrization. The choice of the extended Hamiltonian $\boldsymbol{H}$ is
closely related to the meaning of the process time parameter $\lambda$.
