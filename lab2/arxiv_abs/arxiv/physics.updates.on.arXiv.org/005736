Proteins are key building blocks of virtually all life, providing the material foundation of spider
silk, cells, and hair, but also offering other functions from enzymes to drugs, and pathogens like
viruses. Based on a nanomechanical analysis of the structure and motions of atoms and molecules
at multiple scales, we report sonified versions of the coronavirus spike protein of the pathogen
of COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. The audio signal, created using a novel nanomechanical sonification method,
features an overlay of the vibrational signatures of the protein's primary, secondary and higher-order
structures. Presenting musical encoding in two versions - one in the amino-acid scale and one based
on equal temperament tuning - the method allows for expressing protein structures in audible space,
offering novel avenues to represent, analyze and design architectural features across length-
and time-scales. We further report a hierarchical frequency spectrum analysis of five distinct
protein structures, which offer insights into how genetic mutations, and the binding of the virus
spike protein to the human ACE2 cell receptor directly influence the audio. Applications of the
approach may include the development of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that
match, through melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein. Other applications
of audible coding of matter include material design by manipulating sound, detecting mutations,
and offering a way to reach out to broader communities to explain the physics of proteins. It also
forms a physics-based compositional technique to create new art, referred to as materiomusic,
which is akin to finding a new palette of colors for a painter. Here, the nanomechanical structure
of matter, reflected in an oscillatory framework, presents a new palette for sound generation,
and can complement or support human creativity.
