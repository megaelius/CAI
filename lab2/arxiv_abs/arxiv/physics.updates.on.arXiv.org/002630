The first definitely interstellar object 1I/'Oumuamua (previously A/2017 U1) observed in our
solar system provides the opportunity to directly study material from other star systems. Can such
objects be intercepted? The challenge of reaching the object within a reasonable timeframe is formidable
due to its high heliocentric hyperbolic excess velocity of about 26 km/s; much faster than any vehicle
yet launched. This paper presents a high-level analysis of potential near-term options for a mission
to 1I/'Oumuamua and potential similar objects. Launching a spacecraft to 1I/'Oumuamua in a reasonable
timeframe of 5-10 years requires a hyperbolic solar system excess velocity between 33 to 76 km/s
for mission durations between 30 to 5 years. Different mission durations and their velocity requirements
are explored with respect to the launch date, assuming direct impulsive transfer to the intercept
trajectory. For missions using a powered Jupiter flyby and solar Oberth maneuver and using existing
technologies, launchers such as the Falcon Heavy and Space Launch System would be able to launch
spacecraft of dozens to hundreds of kilogram towards 1I/'Oumuamua, for a launch in 2021 and spacecraft
with an order of magnitude higher masses via an additional Saturn flyby. Further technology options
are outlined, ranging from electric propulsion, and more advanced options such as laser electric
propulsion, and solar and laser sails. To maximize science return decelerating the spacecraft
at 'Oumuamua is highly desirable, due to the minimal science return from a hyper-velocity encounter.
Electric and magnetic sails could be used for this purpose. It is concluded that although reaching
the object is challenging, there seem to be viable options based on current and near-term technology.
