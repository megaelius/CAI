Stock market comovements are examined using cointegration, Granger causality tests and nonlinear
approaches in context of mutual information and correlations. Underlying data sets are affected
by non-stationarities and trends, we also apply AMF-DFA and AMF-DXA. We find only 170 pair of Stock
markets cointegrated, and according to the Granger causality and mutual information, we realize
that the strongest relations lies between emerging markets, and between emerging and frontier
markets. According to scaling exponent given by AMF-DFA, $h(q=2)>1$, we find that all underlying
data sets belong to non-stationary process. According to EMH, only 8 markets are classified in uncorrelated
processes at $2\sigma$ confidence interval. 6 Stock markets belong to anti-correlated class and
dominant part of markets has memory in corresponding daily index prices during January 1995 to February
2014. New-Zealand with $H=0.457\pm0.004$ and Jordan with $H=0.602\pm 0.006$ are far from EMH.
The nature of cross-correlation exponents based on AMF-DXA is almost multifractal for all pair
of Stock markets. The empirical relation, $H_{xy}\le [H_{xx}+H_{yy}]/2$, is confirmed. Mentioned
relation for $q>0$ is also satisfied while for $q<0$ there is a deviation from this relation confirming
behavior of markets for small fluctuations is affected by contribution of major pair. For larger
fluctuations, the cross-correlation contains information from both local and global conditions.
Width of singularity spectrum for auto-correlation and cross-correlation are $\Delta \alpha_{xx}\in
[0.304,0.905]$ and $\Delta \alpha_{xy}\in [0.246,1.178]$, respectively. The wide range of singularity
spectrum for cross-correlation confirms that the bilateral relation between Stock markets is
more complex. The value of $\sigma_{DCCA}$ indicates that all pairs of stock market studied in this
time interval belong to cross-correlated processes.
