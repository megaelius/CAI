The various mathematical models developed in the past to interpret the behavior of natural and manmade
materials were based on observations and experiments made at that time. Classical laws (such as
Newton's for gravity, Hooke's for elasticity, Navier-Stokes for fluidity, Fick's/Fourier's
for diffusion/heat transfer, Coulomb's for electricity, as well as Maxwell's for electromagnetism
and Einstein's for relativity) formed the basis of current technology and shaping of our civilization.
The discovery of new phenomena with the aid of recently developed experimental probes have led to
various modifications of these laws across disciplines and the scale spectrum: from subatomic
and elementary particle physics to cosmology and from atomistic and nano/micro to macro/giga scales.
The emergence of nanotechnology and the further advancement of space technology are ultimately
connected with the design of novel tools for observation and measurements, as well as the development
of new methods and approaches for quantification and understanding. The paper first reviews the
author's previously developed weakly nonlocal or gradient models for elasticity, diffusion and
plasticity within a unifying internal length gradient (ILG) framework. It then proposes a similar
extension for fluids and Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. Finally, it ventures a gradient
modification of Newton's law of gravity and examines its implications to some problems of elementary
particle physics, also relevant to cosmology. Along similar lines, it suggests an analogous extension
of London's quantum mechanical potential to include both an "attractive" and a "repulsive" branch.
It concludes with some comments on a fractional generalization of the ILG framework.
