Electron-acoustic waves occur in space and laboratory plasmas where two distinct electron populations
exist, namely cool and hot electrons. The observations revealed that the hot electron distribution
often has a long-tailed suprathermal (non-Maxwellian) form. The aim of the present study is to investigate
how various plasma parameters modify the electron-acoustic structures. We have studied the electron-acoustic
waves in a collisionless and unmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial electrons, hot suprathermal
electrons, and mobile ions. First, we started with a cold one-fluid model, and we extended it to a
warm model, including the electron thermal pressure. Finally, the ion inertia was included in a
two-fluid model. The linear dispersion relations for electron-acoustic waves depicted a strong
dependence of the charge screening mechanism on excess suprathermality. A nonlinear (Sagdeev)
pseudopotential technique was employed to investigate the existence of electron-acoustic solitary
waves, and to determine how their characteristics depend on various plasma parameters. The results
indicate that the thermal pressure deeply affects the electron-acoustic solitary waves. Only
negative polarity waves were found to exist in the one-fluid model, which become narrower as deviation
from the Maxwellian increases, while the wave amplitude at fixed soliton speed increases. However,
for a constant value of the true Mach number, the amplitude decreases for increasing suprathermality.
It is also found that the ion inertia has a trivial role in the supersonic domain, but it is important
to support positive polarity waves in the subsonic domain.
