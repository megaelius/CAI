In present article the original proposition is a generalization of the Einstein's world tensor
$g_{ij}$ by the introduction of pure inertial field tensor $g^{ac}_{ij}$ such that $R_{{\mu}{\nu}{\lambda}}^{{\alpha}}(g^{ac}_{ij})\neq0$.Bimetric
theory of gravitational-inertial field is considered for the case when the gravitational-Inertial
field is governed by either a perfect magnetic fluid.In a series of papers published during the past
decade with respect to M\"ossbauer experiments in a rotating system [71]-[75],it has been experimentally
shown that the relative energy shift {\Delta}E/E between the source of resonant radiation (situated
at the center of the rotating system) and the resonant absorber (located on the rotor rim) is described
by the relationship ${\Delta}E/E=-ku^2/c^2$, where u is the tangential velocity of the absorber,
c the velocity of light in vacuum, and k some coefficient, which -- contrary to what had been classically
predicted equal 1/2 (see for example [35]) -- turns out to be substantially larger than 1/2. It cannot
be stressed enough that the equality $k=1/2$ had been predicted by general theory of relativity
(GTR) on account of the special relativistic time dilation effect delineated by the tangential
displacement of the rotating absorber, where the "clock hypothesis" by Einstein (i.e., the non-reliance
of the time rate of any clock on its acceleration [35]) was straightly adopted. Hence, the revealed
inequality $k>1/2$ indicates the presence of some additional energy shift (next to the usual time
dilation effect arising from tangential displacement alone) between the emitted and absorbed
resonant radiation. By using Bimetric Theory of Gravitational-Inertial Field [76] we obtain $k=0.75$
in a good agreement with experimental result $k=0.69+(-)0.03$ [75].
