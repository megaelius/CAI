Power laws, characterized by quantities following 1/x^\alpha{} distributions, are commonly
reported when observing nature or society, and the question of their origin has for a long time intrigued
physicists. Power laws have also been observed in neural recordings, both at the macroscopic and
microscopic levels: at the macroscopic level, the power spectral density (PSD) of the electroencephalogram
(EEG) has been seen to follow 1/f^\alpha{} distributions; at the microscopic level similar power
laws have been observed in single-neuron recordings of the neuronal soma potential and soma current,
yet with different values of the power-law exponent \alpha. In this theoretical study we find that
these observed macroscopic and microscopic power laws may, despite the widely different spatial
scales and different exponents, have the same source. By a combination of simulation on a biophysical
detailed, pyramidal neuron model and analytical investigations of a simplified ball and stick
neuron, we find that the transfer functions from current input to the single-neuron contribution
to the EEG (transmembrane current dipole moment), the soma potential and soma current all express
high-frequency power laws if input currents are homogeneously distributed throughout the neural
membrane. This general result pertains regardless of whether the current sources stems from synaptic
noise or intrinsic channel noise. Our work is of relevance for 1/f-theory in general: the results
for the transfer functions from spatially distributed input currents to the various measurement
modalities are general with respect to the frequency spectrum of the input, and we show that the cable
equation transfers white noise input into colored 1/f^\alpha-noise where \alpha{} may have any
half-numbered value within the interval from 1/2 to 3 for the different measurement modalities.
