The delta function potential is a simple model of zero-range contact interaction in one dimension.
The Kronig-Penney model is a one-dimensional periodic array of delta functions that models the
energy bands in a crystal. Here we investigate contact interactions that generalize the delta function
potential and corresponding generalizations of the Kronig-Penney model within conventional
and parity-time symmetric quantum mechanics (PTQM). In conventional quantum mechanics we determine
the most general contact interaction compatible with self-adjointness; in PTQM we consider interactions
that are symmetric under the combined transformation PT. In both cases we find that the most general
interaction has four independent real parameters; depending on the parameter values the interaction
can support more bound states than the conventional delta function. In the PT case the two bound state
energies can be both real or a complex conjugate pair, with the transition corresponding to the breaking
of PT-symmetry. The scattering states for the PT case are also found to exhibit spontaneous breaking
of PT-symmetry. We investigate the energy bands when the generalized contact interactions are
repeated periodically in space in one dimension. In the Hermitian case we find that the two bound
states result in two narrow bands generically separated by a gap. These bands intersect at a single
point in the Brillouin zone as the interaction parameters are varied. Near the intersection the
bands form a massless Dirac cone. In the PT-symmetric case, as the parameters of the contact interaction
are varied the two bound state bands undergo a PT-symmetry breaking transition wherein the two band
energies go from being real to being a complex conjugate pair. The PT-symmetric Kronig-Penney model
provides a simple soluble example of the transition which has the same form as in other models of PT-symmetric
crystals.
