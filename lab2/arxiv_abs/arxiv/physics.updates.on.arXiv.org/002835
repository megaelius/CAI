The actin cytoskeleton is composed of multiple networks which are specialized for several processes
such as cell motility or cell division. Each of these networks are composed of organized actin microfilaments
which are decorated with specific sets of actin binding proteins (ABPs). The molecular mechanisms
guiding ABPs to specific actin networks are still poorly understood, but cooperativity, the mechanism
by which the binding of an ABP is positively influenced by proximal bound ABPs, plays a crucial role
in generating locally dense stretches of ABPs. Cooperative binding is characterized by its amplitude,
but also by the range at which its effects are propagated along an actin filament through long-range
allosteric interactions. The range of these allosteric effects is still debated, but is likely
to be significant at the lengthscale of actin filaments in cells. Here, we investigated how cooperativity
influences the clustering of ABPs, using a stochastic computational model of binding of ABPs to
actin filaments. The model reproduces the formation of ABP clusters observed experimentally at
the single filament scale, and provides a theoretical estimation of the range of cooperativity
for proteins such as ADF/cofilin. We found that both the amplitude and the spatial range of cooperativity
dramatically impact the properties of clustering. However, the parameters of cooperativity modulate
differently the rate of assembly, size and dynamics of the ABP clusters, suggesting that cooperativity
is an efficient mechanism to regulate precisely the recruitment of ABPs in cells. This work provides
a more general framework for future understanding of how actin networks acquire distinct and specific
protein compositions from a common cytoplasm.
