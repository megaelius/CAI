Inverse dynamic analysis using musculoskeletal modeling is a powerful tool, which is utilized
in a range of applications to estimate forces in ligaments, muscles, and joints, non-invasively.
To date, the conventional input used in this analysis is derived from optical motion capture (OMC)
and force plate (FP) systems, which restrict the application of musculoskeletal models to gait
laboratories. To address this problem, we propose a musculoskeletal model, capable of estimating
the internal forces based solely on inertial motion capture (IMC) input and a ground reaction force
and moment (GRF&M) prediction method. We validated the joint angle and kinetic estimates of the
lower limbs against an equally constructed musculoskeletal model driven by OMC and FP system. The
sagittal plane joint angles of ankle, knee, and hip presented excellent Pearson correlations (\rho
= 0.95, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively) and root-mean-squared differences (RMSD) of 4.1 $\pm$ 1.3$\circ$,
4.4 $\pm$ 2.0$\circ$, and 5.7 $\pm$ 2.1$\circ$, respectively. The GRF&M predicted using IMC input
were found to have excellent correlations for three components (vertical:\rho = 0.97, RMSD=9.3
$\pm$ 3.0 %BW, anteroposterior: \rho = 0.91, RMSD=5.5 $\pm$ 1.2 %BW, sagittal: \rho = 0.91, RMSD=1.6
$\pm$ 0.6 %BW*BH), and strong correlations for mediolateral (\rho = 0.80, RMSD=2.1 $\pm$ 0.6%BW
) and transverse (\rho = 0.82, RMSD=0.2 $\pm$ 0.1 %BW*BH). The proposed IMC-based method removes
the complexity and space-restrictions of OMC and FP systems and could enable applications of musculoskeletal
models in either monitoring patients during their daily lives or in wider clinical practice.
