We carry out a comprehensive Bayesian correlation analysis between hot halos and direct masses
of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), by retrieving the X-ray plasma properties (temperature,
luminosity, density, pressure, masses) over galactic to cluster scales for 85 diverse systems.
We find new key scalings, with the tightest relation being the $M_\bullet-T_{\rm x}$, followed
by $M_\bullet-L_{\rm x}$. The tighter scatter (down to 0.2 dex) and stronger correlation coefficient
of all the X-ray halo scalings compared with the optical counterparts (as the $M_\bullet-\sigma_{\rm
e}$) suggest that plasma halos play a more central role than stars in tracing and growing SMBHs (especially
those that are ultramassive). Moreover, $M_\bullet$ correlates better with the gas mass than dark
matter mass. We show the important role of the environment, morphology, and relic galaxies/coronae,
as well as the main departures from virialization/self-similarity via the optical/X-ray fundamental
planes. We test the three major channels for SMBH growth: hot/Bondi-like models have inconsistent
anti-correlation with X-ray halos and too low feeding; cosmological simulations find SMBH mergers
as sub-dominant over most of the cosmic time and too rare to induce a central-limit-theorem effect;
the scalings are consistent with chaotic cold accretion (CCA), the rain of matter condensing out
of the turbulent X-ray halos that sustains a long-term self-regulated feedback loop. The new correlations
are major observational constraints for models of SMBH feeding/feedback in galaxies, groups,
and clusters (e.g., to test cosmological hydrodynamical simulations), and enable the study of
SMBHs not only through X-rays, but also via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (Compton parameter),
lensing (total masses), and cosmology (gas fractions).
