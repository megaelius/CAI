Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, many efforts and innovative solutions have surfaced to
deal with the possible shortage of ventilators upon catastrophic surges of patients. One solution
involves splitting one ventilator to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement,
but there are obvious risks and little is known on how the technique would work on patients with ARDS
from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs of equal characteristics can
be successfully ventilated from one machine, but that large variations in tidal volume delivery
occurs when lungs with different compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of
the feasibility of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments expanding
on the previous studies with different ventilator setting and lung characteristics. Using two
test lungs connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were measured
for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances, modes of ventilation, inspiratory
and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found large discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for
paired test lungs with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway resistances,
and that higher PEEP settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test
lungs. The most balanced, although far from ideal, delivery of tidal volumes for the test lungs with
different compliance was measured using pressure-controlled ventilation with a maximum inspiratory
pressure of 30 mbar and a PEEP at 6 or 10 mbar. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were
not able to identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the hazards
of the technique.
