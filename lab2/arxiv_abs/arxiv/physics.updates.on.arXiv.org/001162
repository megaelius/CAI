It was previously difficult to use the equilibrium Z-pinch as a magnetic-confinement fusion system
owing to unavoidable exchange or quasi-exchange mode instability; however, the development of
pulsed power technology and the dynamic Z-pinch has led to renewed interest in the Z-pinch for fusion
applications. In a dynamic Z-pinch system, magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability is inevitable
due to implosion of the plasma driven by the magnetic pressure. MRT instability develops along with
other modes of instability, but it grows much faster and is the most dangerous instability undermining
pinch symmetry. We propose to use a directional time-varying (rotating) driven magnetic field
to suppress MRT instability in a dynamic Z-pinch. A finite thickness cylindrical liner configuration
was studied. A rotational drive magnetic field is equivalent to two magnetic field components,
Theta and Z, that alternate in time, referred to as an alternant Theta-Z-pinch configuration. The
maximum e-folding number at stagnation of the dominant mode of an optimized alternant Theta-Z-pinch
is significantly lower than that of the standard Theta- or Z-pinch and the instability is completely
stabilized at a certain thickness. Directional rotation of the magnetic field is independent of
the finite thickness: these parameters cooperate and enhance the suppressing effect. The finite
thickness effect appears only when the magnetic field is time-varying in orientation and there
is no reflection in the standard Theta- or Z-pinch. Because MRT instability can be well suppressed
in this way, the alternant Theta-Z-pinch configuration has potential applications in liner inertial
fusion.
