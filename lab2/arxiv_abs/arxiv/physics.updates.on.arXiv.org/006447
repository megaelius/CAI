This study develops a framework for quantification of the impact of changes in population mobility
due to social distancing on the COVID-19 infection growth rate. Using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) epidemiological model we establish that under some mild assumptions the growth rate of COVID-19
deaths is a time-delayed approximation of the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. We then hypothesize
that the growth rate of COVID-19 infections is a function of population mobility, which leads to
a statistical model that predicts the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths as a delayed function of population
mobility. The parameters of the statistical model directly reveal the growth rate of infections,
the mobility-dependent transmission rate, the mobility-independent recovery rate, and the critical
mobility, below which COVID-19 growth rate becomes negative. We fitted the proposed statistical
model on publicly available data from 14 countries where daily death counts exceeded 100 for more
than 3 days as of May 6th, 2020. The publicly available Google Mobility Index (GMI) was used as a measure
of population mobility at the country level. Our results show that the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths
can be accurately estimated 20 days ahead as a quadratic function of the transit category of GMI (adjusted
R-squared = 0.784). The estimated 95% confidence interval for the critical mobility is in the range
between 36.1% and 47.6% of the pre-COVID-19 mobility. This result indicates that a significant
reduction in population mobility is needed to reverse the growth of COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover,
the quantitative relationship established herein suggests that a readily available, population-level
metric such as GMI can be a useful indicator of the course of COVID-19 epidemic.
