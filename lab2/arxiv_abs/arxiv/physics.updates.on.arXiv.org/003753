Small-scale magnetic flux ropes, in the solar wind, have been studied for decades via the approach
of both simulation and observation. Statistical analysis utilizing various in-situ spacecraft
measurements is the main observational approach. In this study, we extend the automated detection
of small-scale flux ropes based on the Grad-Shafranov reconstruction to the complete dataset of
\emph{Ulysses} spacecraft in-situ measurements. We first discuss the temporal variation of the
bulk properties of 22,719 flux ropes found through our approach, namely, the average magnetic field
and plasma parameters, etc., as functions of the heliographical latitudes and heliocentric radial
distances. We then categorize all identified events into three groups based on event distributions
in different latitudes separated at 30$^{\circ}$, at different radial distances, and under different
solar activities, respectively. By the detailed statistical analysis, we conclude as follows.
(1) The properties of flux ropes, such as the duration, scale size, etc., follow the power-law distributions,
but with different slope indices, especially for distributions at different radial distances.
(2) Also, they are affected by the solar wind speed which has different distributions under the different
solar activities, which is manifested as the latitudinal effect. (3) The main difference in flux
rope properties between the low and high latitudes is attributed to possible Alfv\'enic structures
or waves. (4) Flux ropes with longer duration and larger scale sizes occur more often at larger radial
distances. (5) With more strict Wal\'en slope threshold, more events are excluded at higher latitudes.
