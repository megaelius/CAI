The effect of rotation on the classical gravity-driven Rayleigh-Taylor instability has been shown
to influence the scale of the perturbations that develop at the unstable interface and consequently
alter the speed of propagation of the front. The present authors argued that this is as a result of
a competition between the destabilizing effect of gravity and the stabilizing effect of the rotation.
In the present paper we consider the extreme limit of high rotation rates in which rotational forces
dominate and gravitational forces may be ignored. The two liquid layers initially form concentric
cylinders, centred on the axis of rotation. The configuration may be thought of as a fluid-fluid
centrifuge. There are two types of perturbation to the interface that may be considered, an azimuthal
perturbation around the circumference of the interface and a varicose perturbation in the axial
direction along the length of the interface. It is the first of these types of perturbation that we
consider here, and so the flow may be considered essentially two-dimensional, taking place in a
circular domain. We carry out a linear stability analysis on a perturbation to the hydrostatic background
state and derive a fourth order Orr-Sommerfeld-like equation that governs the system. We consider
the dynamics of systems of stable and unstable configurations, inviscid and viscous fluids, immiscible
fluid layers with surface tension, and miscible fluid layers that may have some initial diffusion
of density. Theoretical predictions are compared with numerical experiments and the agreement
is shown to be good. We do not restrict our analysis to equal volume fluid layers and so our results
also have applications in coating and lubrication problems in rapidly rotating systems and machinery.
