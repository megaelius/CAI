A type of line defect (LD) composed of alternate squares and octagons (4-8) as the basic unit is currently
an experimentally available topological defect in graphene lattice, which brings some interesting
modification to magnetic and electronic properties of graphene. The transitional metal (TM) adsorb
on graphene with line-defect (4-8), and they show interesting and attractive structural, magnetic
and electronic properties. For different TMs such as Fe, Co, Mn, Ni and V, the complex systems show
different magnetic and electronic properties. The TM atoms can spontaneously adsorb at quadrangular
sites, forming an atomic chain along LD on graphene. The most stable configuration is hollow site
of regular tangle. The TMs (TM = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, V) tend to form extended metal lines, showing ferromagnetic
(FM) ground state. For Co, Fe, and V atom, the system are half-metal. The spin-{\alpha} electron
is insulating, while spin-\b{eta} electron is conductive. For Mn and Ni atom, Mn-LD and Ni-LD present
spin-polarized metal; For Fe atom, the Fe-LD shows semimetal with Dirac cones. For Fe and V atom,
both Fe-LD and V-LD show spin-polarized half-metallic properties. And its spin-{\alpha} electron
is conducting, while spin-\b{eta} electron is insulating. Different TMs adsorbing on graphene
nanoribbon forming same stable configurations of metal lines, show different electronic properties.
The adsorption of TMs introduces magnetism and spin-polarization. These metal lines have potential
application in spintronic devices, and work as quasi-one-dimensional metallic wire, which may
form building blocks for atomic-scale electrons with well-controlled contacts at atomic level.
