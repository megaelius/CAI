Gas detectors are one of the pillars of the research in fundamental physics. Since many years, a new
concept of detectors, the Micro Pattern Gas Detectors, allows to overcome many of the problems of
other types of commonly used detectors, as drift chambers and microstrips, reducing the discharge
rate and increasing the radiation tolerance. Among these, one of the most commonly used is the Gas
Electron Multiplier. Commonly deployed as fast timing detectors and triggers, due to their fast
response, high rate capability and high radiation hardness, they can also be used as trackers. The
center of gravity readout technique allows to overcome the limit of the digital pads, whose spatial
resolution is constrained by the pitch size. The presence of a high external magnetic field can distort
the electronic cloud and affect the spatial resolution. The micro-TPC reconstruction method allows
to reconstruct the three dimensional particle position as in a traditional Time Projection Chamber,
but within a drift gap of a few millimeters. This method brings these detectors into a new perspective
for what concerns the spatial resolution in strong magnetic field. In this report, the basis of this
new technique will be shown and it will be compared to the traditional center of gravity. The results
of a series of test beam performed with 10 x 10 cm2 planar prototypes in magnetic field will also be
presented. This is one of the first implementations of this technique for GEM detectors in magnetic
field and allows to reach unprecedented performance for gas detectors, up to a limit of 120 micron
at 1T, one of the world's best results for MPGDs in strong magnetic field. The micro-TPC reconstruction
has been recently tested at very high rates in a test beam at the MAMI facility; preliminary results
of the test will be presented.
