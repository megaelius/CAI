Electrooptic modulation performs the conversion between the electrical and optical domain with
applications in data communication for optical interconnects, but also for novel optical compute
algorithms such as providing nonlinearity at the output stage of optical perceptrons in neuromorphic
analogue optical computing. Since the clock frequency for photonics on chip has a power overhead
sweet slot around 10s of GHz, ultrafast modulation may only be required in long distance communication,
but not for short onchip links. Here we show a roadmap towards atto Joule per bit efficient modulators
on chip as well as some experimental demonstrations of novel plasmon modulators with sub 1fJ per
bit efficiencies. We then discuss the first experimental demonstration of a photon plasmon-hybrid
Graphene-based electroabsorption modulator on silicon. The device shows a sub 1V steep switching
enabled by near ideal electrostatics delivering a high 0.05dB per V um performance requiring only
110 aJ per bit. Improving on this design, we discuss a plasmonic slot based Graphene modulator design,
where the polarization of the plasmonic mode matches with Graphenes inplane dimension. Here a push
pull dual gating scheme enables 2dB per V um efficient modulation allowing the device to be just 770
nm short for 3dB small signal modulation. This in turn allows for a device-enabled two orders of magnitude
improvement of electrical optical co integrated network on chips over electronic only architectures.
The latter opens technological opportunities in in cognitive computing, dynamic data-driven
applications system, and optical analogue compute engines to include neuromorphic photonic computing.
