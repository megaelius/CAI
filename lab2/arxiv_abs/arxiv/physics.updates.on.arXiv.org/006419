The 'Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with
the Sun' (ARTEMIS) mission provides a unique opportunity to study the structure of interplanetary
shocks and the associated generation of plasma waves with frequencies between ~50-8000 Hz due to
its long duration electric and magnetic field burst waveform captures. We compare wave properties
and occurrence rates at 11 quasi-perpendicular interplanetary shocks with burst data within 10
minutes (~3200 proton gyroradii upstream, ~1900 downstream) of the shock ramp. A perturbed shock
is defined as possessing a large amplitude whistler precursor in the quasi-static magnetic field
with an amplitude greater than 1/3 the difference between the upstream and downstream average magnetic
field magnitudes; laminar shocks lack these large precursors and have a smooth, step function-like
transition. In addition to wave modes previously observed, including ion acoustic, whistler,
and electrostatic solitary waves, waves in the ion acoustic frequency range that show rapid temporal
frequency change are common. The ramp region of two laminar shocks contained a wide range of large
amplitude wave modes. The ion acoustic waves observed in the ramp of laminar shocks could provide
resistivities necessary for the energy dissipation. The wave occurrence rates for laminar shocks
are higher in the transition region, especially the ramp, than downstream. One perturbed shock
exhibited no waves with amplitudes > 2 mV/m, suggesting the primary dissipation method to not be
wave-particle interactions, instead likely dispersion via whistler precursor. Perturbed shocks
have approximately 2-3 times the wave occurrence rate downstream than laminar shocks.
