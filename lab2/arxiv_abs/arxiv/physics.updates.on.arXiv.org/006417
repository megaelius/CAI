This paper reports theoretical and numerical investigations on free molecular gas flows through
micro-channels. Both diffusely and specularly reflective channel surfaces are considered. Gaskinetic
methods are adopted to develop the analytical solutions for surface and flowfield properties.
The crucial steps include constructing the velocity distribution functions (VDFs) for points
at the plate surfaces and inside flowfield, and then completing the integration over the related
velocity phases. For diffusely reflective surfaces, the VDFs are related to the densities and temperatures
at the two exits and the plate temperatures. For surfaces with specular reflections, the VDFs at
the plate surface and inside the flowfield are identical, and independent of the surface temperature
ratio and the geometric aspect ratio. Based on the VDFs and velocity phases, surface property coefficients
(e.g., C_p, C_f, and C_q) and flowfield properties (e.g., density, velocity components, and temperature)
are obtained. For the diffusely reflective surface scenario, the mass flow rate can be approximated
and the results include four non-dimensional parameters: the aspect ratio, the density ratio,
and two temperature ratios. For specularly reflective surface scenario, the surface and flowfield
properties are uniform everywhere, the channel aspect ratio and plate temperatures do not have
any influence. Particle simulations with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method are performed,
and essentially identical results validate the theoretical work. This work is heuristic and can
be used to investigate less rarefied micro-channel gaseous flows, for example, aid experimental
measurement design for thermal transpiration flows.
