Purpose: Most MR spectroscopy (MRS) pulse sequences rely on broadband excitation with water saturation
and typically focus on upfield signals. By contrast, the downfield spectrum, which contains many
potentially useful resonances, is typically not targeted because conventional water-suppressed
techniques indirectly saturate the labile protons through exchange. Relaxation-enhanced MRS
(RE-MRS) uses frequency-selective excitation while actively avoiding bulk water perturbation,
thereby enabling high-quality downfield spectroscopy. However, RE-MRS typically requires very
long (typically >40 ms) echo times (TEs) due to its localization module, which inevitably decreases
sensitivity and filters shorter T2 components. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining
RE-MRS and image selected in vivo spectroscopy (ISIS) localization, abbreviated iRE-MRS, which
in turn allows very short TEs (5 ms using our hardware). Methods: Experiments were performed in vitro
for validation as well as and in in vivo rat brains at 9.4T. Results: The new iRE-MRS methodology was
validated in phantoms where good performance was noted. When the downfield spectrum was investigated
at short TEs in in vivo rat brains, iRE-MRS provided very high sensitivity; the ensuing downfield
spectra encompassed numerous broad peaks, as well as a broad baseline. All downfield spectral peaks
were highly attenuated by increasing TEs as well as by applying water saturation, although to different
extent. The signal ratios also varied between TEs, suggesting that exchange rates are different
among the downfield signals. Conclusions: Short-TE iRE 1H downfield MRS opens new directions in
the investigation of in vivo downfield metabolites and their role on healthy and disease processes.
