Many searches for axion cold dark matter rely on the use of tunable electromagnetic resonators.
Current detectors operate at or near microwave frequencies and use cylindrical cavities with cylindrical
tuning rods. The cavity performance strongly impacts the signal power of the detector, which is
expected to be very small even under optimal conditions. There is strong motivation to characterize
these microwave cavities and improve their performance in order to maximize the achievable signal
power. We present the results of a study characterizing the HAYSTAC cavity using bead perturbation
measurements and detailed finite element simulations. This is the first use of bead perturbation
methods to characterize an axion haloscope cavity. In this study, we measured impacts of misalignments
on the order of 0.001 in and demonstrated that the same impacts can be predicted using finite element
models. We also performed a detailed study of mode crossings and hybridization between the TM$_{010}$
mode used in operation and intruder modes. This mixing limits the tuning range of the cavity that
can be used during an axion search. By characterizing each mode crossing in detail, we show that some
mode crossings are benign and are potentially still useful for data collection. The level of observed
agreement between measurements and simulations demonstrates that finite element modeling can
capture non-ideal cavity behavior and the impacts of very small imperfections. Finite element
modeling and bead perturbation measurements are standard tools in the microwave engineering community,
but they have been underutilized in axion cavity design. This work demonstrates their potential
to improve understanding of existing cavities and to optimize future designs.
