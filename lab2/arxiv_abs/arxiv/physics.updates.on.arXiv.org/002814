The recent detections of gravitational waves (GWs) reported by LIGO/Virgo collaborations have
made significant impact on physics and astronomy. A global network of GW detectors will play a key
role to solve the unknown nature of the sources in coordinated observations with astronomical telescopes
and detectors. Here we introduce KAGRA (former name LCGT; Large-scale Cryogenic Gravitational
wave Telescope), a new GW detector with two 3-km baseline arms arranged in the shape of an "L", located
inside the Mt. Ikenoyama, Kamioka, Gifu, Japan. KAGRA's design is similar to those of the second
generations such as Advanced LIGO/Virgo, but it will be operating at the cryogenic temperature
with sapphire mirrors. This low temperature feature is advantageous for improving the sensitivity
around 100 Hz and is considered as an important feature for the third generation GW detector concept
(e.g. Einstein Telescope of Europe or Cosmic Explorer of USA). Hence, KAGRA is often called as a 2.5
generation GW detector based on laser interferometry. The installation and commissioning of KAGRA
is underway and its cryogenic systems have been successfully tested in May, 2018. KAGRA's first
observation run is scheduled in late 2019, aiming to join the third observation run (O3) of the advanced
LIGO/Virgo network. In this work, we describe a brief history of KAGRA and highlights of main feature.
We also discuss the prospects of GW observation with KAGRA in the era of O3. When operating along with
the existing GW detectors, KAGRA will be helpful to locate a GW source more accurately and to determine
the source parameters with higher precision, providing information for follow-up observations
of a GW trigger candidate.
