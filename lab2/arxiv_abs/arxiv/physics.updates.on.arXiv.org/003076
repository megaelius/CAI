A novel technique based on the Full Orthogonalization Arnoldi (FOA) is proposed to perform Dynamic
Mode Decomposition (DMD) for a sequence of snapshots. A modification to FOA is presented for situations
where the matrix $A$ is unknown, but the set of vectors $\{A^{i-1}v_1\}_{i=1}^{N-1}$ are known.
The modified FOA is the kernel for the proposed projected DMD algorithm termed, FOA based DMD. The
proposed algorithm to compute DMD modes and eigenvalues i) does not require Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) for snapshot matrices $X$ with $\kappa_2(X) \ll 1/\epsilon_m$, where $\kappa_2(X)$ is the
2-norm condition number of the snapshot matrix and $\epsilon_m$ is the relative round-off error
or machine epsilon, ii) has an optional rank truncation step motivated by round off error analysis
for snapshot matrices $X$ with $\kappa_2(X) \approx 1/\epsilon_m$, iii) requires only one snapshot
at a time, thus making it a 'streaming' method even with the optional rank truncation step, iv) consumes
less memory and requires less floating point operations to obtain the projected matrix than existing
projected DMD methods and v) lends itself to easy parallelism as the main computational kernel involves
only vector additions, dot products and matrix vector products. The new technique is therefore
well-suited for DMD of large datasets on parallel computing platforms. We show both theoretically
and using numerical examples that for FOA based DMD without rank truncation, the finite precision
error in the computed projection of the linear mapping is $O(\epsilon_m\kappa_2(X))$. The proposed
method is also compared to existing projected DMD methods for computational cost, memory consumption
and relative round off error. Error indicators are presented that are useful to decide when to stop
acquiring new snapshots. The proposed method is applied to several examples of numerical simulations
of fluid flow.
