Active ring laser gyroscopes (RLG) operating on the principle of the optical Sagnac effect are preferred
instruments for a range of applications, such as inertial guidance systems, seismology, and geodesy,
that require both high bias stability and high angular velocity resolutions. Operating at such
accuracy levels demands special precautions like dithering or multi-mode operation to eliminate
frequency lock-in or similar effects introduced due to synchronisation of counter-propagating
channels. Recently proposed bidirectional ultrafast fibre lasers can circumvent the limitations
of continuous wave RLGs. However, their performance is limited due to the nature of the highly-averaged
interrogation of the Sagnac effect. In general, the performance of current optical gyroscopes
relies on the available measurement methods used for extracting the signal. Here, by changing the
paradigm of traditional measurement and applying spatio-temporal intensity processing, we demonstrate
that the bidirectional ultrafast laser can be transformed to an ultrafast gyroscope with acquisition
rates of the order of the laser repetition rate, making them at least two orders of magnitude faster
than commercially deployed versions. We also show the proof-of-principle for dead-band-free
round trip time-resolved spectral domain measurements using the Dispersive Fourier Transform,
further enhancing the gyroscopic sensitivity. Our results reveal the high potential of application
of novel methods of signal measurements in mid-sized ultrafast fibre laser gyroscopes to achieve
performances that are currently available only with large-scale RLGs.
