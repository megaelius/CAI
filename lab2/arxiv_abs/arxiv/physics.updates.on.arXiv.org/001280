The transfer of energy from large to small scales in solar wind turbulence is an important ingredient
of the longstanding question about the mechanism of the interplanetary plasma heating. Previous
studies have shown that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is statistically compatible with
the observed solar wind heating as it expands in the heliosphere. However, in order to understand
which processes contribute to the plasma heating, it is necessary to have a local description of
the energy flux across scales. To this aim, it is customary to use indicators such as the magnetic
field partial variance of increments (PVI), which is associated with the local, relative, scale-dependent
magnetic energy. A more complete evaluation of the energy transfer should also include other terms,
related to velocity and cross-helicity. This is achieved here by introducing a proxy for the local,
scale dependent turbulent energy transfer rate epsilon_Dt(t), based on the third-order moment
scaling law for MHD turbulence. Data from Helios 2 are used to determine the statistical properties
of such a proxy in comparison with the magnetic and velocity fields PVI, and the correlation with
local solar wind heating is computed. PVI and epsilon_Dt(t) are generally well correlated, however
epsilon_Dt(t) is a very sensitive proxy that can exhibit large amplitude values, both positive
and negative, even for low amplitude peaks in the PVI. Furthermore, epsilon_Dt(t) is very well correlated
with local increases of temperature when large amplitude bursts of energy transfer are localized,
thus suggesting an important role played by this proxy in the study of plasma energy dissipation.
