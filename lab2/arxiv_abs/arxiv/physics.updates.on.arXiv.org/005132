In this work by using the assumptions that wavelength is much smaller than charge separation distance
of an electric dipole, which in turn is much smaller than a distance up to the point of observation,
the new results for radiation of an electric dipole were obtained. These results generalize and
extend the standard classical solution, and they indicate that under the above assumptions the
electric dipole emits both long-range longitudinal electric and transverse electromagnetic
waves. For a specific values of the dipole system parameters the longitudinal and transverse electric
fields are displayed. Total power emitted by electric and electromagnetic waves are calculated
and compared. It was shown that under the standard assumption of charge separation distance being
much smaller than wavelength: a) classical solution correctly describes the transverse electromagnetic
waves only; b) longitudinal electric waves are non-negligible; c) total radiated power is proportional
to the fourth degree of frequency and to the second degree of the charge separation distance; d) transverse
component of our solution reduces to classical solution. In case wavelength is much smaller than
charge separation distance: a) the classical solution is not valid and it overestimates the total
radiated power; b) longitudinal electric waves are dominant and transverse electromagnetic waves
are negligible; c) total radiated power is proportional to the third degree of frequency and to the
charge separation distance; d) most of the power is emitted in a narrow beam along the dipole axis,
thus emission of waves is focused as with lasers.
