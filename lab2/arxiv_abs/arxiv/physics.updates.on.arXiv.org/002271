It is shown, using density matrix calculation, that high precision two-dimensional (2D) atom localization
in V-type system can be achieved by applying an additional microwave coupling field between the
excited states. In the present scheme, two lasers, probe and pump, form a V-type system by coupling
the ground state to the excited states while an additional 2D standing microwave field is used to
couple the excited states. The solutions of the density matrix equations reveal that the off-diagonal
density matrix element $\rho_{31}$, which signify the coherence between the states connected
by the probe laser, is position dependent. As the imaginary part of $\rho_{31}$ is proportional
to the imaginary part of the susceptibility, the probe absorption also becomes position dependent
and in this situation one can readily obtain information about the atom position from the probe absorption
spectra. Perfect 2D atom localization can be achieved by carefully selecting different system
parameters such as detuning, relative phase, dephasing and field strength. It is found that the
atom localization is highly dependent on the probe and coupling field detuning values. In view of
this, a systematic study is performed on the system parameters and different zones have been identified
which give rise to different absorption shapes, e.g. "dip", "wall", "peak" as well as negative absorption
or amplification. Probe absorption spectrum is also found to be dependent on relative phase between
the applied fields. The dependence of the dephasing parameter on the probe absorption is investigated
and found to be detrimental to atom localization. The effect of the microwave coupling strength
on "wall" type absorption shape is also studied and the results are discussed. Finally, a possible
practical realization of the present scheme is discussed in Conclusion section.
