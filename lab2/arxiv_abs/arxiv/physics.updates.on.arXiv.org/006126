To contain the pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Mainland China, the authorities have put in
place a series of measures, including quarantines, social distancing, and travel restrictions.
While these strategies have effectively dealt with the critical situations of outbreaks, the combination
of the pandemic and mobility controls has slowed China's economic growth, resulting in the first
quarterly decline of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since GDP began to be calculated, in 1992. To characterize
the potential shrinkage of the domestic economy, from the perspective of mobility, we propose two
new economic indicators: the New Venues Created (NVC) and the Volumes of Visits to Venue (V^3), as
the complementary measures to domestic investments and consumption activities, using the data
of Baidu Maps. The historical records of these two indicators demonstrated strong correlations
with the past figures of Chinese GDP, while the status quo has dramatically changed this year, due
to the pandemic. We hereby presented a quantitative analysis to project the impact of the pandemic
on economies, using the recent trends of NVC and V^3. We found that the most affected sectors would
be travel-dependent businesses, such as hotels, educational institutes, and public transportation,
while the sectors that are mandatory to human life, such as workplaces, residential areas, restaurants,
and shopping sites, have been recovering rapidly. Analysis at the provincial level showed that
the self-sufficient and self-sustainable economic regions, with internal supplies, production,
and consumption, have recovered faster than those regions relying on global supply chains.
