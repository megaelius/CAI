We propose a statistical multiscale mapping approach to identify microscopic and molecular heterogeneity
across a tumor microenvironment using multiparametric MR (mp-MR). Twenty-nine patients underwent
pre-surgical mp-MR followed by MR-guided stereotactic core biopsy. The locations of the biopsy
cores were identified in the pre-surgical images using stereotactic bitmaps acquired during surgery.
Feature matrices mapped the multiparametric voxel values in the vicinity of the biopsy cores to
the pathologic outcome variables for each patient and logistic regression tested the individual
and collective predictive power of the MR contrasts. A non-parametric weighted k-nearest neighbor
classifier evaluated the feature matrices in a leave-one-out cross validation design across patients.
Resulting class membership probabilities were converted to chi-square statistics to develop
full-brain parametric maps, implementing Gaussian random field theory to estimate inter-voxel
dependencies. Corrections for family-wise error rates were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg
and random field theory, and the resulting accuracies were compared. The combination of all five
image contrasts correlated with outcome (P<.001) for all four microscopic variables. The probabilistic
mapping method using Benjamini-Hochberg generated statistically significant results (P<.05)
for three of the four dependent variables: 1) IDH1, 2) MGMT, and 3) microvascular proliferation,
with an average classification accuracy of 0.984 +/- 0.02 and an average classification sensitivity
of 1.567% +/- 0.967. The images corrected by random field theory demonstrated improved classification
accuracy (0.989 +/- 0.008) and classification sensitivity (5.967% +/- 2.857) compared with Benjamini-Hochberg.
Microscopic and molecular tumor properties can be assessed with statistical confidence across
the brain from minimally-invasive, mp-MR.
