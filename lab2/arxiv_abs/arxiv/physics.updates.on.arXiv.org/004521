3D computer-assisted corrective osteotomy has become the state-of-the-art for surgical treatment
of complex bone deformities. Despite available technologies, the automatic generation of clinically
acceptable, ready-to-use preoperative planning solutions is currently not possible for such
pathologies. Multiple contradicting and mutually dependent objectives have to be considered,
as well as clinical and technical constraints, generally requiring iterative manual adjustments.
This leads to unnecessary efforts and unbearable clinical costs, hindering also the quality of
patient treatment. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for the generation of ready-to-use
preoperative planning solutions in a fully automatic fashion. An automatic diagnostic assessment
using patient-specific 3D models is performed for 3D malunion quantification and definition of
the optimization parameters. Afterward, clinical objectives are translated into the optimization
module, and controlled through tailored fitness functions based on a weighted and multi-staged
optimization approach. The optimization is based on a genetic algorithm capable of solving multi-objective
optimization problems with non-linear constraints. The framework outputs a complete preoperative
planning solution including position and orientation of the osteotomy plane, transformation
to achieve the bone reduction, and position and orientation of the fixation plate and screws. A qualitative
validation was performed on 36 consecutive cases of radius osteotomy where solutions generated
by the optimization algorithm (OA) were compared against the gold standard (GS) solutions generated
by experienced surgeons. Solutions were blinded and presented to 6 readers, who voted OA solutions
to be better in 55% of the time. The quantitative evaluation was based on different error measurements,
showing average improvements with respect to the GS.
