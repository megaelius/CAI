We observed resistance drift in 125 K - 300 K temperature range in melt quenched amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5
line-cells with length x width x thickness = ~500 nm x ~100 nm x ~ 50 nm. Drift coefficients measured
using small voltage sweeps appear to decrease from 0.12 +/- 0.029 at 300 K to 0.075 +/- 0.006 at 125
K. The current-voltage characteristics of the amorphized cells measured in the 85 K - 300 K using
high-voltage sweeps (0 to ~25 V) show a combination of a linear, low-field exponential and high-field
exponential conduction mechanisms, all of which are strong functions of temperature. The very
first high-voltage sweep after amorphization (with electric fields up to ~70% of the breakdown
field) shows clear hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics due to accelerated drift,
while the consecutive sweeps show stable characteristics. Stabilization was achieved with 50
nA compliance current (current densities ~104 A/cm^2), preventing appreciable self-heating
in the cells. The observed acceleration and stoppage of the resistance drift with the application
of high electric fields is attributed to changes in the electrostatic potential profile within
amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 due to trapped charges, reducing tunneling current. Stable current-voltage
characteristics are used to extract carrier activation energies for the conduction mechanisms
in 85 K - 300 K temperature range. The carrier activation energy associated with linear current-voltage
response is extracted to be 331 +/- 5 meV in 200 - 300 K range, while carrier activation energies of
233 +/- 2 meV and 109 +/- 5 meV are extracted in 85 K to 300 K range for the mechanisms that give exponential
current-voltage responses.
