The sedimentation process of granular materials exists ubiquitously in nature and many fields
which involve the solid-liquid separation. This paper employs the coupled computational fluid
dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) to investigate the sedimentation process of non-cohesive
particles, including the hindered settling stage and the deposition stage. Firstly, the coupled
CFD-DEM model for sedimentation is validated by the hindered settling velocity at different solid
volume concentrations of suspension (0.05~0.6). Two typical modes of sedimentation are also presented
by the concentration profiles and the equal-concentration lines. Then, the comparisons between
mono- and poly-dispersed particle system are detailed. In the sedimentation of the poly-dispersed
particle system, the segregation phenomenon is simulated. Furthermore, this segregation effect
reduces with the increase of the initial solid concentration of suspension. From the simulations,
the contact force between every pair of particles can be obtained, hence we demonstrate the "effective
stress principle" from the view of the particle contact force by giving the correspondence between
the particle contact force and the "effective stress", which is a critical concept of soil mechanics.
We also demonstrate the effective stress principle from the view of the contact force acting on particles.
Moreover, the deposition stage can be simulated by CFD-DEM method, therefore the solid concentrations
of sediment bed on different conditions are studied. Based on the simulation results of maximum
solid concentration and the theory of sedimentation, this paper also discusses a method to calculate
the critical time when sedimentation ends of two typical modes of sedimentation.
