The function of proteins is determined by a combination of their structure and dynamics. Acquisition
of structural information has recently been revolutionized by advances in electron microscopy,
however protein dynamics is difficult to obtain over long timescales. Here we show a novel plasmon
ruler based single molecule approach to study the conformational dynamics of single proteins over
24 hours at video rate in and out of equilibrium (i.e. in the absence and presence of ATP). This approach
does not impose external force on the proteins and allows to measure protein dynamics over several
orders of magnitude, which cannot be achieved by the established single molecule techniques. We
used this technique to explore the dynamics of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and find (beside
the well-known fast dynamics in the range netween 0.1 and 10 s) states with very long dwell times (linked
to rarely visited states) in the minute timescale, which could indicate, for instance, pathways
to protein denaturation. Our plasmon ruler based method will enable to access the full complexity
of correlated local and global conformational dynamics on the level of individual proteins and
therefore extend and complement the current "structure / function" paradigm with a novel "structure
/ timescale / function" description. Access to the dynamics of a single protein over more than 6 orders
of magnitude further allows us to address important questions like conformational heterogeneity
among proteins, ergodic behavior, and nonMarkovian dynamics, ultimately extending the often
static view of biomolecules with a more dynamic picture.
