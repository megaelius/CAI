In the spirit of the "Principle of Equipresence" introduced by Truesdell & Toupin, The Classical
Field Theories (1960), we use the full version of the viscous stress tensor which was originally
derived for compressible flows, instead of the classical incompressible stress tensor. In our
approach, the divergence-free constraint for the viscous stress term is not enforced ahead of discretization.
Instead, our formulation allows the scheme itself to "choose" a consistent way to interpret the
divergence-free constraint: i.e., the divergence-free constraint is interpreted (or enforced)
in a consistent fashion in both the mass conservation equation and the stress tensor term (in the
momentum equation). Furthermore, our approach preserves the original symmetrical properties
of the stress tensor, e.g. its rotational invariance, and it remains physically correct in the context
of compressible flows. As a result, our approach facilitates versatility and code reuse. In this
paper, we introduce our approach and establish some important mathematical properties for the
resulting class of finite element schemes. More precisely, for general mixed methods, which are
not necessarily pointwise divergence-free, we establish the existence of a new norm induced by
the full, viscous bilinear form. Thereafter, we prove the coercivity of the viscous bilinear form
and the semi-coercivity of a convective trilinear form. In addition, we demonstrate L2-stability
of the discrete velocity fields for the general class of methods and (by deduction) the H(div)-conforming
methods. Finally, we run some numerical experiments to illustrate the behavior of the versatile
mixed methods, and we make careful comparisons with a conventional H(div)-conforming scheme.
