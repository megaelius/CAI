As a fundamental process converting magnetic to plasma energy in high-energy astrophysical plasmas,
relativistic magnetic reconnection is a leading explanation for the acceleration of particles
to the ultrarelativistic energies necessary to power nonthermal emission (especially X-rays
and gamma-rays) in pulsar magnetospheres and pulsar wind nebulae, coronae and jets of accreting
black holes, and gamma-ray bursts. An important objective of plasma astrophysics is therefore
the characterization of nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) effected by reconnection. Reconnection-powered
NTPA has been demonstrated over a wide range of physical conditions using large two-dimensional
(2D) kinetic simulations. However, its robustness in realistic 3D reconnection -- in particular,
whether the 3D relativistic drift-kink instability (RDKI) disrupts NTPA -- has not been systematically
investigated, although pioneering 3D simulations have observed NTPA in isolated cases. Here we
present the first comprehensive study of NTPA in 3D relativistic reconnection in collisionless
electron-positron plasmas, characterizing NTPA as the strength of 3D effects is varied systematically
via the length in the third dimension and the strength of the guide magnetic field. We find that, while
the RDKI prominently perturbs 3D reconnecting current sheets, it does not suppress particle acceleration,
even for zero guide field; fully 3D reconnection robustly and efficiently produces nonthermal
power-law particle spectra closely resembling those obtained in 2D. This finding provides strong
support for reconnection as the key mechanism powering high-energy flares in various astrophysical
systems. We also show that strong guide fields significantly inhibit NTPA, slowing reconnection
and limiting the energy available for plasma energization, yielding steeper and shorter power-law
spectra.
