EasyPET is a new concept of a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner using an innovative acquisition
method based on two rotation axes for the movement of detector pairs. Due to its simplicity, it is
suitable for education purposes, to teach students about the PET technology and its basic concepts,
from the radiation detecting and analogue pulse analysis to the coincidence sorting and image reconstruction.
The concept allows achieving high and uniform position resolution over the whole field of view (FoV),
by eliminating parallax errors due to the depth of interaction (DoI), which are typical of ring-based
PET systems, so quality images are obtained even without state-of-the-art image reconstruction
algorithms. The technology developed at the University of Aveiro with a patent-pending, is licensed
to CAEN S.p.A, and included in the educational catalogue of the company. In this work, a simulation
toolkit based in the Edugate platform was developed to simulate the EasyPET system. It can simulate
all the physical aspects of the product, such us the scanning range, variable Field-of-View (FOV),
scintillator energy resolution, coincidence time and energy window, among others. A simple image
reconstruction algorithm based on Filtered-back-projection (FBP) is implemented. The toolkit
allows a quick analysis in classroom of the simulation results. The platform was also used to study
the new EasyPET 3D version, and a simulation of a NEMA NU 4-2008 IQ phantom was performed, demonstrating
the capability of the platform not only for education purposes but also for research. Patent Universidade
