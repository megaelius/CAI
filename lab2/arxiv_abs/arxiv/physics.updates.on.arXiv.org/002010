I investigate the nightly mean emission height and width of the OH*(3-1) layer by comparing nightly
mean temperatures measured by the ground-based spectrometer GRIPS 9 and the Na lidar at ALOMAR.
The data set contains 42 coincident measurements between November 2010 and February 2014, when
GRIPS 9 was in operation at the ALOMAR observatory (69.3$^\circ$N, 16.0$^\circ$E) in northern
Norway. To closely resemble the mean temperature measured by GRIPS 9, I weight each nightly mean
temperature profile measured by the lidar using Gaussian distributions with 40 different centre
altitudes and 40 different full widths at half maximum. In principle, one can thus determine the
altitude and width of an airglow layer by finding the minimum temperature difference between the
two instruments. On most nights, several combinations of centre altitude and width yield a temperature
difference of $\pm$2 K. The generally assumed altitude of 87 km and width of 8 km is never an unambiguous,
good solution for any of the measurements. Even for a fixed width of $\sim$8.4 km, one can sometimes
find several centre altitudes that yield equally good temperature agreement. Weighted temperatures
measured by lidar are not suitable to determine unambiguously the emission height and width of an
airglow layer. However, when actual altitude and width data are lacking, a comparison with lidars
can provide an estimate of how representative a measured rotational temperature is of an assumed
altitude and width. I found the rotational temperature to represent the temperature at the commonly
assumed altitude of 87.4 km and width of 8.4 km to within $\pm$16 K, on average. This is not a measurement
uncertainty.
