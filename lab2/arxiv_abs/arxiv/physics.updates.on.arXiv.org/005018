Heart transplant patients are followed with periodic right heart catheterizations (RHCs) to identify
post-transplant complications and guide treatment. Post-transplant positive outcomes are associated
with a steady reduction of right ventricular and pulmonary arterial pressures, toward normal levels
of right-side pressure (about 20mmHg) measured by RHC. This study shows more information about
patient progression is obtained by combining standard RHC measures with mechanistic computational
cardiovascular systems models. This study shows: to understand how cardiovascular system models
can be used to represent a patient's cardiovascular state, and to use these models to track post-transplant
recovery and outcome. To obtain reliable parameter estimates comparable within and across datasets,
we use sensitivity analysis, parameter subset selection, and optimization to determine patient
specific mechanistic parameter that can be reliably extracted from the RHC data. Patient-specific
models are identified for ten patients from their first post-transplant RHC and longitudinal analysis
is done for five patients. Results of sensitivity analysis and subset selection show we can reliably
estimate seven non-measurable quantities including ventricular diastolic relaxation, systemic
resistance, pulmonary venous elastance, pulmonary resistance, pulmonary arterial elastance,
pulmonary valve resistance and systemic arterial elastance. Changes in parameters and predicted
cardiovascular function post-transplant are used to evaluate cardiovascular state during recovery
in five patients. Of these five patients, only one patient showed inconsistent trends during recovery
in ventricular pressure-volume relationships and power output. At a four-year recovery time point
this patient exhibited biventricular failure along with graft dysfunction while the remaining
four exhibited no cardiovascular complications.
