We consider the relevance of known constraints from each of Hide's theorem, the angular momentum
conserving (AMC) model, and the equal-area model on the extent of cross-equatorial Hadley cells.
These theories respectively posit that a Hadley circulation must span: all latitudes where the
radiative convective equilibrium (RCE) absolute angular momentum ($M_\mathrm{rce}$) satisfies
$M_\mathrm{rce}>\Omega a^2$ or $M_\mathrm{rce}<0$ or where the RCE absolute vorticity ($\eta_\mathrm{rce}$)
satisfies $f\eta_\mathrm{rce}<0$; all latitudes where the RCE zonal wind exceeds the AMC zonal
wind; and over a range such that depth-averaged potential temperature is continuous and that energy
is conserved. The AMC model requires knowledge of the ascent latitude $\varphi_\mathrm{a}$, which
need not equal the RCE forcing maximum latitude $\varphi_\mathrm{m}$. Whatever the value of $\varphi_\mathrm{a}$,
we demonstrate that an AMC cell must extend at least as far into the winter hemisphere as the summer
hemisphere. The equal-area model predicts $\varphi_\mathrm{a}$, always placing it poleward
of $\varphi_\mathrm{m}$. As $\varphi_\mathrm{m}$ is moved poleward (at a given thermal Rossby
number), the equal-area predicted Hadley circulation becomes implausibly large, while both $\varphi_\mathrm{m}$
and $\varphi_\mathrm{a}$ become increasingly displaced poleward of the minimal cell extent based
on Hide's theorem (i.e. of supercritical forcing). In an idealized dry general circulation model,
cross-equatorial Hadley cells are generated, some spanning nearly pole-to-pole. All homogenize
angular momentum imperfectly, are roughly symmetric in extent about the equator, and appear in
extent controlled by the span of supercritical forcing.
