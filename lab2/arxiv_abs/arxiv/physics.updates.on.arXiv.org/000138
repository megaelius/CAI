We present the first quantified measure of the rate of energy dissipated per unit volume by high frequency
electromagnetic waves in the transition region of the Earth's collisionless bow shock using data
from the THEMIS spacecraft. Every THEMIS shock crossing examined with available wave burst data
showed both low frequency (< 10 Hz) magnetosonic-whistler waves and high frequency (> 10
Hz) electromagnetic and electrostatic waves throughout the entire transition region and into
the magnetosheath. The waves in both frequency ranges had large amplitudes, but the higher frequency
waves, which are the focus of this study, showed larger contributions to both the Poynting flux and
the energy dissipation rates. The higher frequency waves were identified as combinations of ion-acoustic
waves, electron cyclotron drift instability driven waves, electrostatic solitary waves, and
whistler mode waves. These waves were found to have: (1) amplitudes capable of exceeding dB ~ 10 nT
and dE ~ 300 mV/m, though more typical values were dB ~ 0.1-1.0 nT and dE ~ 10-50 mV/m; (2) energy fluxes
in excess of 2000 x 10^(-6) W m^(-2); (3) resistivities > 9000 Ohm m; and (4) energy dissipation
rates > 3 x 10^(-6) W m^(-3). The dissipation rates were found to be in excess of four orders of magnitude
greater than was necessary to explain the increase in entropy across the shocks. Thus, the waves
need only be, at times, < 0.01% efficient to balance the nonlinear wave steepening that produces
the shocks. Therefore, these results show for the first time that high frequency electromagnetic
and electrostatic waves have the capacity to regulate the global structure of collisionless shocks.
