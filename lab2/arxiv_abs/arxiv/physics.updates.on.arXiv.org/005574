Tracking of objects in cellular environments has become a vital tool in molecular cell biology.
A particularly important example is single molecule tracking which enables the study of the motion
of a molecule in cellular environments and provides quantitative information on the behavior of
individual molecules in cellular environments, which were not available before through bulk studies.
Here, we consider a dynamical system where the motion of an object is modeled by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs), and measurements are the detected photons emitted by the moving fluorescently
labeled object, which occur at discrete time points, corresponding to the arrival times of a Poisson
process, in contrast to uniform time points which have been commonly used in similar dynamical systems.
The measurements are distributed according to optical diffraction theory, and therefore, they
would be modeled by different distributions, e.g., a Born and Wolf profile for an out-of-focus molecule.
For some special circumstances, Gaussian image models have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce
a stochastic framework in which we calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of the biophysical
parameters of the molecular interactions, e.g., diffusion and drift coefficients. More importantly,
we develop a general framework to calculate the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB), given by the inverse
of the Fisher information matrix, for the estimation of unknown parameters and use it as a benchmark
in the evaluation of the standard deviation of the estimates. There exists no established method,
even for Gaussian measurements, to systematically calculate the CRLB for the general motion model
that we consider in this paper. We apply the developed methodology to simulated data of a molecule
with linear trajectories and show that the standard deviation of the estimates matches well with
the square root of the CRLB.
