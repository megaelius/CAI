The polymer ejection from a capsid through a nanoscale pore is an important biological process with
relevance to modern biotechnology. Here, we study the generic capsid ejection using Langevin dynamics.
We show that even when the ejection takes place within the drift-dominated region there is a very
high probability for the ejection process not to be completed. Introducing a small aligning force
at the pore entrance enhances ejection dramatically. Such a pore asymmetry is a candidate for a mechanism
through which a viral ejection is completed. By detailed high-resolution simulations we show that
such capsid ejection is an out-of-equilibrium process that shares many common features with the
much studied driven polymer translocation through a pore in a wall or a membrane. We find that the
escape times scale with polymer length, $\tau \sim N^\alpha$. We show that for the pore without the
asymmetry the previous predictions corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations do not hold. For the
pore with the asymmetry the scaling exponent varies with the initial monomer density (monomers
per capsid volume) $\rho$ inside the capsid. For very low densities $\rho \le 0.002$ the polymer
is only weakly confined by the capsid, and scaling with $\alpha = 1.33$ that is close to the one in polymer
translocation is obtained. At intermediate densities scaling exponents $\alpha = 1.25$ and $1.21$
for $\rho = 0.01$ and $0.02$, respectively. These scalings are in accord with a crude derivation
for the lower limit $\alpha = 1.2$. The scaling breaks down, when the density exceeds the value for
complete confinement by the capsid, $\rho \gtrapprox 0.25$. The high-resolution data show that
the capsid ejection for both pores, analogously to polymer translocation, can be characterized
as a multiplicative stochastic process that is dominated by small-scale transitions.
