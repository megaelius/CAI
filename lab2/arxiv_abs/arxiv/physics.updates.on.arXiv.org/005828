GEM are widely used as amplification stages in gaseous detectors exposed to high rates. The GEM consists
of a polyimide foil which is coated by two thin copper layers. Charges collected into the holes or
created during the amplification process may adhere to the polyimide part inside the holes. This
is often accompanied by a change of the effective gain. The effect is commonly known as the charging-up
effect. This work presents a systematic investigation of the effect under well-controlled and
monitored conditions for a single standard GEM foil in Ar/CO$_2$ (90/10) gas for varying rates of
X-ray interactions in the detector and for different gains of the foil. In order to cover a wide range
of different rates, we apply two different methods. The first one is based on a current measurement
while the second one relies on the analysis of $^{55}$Fe spectra over time. Both methods give consistent
results, showing an initial increase of the effective gain with time and an asymptotic saturation,
which can be well described by a single-exponential function. We find that the characteristic time
constants extracted from our measurements scale inversely proportional to the rate of incoming
electrons for a given GEM voltage. Introducing characteristic quantities, which describe either
the number of incoming electrons per hole or the total number of electrons in a hole per characteristic
time, we find consistent numbers for measurements taken at the same GEM voltages. For measurements
taken at different GEM voltages, however, also the characteristic total number of electrons inside
the hole, which is supposed to take into account the different effective gains, is found to be higher
by a factor of about 3.5 for $U_{\rm GEM}=$ 350V ($n_{\rm tot}=8.8\times 10^8$) compared to 400V
($n_{\rm tot}=2.4\times 10^8$). This hints at a residual dependence of the charging-up characteristics
on the GEM voltage.
