HiPIMS plasmas generate energetic metal ions at the substrate as a major difference to conventional
direct current magnetron sputtering. The origin of these ions is still an open issue, which is unraveled
by using two fast diagnostics: time resolved mass spectrometry with a temporal resolution of 2 $\mu$s
and phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy with a temporal resolution of 1 $\mu$s. A power
scan from dcMS-like to HiPIMS plasmas was performed, with a 2-inch magnetron and a titanium target
as sputter source and argon as working gas. Clear differences in the transport as well in the energetic
properties of Ar$^{+}$, Ar$^{2+}$, Ti$^+$ and Ti$^{2+}$ were observed. For discharges with highest
peak power densities a high energetic group of Ti$^+$ and Ti$^{2+}$ could be identified. A cold group
of ions is always present. It is found that hot ions are observed only, when the plasma enters the spokes
regime, which can be monitored by oscillations in the IV-characteristics in the MHz range that are
picked up by the used VI-probes. These oscillations are correlated with the spokes phenomenon and
are explained as an amplification of the Hall current inside the spokes as hot ionization zones.
To explain the presence of energetic ions, we propose a double layer (DL) confining the hot plasma
inside a spoke: if an atom becomes ionized inside the spokes region it is accelerated because of the
DL to higher energies whereas its energy remains unchanged if it is ionized outside. In applying
this DL model to our measurements the observed phenomena as well as several measurements from other
groups can be explained. Only if spokes and a double layer are present the confined particles can
gain enough energy to leave the magnetic trap. We conclude from our findings that the spoke phenomenon
represents the essence of HiPIMS plasmas, explaining their good performance for material synthesis
applications.
