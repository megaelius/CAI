Based on a joint analysis of the data from 10 midlatitude decameter radars the effects are investigated
during 80 x-ray flares in the period 2013-2017. For the investigation nine mid-latitude SuperDARN
radars of the northern hemisphere and Ekaterinburg coherent decameter radar of ISTP SB RAS are used.
All the radars work in the same 8-20MHz frequency band and have similar hardware and software. During
the analysis the temporal dynamics of noise from each of the radar direction and for each flare is
investigated separately. As a result, on the basis of about 13000 daily measurements we found a strong
anticorrelation between noise power and x-ray flare intensity, that allows to use short-wave sky
noise to diagnose the ionospheric effects of x-ray solar flares. It is shown that in 88.3\% of cases
an attenuation of daytime decameter radio noise is observed during solar flare, correlating with
the temporal dynamics of the solar flare. The intensity of decameter noise anticorrelates well
(the Pearson correlation coefficient better than -0.5) with the shape of the X-ray flare in the daytime
(for solar elevation angle $>0$) in 33\% of cases, the average Pearson correlation over the daytime
is about -0.34. Median regression coefficient between GOES 0.1-0.8nm x-ray intensity and daytime
sky-noise attenuation is about $-4.4\cdot10^{4}\ [dB\cdot m^{2}/Wt]$. Thus, it has been shown
that measurements of the decameter sky noise level at midlatitude decameter radars can be used to
study the ionospheric absorption of high-frequency waves in the lower ionosphere during x-ray
solar flares. This can be explained by the assumption that the most part of decameter sky noise detected
by the radars can be interpreted as produced by ground sources at distances of the first propagation
hop (\textasciitilde{} 3000 km).
