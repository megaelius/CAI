Transcranial electric stimulation (TES) can modulate intrinsic neural activity in the brain by
injecting weak currents through electrodes attached to the scalp. TES has been widely used as a neuroscience
tool to investigate how behavioural and physiological variables of brain function are modulated
by electric stimulation of specific brain regions. For an unambiguous interpretation of TES experiments,
it is important that the electric fields can be steered towards one or several brain regions-of-interest.
However, the conductive proprieties of the human head impose inherent physical limitations on
how focal the electric fields in the brain produced by multi-electrode TES can be. As a rule of thumb,
it is not feasible to target deep brain areas with TES, although focusing the field in some specific
deeper locations might be possible due to favourable conductive properties in the surrounding
tissue. In the present study, we first propose a novel method for the automatic calculation of electrode
placements and stimulation intensities to optimally affect a given target position. We provide
a computationally efficient and robust implementation of the optimization procedure that is able
to adhere to safety constraints, while explicitly controlling both the number of active electrodes
and the angular deviation of the field in the target area relative to the desired field direction.
Leveraging the high computational efficiency of our method, we systematically assess the achievable
focality of multi-electrode TES for all cortex positions, thereby investigating the dependence
on the chosen constraints. Our results provide comprehensive insight into the limitations regarding
the achievable TES dose and focality that are imposed by the biophysical constraints and the safety
considerations of TES.
