In this paper we investigate the dynamics of the inertial wave energy converter (ISWEC) device using
fully-resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Originally prototyped by Polytechnic
University of Turin, the device consists of a floating, boat-shaped hull that is slack-moored to
the sea bed. Internally, a gyroscopic power take off (PTO) unit converts the wave-induced pitch
motion of the hull into electrical energy. The CFD model is based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations and utilizes the fictitious domain Brinkman penalization technique to couple the device
physics and water wave dynamics. A numerical wave tank is used to emulate realistic sea operating
conditions. A Froude scaling analysis is performed to enable two- and three-dimensional simulations
for a scaled-down (1:20) ISWEC model. It is demonstrated that the scaled-down 2D model is sufficient
to accurately simulate the hull's pitching motion and to predict the power generation capability
of the converter. A systematic parameter study of the ISWEC is conducted, and its optimal performance
in terms of power generation is determined based on the hull and gyroscope control parameters. It
is demonstrated that the device achieves peak performance when the gyroscope specifications are
chosen based on reactive control theory. It is shown that a proportional control of the PTO control
torque is required to generate continuous gyroscope precession effects, without which the device
generates no power. In an inertial reference frame, it is demonstrated that the yaw and pitch torques
acting on the hull are of the same order of magnitude, informing future design investigations of
the ISWEC technology. Further, an energy transfer pathway from the water waves to the hull, the hull
to the gyroscope, and the gyroscope to the PTO unit is analytically described and numerically verified.
