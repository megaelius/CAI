We present an accurate methodology for representing the physics of waves, for periodic structures,
through effective properties for a replacement bulk medium: This is valid even for media with zero
frequency stop-bands and where high frequency phenomena dominate. Since the work of Lord Rayleigh
in 1892, low frequency (or quasi-static) behaviour has been neatly encapsulated in effective anisotropic
media. However such classical homogenization theories break down in the high-frequency or stop
band regime. Higher frequency phenomena are of significant importance in photonics (transverse
magnetic waves propagating in infinite conducting parallel fibers), phononics (anti-plane shear
waves propagating in isotropic elastic materials with inclusions), and platonics (flexural waves
propagating in thin-elastic plates with holes). Fortunately, the recently proposed high-frequency
homogenization (HFH) theory is only constrained by the knowledge of standing waves in order to asymptotically
reconstruct dispersion curves and associated Floquet-Bloch eigenfields: It is capable of accurately
representing zero-frequency stop band structures. The homogenized equations are partial differential
equations with a dispersive anisotropic homogenized tensor that characterizes the effective
medium. We apply HFH to metamaterials, exploiting the subtle features of Bloch dispersion curves
such as Dirac-like cones, as well as zero and negative group velocity near stop bands in order to achieve
exciting physical phenomena such as cloaking, lensing and endoscope effects. These are simulated
numerically using finite elements and compared to predictions from HFH. An extension of HFH to periodic
supercells enabling complete reconstruction of dispersion curves through an unfolding technique
is also introduced.
