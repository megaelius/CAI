Point Spread Function (PSF) engineering is used in single emitter localization to measure the emitter
position in 3D and possibly other parameters such as the emission color or dipole orientation as
well. Advanced PSF models such as spline fits to experimental PSFs or the vectorial PSF model can
be used in the corresponding localization algorithms in order to model the intricate spot shape
and deformations correctly. The complexity of the optical architecture and fit model makes PSF
engineering approaches particularly sensitive to optical aberrations. Here, we present a calibration
and alignment protocol for fluorescence microscopes equipped with a Spatial Light Modulator with
the goal of establishing a wavefront error well below the diffraction limit for optimum application
of complex engineered PSFs. We achieve high-precision wavefront control, to a level below 20 m$\lambda$
wavefront aberration over a 30 minute time window after the calibration procedure, using a separate
light path for calibrating the pixel-to-pixel variations of the SLM, and alignment of the SLM with
respect to the optical axis and Fourier plane within 3 $\mu$m ($x/y$) and 100 $\mu$m ($z$) error.
Aberrations are retrieved from a fit of the vectorial PSF model to a bead $z$-stack and compensated
with a residual wavefront error comparable to the error of the SLM calibration step. This well-calibrated
and corrected setup makes it possible to create complex `3D+$\lambda$' PSFs that fit very well to
the vectorial PSF model. Proof-of-principle bead experiments show precisions below 10~nm in $x$,
$y$, and $\lambda$, and below 20~nm in $z$ over an axial range of 1 $\mu$m with 2000 signal photons
and 12 background photons.
