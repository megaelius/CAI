Machine learning algorithms have recently been used to classify students as those likely to receive
an A or B or students likely to receive a C, D, or F in a physics class. The performance metrics used in
that study become unreliable when the outcome variable is substantially unbalanced. This study
seeks to further explored the classification of students who will receive a C, D, and F and extend
those methods to predicting whether a student will receive a D or F. The sample used for this work ($N=7184$)
is substantially unbalanced with only 12\% of the students receiving a D or F. Applying the same methods
as the previous study produced a classifier that was very inaccurate, classifying only 20\% of the
D or F cases correctly. This study will focus on the random forest machine learning algorithm. By
adjusting the random forest decision threshold, the correct classification rate of the D or F outcome
rose to 46\%. This study also investigated the previous finding that demographic variables such
as gender, underrepresented minority status, and first generation status had low variable importance
for predicting class outcomes. Downsampling revealed that this was not the result of the underrepresentation
of these students. An optimized classification model was constructed which predicted the D and
F outcome with 46\% accuracy and C, D, and F outcome with 69\% accuracy; the accuracy of prediction
of these outcomes is called "sensitivity" in the machine learning literature. Substantial variation
was detected when this classification model was applied to predict the C, D, or F outcome for underrepresented
demographic groups with 61\% sensitivity for women, 67\% for underrepresented minority students,
and 78\% for first-generation students. Similar variation was observed for the D and F outcome.
