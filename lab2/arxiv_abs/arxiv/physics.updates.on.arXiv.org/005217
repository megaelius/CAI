The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is anticipated to influence the public transportation
(PT) system. Many possible relationships between AV and PT are proposed depending on the policy
and institution, where competition and cooperation are two main categories. This paper focuses
on the former in a hypothetical scenario-"if both AV and PT operators were only profit-oriented."
We aim to quantitatively evaluate the system performance (e.g. level of service, operators' financial
viability, transport efficiency) when AV and PT are profit-oriented competitors with dynamic
adjustable supply strategies under certain policy constraints. We assume AV can adjust the fleetsize
and PT can adjust the headway. Service fare and bus routes are fixed. The competition process is analyzed
through an agent-based simulation platform, which incorporates a proposed heuristic dynamic
supply updating algorithm (HDSUA). The first-mile scenario in Singapore Tampines area is selected
as the case study, where only bus is considered for PT system. We found that when AV and bus operators
are given the flexibility to adjust supply, both of them will re-distribute their supply spatially
and temporally, leading to higher profits. In temporal dimension, both AV and bus will concentrate
their supplies in morning and evening peak hours, and reduce the supplies in off-peak hours. The
competition between AV and PT decreases passengers' travel time but increase their travel cost.
The generalized travel cost is still reduced when counting the value of time. The bus supply adjustment
can increase the bus average load and reduce total passenger car equivalent (PCE), which is good
for transport efficiency and sustainability. But the AV supply adjustment shows the opposite effect.
Overall, the competition does not necessarily bring out loss-gain results. A win-win outcome is
also possible under certain policy interventions.
