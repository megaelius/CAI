Morphological features of small vessels provide invaluable information regarding underlying
tissue, especially in cancerous tumors. This paper introduces methods for obtaining quantitative
morphological features from microvasculature images obtained by non-contrast ultrasound imaging.
Those images suffer from the artifact that limit quantitative analysis of the vessel morphological
features. In this paper we introduce processing steps to increase accuracy of the morphological
assessment for quantitative vessel analysis in presence of these artifact. Specifically, artificats
are reduced by additional filtering and vessel segments obtained by skeletonization of the regularized
microvasculature images are further analyzed to satisfy additional constraints, such as diameter,
and length of the vessel segments. Measurement of some morphological metrics, such as tortuosity,
depends on preserving large vessel trunks that may be broken down into multiple branches. We propose
two methods to address this problem. In the first method, small vessel segments are suppressed in
the vessel filtering process via adjusting the size scale of the regularization. Hence, tortuosity
of the large trunks can be more accurately estimated by preserving longer vessel segments. In the
second approach, small connected vessel segments are removed by a combination of morphological
erosion and dilation operations on the segmented vasculature images. These methods are tested
on representative in vivo images of breast lesion microvasculature, and the outcomes are discussed.
This paper provides a tool for quantification of microvasculature image from non-contrast ultrasound
imaging may result in potential biomarkers for diagnosis of some diseases.
