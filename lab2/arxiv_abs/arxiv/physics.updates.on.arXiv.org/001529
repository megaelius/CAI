Based upon thermodynamic ideas, two new derivations of the Planck blackbody spectrum are given
within classical physics which includes classical zero-point radiation. The first and second
laws of thermodynamics, applied to a harmonic oscillator or a radiation normal mode, require that
the canonical potential $\phi(\omega/T)$ is a function of a single variable corresponding to the
ratio of the oscillation frequency to the temperature. The second law of thermodynamics involves
extremum ideas which may be applied to thermal radiation. Our first derivation of the Planck spectrum
is based upon the idea that the canonical potential $\phi(\omega/T)$ is a monotonic function and
all its derivatives are monotonic when interpolating between zero-point energy at low temperature
and energy equipartition at high temperature; the monotonic behavior precludes the canonical
potential from giving a preferred value for the ratio $\omega/T.$ Our second derivation of the Planck
spectrum is based upon the requirement that the change in the Helmholtz free energy of the radiation
in a partitioned box held at constant temperature should be a minimum at thermal equilibrium. Finally,
the change in Casimir energy with change in partition position for the radiation in a partitioned
box is shown to correspond at high temperature to the absence of zero-point energy when the spectral
energy per normal mode is chosen as the traditional Planck spectrum which omits zero-point energy
at low temperature; thus the idea of zero-point energy is embedded in the traditional Planck spectrum.
It is emphasized that thermal radiation is intimately connected with zero-point radiation and
the structure of spacetime in classical physics.
