The human mind is constituted by inner, subjective, private, first-person conscious experiences
that cannot be measured with physical devices or observed from an external, objective, public,
third-person perspective. The qualitative, phenomenal nature of conscious experiences also
cannot be communicated to others in the form of a message composed of classical bits of information.
Because in a classical world everything physical is observable and communicable, it is a daunting
task to explain how an empirically unobservable, incommunicable consciousness could have any
physical substrates such as neurons composed of biochemical molecules, water, and electrolytes.
The challenges encountered by classical physics are exemplified by a number of thought experiments
including the inverted qualia argument, the private language argument, the beetle in the box argument
and the knowledge argument. These thought experiments, however, do not imply that our consciousness
is nonphysical and our introspective conscious testimonies are untrustworthy. The principles
of classical physics have been superseded by modern quantum physics, which contains two fundamentally
different kinds of physical objects: unobservable quantum state vectors, which define what physically
exists, and quantum operators (observables), which define what can physically be observed. Identifying
consciousness with the unobservable quantum information contained by quantum physical brain
states allows for application of quantum information theorems to resolve possible paradoxes created
by the inner privacy of conscious experiences, and explains how the observable brain is constructed
by accessible bits of classical information that are bound by Holevo's theorem and extracted from
the physically existing quantum brain upon measurement with physical devices.
