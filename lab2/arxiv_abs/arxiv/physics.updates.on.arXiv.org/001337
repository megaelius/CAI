Neutron production in lead by cosmic muons has been studied with a Gadolinium doped liquid scintillator
detector installed in the T\"ubingen shallow underground laboratory, next to the Muon-Induced
Neutron Indirect Detection EXperiment used for muon tagging. The neutrons were detected through
neutron capture signals and neutron-induced nuclear recoil signals. Results on the rates of observed
neutron captures and nuclear recoils are presented and compared to predictions from GEANT4-9.6
and GEANT4.10.3. The predicted rates are significantly too low for both versions of GEANT4. For
neutron capture events, the observation exceeds the predictions by factors of $ 1.65~\pm\,0.02\,\textrm{(stat.)}~\pm\,0.07\,\textrm{(syst.)}
$ and $ 2.58~\pm\,0.03\,\textrm{(stat.)}~\pm\,0.11\,\textrm{(syst.)} $ for GEANT4-9.6 and
GEANT4-10.3, respectively. For neutron nuclear recoil events, which require neutron energies
above approximately 5 MeV, the factors are even larger, $ 2.22~\pm\,0.05\,\textrm{(stat.)}~\pm\,0.25\,\textrm{(syst.)}
$ and $ 3.76~\pm\,0.09\,\textrm{(stat.)}~\pm\,0.41\,\textrm{(syst.)} $, respectively. Also
presented is the first statistically significant measurement of the spectrum of neutrons induced
by cosmic muons in lead between 5 and 40\,MeV. It was obtained by unfolding the nuclear recoil spectrum.
The observed neutron spectrum is harder than the GEANT4 predicted spectra. An investigation of
the distribution of the time difference between muon tags and nuclear recoil signals confirms the
validity of the unfolding procedure and shows that GEANT4 cannot properly describe the time distribution
of nuclear recoil events. In general, the description of the data is worse for GEANT4-10.3 than for
GEANT4-9.6.
