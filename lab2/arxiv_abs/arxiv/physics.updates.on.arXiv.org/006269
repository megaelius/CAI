This study presents two different machine learning approaches for the modeling of hydrodynamic
force on particles in a particle-laden multiphase flow. Results from particle-resolved direct
numerical simulations (PR-DNS) of flow over a random array of stationary particles for eight combinations
of particle Reynolds number ($Re$) and volume fraction ($\phi$) are used in the development of the
models. The first approach follows a two step process. In the first flow prediction step, the perturbation
flow due to a particle is obtained as an axisymmetric superposable wake using linear regression.
In the second force prediction step, the force on a particle is evaluated in terms of the perturbation
flow induced by all its neighbors using the generalized Fax\'en form of the force expression. In
the second approach, the force data on all the particles from the PR-DNS simulations is used to develop
an artificial neural network (ANN) model for direct prediction of force on a particle. Due to the
unavoidable limitation on the number of fully resolved particles in the PR-DNS simulations, direct
force prediction with the ANN model tends to over-fit the data and performs poorly in the prediction
of test data. In contrast, due to the millions of grid points used in the PR-DNS simulations, accurate
flow prediction is possible, which then allows accurate prediction of particle force. This hybridization
of multiphase physics and machine learning is particularly important, since it blends the strength
of each, and the resulting pairwise interaction extended point-particle (PIEP) model cannot be
developed by either physics or machine learning alone.
