When matter is exposed to a high-intensity x-ray free-electron-laser pulse, the x rays excite inner-shell
electrons leading to the ionization of the electrons through various atomic processes and creating
high-energy-density plasma, i.e., warm or hot dense matter. The resulting system consists of atoms
in various electronic configurations, thermalizing on sub-picosecond to picosecond timescales
after photoexcitation. We present a simulation study of x-ray-heated solid-density matter. For
this we use XMDYN, a Monte-Carlo molecular-dynamics-based code with periodic boundary conditions,
which allows one to investigate non-equilibrium dynamics. XMDYN is capable of treating systems
containing light and heavy atomic species with full electronic configuration space and 3D spatial
inhomogeneity. For the validation of our approach we compare for a model system the electron temperatures
and the ion charge-state distribution from XMDYN to results for the thermalized system based on
the average-atom model implemented in XATOM, an ab-initio x-ray atomic physics toolkit extended
to include a plasma environment. Further, we also compare the average charge evolution of diamond
with the predictions of a Boltzmann continuum approach. We demonstrate that XMDYN results are in
good quantitative agreement with the above mentioned approaches, suggesting that the current
implementation of XMDYN is a viable approach to simulate the dynamics of x-ray-driven non-equilibrium
dynamics in solids. In order to illustrate the potential of XMDYN for treating complex systems we
present calculations on the triiodo benzene derivative 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid
(I3C), a compound of relevance of biomolecular imaging, consisting of heavy and light atomic species.
