The NEXT experiment aims at searching for the hypothetical neutrinoless double-beta decay from
the ${}^{136}$Xe isotope using a high-purity xenon TPC. Efficient discrimination of the events
through pattern recognition of the topology of primary ionisation tracks is a major requirement
for the experiment. However, it is limited by the diffusion of electrons. It is known that the addition
of a small fraction of a molecular gas to xenon reduces electron diffusion. On the other hand, the
electroluminescence (EL) yield drops and the achievable energy resolution may be compromised.
We have studied the effect of adding several molecular gases to xenon (CO${}_{2}$, CH${}_{4}$ and
CF${}_{4}$) on the EL yield and energy resolution obtained in a small prototype of driftless gas
proportional scintillation counter. We have compared our results on the scintillation characteristics
(EL yield and energy resolution) with a microscopic simulation, obtaining the diffusion coefficients
in those conditions as well. Accordingly, to reach an electron diffusion of about 2.5 mm/$\sqrt{\mathrm{m}}$,
one needs additive concentrations of about 0.05%, 0.2% and 0.02% for CO${}_{2}$, CH${}_{4}$ and
CF${}_{4}$, respectively. Our results show that CF${}_{4}$ admixtures present the highest EL
yield in those conditions, but terrible energy resolution. CH${}_{4}$ presents the best energy
resolution despite the EL yield being the lowest. A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages
of each mixture is presented, as well as on the energy resolution contributions for each case. We
demonstrate the possibility to have an electroluminescence TPC operating very close to the thermal
diffusion limit without jeopardizing the TPC performance, if CO${}_{2}$ or CH${}_{4}$ are chosen
as additives.
