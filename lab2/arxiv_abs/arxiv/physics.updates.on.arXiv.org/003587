The combination of a fuel cell and batteries has promising potential for powering autonomous vehicles.
The MUN Explorer Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is built to do mapping-type missions of seabeds
as well as survey missions. These missions require a great deal of power to reach underwater depths
(i.e. 3000 meters). The MUN Explorer uses 11 rechargeable Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries as the
main power source with a total capacity of 14.6kWh to 17.952kWh, and the vehicle can run for 10 hours.
The draw-backs of operating the existing power system of the MUN Explorer, which was done by the researcher
at the Holyrood management facility, include mobilization costs, logistics and transport, and
facility access, all of which should be taken into consideration. Recharging the batteries for
at least 8 hours is also very challenging and time consuming. To overcome these challenges and run
the MUN Explorer for a long time, it is essential to integrate a fuel cell into an existing power system
(i.e. battery bank). The integration of the fuel cell not only will increase the system power, but
it will also reduce the number of batteries needed as suggested by HOMER software. In this paper,
an integrated fuel cell is designed to be added into the MUN Explorer AUV along with a battery bank
system to increase its power system. The system sizing is performed using HOMER software. The results
from HOMER software show that a 1kW fuel cell and 8 Li-ion batteries can increase the power system
capacity to 68 kWh. The dynamic model is then built in MATLAB/Simulink environment to provide a better
understanding of the system behavior.The 1kW fuel cell is connected to a DC/DC Boost Converter to
increase the output voltage from 24V to 48V as required by the battery and DC motor.
