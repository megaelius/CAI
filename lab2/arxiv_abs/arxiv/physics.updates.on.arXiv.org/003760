The mass-transport induced by crossed surface waves consists of the Stokes and Euler contributions
which are very different in nature. The first contribution is a generalization of Stokes drift for
a plane wave in ideal fluid and the second contribution arises due to the fluid viscosity and it is
excited by a force applied in the viscous sublayer near the fluid surface. We study the formation
and decay of the induced mass-transport theoretically and experimentally and demonstrate that
both contributions have different time scales for typical experimental conditions. The evolution
of the Euler contribution is described by a diffusion equation, where the fluid kinematic viscosity
plays the role of the diffusion coefficient, while the Stokes contribution evolves faster, feeling
the additional damping near the system boundaries. The difference becomes more pronounced if the
fluid surface is contaminated. We model the effect of contamination by a thin insoluble liquid film
presented on the fluid surface with the compression modulus being the only non-zero rheological
parameter of the film. Then the Euler contribution into the mass-transport becomes parametrically
larger and the evolution of the Stokes contribution becomes parametrically faster. The parameter
is the same in both cases and it is equal to the quality factor of surfaces waves, which is modified
by the presence of a surface film. We infer the value of the compression modulus of the film by fitting
the results of transient measurements of eddy currents and demonstrate that the obtained value
leads to the correct ratio of amplitudes of horizontal and vertical velocities of the wave motion
and is in reasonable agreement with the measured dissipation rate of surface waves.
