The goal of this paper is to enable 3D printed lightweight composite foams by blending hollow glass
micro balloons (GMB) with high density polyethylene (HDPE). To that end, lightweight feedstock
for printing syntactic foam composites is developed. The blend for this is prepared by varying GMB
content (20, 40, and 60 volume %) in HDPE for filament extrusion, which is subsequently used for three-dimensional
printing (3DP). The rheological properties and the melt flow index (MFI) of blends are investigated
for identifying suitable printing parameters. It is observed that the storage and loss modulus,
as well as complex viscosity, increases with increasing GMB content, whereas MFI decreases. Further,
the coefficient of thermal expansion of HDPE and foam filaments decreases with increasing GMB content,
thereby lowering the thermal stresses in prints, which promotes the reduction in warpage. The mechanical
properties of filaments are determined by subjecting them to tensile tests, whereas 3D printed
samples are tested under tensile and flexure tests. The tensile modulus of the filament increases
with increasing GMB content (8-47%) as compared to HDPE and exhibit comparable filament strength.
3D printed foams show higher specific tensile and flexural modulus as compared to neat HDPE, making
them suitable candidate materials for weight sensitive applications. HDPE having 60% by volume
GMB exhibited the highest modulus and is 48.02% higher than the printed HDPE. Finally, the property
map reveals higher modulus and comparable strength against injection and compression molded foams.
Printed foam registered 1.8 times higher modulus than molded samples. Hence, 3D printed foams have
the potential for replacing components processed through conventional manufacturing processes
that have limitations on geometrically complex designs, lead time, and associated costs.
