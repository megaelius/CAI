Non-invasive surface wave methods have become a popular alternative to traditional invasive forms
of site-characterization for inferring a site's subsurface shear-wave velocity (Vs) structure.
The advantage of surface wave methods over traditional forms of site characterization is that measurements
made solely at the ground surface can be used routinely and economically to infer the subsurface
structure of a site to depths of engineering interest (20-50m), and much greater depths (>1km) in
some special cases. However, the quantification and propagation of uncertainties from surface
wave measurements into the Vs profiles used in subsequent engineering analyses remains challenging.
While this has been the focus of much work in recent years, and while considerable progress has been
made, no approach for doing so has been widely accepted, leading analysts to either address the propagation
of uncertainties in their own specialized manner or, worse, to ignore these uncertainties entirely.
In response, this paper presents an easy-to-implement, effective, and verifiable method for developing
uncertainty-consistent Vs profiles from inversion of surface wave dispersion data. We begin by
examining four approaches presented in the literature for developing suites of Vs profiles meant
to account for uncertainty present in the measured dispersion data. These methods are shown to be
deficient in three specific ways. First, all approaches are shown to be highly sensitive to their
many user-defined inversion input parameters, making it difficult/impossible for them to be performed
repeatedly by different analysts. Second, the suites of inverted Vs profiles, when viewed in terms
of their implied theoretical dispersion data, are shown to significantly underestimate the uncertainty
present in the experimental dispersion data, though some may appear satisfactory when viewed purely
qualitatively...
