In carbon capture and sequestration (also known as carbon capture and storage, or CCS), developing
effective monitoring methods is needed to detect and respond to CO2 leakage. CO2 leakage detection
methods rely on geophysical observations and monitoring sensor network. However, traditional
methods usually require development of site-specific physical models and expert interpretation,
and the effectiveness of these methods can be limited to the different application locations, operational
scenarios, and conditions. In this paper, we developed a novel data-driven leakage detection method
based on densely connected convolutional neural networks. Our method is an end-to-end detection
approach, that differs from conventional leakage monitoring methods by directly learning a mapping
relationship between seismic data and the CO2 leakage mass. To account for the spatial and temporal
characteristics of seismic data, our novel networks architecture combines 1D and 2D convolutional
neural networks. To overcome the computational expense of solving optimization problems, we apply
a densely-connecting strategy in our network architecture that reduces the number of network parameters.
Based on the features generated by our convolutional neural networks, we further incorporate a
long short-term memory network to utilize time-sequential information, which further improves
the detection accuracy. Finally, we employ our detection method to synthetic seismic datasets
generated based on flow simulations of a hypothetical CO2 storage scenario with injection into
a partially compartmentalized sandstone storage reservoir. To evaluate method performance,
we conducted multiple experiments including a random leakage test, a sequential test, and a robustness
test.
