Essentials of the scientific discovery process have remained largely unchanged for millennia:
systematic human observation of natural phenomena is used to form hypotheses that, when validated
through experimentation, are generalized into established scientific theory. Today, however,
we face major scientific challenges because automated scientific instrumentation and large-scale
data acquisition are generating data sets of such volume and complexity as to defy human analysis.
To achieve scientific discovery using these enormous empirical data sets will require new approaches.
A good example is modern visualization studies of electronic quantum matter (EQM) which yield dense
arrays of electronic structure images that are often astonishingly complex at the atomic-scale.
Given the recent advances in machine learning (ML) studies of synthetic EQM data, the outstanding
challenge now is to engage ML with real EQM data. Here we report development and training of an array
of artificial neural networks (ANN) designed to recognize different types of hypothesized order
hidden in EQM image-arrays. The ANNs are used to analyze a large, experimentally-derived EQM image
archive, spanning a wide range of electron densities and energies, in carrier-doped cuprate Mott
insulators. Remarkably, this ML system repeatedly and reliably discovers, throughout all these
noisy and complex data, the features of a very specific ordered state of EQM. It discerns a lattice-commensurate,
precisely four-unit-cell periodic, unidirectional, translational-symmetry-breaking state,
consistent with those long predicted within strong-coupling theories of electronic liquid crystals.
This marks a breakthrough in the capability of ML to achieve physics discovery and suggests broad
new avenues for the scientific method.
