Single-molecule biophysics has transformed our understanding of the fundamental molecular processes
involved in living biological systems, but also of the fascinating physics of life. Far more exotic
than a collection of exemplars of soft matter behaviour, active biological matter lives far from
thermal equilibrium, and typically covers multiple length scales from the nanometre level of single
molecules up several orders of magnitude to longer length scales in emergent structures of cells,
tissues and organisms. Biological molecules are often characterized by an underlying instability,
in that multiple metastable free energy states exist which are separated by energy levels of typically
just a few multiples of the thermal energy scale of kBT, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the
absolute temperature, implying complex, dynamic inter-conversion kinetics across this bumpy
free energy landscape in the relatively hot, wet environment of real, living biological matter.
The key utility of single-molecule biophysics lies in its ability to probe the underlying heterogeneity
of free energy states across a population of molecules, which in general is too challenging for conventional
ensemble level approaches which measure mean average properties. Parallel developments in both
experimental and theoretical techniques have been key to the latest insights and are enabling the
development of highly-multiplexed, correlative techniques to tackle previously intractable
biological problems. Experimentally, technological developments in the sensitivity and speed
of biomolecular detectors, the stability and efficiency of light sources, probes and microfluidics,
have enabled and driven the study of heterogeneous behaviours both in vitro and in vivo that were
previously undetectable by ensemble methods...
