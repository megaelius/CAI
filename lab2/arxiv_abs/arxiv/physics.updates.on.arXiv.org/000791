We provide a synthesis model demonstrating the "fast dynamo" action of the Sun. The latter is essentially
accomplished via two toroidal structures presumably formed in the tachocline and placed symmetrically
with respect to the equatorial plane. The two tori are characterized by several prominent key-properties
as follows: First, in each "Torus" a surplus charge is entrapped for the time period of an 11-year
sunspot cycle; for the next cycle the charge changes sign. Second, the net charge of Torus, moving
with the solar rotational speed (U), generates a huge toroidal current which, in turn, builds up
an intense poloidal magnetic field. Third, each Torus is placed at a specific distance from the Radiative
Zone, so that the U of an entrapped charge carrier equals the local propagation velocity for an electromagnetic
disturbance (v). Thus, two Torus electrons satisfy the condition that the repulsive electrostatic
force equals the attractive magnetic force caused from the two elementary currents. Fourth, the
surplus charge steadily increases; electrons are systematically attracted inwards or repealed
outwards via the poloidal field. The charges remain without any "Debye shielding" action in the
Torus-core region, while they demonstrate a "Debye anti-shielding effect" closer to the Radiative
Zone. Thus, the Torus charge "moves" with zero resistivity and rotational speed U; the Torus core
region behaves like a gigantic superconductor at the extremely high temperatures of tachocline.
Fifth, the tori move equatorward drifting on a surface being an ellipsoid by revolution on which
the condition U=v is satisfied. Moreover, we present a preliminary 3D solar circuit with the ability
to reverse the magnetic field in each 22-year cycle. Finally, we discuss many longstanding unresolved
questions in the context of the proposed model.
