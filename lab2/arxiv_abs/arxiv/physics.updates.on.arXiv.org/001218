In this paper we present a social network and forensic analysis of the vote counts of Spanish national
elections that took place in December 2015 and their sequel in June 2016. Vote counts are extracted
at the level of municipalities, yielding an unusually high resolution dataset with over 8000 samples.
We initially consider the phenomenon of Bipartisanship breakdown by analysing spatial distributions
of several Bipartisanship indices. We find that such breakdown is more prominent close to cosmopolite
and largely populated areas and less important in rural areas where Bipartisanship still prevails,
and its evolution mildly consolidates in the 2016 round, with some evidence of Bipartisanship reinforcement
which we hypothesize to be due to psychological mechanisms of risk aversion. On a third step we explore
to which extent vote data are faithful by applying forensic techniques to vote statistics. We first
explore the conformance of first digit distributions to Benford's law for each of the main political
parties. The results and interpretations are mixed and vary across different levels of aggregation,
finding a general good quantitative agreement at the national scale for both municipalities and
precincts but finding systematic nonconformance at the level of individual precincts. As a complementary
metric, we further explore the co-occurring statistics of voteshare and turnout, finding a mild
tendency in the clusters of the conservative party to smear out towards the area of high turnout and
voteshare, what has been previously interpreted as a possible sign of incremental fraud. In every
case results are qualitatively similar between 2015 and 2016 elections.
