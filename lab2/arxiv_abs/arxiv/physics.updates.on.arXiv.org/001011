Hydrodynamics can be formulated as the gradient expansion of conserved currents in terms of the
fundamental fields describing the near-equilibrium fluid flow. In the relativistic case, the
Navier-Stokes equations follow from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor to first order
in derivatives. In this paper, we go beyond the presently understood second-order hydrodynamics
and discuss the systematisation of obtaining the hydrodynamic expansion to an arbitrarily high
order. As an example of the algorithm that we present, we fully classify the gradient expansion at
third order for neutral fluids in four dimensions, thus finding the most general next-to-leading-order
corrections to the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations in curved space-time. In doing so, we
list $20$ new transport coefficient candidates in the conformal and $68$ in the non-conformal case.
As we do not consider any constraints that could potentially arise from the local entropy current
analysis, this is the maximal possible set of neutral third-order transport coefficients. To investigate
the physical implications of these new transport coefficients, we obtain the third-order corrections
to the linear dispersion relations that describe the propagation of diffusion and sound waves in
relativistic fluids. We also compute the corrections to the scalar (spin-$2$) two-point correlation
function of the third-order stress-energy tensor. Furthermore, as an example of a non-linear hydrodynamic
flow, we calculate the third-order corrections to the energy density of a boost-invariant Bjorken
flow. Finally, we apply our field theoretic results to the $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills
fluid at infinite 't Hooft coupling and infinite number of colours to find the values of five new linear
combinations of the conformal transport coefficients.
