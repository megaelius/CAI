We present two independent numerical schemes for passive tracer particles in the hydrodynamical
moving-mesh code Arepo, and compare their performance for various problems, from simple tests
to cosmological simulations. The purpose of tracer particles is to allow the flow to be followed
in a Lagrangian way, reliably tracing the evolution of the fluid. Such tracer particles can subsequently
measure any local instantaneous fluid property, thereby recording the thermodynamical history
of individual fluid parcels. We begin by discussing "velocity field tracers", which are advected
according to the local velocity field of the fluid, and which have been commonly used in the literature.
We find that such tracers do not in general follow the mass flow correctly, particularly in complex
flows, and explain why this is the case. This weakness of the method can result in orders-of-magnitude
biases in simulations of driven turbulence and in cosmological simulations of structure formation,
rendering the velocity field tracers inappropriate for these flows. We then discuss a novel implementation
of "Monte Carlo tracers", which are moved along with fluid cells, and are exchanged probabilistically
between them following the mass flux. This method reproduces the mass distribution of the fluid
correctly by construction, however it is more diffusive than the fluid itself. Nonetheless, we
show that this novel approach is more reliable and demonstrate that it is appropriate for following
hydrodynamical flows in mesh-based codes. The Monte Carlo tracers can also naturally be transferred
between fluid cells and other types of particles, such as stellar particles, so that the mass flow
in cosmological simulations can be followed in its entirety. Finally, we demonstrate a possible
use of the tracer particles by studying the thermodynamical history of the halo atmosphere in the
Santa Barbara Cluster.
