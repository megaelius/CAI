This paper investigates the influencing factors in passengers' multimodal traffic choice behaviors
and provides a decision-making basis and improvement strategies. By collecting large individual-level
data through a comprehensive field survey that was carried out at the major transportation hubs
in Xian City in China from the 1st to the 10th of March 2018, we compared 21 variables from the data with
four travel modes including air, high-speed rail (HSR), traditional passenger train, and express
bus. Among the variables, 12 variables were used as the independent variables after the correlation
analysis and the collinearity test, including age, car ownership, ticketing method, travel purpose,
travel distance, fare rate, inter-city travel time per hundred kilometers, safety, comfort, punctuality,
access time, and departure time. The regression relationships between the travel mode choice and
the independent variables were studied using Bayesian binomial logistic regression (BBL) and
Bayesian multiple logistic regression (BMNL). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
was applied to analyze the predictive performance of the regression models. The results show that
the area under curve (AUC) of the ROC curves for the air travel, high-speed train, passenger train,
and express bus using BMNL were 0.9785, 0.9263, 0.8614, and 0.9025, respectively. The AUC value
of the ROC curve of the express bus using BBL was 0.8797, which indicated that the passenger travel
choice models established by Bayesian logistic regressions had good prediction ability. The application
of Bayesian logistic regression in traffic mode choice is beneficial to enriching the assessments
of mode-choice behaviors, and the findings of this study can provide a basis for formulating traffic
management strategies in practice for shareholders and policymakers.
