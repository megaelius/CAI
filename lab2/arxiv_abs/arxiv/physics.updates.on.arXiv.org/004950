Our study provides the first experimental investigation of the internal flows of ventilated partial
cavitation (VPC) formed by air injection behind a backward-facing step. The experiments are conducted
using flow visualization and planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) with fog particles for two
different cavity regimes of VPC, i.e., open cavity (OC) and two-branch cavity (TBC), under various
range of free stream velocity (U) and ventilation rates (Q). Our experiments reveal similar flow
patterns for both OC and TBC, including forward flow region near the air-water interface, reverse
flow region, near-cavitator vortex, and internal flow circulation vortex. However, OC internal
flow exhibits highly unsteady internal flow features, while TBC internal flow shows laminar-like
flow patterns with a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability developed at the interface between forward
and reverse flow regions within the cavity. Internal flow patterns and the unsteadiness of OC resemble
those of turbulent flow separation past a backward-facing step (BFS flow), suggesting a strong
coupling of internal flow and turbulent external recirculation region for OC. Likewise, internal
flow patterns of TBC resemble those of laminar BFS flow, with the presence of unsteadiness due to
the strong velocity gradient across the forward-reverse flow interface. The variation of the internal
flow upon changing U or Q is further employed to explain the cavity regime transition and the corresponding
change of cavity geometry. Our study suggests that ventilation control can potentially stabilize
the cavity in the TBC regime by delaying its internal flow regime transition from laminar-like to
highly unsteady.
