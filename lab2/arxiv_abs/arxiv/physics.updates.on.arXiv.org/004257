In view of the large differences in the previous calculations of enhancement factors to the parity
and time-reversal violating (P,T-odd) electric dipole moment (EDM) of $^{225}$Ra due to nuclear
Schiff moment (NSM) and tensor-pseudotensor (T-PT) electron-nucleus (e-N) interactions between
the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory and other many-body methods, we employ the relativistic
normal coupled-cluster (RNCC) theory to explain the discrepancies. The normalization of the wave
function in the RNCC theory becomes unity by construction. This feature removes the ambiguity associated
with the uncertainties in calculations that could arise due to mismatch in cancellation of the normalization
factor of the wave function in a truncated RCC method. Moreover, all the terms in the expression for
EDM using the RNCC method naturally terminate, in contrast to the RCC approach. By taking an average
of the results from two variants each of both the RCC and RNCC methods, we recommend enhancement factors
to the EDM of 225Ra due to NSM as $-$6.29(1) $\times 10^{-17} |e| $cm $( |e| fm^3)$ and due to T-PT e-N
coupling constant as $-$12.66(14) $\times {10^{-20} \langle \sigma_N \rangle | e | }$cm, for the
nuclear Pauli spinor, $\sigma_N$. This is corroborated by analyzing the dipole polarizability
($\alpha_d$) value of $^{225}$Ra, which is obtained as 244(13) $ea_0^3$. We also compare our results
for all three properties with previous calculations that employ different many-body methods.
Our $\alpha_d$ value agrees very well with the results that are obtained by carrying out rigorous
analyses using other variants of RCC methods.
