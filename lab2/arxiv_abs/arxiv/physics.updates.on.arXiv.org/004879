Plate motion near the fault gouge layer, and the elastic interplay between the gouge layer and the
plate under stick-slip conditions, is key to understanding the dynamics of sheared granular fault
systems. Here, a two-dimensional implementation of the combined finite-discrete element method
(FDEM), which merges the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element method (DEM), is used
to explicitly to simulate a sheared granular fault system. We focus on investigating the influence
of normal load, driving shear velocity and plate stiffness on the velocities and displacements
measured at locations on the upper and lower plates just adjacent to the gouge in the direction parallel
to the shear direction (x direction). The simulations show that at slips the plate velocities are
proportional to the normal load and may be inversely proportional to the square root of the plate's
Young's modulus; whereas the driving shear velocity does not show distinct influence on the plate
velocities. During stick phases, the velocities of the upper and lower plates are respectively
slightly greater and slightly smaller than the half of the driving shear velocity, and are both in
the same direction of shear. The shear strain rate of the gouge is calculated from this velocity difference
between the upper and lower plate during stick phases and thus the gouge effective shear modulus
can be calculated. The results show that the gouge effective shear modulus increases proportionally
with normal load, while the influence of shear velocity and plate stiffness on gouge effective shear
modulus is minor. The simulations address the dynamics of a laboratory scale fault gouge system
and may help reveal the complexities of earthquake frictional dynamics.
