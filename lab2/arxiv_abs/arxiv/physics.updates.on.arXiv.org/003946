Purpose Study on curcumin dissolved in natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) was aimed at exploiting
their beneficial properties as drug carriers. Methods The concentration of dissolved curcumin
in NADES was measured. Simulated gastrointestinal fluids were used to determine the concentration
of curcumin and quantum chemistry computations were performed for clarifying the origin of curcumin
solubility enhancement in NADES. Results NADES comprising choline chloride and glycerol had the
highest potential for curcumin dissolution. This system was also successfully applied as an extraction
medium for obtaining curcuminoids from natural sources, as well as an effective stabilizer preventing
curcumin degradation from sunlight. The solubility of curcumin in simulated gastrointestinal
fluids revealed that the significant increase of bioavailability takes place in the small intestinal
fluid. Conclusions Suspension of curcumin in NADES offers beneficial properties of this new liquid
drug formulation starting from excreting from natural sources, through safe storage and ending
on the final administration route. Therefore, there is a possibility of using a one-step process
with this medium. The performed quantum chemistry computations clearly indicated the origin of
the enhanced solubility of curcumin in NADES in the presence of intestinal fluids. Direct intermolecular
contacts leading to hetero-molecular pairs with choline chloride and glycerol are responsible
for elevating the bulk concentration of curcumin. Choline chloride plays a dominant role in the
system and the complexes formed with curcumin are the most stable among all possible homo- and hetero-molecular
pairs that can be found in NADES-curcumin systems.
