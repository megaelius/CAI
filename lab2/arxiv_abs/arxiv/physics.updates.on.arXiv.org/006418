The rapid spread of COVID-19 in the United States has imposed a major threat to public health, the
real economy, and human well-being. With the absence of effective vaccines, the preventive actions
of social distancing and travel reduction are recognized as essential non-pharmacologic approaches
to control the spread of COVID-19. Prior studies demonstrated that human movement and mobility
drove the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 in China. Little is known, however, about the
patterns and effects of co-location reduction on cross-county transmission risk of COVID-19.
This study utilizes Facebook co-location data for all counties in the United States from March to
early May 2020. The analysis examines the synchronicity and time lag between travel reduction and
pandemic growth trajectory to evaluate the efficacy of social distancing in ceasing the population
co-location probabilities, and subsequently the growth in weekly new cases. The results show that
the mitigation effects of co-location reduction appear in the growth of weekly new cases with one
week of delay. Furthermore, significant segregation is found among different county groups which
are categorized based on numbers of cases. The results suggest that within-group co-location probabilities
remain stable, and social distancing policies primarily resulted in reduced cross-group co-location
probabilities (due to travel reduction from counties with large number of cases to counties with
low numbers of cases). These findings could have important practical implications for local governments
to inform their intervention measures for monitoring and reducing the spread of COVID-19, as well
as for adoption in future pandemics. Public policy, economic forecasting, and epidemic modeling
need to account for population co-location patterns in evaluating transmission risk of COVID-19
across counties.
