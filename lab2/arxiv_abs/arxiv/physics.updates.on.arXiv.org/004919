Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) is a catheter based image modality allowing
for high resolution imaging of vessels. It is based on a fast sequential acquisition of A-scans with
an axial spatial resolution in the range of 5 to 10 {\mu}m, i.e., one order of magnitude higher than
in conventional methods like intravascular ultrasound or computed tomography angiography. However,
position and orientation of the catheter in patient coordinates cannot be obtained from the IVOCT
measurements alone. Hence, the pose of the catheter needs to be established to correctly reconstruct
the three-dimensional vessel shape. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a three-dimensional tomographic,
tracer-based and radiation-free image modality providing high temporal resolution with unlimited
penetration depth. Volumetric MPI images are angiographic and hence suitable to complement IVOCT
as a co-modality. We study simultaneous bimodal IVOCT MPI imaging with the goal of estimating the
IVOCT pullback path based on the 3D MPI data. We present a setup to study and evaluate simultaneous
IVOCT and MPI image acquisition of differently shaped vessel phantoms. First, the infuence of the
MPI tracer concentration on the optical properties required for IVOCT is analyzed. Second, using
a concentration allowing for simultaneous imaging, IVOCT and MPI image data is acquired sequentially
and simultaneously. Third, the luminal centerline is established from the MPI image volumes and
used to estimate the catheter pullback trajectory for IVOCT image reconstruction. The image volumes
are compared to the known shape of the phantoms. We were able to identify a suitable MPI tracer concentration
of 2.5 mmol/L with negligible influence on the IVOCT signal. The pullback trajectory estimated
from MPI agrees well with the centerline of the phantoms. (...)
