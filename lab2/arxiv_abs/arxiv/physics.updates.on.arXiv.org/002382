Motivated by the importance of stratified shear flows in geophysical and environmental circumstances,
we characterize their energetics, mixing and spectral behavior through a series of direct numerical
simulations of turbulence generated by Holmboe wave instability (HWI) under various initial conditions.
We focus on circumstances where the stratification is sufficiently `strong' so that HWI is the dominant
primary instability of the flow. Our numerical findings demonstrate the emergence of self-organised
criticality (SOC) that is manifest as an adjustment of an appropriately defined gradient Richardson
number, $Ri_g$, associated with the horizontally-averaged mean flow, in such a way that it is continuously
attracted towards a critical value of $Ri_g \sim 1/4$. This self-organization occurs through a
continuously reinforced localisation of the `scouring' motions (i.e. `avalanches') that are
characteristic of the turbulence induced by the break down of Holmboe wave instabilities and are
developed on the upper and lower flanks of the sharply localized density interface, embedded within
a much more diffuse shear layer. These localised `avalanches' are also found to exhibit the expected
scale invariant characteristics. From an energetics perspective, the emergence of SOC is expressed
in the form of a long-lived turbulent flow that remains in a `quasi-equilibrium' state for an extended
period of time. Most importantly, the irreversible mixing that results from such self-organised
behavior appears to be characterized generically by a universal cumulative turbulent flux coefficient
of $\Gamma_c \sim 0.2$ only for turbulent flows engendered by Holmboe wave instability. The existence
of this self-organised critical state corroborates the original physical arguments associated
with self-regulation of stratified turbulent flows as involving a `kind of equilibrium' as described
by Turner (1973).
