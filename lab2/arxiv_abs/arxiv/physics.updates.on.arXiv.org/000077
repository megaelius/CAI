Confirmed cases during the early stage of the 2009 H1N1 pdm in various countries showed an age shift
between importations and local transmission cases, with adults mainly responsible for seeding
unaffected regions and children most frequently driving community outbreaks. We introduce a multi-host
stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically address the role of a heterogeneously
mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic.
We inform the model with statistics on demography, mixing and travel behavior for Europe and Mexico,
and calibrate it to the 2009 H1N1 pdm early outbreak. We varied model parameters to explore the invasion
conditions under different scenarios. We derive the expression for the global invasion potential
of the epidemic that depends on disease transmissibility, transportation network and mobility
features, demographic profile and mixing pattern. Highly assortative mixing favor the spatial
containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity
of adults vs. children. Heterogeneity of the mobility network topology and traffic flows strongly
favor the disease invasion, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demography
and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Results are compatible
with the H1N1 spatial spread observed. The work illustrates the importance of age-dependent mixing
profiles and mobility features in the study of the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging
influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for
a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of public
health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors.
