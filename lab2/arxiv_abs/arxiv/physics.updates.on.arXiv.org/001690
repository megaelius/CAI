We introduce in this study an algorithm for the imaging of faults and of slip fields on those faults.
The physics of this problem are modeled using the equations of linear elasticity. We define a regularized
functional to be minimized for building the image. We first prove that the minimum of that functional
converges to the unique solution of the related fault inverse problem. Due to inherent uncertainties
in measurements, rather than seeking a deterministic solution to the fault inverse problem, we
then consider a Bayesian approach. In this approach the geometry of the fault is assumed to be planar,
it can thus be modeled by a three dimensional random variable whose probability density has to be
determined knowing surface measurements. The randomness involved in the unknown slip is teased
out by assuming independence of the priors, and we show how the regularized error functional introduced
earlier can be used to recover the probability density of the geometry parameter. The advantage
of the Bayesian approach is that we obtain a way of quantifying uncertainties as part of our final
answer. On the downside, this approach leads to a very large computation since the slip is unknown.
To contend with the size of this computation we developed an algorithm for the numerical solution
to the stochastic minimization problem which can be easily implemented on a parallel multi-core
platform and we discuss techniques aimed at saving on computational time. After showing how this
algorithm performs on simulated data, we apply it to measured data. The data was recorded during
a slow slip event in Guerrero, Mexico.
