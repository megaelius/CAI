The perovskite oxides are known to be susceptible to structural distortions over a long wavelength
when compared to their parent cubic structures. From an ab initio simulation perspective, this
requires accurate calculations including many thousands of atoms; a task well beyond the remit
of traditional plane wave-based density functional theory (DFT). We suggest that this void can
be filled using the methodology implemented in the large-scale DFT code, CONQUEST, using a local
pseudoatomic orbital (PAO) basis. Whilst this basis has been tested before for some structural
and energetic properties, none have treated the most fundamental quantity to the theory, the charge
density $n(\mathbf{r})$ itself. An accurate description of $n(\mathbf{r})$ is vital to the perovskite
oxides due to the crucial role played by short-range restoring forces (characterised by bond covalency)
and long range coulomb forces as suggested by the soft-mode theory of Cochran and Anderson. We find
that modestly sized basis sets of PAOs can reproduce the plane-wave charge density to a total integrated
error of better than 0.5% and provide Bader partitioned ionic charges, volumes and average charge
densities to similar degree of accuracy. Further, the multi-mode antiferroelectric distortion
of PbZrO$_3$ and its associated energetics are reproduced by better than 99% when compared to plane-waves.
This work suggests that electronic structure calculations using efficient and compact basis sets
of pseudoatomic orbitals can achieve the same accuracy as high cutoff energy plane-wave calculations.
When paired with the CONQUEST code, calculations with high electronic and structural accuracy
can now be performed on many thousands of atoms, even on systems as delicate as the perovskite oxides.
