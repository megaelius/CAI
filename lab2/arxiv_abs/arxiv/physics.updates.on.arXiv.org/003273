This work presents a novel diagnostic tool for studying the thermodynamics of the climate systems
with a wide range of applications, from sensitivity studies to model tuning. It includes a number
of modules for assessing the internal energy budget, the hydrological cycle, the Lorenz Energy
Cycle and the material entropy production, respectively. The routine receives as inputs energy
fluxes at surface and at the Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA), for the computation of energy budgets at Top-of-Atmosphere
(TOA), at the surface, and in the atmosphere as a residual. Meridional enthalpy transports are also
computed from the divergence of the zonal mean energy budget fluxes; location and intensity of peaks
in the two hemispheres are then provided as outputs. Rainfall, snowfall and latent heat fluxes are
received as inputs for computing the water mass and latent energy budgets. If a land-sea mask is provided,
the required quantities are separately computed over continents and oceans. The diagnostic tool
also computes the Lorenz Energy Cycle (LEC) and its storage/conversion terms as annual mean global
and hemispheric values. In order to achieve this, one needs to provide as input three-dimensional
daily fields of horizontal wind velocity and temperature in the troposphere. Two methods have been
implemented for the computation of the material entropy production, one relying on the convergence
of radiative heat fluxes in the atmosphere (indirect method), one combining the irreversible processes
occurring in the climate system, particularly heat fluxes in the boundary layer, the hydrological
cycle and the kinetic energy dissipation as retrieved from the residuals of the LEC. A version of
the diagnostic tool is included in the Earth System Model eValuation Tool (ESMValTool) community
diagnostics, in order to assess the performances of soon available CMIP6 model simulations.
