Chimera state refers to coexistence of coherent and non-coherent phases in identically coupled
dynamical units found in various complex dynamical systems. Identification of Chimera, on one
hand is essential due to its applicability in various areas including neuroscience, and on other
hand is challenging due to its widely varied appearance in different systems and the peculiar nature
of its profile. Therefore, a simple yet universal method for its identification remains an open
problem. Here, we present a very distinctive approach using machine learning techniques to characterize
different dynamical phases and identify the chimera state from given spatial profiles generated
using various different models. The experimental results show that the performance of the classification
algorithms varies for different dynamical models. The machine learning algorithms, namely random
forest, oblique random forest based on tikhonov, parallel-axis split and null space regularization
achieved more than $96\% $ accuracy for the Kuramoto model. For the logistic-maps, random forest
and tikhonov regularization based oblique random forest showed more than $90\%$ accuracy, and
for the H\'enon-Map model, random forest, null-space and axis-parallel split regularization
based oblique random forest achieved more than $80\%$ accuracy. The oblique random forest with
null space regularization achieved consistent performance (more than $83\%$ accuracy) across
different dynamical models while the auto-encoder based random vector functional link neural
network showed relatively lower performance. This work provides a direction for employing machine
learning techniques to identify dynamical patterns arising in coupled non-linear units on large-scale,
and for characterizing complex spatio-temporal patterns in real-world systems for various applications.
