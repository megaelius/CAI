Traditional concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems utilize multijunction cells to minimize
thermalization losses, but cannot efficiently capture diffuse sunlight, which contributes to
a high levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and limits their use to geographical regions with high direct
sunlight insolation. Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) harness light generated by luminophores
embedded in a light-trapping waveguide to concentrate light onto smaller cells. LSCs can absorb
both direct and diffuse sunlight, and thus can operate as flat plate receivers at a fixed tilt and
with a conventional module form factor. However, current LSCs experience significant power loss
through parasitic luminophore absorption and incomplete light trapping by the optical waveguide.
Here we introduce a tandem LSC device architecture that overcomes both of these limitations, consisting
of a PLMA polymer layer with embedded CdSe/CdS quantum dot (QD) luminophores and InGaP micro-cells,
which serve as a high bandgap absorber on top of a conventional Si photovoltaic. We experimentally
synthesize CdSe/CdS QDs with exceptionally high quantum-yield (99%) and ultra-narrowband emission
optimally matched to fabricated III-V InGaP micro-cells. Using a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model,
we show the radiative limit power conversion efficiency for a module with these components to be
30.8% diffuse sunlight conditions. These results indicate that a tandem LSC-on-Si architecture
could significantly improve upon the efficiency of a conventional Si photovoltaic module with
simple and straightforward alterations of the module lamination steps of a Si photovoltaic manufacturing
process, with promise for widespread module deployment across diverse geographical regions and
energy markets.
