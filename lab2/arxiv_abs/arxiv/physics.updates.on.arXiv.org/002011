The purpose of this work was to obtain output correction factors for microDiamond and EFD-3G detectors
in very small (less than 5 mm) circular fields. We also investigated the impact of possible variations
in microDiamond detector design schematics on the calculated correction factors. Output factors
(OFs) of 6MV beams from TrueBeam linac collimated with 1.27-40mm diameter cones were measured with
EBT3 films, microDiamond and EFD-3G detectors as well as calculated (in water) using Monte Carlo
(MC) methods. Based on EBT3 measurements and MC calculations output correction factors were derived
for these detectors. MC calculations were performed for microDiamond detector in parallel and
perpendicular orientations relative to the beam axis. Furthermore, correction factors were calculated
for two microDiamond detector models, differing by the presence or absence of metallic pins. The
measured OFs agreed within 2.4% for fields $\geqslant$10mm. For the cones of 1.27, 2.46, and 3.77mm
maximum differences were 17.9, 1.8 and 9.0%, respectively. MC calculated output factors in water
agreed with those obtained using EBT3 film within 2.2% for all fields. MC calculated output correction
factors for microDiamond detector in fields $\geqslant$10mm ranged within 0.975-1.020 for perpendicular
and parallel orientations. MicroDiamond detector correction factors calculated for the 1.27,
2.46 and 3.77mm fields were 1.974, 1.139 and 0.982 with detector in parallel orientation, and these
factors were 1.150, 0.925 and 0.914 in perpendicular orientation. Including metallic pins in the
microDiamond model had little effect on calculated correction factors. EBT3 and MC obtained correction
factors agreed within 3.7% for fields of $\geqslant$3.77mm and within 5.9% for smaller cones. Including
metallic pins into the detector model is not necessary as their presence/absence had no effect on
calculated correction factors.
