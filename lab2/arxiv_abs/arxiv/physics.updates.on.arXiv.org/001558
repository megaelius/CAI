The effect of $\alpha$-particle irradiation on a NdFeAs(O,F) thin film has been investigated to
determine how the introduction of defects affects basic superconducting properties, including
the critical temperature $T_c$ and the upper critical field $H_{c2}$, and properties more of interest
for applications, like the critical current density $J_c$ and the related pinning landscape. The
irradiation-induced suppression of the film $T_c$ is significantly smaller than on a similarly
damaged single crystal. Moreover $H_{c2}$ behaves differently, depending on the field orientation:
for H//c the $H_{c2}$ slope monotonically increases with increasing disorder, whereas for H//ab
it remains constant at low dose and it increases only when the sample is highly disordered. This suggests
that a much higher damage level is necessary to drive the NdFeAs(O,F) thin film into the dirty limit.
Despite the increase in the low temperature $H_{c2}$, the effects on the $J_c$(H//c) performances
are moderate in the measured temperature and field ranges, with a shifting of the pinning force maximum
from 4.5 T to 6 T after an irradiation of $2\times10^{15} cm^{-2}$. On the contrary, $J_c$(H//ab)
is always suppressed. The analysis demonstrates that irradiation does introduce point defects
acting as pinning centres proportionally to the irradiation fluence but also suppresses the effectiveness
of c-axis correlated pinning present in the pristine sample. We estimate that significant performance
improvements may be possible at high field or at temperatures below 10 K. The suppression of the $J_c$(H//ab)
performance is not related to a decrease of the $J_c$ anisotropy as found in other superconductors.
Instead it is due to the presence of point defects that decrease the efficiency of the ab-plane intrinsic
pinning typical of materials with a layered structure.
