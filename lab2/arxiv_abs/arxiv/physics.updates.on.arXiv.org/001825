Viscoplastic deformation of metals is the result of motion and interaction of dislocations, line
defects of the crystalline structure. In the microstructural (physics-based) constitutive model
presented in this study, the main underlying microstructural processes influencing viscoplastic
deformation and mechanical properties of metals in cold and warm regimes are statistically described
by the introduced postulates/axioms of stochastic continuum dislocation dynamics (SCDD). Three
microstructural (internal) state variables (MSVs) are used for statistical quantifications
of different types/species of dislocations by the notion of dislocation density. Considering
the mobility property of dislocations, they are categorized to mobile and (relatively) immobile
dislocations. Mobile dislocations carry the plastic strain (rate), while immobile dislocations
contribute to plastic hardening. Moreover, with respect to their arrangement, dislocations are
classified to cell and wall dislocations. Cell dislocations are those that exist inside cells/subgrains,
and wall dislocations are packed in (and consequently formed) the subgrain walls/boundaries.
Therefore, the MSVs incorporated in this model are cell mobile, cell immobile and wall immobile
dislocation densities. The evolution of these internal variables is calculated by means of adequate
equations that characterize the dislocation processes dominating material behavior during cold
and warm monotonic viscoplastic deformation. The constitutive equations are then numerically
integrated; and the constitutive parameters are determined/fitted for a widely used ferritic-pearlitic
steel (20MnCr5).
