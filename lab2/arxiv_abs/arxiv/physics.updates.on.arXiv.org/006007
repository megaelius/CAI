Computer simulations of model systems are widely used to explore striking phenomena in promising
applications spanning from physics, chemistry, biology, to materials science and engineering.
The long range electrostatic interactions between charged particles constitute a prominent factor
in determining structures and states of model systems. How to efficiently calculate electrostatic
interactions in model systems subjected to partial or full periodic boundary conditions has been
a grand challenging task. In the past decades, a large variety of computational schemes have been
proposed, among which the Ewald summation method is the most reliable route to accurately deal with
electrostatic interactions in model systems. In addition, extensive effort has been done to improve
computational efficiency of the Ewald summation based methods. Representative examples are approaches
based on cutoffs, reaction fields, multi-poles, multi-grids, and particle-mesh schemes. We sketched
an ENUF method, an abbreviation for the Ewald summation method based on Non-Uniform fast Fourier
transform technique, and have implemented this method in particle-based simulation packages
to calculate electrostatic energies and forces at micro- and mesoscopic levels. Extensive computational
studies of conformational properties of polyelectrolytes, dendrimer-membrane complexes, and
ionic fluids demonstrated that the ENUF method and its derivatives conserve both energy and momentum
to floating point accuracy, and exhibit a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$
with optimal physical parameters. These ENUF based methods are attractive alternatives in molecular
simulations where high accuracy and efficiency of simulation methods are needed to accelerate
calculations of electrostatic interactions at extended spatiotemporal scales.
