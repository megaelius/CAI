Combined measurements of velocity components and temperature in a turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection flow at a low Prandtl number of $\mathit{Pr}= 0.029$ and Rayleigh numbers between $10^6
\le \mathit{Ra} \le 6 \times 10^7$ are conducted in a series of experiments with durations of more
than a thousand free-fall time units. Multiple crossing ultrasound beam lines and an array of thermocouples
at mid-height allow for a detailed analysis and characterization of the complex three-dimensional
dynamics of the single large-scale circulation (LSC) roll in the cylindrical convection cell of
unit aspect ratio which is filled with the liquid metal alloy GaInSn. We measure the internal temporal
correlations of the complex large-scale flow and distinguish between short-term oscillations
associated with a sloshing motion in the mid-plane as well as varying orientation angles of the velocity
close to the top/bottom plates and the slow azimuthal drift of the mean orientation of the roll as
a whole that proceeds on an up to a hundred times slower time scale. The coherent LSC drives a vigorous
turbulence in the whole cell that is quantified by direct Reynolds number measurements at different
locations in the cell. The velocity increment statistics in the bulk of the cell displays characteristic
properties of intermittent small-scale fluid turbulence. We also show that the impact of the symmetry-breaking
large-scale flow persists to small-scale velocity fluctuations thus preventing the establishment
of fully isotropic turbulence in the cell centre. Reynolds number amplitudes depend sensitively
on beam line position in the cell such that different definitions have to be compared. The global
momentum and heat transfer scalings with Rayleigh number are found to agree with those of direct
numerical simulations and other laboratory experiments.
