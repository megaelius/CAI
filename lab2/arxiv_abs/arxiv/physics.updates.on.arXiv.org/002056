In this paper we propose an efficient second order well balanced finite volume method for modeling
complex free surface flows at the aid of a simple diffuse interface method. The employed physical
model is a two-phase model derived from the Baer-Nunziato system for compressible multi-phase
flows. In particular, as proposed for the first time in Dumbser (2011), the number of equations is
reduced from seven to three by assuming that the relative pressure of the gas with respect to the atmospheric
reference pressure is zero, and that the gas momentum is negligible compared to the one of the liquid.
The two-phase model does not make any of the classical assumptions of shallow water type systems,
hence it does not neglect vertical accelerations and the free surface is not constraint to be a single-valued
function, so even complex shapes as those of breaking waves can be properly captured. The resulting
PDE system is solved by a novel well balanced path-conservative finite volume method on structured
Cartesian grids, which is able to preserve exactly the equilibrium states even in the presence of
obstacles. It furthermore automatically computes the location of the water-air interfaces, and
assures low numerical dissipation at the free surface thanks to a novel Osher-Romberg-type Riemann
solver. Finally, high computational performance is guaranteed by an efficient parallel implementation
on a GPU-based platform that reaches the efficiency of twenty million of volumes processed per seconds
and makes it possible to employ even very fine meshes. The validation of our new well balanced scheme
is carried out by comparing the obtained numerical results against existing analytical, numerical
and experimental reference solutions for a large number of test cases, among which oscillating
elliptical drops, dambreak problems, breaking waves, over topping weir flows, and wave impact
problems.
