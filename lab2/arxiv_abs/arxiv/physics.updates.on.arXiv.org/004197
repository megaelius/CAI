Debate continues on the amount and distribution of radioactive heat producing elements (i.e.,
U, Th, and K) in the Earth, with estimates for mantle heat production varying by an order of magnitude.
Constraints on the bulk-silicate Earth's (BSE) radiogenic power also places constraints on overall
BSE composition. Geoneutrino detection is a direct measure of the Earth's decay rate of Th and U.
The geoneutrino signal has contributions from the local ($\sim$40$\%$) and global ($\sim$35$\%$)
continental lithosphere and the underlying inaccessible mantle ($\sim$25$\%$). Geophysical
models are combined with geochemical datasets to predict the geoneutrino signal at current and
future geoneutrino detectors. We propagated uncertainties, both chemical and physical, through
Monte Carlo methods. Estimated total signal uncertainties are on the order of $\sim$20$\%$, proportionally
with geophysical and geochemical inputs contributing $\sim$30$\%$ and $\sim$70$\%$, respectively.
We find that estimated signals, calculated using CRUST2.0, CRUST1.0, and LITHO1.0, are within
physical uncertainty of each other, suggesting that the choice of underlying geophysical model
will not change results significantly, but will shift the central value by up to $\sim$15$\%$, depending
on the crustal model and detector location. Similarly, we see no significant difference between
calculated layer abundances and bulk-crustal heat production when using these geophysical models.
The bulk crustal heat production is calculated as $7 \pm2$~terrawatts, which includes an increase
of 1~TW in uncertainty relative to previous studies. Future improvements, including uncertainty
attribution and near-field modeling, are discussed.
