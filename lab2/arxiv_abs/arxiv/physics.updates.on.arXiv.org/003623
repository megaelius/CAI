A procedure of testing the $f(R)$-theory of gravity is discussed. The latter is an extension of the
general theory of relativity (GR). In order this extended theory (in some variant) to be really confirmed
as a more precise theory it must be tested. To do that we first have to solve an equation generalizing
Einstein's equation in the GR. However, solving this generalized Einstein's equation is often
very hard, even it is impossible in general to find an exact solution. It is why the perturbation method
for solving this equation is used. In a recent work \cite{Ky:2018fer} a perturbation method was
applied to the $f(R)$-theory of gravity in a central gravitational field which is a good approximation
in many circumstances. There, perturbative solutions were found for a general form and some special
forms of $f(R)$. These solutions may allow us to test an $f(R)$-theory of gravity by calculating
some quantities which can be verified later by the experiment (observation). In \cite{Ky:2018fer}
an illustration was made on the case $f(R)=R+\lambda R^2$. For this case, in the present article,
the orbital precession of S2 orbiting around Sgr A* is calculated in a higher-order of approximation.
The $f(R)$-theory of gravity should be also tested for other variants of $f(R)$ not considered yet
in \cite{Ky:2018fer}. Here, several representative variants are considered and in each case the
orbital precession is calculated for the Sun--Mercury- and the Sgr A*--S2 gravitational systems
so that it can be compared with the value observed by a (future) experiment. Following the same method
of \cite{Ky:2018fer} a light bending angle for an $f(R)$ model in a central gravitational field
can be also calculated and it could be a useful exercise.
