The nonlinear responses of different materials provide useful mechanisms for optical switching,
low noise amplification, and harmonic frequency generation. However, the nonlinear processes
usually have an extremely weak nature and require high input power to be excited. To alleviate this
severe limitation, we propose new designs of ultrathin nonlinear metasurfaces composed of patterned
graphene micro-ribbons to significantly enhance third harmonic generation (THG) at far-infrared
and terahertz (THz) frequencies. The incident wave is tightly confined and significantly boosted
along the surface of graphene in these configurations due to the excitation of highly localized
plasmons. The bandwidth of the resonant response becomes narrower due to the introduction of a metallic
substrate below the graphene micro-ribbons, which leads to zero transmission and standing waves
inside the intermediate dielectric spacer layer. The enhancement of the incident field, combined
with the large nonlinear conductivity of graphene, can dramatically increase the THG conversion
efficiency by several orders of magnitude. In addition, the resonant frequency of the metasurface
can be adjusted by dynamically tuning the Fermi energy of graphene via electrical or chemical doping.
As a result, the third harmonic generated wave can be optimized and tuned to be emitted at different
frequencies without the need to change the nonlinear metasurface geometry. The proposed nonlinear
metasurfaces provide a new way to realize compact and efficient nonlinear sources at the far-infrared
and THz frequency ranges, as well as new frequency generation and wave mixing devices which are expected
to be useful for nonlinear THz spectroscopy and noninvasive THz imaging applications.
