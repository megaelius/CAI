The standard model of the universe is further completed back in time before inflation in agreement
with observations, classical-quantum gravity duality and quantum space-time. Quantum vacuum
energy bends the space-time and produces a constant curvature de Sitter background. We link de Sitter
universe and the cosmological constant to the (classical and quantum) harmonic oscillator. Quantum
discrete cosmological levels are found: size, time, vacuum energy, Hubble constant and gravitational
(Gibbons-Hawking) entropy from the very early trans-planckian vacuum to the classical today vacuum
energy. For each level $n = 0, 1, 2,...$, the two: post and pre (trans)-planckian phases are covered:
In the post-planckian universe, the levels (in planck units) are: Hubble constant $H_{n} = {1}/\sqrt{(2n
+ 1)}$, vacuum energy $\Lambda_{n} = 1/(2n + 1)$, entropy $S_n = (2n + 1)$. As $n$ increases, radius,
mass and $S_n$ increase, $H_n$ and $\Lambda_n$ decrease and {\it consistently} the universe {\it
classicalizes}. In the pre-planckian (trans-planckian) phase, the quantum levels are: $H_{Qn}
= \sqrt{(2n + 1)},\; \Lambda_{Qn} = (2n + 1)/1,\; S_{Qn} = 1/(2n + 1)$, $Q$ denoting quantum. The $n$-levels
cover {\it all} scales from the far past highest excited trans-planckian level $n = 10^{122}$ with
finite curvature, $\Lambda_Q = 10^{122}$ and minimum entropy $S_Q = 10^{-122}$, $n$ decreases
till the planck level $(n = 0)$ and enters the post-planckian phase e.g: $n = 1, 2,...,n_{inflation}
= 10^{12},... ,n_{cmb} = 10^{114},...,n_{reoin} = 10^{118},...,n_{today} = 10^{122}$ with the
most classical value $H_{today} = 10^{-61}$, $\Lambda_{today} = 10^{-122}$, $S_{today} = 10^{122}$.
We implement the Snyder-Yang algebra in this context yielding a consistent group-theory realization
of quantum discrete de Sitter space-time, classical-quantum gravity duality symmetry and a clarifying
unifying picture.(Abridged)
