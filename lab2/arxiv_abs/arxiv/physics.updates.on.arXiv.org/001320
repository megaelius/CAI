T cell receptors (TCRs) bind foreign or self-peptides attached to major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) molecules, and the strength of this interaction determines T cell activation. Optimizing
the ability of T cells to recognize a diversity of foreign peptides yet be tolerant of self-peptides
is crucial for the adaptive immune system to properly function. This is achieved by selection of
T cells in the thymus, where immature T cells expressing unique, stochastically generated TCRs
interact with a large number of self-peptide-MHC; if a TCR does not bind strongly enough to any self-peptide-MHC,
or too strongly with at least one self-peptide-MHC, the T cell dies. Past theoretical work cast thymic
selection as an extreme value problem, and characterized the statistical enrichment or depletion
of amino acids in the post-selection TCR repertoire, showing how T cells are selected to be able to
specifically recognize peptides derived from diverse pathogens, yet have limited self-reactivity.
Here, we investigate how the degree of enrichment is modified by nonuniform contacts that a TCR makes
with peptide-MHC. Specifically, we were motivated by recent experiments showing that amino acids
at certain positions of a TCR sequence have large effects on thymic selection outcomes, and crystal
structure data that reveal a nonuniform contact profile between a TCR and its peptide-MHC ligand.
Using a representative TCR contact profile as an illustration, we show via simulations that the
degree of enrichment now varies by position according to the contact profile, and, importantly,
it depends on the implementation of nonuniform contacts during thymic selection. We explain these
nontrivial results analytically. Our study has implications for understanding the selection
forces that shape the functionality of the post-selection TCR repertoire.
