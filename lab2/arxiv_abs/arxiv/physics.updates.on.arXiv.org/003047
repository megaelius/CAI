Remote sensing observations indicate that Europa is surrounded by a tenuous atmosphere. Furthermore,
recent observations and historic data from Galileo hint at the occurrence of water vapour eruptions
originating from the interior that create 200 km high plumes. Due to the lack of adequate measurements
large uncertainties exist in the properties of Europa's atmosphere (e.g. loss rate and structure)
and plumes (e.g. structure, source location, duration), of the latter one the existence is not even
confirmed. Unexploited opportunities to constrain properties of the atmosphere or plumes remain
in the in-situ data collected by the Galileo mission, the only mission that has surveyed Europa from
close by. In this thesis, I investigate how to constrain the properties (density, scale height)
of Europa's tenuous atmosphere and plumes, using data from the Galileo in-situ particle detector
instruments (PLS, EPD). I simulate the depletion of energetic protons and oxygen ions measured
during the E12 flyby. A Monte Carlo particle tracing method is used to simulate the particle trajectories
and determine where they are depleted: at the surface or in the atmosphere. The simulations show
that the depletions of energetic ions observed in the range 80 to 540 keV can be explained by charge
exchange with neutral atmospheric particles, but not by impact on the surface alone. This suggests
that an atmosphere must have been present during the E12 flyby. The simulations best represent the
sublimated component of the atmosphere and favour higher surface densities than the literature,
but are not sensitive to the scale height. Furthermore, an additional depletion is visible very
briefly in the energetic protons with energies from 540 to 1040 keV. This feature could be consistent
with localized losses from a Europa plume, although such a solution is not unique.
