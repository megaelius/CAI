We present a detailed description and verification of a discontinuous Galerkin finite element
method (DG) for the multi-component chemically reacting compressible Navier-Stokes equations
that retains the desirable properties of DG, namely discrete conservation and high-order accuracy
in smooth regions of the flow. Pressure equilibrium between adjacent elements is maintained through
the consistent evaluation of the thermodynamics model and the resulting weak form, as well as the
proper choice of nodal basis. As such, the discretization does not generate unphysical pressure
oscillations in smooth regions of the flow or at material interfaces where the temperature is continuous.
Additionally, we present an hp-adaptive DG method for solving systems of ordinary differential
equations, DGODE, which is used to resolve the temporal evolution of the species concentrations
due to stiff chemical reactions. The coupled solver is applied to several challenging test problems
including multi-component shocked flows as well as chemically reacting detonations, deflagrations,
and shear flows with detailed kinetics. We demonstrate that the discretization does not produce
unphysical pressure oscillations and, when applicable, we verify that it maintains discrete conservation.
The solver is also shown to reproduce the expected temperature and species profiles throughout
a detonation as well as the expected two-dimensional cellular detonation structure. We also demonstrate
that the solver can produce accurate, high-order, approximations of temperature and species profiles
without artificial stabilization for the case of a one-dimensional pre-mixed flame. Finally,
high-order solutions of two- and three-dimensional multi-component chemically reacting shear
flows, computed without any additional stabilization, are presented.
