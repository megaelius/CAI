Natural philosophy necessarily combines the process of scientific observation with an abstract
(and usually symbolic) framework, which provides a logical structure to the development of a scientific
theory. The metaphysical underpinning of science includes statements about the process of science
itself, and the nature of both the philosophical and material objects involved in a scientific investigation.
By developing a formalism for an abstract mathematical description of inherently non-mathematical,
physical objects, an attempt is made to clarify the mechanisms and implications of the philosophical
tool of Ansatz. Outcomes of the analysis include a possible explanation for the philosophical issue
of the 'unreasonable effectiveness' of mathematics as raised by Wigner, and an investigation into
formal definitions of the terms: principles, evidence, existence and universes that are consistent
with the conventions used in physics. It is found that the formalism places restrictions on the mathematical
properties of objects that represent the tools and terms mentioned above. This allows one to make
testable predictions regarding physics itself (where the nature of the tools of investigation
is now entirely abstract) just as scientific theories make predictions about the universe at hand.
That is, the mathematical structure of objects defined within the new formalism has philosophical
consequences (via logical arguments) that lead to profound insights into the nature of the universe,
which may serve to guide the course of future investigations in science and philosophy, and precipitate
inspiring new avenues of research.
