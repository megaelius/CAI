We discuss the Brownian thermal noise which affects the cantilever dynamics of a dAFM (dynamic atomic
force microscope), both when it works in air and in presence of water. Our scope is to accurately describe
the cantilever dynamics, and to get this result we deeply investigate the relationship between
the cantilever thermal fluctuations and its interactions with the surrounding liquid. We present
a relatively simple and very easy-to-use analytical model to describe the interaction forces between
the liquid and the cantilever. The novelty of this approach is that, under the assumption of small
cantilever oscillations, by using the superposition principle we found a very simple integral
expression to describe fluid-cantilever interactions. More specifically we note that, beside
including fluid inertia and viscosity (which is common to many existing models in the literature)
an additional diffisivity term needs to be considered, whose crucial influence for the correct
evaluation of the cantilever response to the thermal excitation is shown in the present paper. The
coefficients of our model are obtained by using numerical results for a 2D fluid flow around a vibrating
rectangular cross-section, and depend on the distance from the wall. This allowed us to completely
characterize the dynamics of a dAFM cantilever also when it operates in tilted conditions. We validate
the analytical model by comparing our results with numerical and experimental dAFM data previously
presented in literature, and with experiments carried out by ourselves. We show that we can provide
extremely accurate prediction of the beam response up and beyond the second resonant peak.
