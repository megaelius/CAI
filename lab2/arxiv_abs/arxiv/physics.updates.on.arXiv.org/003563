Classical physics has enabled the acquisition of significant knowledge of the physical properties
of nature on a standard macroscopic scale. These achievements were driven by use of the causal ontological
approach (proposed originally by Aristotle) to formulate models of physical reality. At the beginning
of the 20th century, however, the physics community began to prefer models based on a fundamentally
different approach to human knowledge. Copenhagen quantum mechanics (CQM) was used to describe
the micro-world. The special theory of relativity was used to describe the kinematics of objects
moving at high velocity values in both the macroscopic and microscopic regions. This phenomenological
approach to knowledge has been more focused on how things appear - instead of their actual properties
and causal sequence. In the middle of the 20th century, the causal ontological approach was used
to develop a significant scientific advance: the systematization of fundamental strongly interacting
particles on the basis of unified algebra in three-dimensional isotopic spin space for spin values
1, 1/2, and 0. However, it was later strongly deformed under the influence of the phenomenological
approach and the quark model. This paper will show that practically all contemporary theoretical
models of physical reality contain mistakes or unresolved problems. Further scientific progress
can be obtained if (and only if) scientists return to the successful causal ontological approach
and falsification. Classical physics may be slightly generalized to enable the description of
inertia mass increase in dependence on velocity, replacing the relativity theory and CQM. New assumptions
may then be employed using generalized classical physics (GCP) to formulate new descriptions of
observed phenomena that were previously inaccurately interpreted and used to promote fundamentally
inadequate theories.
