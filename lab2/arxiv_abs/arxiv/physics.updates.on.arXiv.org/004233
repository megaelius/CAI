Current global warming is causing significant changes in snowfall in polar regions, directly impacting
the mass balance of the ice caps. The only water supply on Antarctica, precipitation, is poorly estimated
from surface measurements over Antarctica. The onboard cloud-profiling radar of the CloudSat
satellite provided the first real opportunity to estimate precipitation at continental scale.
Based on CloudSat observations, we propose to explore the vertical structure of precipitation
in Antarctica over the 2007-2010 period. A first division of this dataset following a topographical
approach (continent versus peripheral regions, with a 2250 m topographical criterion) shows a
high precipitation rate (275 mm/yr at 1200 meters above ground level) with low relative seasonal
variation (+/-11%) over the peripheral areas. Over the plateau, the precipitation rate is low (34
mm/yr at 1200 m.a.g.l.) with a much larger relative seasonal variation (+/-143%). A second study
that follows a geographical division highlights the average vertical structure of precipitation
and temperature depending on the regions and their interactions with the topography. In particular,
over ice-shelves, we see a strong dependence of the distribution of precipitation on sea-ice coverage.
Finally, the relationship between precipitation and temperature is analyzed and compared with
a simple analytical relationship. This study highlights that precipitation is largely dependent
on the advection of air masses along the topographic slopes with an average vertical wind of 0.02
m/s . This provides new diagnostics to evaluate climate models with a three-dimensional approach
of the atmospheric structure of precipitation.
