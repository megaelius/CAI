The present study reports on the bio-organic composition of a deep-sea venting hydrothermal system
originating from arc volcanism; the origin of the particulates in hydrothermal fluids from the
Suiyo Seamount in the southern Izu-Bonin (Ogasawara) Arc is discussed with regard to amino compounds.
Chimney samples on deep-sea hydrothermal systems and core samples at Suiyo Seamount were determined
for amino acids, and occasionally amino sugars. Two types of chimney samples were obtained from
active hydrothermal systems by submersible vehicles: one was natural chimney (NC) on a hydrothermal
natural vent; the other was artificial chimneys (AC), mainly formed by the growth and deposition
of sulfide-rich particulate components in a Kuwabara-type in situ incubator (KI incubator). Total
hydrolyzed amino acids (THAA) and hydrolyzed hexosamines (HA) in AC ranged from 10.7 nmol/g to 64.0
nmol/g and from 0 nmol/g to 8.1 nmol/g, respectively, while THAA in hydrothermally altered core
samples ranged from 26.0 nmol/g to 107.4 nmol/g-rock. The THAA was thus of the same order of magnitude
in AC and core samples. The representative biochemical indicator ratios of {\beta}-alanine/aspartic
acid and {\gamma}-aminobutyric acid/glutamic acid were low. This is consistent with a large microbial
population and labile subterranean biogenic organic compounds. A micro energy dispersive X-ray
spectrometer ({\mu}EDX) was used to show that the formation of massive pyrite- and chalcopyrite-ores,
the major matrixes of the natural chimney structures, were processed during hydrothermal activity.
These data suggest that labile particulate organic matter (POM) and/or dissolved organic matter
(DOM) from hydrothermal fluid were continuously trapped to form concentrated organic matter in
a sulfide-rich matrix.
