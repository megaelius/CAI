The physics of critical phenomena in a many-body system far from thermal equilibrium is an interesting
and important issue to be addressed both experimentally and theoretically. The trapped cold atoms
have been actively used as a clean and versatile simulator for classical and quantum-mechanical
systems, deepening understanding of the many-body physics behind. Here we review the nonlinear
and collective dynamics in a periodically modulated magneto-optically trapped cold atoms. By
temporally modulating the intensity of the trapping lasers with the controlled phases, one can
realize two kinds of nonlinear oscillators, the parametrically driven oscillator and the resonantly
driven Duffing oscillator, which exhibit the dynamical bistable states. Cold atoms behave not
only as the single-particle nonlinear oscillators, but also as the coupled oscillators by the light-induced
inter-atomic interaction, which leads to the phase transitions far from equilibrium in a way similar
to the phase transition in equilibrium. The parametrically driven cold atoms show the ideal mean-field
symmetry-breaking transition, and the symmetry is broken with respect to time translation by the
modulation period. Such a phase transition results from the cooperation and competition between
the inter-particle interaction and the fluctuations, which lead to the nonlinear switching of
atoms between the vibrational states, and the experimentally measured critical characteristics
prove it as the ideal mean-field transition class. On the other hand, the resonantly driven cold
atoms that possess the coexisting periodic attractors exhibit the kinetic phase transition analogous
to the discontinuous gas-liquid phase transition in equilibrium, and interestingly the global
interaction between atoms causes the shift of the phase-transition boundary.
