We numerically and experimentally investigate evaporation of a sessile droplet on a heated substrate.
We develop a finite element (FE) model in two-dimensional axisymmetric coordinates to solve coupled
transport of heat in the droplet and substrate, and of the mass of liquid vapor in surrounding ambient
while assuming diffusion-limited, quasi-steady evaporation of the droplet. The two-way coupling
is implemented using an iterative scheme and under-relaxation is used to ensure numerical stability.
The FE model is validated against the published spatial profile of the evaporation mass flux and
temperature of the liquid-gas interface. We discuss cases in which the two-way coupling is significantly
accurate than the one-way coupling. In experiments, we visualized side view of an evaporating microliter
water droplet using a high-speed camera at different substrate temperatures and recorded temperature
of the liquid-gas interface from the top using an infrared camera. We examine the dependency of inversion
of the temperature profile across the liquid-gas interface on the ratio of the substrate thickness
to the wetted radius, the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the substrate to that of the droplet
and contact angle. A comparison of measured evaporation mass rate with the computed values at different
substrate temperature show that the evaporation mass rate increases non-linearly with respect
to the substrate temperature, and FE model predicts these values close to the experimental data.
Comparisons of time-averaged evaporation mass rate obtained by the previous and present models
against the measurements suggest that the evaporative cooling at the interface and variation of
diffusion coefficient with temperature should be taken into account in the model in order to accurately
capture the measurements.
