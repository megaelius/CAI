The flow inside a fluid damper where a piston reciprocates sinusoidally inside an outer casing containing
high-viscosity silicone oil is simulated using a Finite Volume method, at various excitation frequencies.
The oil is modelled by the Carreau-Yasuda (CY) and Phan-Thien \& Tanner (PTT) constitutive equations.
Both models account for shear-thinning but only the PTT model accounts for elasticity. The CY and
other generalised Newtonian models have been previously used in theoretical studies of fluid dampers,
but the present study is the first to perform full two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations
employing a viscoelastic constitutive equation. It is found that the CY and PTT predictions are
similar when the excitation frequency is low, but at medium and higher frequencies the CY model fails
to describe important phenomena that are predicted by the PTT model and observed in experimental
studies found in the literature, such as the hysteresis of the force-displacement and force-velocity
loops. Elastic effects are quantified by applying a decomposition of the damper force into elastic
and viscous components, inspired from LAOS (Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear) theory. The CY
model also overestimates the damper force relative to the PTT, because it underpredicts the flow
development length inside the piston-cylinder gap. It is thus concluded that (a) fluid elasticity
must be accounted for and (b) theoretical approaches that rely on the assumption of one-dimensional
flow in the piston-cylinder gap are of limited accuracy, even if they account for fluid viscoelasticity.
The consequences of using lower-viscosity silicone oil are also briefly examined.
