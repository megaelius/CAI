The multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis of time series is able to reveal the presence of
long-range correlations and, at the same time, to characterize the self-similarity of the series.
The rich information derivable from the characteristic exponents and the multifractal spectrum
can be further analyzed to discover important insights about the underlying dynamical process.
In this paper, we employ multifractal analysis techniques in the study of protein contact networks.
To this end, initially a network is mapped to three different time series, each of which is generated
by a stationary unbiased random walk. To capture the peculiarities of the networks at different
levels, we accordingly consider three observables at each vertex: the degree, the clustering coefficient,
and the closeness centrality. To compare the results with suitable references, we consider also
instances of three well-known network models and two typical time series with pure monofractal
and multifractal properties. The first result of notable interest is that time series associated
to proteins contact networks exhibit long-range correlations (strong persistence), which are
consistent with signals in-between the typical monofractal and multifractal behavior. Successively,
a suitable embedding of the multifractal spectra allows to focus on ensemble properties, which
in turn gives us the possibility to make further observations regarding the considered networks.
In particular, we highlight the different role that small and large fluctuations of the considered
observables play in the characterization of the network topology.
