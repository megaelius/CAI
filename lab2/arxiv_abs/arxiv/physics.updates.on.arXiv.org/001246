A formulation of the shallow water equations adapted to general complex terrains is proposed. Its
derivation starts from the observation that the typical approach of depth integrating the Navier-Stokes
equations along the direction of gravity forces is not exact in the general case of a tilted curved
bottom. We claim that an integration path that better adapts to the shallow water hypotheses follows
the "cross-flow" surface, i.e., a surface that is normal to the velocity field at any point of the
domain. Because of the implicitness of this definition, we approximate this "cross-flow" path
by performing depth integration along a local direction normal to the bottom surface, and propose
a rigorous derivation of this approximation and its numerical solution as an essential step for
the future development of the full "cross-flow" integration procedure. We start by defining a local
coordinate system, anchored on the bottom surface to derive a covariant form of the Navier-Stokes
equations. Depth integration along the local normals yields a covariant version of the shallow
water equations, which is characterized by flux functions and source terms that vary in space because
of the surface metric coefficients and related derivatives. The proposed model is discretized
with a first order FORCE-type Godunov Finite Volume scheme that allows implementation of spatially
variable fluxes. We investigate the validity of our SW model and the effects of the bottom geometry
by means of three synthetic test cases that exhibit non negligible slopes and surface curvatures.
The results show the importance of taking into consideration bottom geometry even for relatively
mild and slowly varying curvatures.
