Concept of determinism has had many transformations throughout the history of physics, and it has
been so influential in this field. However, with the growth of quantum physics, determinism became
a scientific "dilemma" and has created many challenges in various contemporary sciences. If this
concept is understood correctly, many misconceptions corresponding to it in natural sciences,
especially physics can be removed. The aim of this paper is to investigate this concept analytically
to solve the existing problems. To do this, first we consider the terminology of determinism including
characteristic, necessary connection, and exact prediction. Then, William James definition
of determinism, Laplacian determinism, Popper definition of determinism, causal determinism,
logical determinism, epistemic determinism, metaphysical determinism, and theological determinism
are introduced. After which, we pay attention to different kinds of determinism including global/local
domain, complete/incomplete form, and the main factor in the formation of events. In the next step,
it is discussed that although determinism had been vague and causal in ancient Greece, it has become
global and theological in middle Ages. In classical physics, it took a complete and universal form.
Laplace provided the most complete picture of determinism. Because of some philosophical ideas,
determinism changed into a different concept in quantum mechanics. Copenhagen school physicists,
especially Bohr, regarded "determinism" as a problem and an undesirable element. It is shown that
determinism is a complex subject with a number of aspects and characteristics which cannot be set
aside from the science. The final result is that determinism cannot be denied in the science; in particular,
the quantum mechanics is a deterministic theory but in an incomplete or local manner.
