For sinus diseases, targeted delivery at diseased sinonasal sites is essential to improve efficacy
of topical sprays as a nasal therapeutic. Considering that ostiomeatal complex (OMC) is the mucociliary
drainage pathway and airflow exchange corridor between the main airway and the frontal, maxillary,
and anterior ethmoid sinuses, we have identified sprayer techniques that are more effective in
targeting OMC, along with the sinus cavities. Nasal airflow and drug transport were numerically
simulated in five CT-based sinonasal airway reconstructions, drawn from pre-operative chronic
rhinosinusitis patients. In each digital model, we applied two different spray orientations at
5-mm insertion: (a) package insert-based direction - an upright spray axis with subject-head inclined
slightly forward (22.5 degrees), (b) line-of-sight (LoS) - with spray axis directed at OMC and through
centroid of visible OMC's projection on the view-plane for best OMC-sighting. LoS protocol registered
an average 8-fold higher targeted delivery, with the finding supported by both parametric t-test
and non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. Simulated dose in two representative models was
validated by in vitro spray experiments in 3D-printed replicas. Finally, observational LoS scores,
based on how much of OMC was visible from nostrils, correlated well with the ratio of the projected
area of the OMC on the nostril plane to the area of the nostril plane itself. While these CFD-based
findings can eventually translate into new personalized spray usage instructions and change the
standard-of-care for nasal treatments, this study also demonstrates how use of relatively simple
engineering tools can "revolutionize" everyday healthcare.
