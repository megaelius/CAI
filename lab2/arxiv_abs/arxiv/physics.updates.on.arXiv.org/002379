Photoionization cross sections, photoelectron angular-asymmetry parameters and photoionization
time delays for $A$@C$_{60}$ endohedral atoms are studied with account for both the individual
and combined effects of dipole static polarization (DSP) of C$_{60}$ by the outgoing photoelectron,
interior static polarization (ISP) of C$_{60}$ by the ion-remainder, $A^{+}$, and atomic-core
relaxation of the encapsulated atom upon its ionization. It is unraveled that the DSP effect is weak;
it changes the phase of confinement-resonant oscillations in $\sigma_{n\ell}$, $\beta_{n\ell}$
and $\tau_{n\ell}$ without generally noticeable changes in their magnitudes, unless $\sigma_{n\ell}$
concentrates a relatively large part of oscillator strength of the continuum spectrum near threshold.
This is counter-intuitive in view of a large dipole static polarizability of C$_{60}$, $\alpha
> 800$ $a.u.$. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the DSP effect results in the transmission of
a part of oscillator strength of the continuum spectrum of $A$@C$_{60}$ into its discrete spectrum.
It is shown that the DSP effect is counteracted by ISP. Possible reasons behind the made findings
are provided. Photoionization of Xe@C$_{60}$, Ne@C$_{60}$, H@C$_{60}$ and some hypothetical
C$^{-}_{60}$ fullerene anions is chosen as a case study. For Xe@C$_{60}$, the role of atomic-core
relaxation of the ionized encapsuled Xe$^{+}$-ion-remainder on the $\rm 4d$ photoionization
of Xe@C$_{60}$ is revealed to be of utter significance, as in free Xe. The random phase approximation
with exchange (RPAE) and generalized RPAE were used in the study. The C$_{60}$ cage is modelled by
a spherical attractive potential of a certain inner radius, thickness and depth. Its dipole static
polarization potential is approximated by the Bates dipole static potential.
