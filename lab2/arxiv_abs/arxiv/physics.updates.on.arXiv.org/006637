Binding and phase behavior of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes and surfactants were studied
in aqueous bulk solutions and at air-water interfaces. In particular, we have investigated the
polyanion poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (NaPSS) and the cationic surfactants dodecyltrimethylammonium
bromide (C$_{12}$TAB), tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C$_{14}$TAB) and cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (C$_{16}$TAB). In order to reveal surfactant/polyelectrolyte binding, aggregation
and phase separation of the mixtures, we have varied the NaPSS concentration systematically and
have kept the surfactants concentration fixed. Information on the behavior in the bulk solution
was gained by electrophoretic mobility and turbidity measurements, while the surface properties
were interrogated with surface tension and sum-frequency generation (SFG). This has enabled us
to relate bulk to interfacial properties with respect to the charging state and the surfactants'
binding efficiency. We found that the latter two are strongly dependent on the alkyl chain length
of the surfactant and that binding is much more efficient as the alkyl chain length of the surfactant
increases. This also results in a different phase behavior as shown by turbidity measurements of
the bulk solutions. Charge neutral aggregates that are forming in the bulk ad-sorb to the air-water
interface, an effect that is likely caused by the increased hydrophobicity of C$_\text{n}$TAB/PSS
complexes. This conclusion is corroborated by SFG spectroscopy, where we observe a decrease in
the intensity of OH stretching bands, which is indicative for a decrease in surface charging and
the formation of interfaces with negligible net charge. Particularly at mixing ratios that are
in the equilibrium two-phase region, we observe weak OH intensities and thus surface charging.
