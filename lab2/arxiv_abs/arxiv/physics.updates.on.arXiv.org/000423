The Convected Scheme (CS) is a `forward-trajectory' semi-Lagrangian method for solution of transport
equations, which has been most often applied to the kinetic description of plasmas and rarefied
neutral gases. In its simplest form, the CS propagates the solution by advecting the `moving cells'
along their characteristic trajectories, and by remapping them on the mesh at the end of the time
step. The CS is conservative, positivity preserving, simple to implement, and not subject to time
step restriction to maintain stability. Recently [Y. G\"u\c{c}l\"u and W.N.G. Hitchon, 2012]
a new methodology was introduced for reducing numerical diffusion, based on a modified equation
analysis: the remapping error was compensated by applying small corrections to the final position
of the moving cells prior to remapping. While the spatial accuracy was increased from 2nd to 4th order,
the new scheme retained the important properties of the original method, and was shown to be simple
and efficient for constant advection problems. Here the CS is applied to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson
system: the Vlasov equation is split into two constant advection equations, one in configuration
space and one in velocity space, and high order time accuracy is achieved by proper composition of
the operators. The splitting procedure enables us to use the constant advection solver, which we
extend to arbitrarily high order of accuracy: a new improved procedure is given, which makes the
calculation of the corrections straightforward. Focusing on periodic domains, we describe a spectrally
accurate scheme based on the fast Fourier transform; the proposed implementation is strictly conservative
and positivity preserving. The ability to correctly reproduce the system dynamics, as well as resolving
small-scale features in the solution, is shown in classical 1D-1V test cases, both in the linear
and the non-linear regimes.
