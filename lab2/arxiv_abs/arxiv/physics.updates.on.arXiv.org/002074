We present an experimental setup to demonstrate normal modes and symmetry breaking in a two-dimensional
pendulum. In our experiment we have used two modes of a single oscillator to demonstrate normal modes,
as opposed to two single oscillators used in standard setups of two-dimensional pendulums. Breaking
of the cylindrical symmetry of the pendulum is achieved by attaching a spring in the suspension.
This leads to interesting visual patterns in the motion, wherein the plane of the oscillator shifts
with time, the motion then becomes elliptical, shifts back again to planar, before finally returning
to planar motion in the original plane. The symmetry breaking leads to non-degenerate normal modes
of oscillation, whose interplay gives rise to the observed motion patterns. This also explains
why for a real pendulum, the plane of motion always shifts, unlike the ideal two-dimensional pendulum
where the plane of oscillation is supposed to remain fixed. This curious fact also contributes to
the difficulties involved in building a Foucault's pendulum, where the plane of rotation due to
Coriolis force needs to be accurately measured. The strength of the symmetry breaking in our system
can be quantified by a parameter the "return time", which is defined as the time over which the pendulum
returns to its original motion pattern. We propose this setup as a pedagogical tool to introduce
the concepts of normal modes and symmetry breaking in a physics laboratory. The motion patterns
that emerge have a high visual impact and we have also described in detail the quantitative observations
can be made with this setup.
