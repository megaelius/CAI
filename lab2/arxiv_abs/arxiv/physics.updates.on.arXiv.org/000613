The activation of a $K^+$ channel sensor in two sequential stages during a voltage clamp may be described
as the translocation of a Brownian particle in an energy landscape with two large barriers between
states. A solution of the Smoluchowski equation for a square-well approximation to the potential
function of the S4 voltage sensor satisfies a master equation, and has two frequencies that may be
determined from the forward and backward rate functions. When the higher frequency terms have small
amplitude, the solution reduces to the relaxation of a rate equation, where the derived two-state
rate functions are dependent on the relative magnitude of the forward rates ($\alpha$ and $\gamma$)
and the backward rates ($\beta$ and $\delta$) for each stage. In particular, the voltage dependence
of the Hodgkin-Huxley rate functions for a $K^+$ channel may be derived by assuming that the rate
functions of the first stage are large relative to those of the second stage - $\alpha \gg \gamma $
and $\beta \gg \delta$. For a {\em Shaker} IR $K^+$ channel, the first forward and backward transitions
are rate limiting ($\alpha < \gamma $ and $\delta \ll \beta$), and for an activation process with
either two or three stages, the derived two-state rate functions also have a voltage dependence
that is of a similar form to that determined for the squid axon. The potential variation generated
by the interaction between a two-stage $K^+$ ion channel and a noninactivating $Na^+$ ion channel
is determined by the master equation for $K^+$ ion channel activation and the ionic current equation
when the $Na^+$ ion channel activation time is small, and if $\beta \ll \delta $ and $\alpha \ll \gamma
$, the system may exhibit a small amplitude oscillation between spikes, or mixed-mode oscillation.
