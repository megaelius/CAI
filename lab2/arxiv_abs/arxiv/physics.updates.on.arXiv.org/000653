Magnetic reconnection (MR) is a key physical concept explaining the addition of magnetic flux to
the magnetotail and closed flux lines back-motion to the dayside magnetosphere. This scenario
elaborated by \citet{dung63}, can explain many aspects of solar wind-magnetosphere interaction
processes, including substorms. However, neither the Dungey model nor its numerous modifications
were able to explain fully the onset conditions for MR in the tail. In this paper, we introduce new
onset conditions for forced MR in the tail. We call our scenario the "windsock memory conditioned
ram pressure effect". Our non-flux-transfer associated forcing is introduced by a combination
of large-scale windsock motions exhibiting memory effects and solar wind dynamic pressure actions
on the nightside magnetopause during northward oriented IMF. Using global MHD GUMICS-4 simulation
results, upstream data from WIND, magnetosheath data from Cluster-1 and distant-tail data from
the two-probe ARTEMIS mission, we show that the simultaneous occurrence of vertical windsock motions
of the magnetotail and enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure introduces strong nightside disturbances,
including enhanced electric fields and persistent vertical cross-tail shear flows. These perturbations,
associated with a stream interaction region in the solar wind, drive MR in the tail during episodes
of northward oriented interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We detect MR indirectly, observing
plasmoids in the tail and ground based signatures of Earthward moving fast flows. We also consider
the application to solar system planets and close-in exoplanets, where the proposed scenario can
elucidate some new aspects of solar/stellar wind - magnetosphere interactions.
