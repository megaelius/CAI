{This paper is a comparison of the Minkowski, Einstein and Einstein dual theories of relativity.
The dual is based on an identity relating the observer time and the proper time as a contact transformation
on configuration space, which leaves phase space invariant. The theory is dual in that, for a system
of $n$ particles, any inertial observer has two unique sets of global variables $({\bf{X}}, t)$
and $({\bf{X}}, \tau)$ to describe the dynamics. Where ${\bf{X}}$ is the (unique) canonical center
of mass. In the $({\bf{X}}, t)$ variables, time is relative and the speed of light is unique, while
in the $({\bf{X}}, \tau)$ variables, time is unique and the speed of light is relative with no upper
bound. The two sets of particle and Maxwell field equations are mathematically equivalent, but
the particle wave equations are not. The dual version contains an additional longitudinal radiation
term that appears instantaneously with acceleration, does not depend on the nature of the force
and the Wheeler-Feynman absorption hypothesis is a corollary. The homogenous and isotropic nature
of the universe is sufficient to prove that a unique definition of Newtonian time exists with zero
set at the big bang. The isotopic dual of $\R$ is used to improve the big bang model, by providing an
explanation for the lack of antimatter in our universe, a natural arrow for time, conservation of
energy, momentum and angular momentum. This also solves the flatness and horizon problems without
inflation. We predict that radiation from a betatron (of any frequency) will not produce photoelectrons,
that matter and antimatter are gravitationally repulsive and that data from distant sources does
not have a unique physical interpretation. We provide a table showing the differences between the
Minkowski, Einstein and dual versions of the special theory.}
