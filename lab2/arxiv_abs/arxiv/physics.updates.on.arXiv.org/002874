Instability of stratified multi-phase flow in a rotating platform becomes important because of
a potential role in micro-mixing and micro-machines. Centrifugal actuation can play an important
role in driving the flow and Coriolis force can enhance the mixing in a short span by destabilizing
the flow. In this study, we focus on the impact of the Coriolis force on a rotating viscosity-stratified
flow with a thin diffusive mixed layer between two fluid layers. Modal stability analysis is used
to estimate the critical parameters, namely Rotation number, Reynolds number, and wave number,
which are responsible to modulate the instability mechanism for different viscosity contrasts.
Present study explores competing influences of rotational forces against the viscous and inertial
forces. Correspondingly, rotational direction (clockwise/anticlockwise) shows a significant
effect on the spatio-temporal instability mechanism and anticlockwise rotation promotes the
instability. Usually, miscible viscosity stratified flow with respect to streamwise disturbance
becomes more unstable for a thinner mixed layer. On the contrary, our numerical computation confirms
a completely contrasting scenario, considering Coriolis force driven instability of a miscible
system on account of spanwise disturbances. Possible physical mechanisms for the same are discussed
in terms of base flow and energy fluctuation among perturbed and base flow. Comparison of two and
three-dimensional instability is done to give a clear-cut idea about the linear instability of
the flow system considered herein. Velocity and viscosity perturbation distributions display
a critical bonding between the vortices near and away from mixed layer, which may be responsible
for the variation of instability with respect to viscosity ratio and rotational direction.
