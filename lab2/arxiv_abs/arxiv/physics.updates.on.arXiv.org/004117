We present a numerical scheme for solving an inverse problem for parameter estimation in tumor growth
models for glioblastomas, a form of aggressive primary brain tumor. The growth model is a reaction-diffusion
partial differential equation (PDE) for the tumor concentration. We use a PDE-constrained optimization
formulation for the inverse problem. The unknown parameters are the reaction coefficient (proliferation),
the diffusion coefficient (infiltration), and the initial condition field for the tumor PDE. Segmentation
of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans from a single time snapshot drive the inverse problem
where segmented tumor regions serve as partial observations of the tumor concentration. The precise
time relative to tumor initiation is unknown, which poses an additional difficulty for inversion.
We perform a frozen-coefficient spectral analysis and show that the inverse problem is severely
ill-posed. We introduce a biophysically motivated regularization on the tumor initial condition.
In particular, we assume that the tumor starts at a few locations (enforced with a sparsity constraint)
and that the initial condition magnitude in the maximum norm equals one. We solve the resulting optimization
problem using an inexact quasi-Newton method combined with a compressive sampling algorithm for
the sparsity constraint. Our implementation uses PETSc and AccFFT libraries. We conduct numerical
experiments on synthetic and clinical images to highlight the improved performance of our solver
over an existing solver that uses a two-norm regularization for the calibration parameters. The
existing solver is unable to localize the initial condition. Our new solver can localize the initial
condition and recover infiltration and proliferation. In clinical datasets (for which the ground
truth is unknown), our solver results in qualitatively different solutions compared to the existing
solver.
