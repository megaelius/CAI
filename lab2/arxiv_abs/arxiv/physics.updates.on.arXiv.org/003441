Background: The deep inspiration breath hold technique (DIBH) is widely used for left-sided breast
radiotherapy (RT), in order to reduce the dose to the heart and the risk of cardiotoxicity. The volumetric
arc therapy (VMAT) technique increases the dose conformity to the planning target volume (PTV).
We hereby describe the procedure of combining VMAT and DIBH without a dedicated equipment, and report
a dosimetric study related on our implemented technique. Methods: The DIBH technique is based on
voluntary breath hold of the patient which is controlled by a laser on tattoo marks. Patients were
selected depending their ability to breath hold for 25s, and VMAT plans were optimized with an arrangement
of 4 arcs with a maximum delivery time of 20s each. A retrospective dosimetric study was undertaken
on 30 patients treated with this technique: 10 received local (whole breast) RT (L-RT) with a simultaneous
integrated boost (SIB), 10 a locoregional (LR)RT of the chestwall, 10 a LR RT of the whole breast with
SIB. For these patients, their DIBH-VMAT treatment plans were compared to free breathing (FB) VMAT
plans, and dose characteristics of PTV and organs at risk (OAR) were evaluated. Results: The PTV
coverage was identical among plans under DIBH or FB. The mean heart dose was reduced from 2.8+/-0.9Gy
in FB to 1.8+/-0.6Gy in DIBH for local RT, and reduced from 3.4+/-1.3Gy in FB to 2.2+/-0.5Gy in DIBH
for LR-RT. The ipsilateral mean lung dose was reduced by a factor of 12% for LR-RT, but remained unchanged
for L-RT with DIBH-VMAT compared to FB treatment. No significant differences were observed in the
mean dose of contra-lateral organs with either DIBH or FB VMAT techniques. Conclusion: The VMAT-DIBH
technique performed without a dedicated breath hold equipment, provided important dose reductions
at the heart, while preserving the ipsilateral lung and contralateral normal tissues.
