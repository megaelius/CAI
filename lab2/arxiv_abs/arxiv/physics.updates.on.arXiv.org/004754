This paper describes the total energy formulation of the compressible reacting Navier-Stokes
equations which is solved numerically using a fully conservative discontinuous Galerkin finite
element method (DG). Previous applications of DG to the compressible reacting Navier-Stokes equations
required nonconservative fluxes or stabilization methods in order to suppress unphysical oscillations
in pressure that led to the failure of simple test cases. In this paper, we demonstrate that material
interfaces with a temperature discontinuity result in numerical unphysical pressure oscillations
if the species internal energy is nonlinear with respect to temperature. We demonstrate that a temperature
discontinuity is the only type of material interface that results in unphysical pressure oscillations
for a conservative discretization of the total energy formulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that unphysical pressure oscillations will be generated at any material interface, including
material interfaces with at which the temperature is continuous, if the thermodynamics are frozen
during the temporal integration of the conserved state. Additionally, we demonstrate that the
oscillations are amplified if the specific heat at constant pressure is incorrectly evaluated
directly from the NASA polynomial expressions. Instead, the mean value, which we derive in this
manuscript, should be used to compute the specific heat at constant pressure. This can reduce the
amplitude of, but not prevent, unphysical oscillations where the species concentrations numerically
mix. We then present solutions to several test cases using the total energy formulation and demonstrate
spurious pressure oscillations were not generated for material interfaces if the temperature
is continuous and that it is better behaved than frozen thermodynamic formulations if the temperature
is discontinuous.
