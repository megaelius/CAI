We report designs and simulations of nonvolatile photonic switches for emerging optical communication
window around 2 $\mu$m wavelength. The switches are designed making use of CMOS compatible ${Ge}_2{Sb}_2{Te}_5$
phase change material embedded with in the silicon-on-insulator strip waveguide. The wavelength
of operation is 2.1 $\mu$m. In a 1 x 1 waveguide switch, active material ${Ge}_2{Sb}_2{Te}_5$ is
substituted in partially and fully etched silicon region of the waveguides. By optimizing the dimensions
of active region, we show that a 1 x 1 switch of only 920 nm in active length can exhibit high extinction
ratio of 34.04 dB when phase of ${Ge}_2{Sb}_2{Te}_5$ is altered from amorphous to crystalline and
low insertion loss of 0.49 dB in ON state. The second device is a two waveguide 1 x 2 directional coupler
switch where one of the silicon waveguides is partially etched and substituted with a 20 nm thick
${Ge}_2{Sb}_2{Te}_5$ in etched silicon region. The altering of ${Ge}_2{Sb}_2{Te}_5$ phases
allows switching of the propagating mode from bar state to cross state and vice-versa. Simulations
results show that the directional coupler switch has an extinction ratio of 18.59 dB with insertion
loss of 1.90 dB for cross state. Device state is changed by injecting voltage pulses into the active
region of the waveguide through the indium-tin-oxide electrodes deposited on top of the active
region. Due to its nonvolatile nature, ${Ge}_2{Sb}_2{Te}_5$ consumes energy only during the phase
transformation, and hence the energy consumption for the devices is of the order of sub nJ which is
lower than the volatile electro-optical and all-optical switches.
