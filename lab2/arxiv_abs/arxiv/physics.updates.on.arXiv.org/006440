This article discussesl a few of the problems that arise in geophysical fluid dynamics and climate
that are associated with the presence of moisture in the air, its condensation and release of latent
heat. Our main focus is Earth's atmosphere but we also discuss how these problems might manifest
themselves on other planetary bodies, with particular attention to Titan where methane takes on
the role of water. GFD has traditionally been concerned with understanding the very basic problems
that lie at the foundation of dynamical meteorology and ocean\-ography. Conventionally, and a
little ironically, the subject mainly considers `dry' fluids, meaning it does not concern itself
overly much with phase changes. The subject is often regarded as dry in another way, because it does
not consider problems perceived as relevant to the real world, such as clouds or rainfall, which
have typically been the province of complicated numerical models. Those models often rely on parameterizations
of unresolved processes, parameterizations that may work very well but that often have a semi-empirical
basis. The consequent dichotomy between the foundations and the applications prevents progress
being made that has both a secure basis in scientific understanding and a relevance to the Earth's
climate, especially where moisture is concerned. The dichotomy also inhibits progress in understanding
the climate of other planets, where observations are insufficient to tune the parameterizations
that weather and climate models for Earth rely upon, and a more fundamental approach is called for.
Here we discuss four diverse examples of the problems with moisture: the determination of relative
humidity and cloudiness; the transport of water vapor and its possible change under global warming;
the moist shallow water equations and the Madden-Julian Oscillation; and the hydrology cycle on
other planetary bodies.
