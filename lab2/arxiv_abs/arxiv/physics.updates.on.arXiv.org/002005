Schizophrenia, a mental disorder that is characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure
to distinguish one's own thoughts and ideas from reality, has been associated with structural abnormalities
in the architecture of functional brain networks. Using various methods from network analysis,
we examine the effect of two classical therapeutic antipsychotics --- Aripiprazole and Sulpiride
--- on the structure of functional brain networks of healthy controls and patients who have been
diagnosed with schizophrenia. We compare the community structures of functional brain networks
of different individuals using mesoscopic response functions, which measure how community structure
changes across different scales of a network. We are able to do a reasonably good job of distinguishing
patients from controls, and we are most successful at this task on people who have been treated with
Aripiprazole. We demonstrate that this increased separation between patients and controls is
related only to a change in the control group, as the functional brain networks of the patient group
appear to be predominantly unaffected by this drug. This suggests that Aripiprazole has a significant
and measurable effect on community structure in healthy individuals but not in individuals who
are diagnosed with schizophrenia. In contrast, we find for individuals are given the drug Sulpiride
that it is more difficult to separate the networks of patients from those of controls. Overall, we
observe differences in the effects of the drugs (and a placebo) on community structure in patients
and controls and also that this effect differs across groups. We thereby demonstrate that different
types of antipsychotic drugs selectively affect mesoscale structures of brain networks, providing
support that mesoscale structures such as communities are meaningful functional units in the brain.
