Direct Numerical Simulation data obtained earlier from two statistically 1D, planar, fully-developed,
weakly turbulent, single-step-chemistry, premixed flames characterized by two significantly
different (7.53 and 2.50) density ratios {\sigma} are analyzed to explore the influence of combustion-induced
thermal expansion on the turbulence and the backward influence of such flow perturbations on the
reaction-zone surface. For this purpose, the simulated velocity fields are decomposed into solenoidal
and potential velocity subfields. The approach is justified by the fact that results obtained adopting
(i) a widely used orthogonal Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition and (ii) a recently introduced natural
decomposition are close in the largest part of the computational domain (including the entire mean
flame brushes) except for narrow zones near the inlet and outlet boundaries. The results show that
combustion-induced thermal expansion can significantly change turbulent flow of unburned mixture
upstream of a premixed flame by generating potential velocity fluctuations. Within the flame brush,
the potential and solenoidal velocity fields are negatively (positively) correlated in unburned
reactants (burned products, respectively) provided that {\sigma}=7.53. Moreover, correlation
between strain rates generated by the solenoidal and potential velocity fields and conditioned
to the reaction zone is positive (negative) in the leading (trailing, respectively) halves of the
mean flame brushes. Furthermore, the potential strain rate correlates negatively with the curvature
of the reaction zone, whereas the solenoidal strain rate and the curvature are negatively (positively)
correlated in the leading (trailing, respectively) halves of the mean flame brushes.
