Scale invariance, collective behaviours and structural reorganization are crucial for portfolio
management (portfolio composition, hedging, alternative definition of risk, etc.). This lack
of any characteristic scale and such elaborated behaviours find their origin in the theory of complex
systems. There are several mechanisms which generate scale invariance but maximum entropy models
are able to explain both scale invariance and collective behaviours. The study of the structure
and collective modes of financial markets attracts more and more attention. It has been shown that
some agent based models are able to reproduce some stylized facts. Despite their partial success,
there is still the problem of rules design. In this work, we used a statistical inverse approach to
model the structure and co-movements in financial markets. Inverse models restrict the number
of assumptions. We found that a pairwise maximum entropy model is consistent with the data and is
able to describe the complex structure of financial systems. We considered the existence of a critical
state which is linked to how the market processes information, how it responds to exogenous inputs
and how its structure changes. The considered data sets did not reveal a persistent critical state
but rather oscillations between order and disorder. In this framework, we also showed that the collective
modes are mostly dominated by pairwise co-movements and that univariate models are not good candidates
to model crashes. The analysis also suggests a genuine adaptive process since both the maximum variance
of the log-likelihood and the accuracy of the predictive scheme vary through time. This approach
may provide some clue to crash precursors and may provide highlights on how a shock spreads in a financial
network and if it will lead to a crash. The natural continuation of the present work could be the study
of such a mechanism.
