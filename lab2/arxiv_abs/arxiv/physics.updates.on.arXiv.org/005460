Systematic variation of the pre-disruption core electron temperature (Te) from 1 to 12 keV using
an internal transport barrier scenario reveals a dramatic increase in the production of seed runaway
electrons (REs), ultimately accessing near-complete conversion of the pre-disruption current
into sub-MeV RE current. Injected Ar pellets are observed to ablate more intensely and promptly
as Te rises. At high Te, the observed ablation exceeds predictions from published thermal ablation
models. Simultaneously, the thermal quench (TQ) is observed to significantly shorten with increasing
Te -- a surprising result. While the reason for the shorter TQ is not yet understood, candidate mechanisms
include: insufficiently accurate thermal ablation models, enhanced ablation driven by the seed
RE population, or significant parallel heat transport along stochastic fields. Kinetic modeling
that self-consistently treats the plasma cooling via radiation, the induced electric field, and
the formation of the seed RE is performed. Including the combined effect of the inherent dependence
of hot-tail RE seeding on Te together with the shortened TQ, modeling recovers the progression towards
near-complete conversion of the pre-disruption current to RE current as Te rises. Measurement
of the HXR spectrum during the early current quench (CQ) reveals a trend of decreasing energy with
pre-disruption Te. At the very highest Te ($\approx$ 12 keV), $\approx$ 100% conversion of the thermal
current to runaway current is found. The energy of this peculiar RE beam is inferred to be sub-MeV
as it emits vanishingly few MeV hard X-rays (HXRs). These measurements demonstrate novel TQ dynamics
as Te is varied and illustrate the limitations of treating the RE seed formation problem without
considering the inter-related dependencies of the pellet ablation, radiative energy loss, and
resultant variations of the TQ duration.
