The Eulerian variational principle is applied to derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson-Amp\`{e}re
system of equations which are represented in a general coordinate system. The invariance of the
action integral under an arbitrary spatial coordinate transformation is used to obtain the momentum
conservation law and the symmetric pressure in a more direct way than using the translational and
rotational symmetries of the system. Next, the Eulerian variational principle is used to derive
the collisionless drift kinetic equation, where particles' phase-space trajectories in given
electromagnetic fields are described by Littlejohn's guiding center equations~[R. G. Littlejohn,
J. Plasma Phys.\ {\bf 29}, 111 (1983)]. Then, it is shown that, in comparison with the conventional
moment method, the invariance under a general spatial coordinate transformation yields a more
convenient way to obtain the momentum balance as a three-dimensional vector equation in which the
symmetric pressure tensor, the Lorentz force, and the magnetization current are properly expressed.
Furthermore, the Eulerian formulation is presented for the extended drift kinetic system, for
which, in addition to the drift kinetic equations for the distribution functions of all particle
species, the quasineutrality condition and Amp\`{e}re's law are derived to determine the self-consistent
electromagnetic fields. Again, the momentum conservation law for the extended system is derived
from the invariance under the general spatial coordinate transformation. Besides, the momentum
balances are investigated for the cases where the collision and/or external source terms are added
into the Vlasov and drift kinetic equations.
