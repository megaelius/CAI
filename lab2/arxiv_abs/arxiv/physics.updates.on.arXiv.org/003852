Diagnostic imaging procedure using ionizing radiation has been growing due to its enormous benefits.
However, using ionizing radiation is also associated with harmful biological effects. Therefore
it is important to take consideration on harmful effects of ionizing radiation and have adequate
awareness on the area, in order to protect people without limiting the benefits. In Ethiopia, the
status of radiation protection practices have not been studied previously, which remain nearly
unknown especially around the study area. Thus, in filing this gap the present study initiated to
assess status of implementation of radiation protection system. General observation, questionnaire
and dose rate measurements were used to get all necessary data for the study. The dose rate measurements
at control room (CR), waiting room (WR) and inside X-ray room (XR) were carried out using well calibrated
Thermo FH 40 G-L10 survey meter. The results of the general observation and the questionnaire showed
poor practice of radiation protection system. The dose rate recordings from CR and WR, when the X-ray
machine being switched on or off are within permissible allowed value at all hospitals. XR machine
off measurements at two locations are also within the range allowed value. However, XR machine on
recordings shows a high level of radiation. This causes very high level unnecessary exposure situation
for helper as a result of poor practices of radiation protection system which intern extremely increases
the population dose. Therefore there is a great need of radiation protection agency activity at
all Hospitals. Considering this scenario we suggest continuous training programs for radiographers;
all Hospitals must full fill more modern radiation protection monitoring equipment and should
have radiation protection advisers to monitor the radiation protection practices.
