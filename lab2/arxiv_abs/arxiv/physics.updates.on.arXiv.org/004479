We present a direct comparison between interface-resolved and one-way-coupled point-particle
direct numerical simulations (DNS) of gravity-free turbulent channel flow laden with small inertial
particles, with high particle-to-fluid density ratio and diameter of about $3$ viscous units.
The most dilute flow considered, solid volume fraction $O(10^{-5})$, shows the particle feedback
on the flow to be negligible, whereas differences with respect to the unladen case, noteworthy a
drag increase of about $10\%$, are found for a volume fraction $O(10^{-4})$. This is attributed
to a dense layer of particles at the wall, caused by turbophoresis, flowing with large particle-to-fluid
apparent slip velocity. The most dilute case is therefore taken as the benchmark for accessing the
validity of a widely-used point-particle model, where the particle dynamics results only from
inertial and non-linear drag forces. In the bulk of the channel, the first and second-order moments
of the particle velocity from the point-particle DNS agree well with those from the interface-resolved
DNS. Close to the wall, however, most of the statistics show major qualitative differences. We show
that this difference originates from the strong shear-induced lift force acting on the particles
in the near wall region. This mechanism is well captured by the lift force model due to Saffman (1965),
while other widely-used, more elaborate, approaches aiming at extending the lift model for a wider
range of particle Reynolds numbers can actually under-predict the magnitude of the near-wall particle
velocity fluctuations for the cases here analysed.
