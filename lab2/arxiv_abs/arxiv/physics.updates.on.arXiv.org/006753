This work reports on the production of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) in water solution based upon two-phase
pulsed laser procedure for ophthalmological therapeutic approaches. In this case, the AgNPs should
be less then 10 nm and have a narrow size distribution. Nanoparticles of this sized-scale are capable
to penetrate the complex ocular barriers, ensuring effective non-invasive drug delivery to retina.
In the first phase, AgNPs larger than 20 nm were fabricated via laser ablation of a Ag target under
water by irradiation with a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm generated by a Nd:YAG laser. During
the second phase, to reduce the mean size of the as-obtained nanoparticles and properly adjust the
size distribution, the water colloids were additionally irradiated by ultraviolet harmonics
(355 nm and 266 nm) from the same laser source. The effect of the key laser parameters - wavelength,
fluence and laser exposure time - upon the nanoparticles morphology was studied. The most suitable
post-ablation treatment of initial colloids was obtained by consecutive irradiation with the
third (355 nm) and the fourth (266 nm) harmonics of the fundamental laser wavelength. By using this
approach synergistic effect between two mechanisms of light absorption by AgNPs was induced. As
a result contaminant-free colloids of AgNPs with a size inferior to 10 nm and a quite narrow size distribution
with a standard deviation of 1.6 nm were fabricated. The toxic effect of the as-produced AgNPs on
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans was explored. The most efficient
action was reached against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Potential application
of the synthesized AgNPs colloidal aqueous solutions with antimicrobial action as a non-invasive
method for ocular infections prevention and treatment was proposed.
