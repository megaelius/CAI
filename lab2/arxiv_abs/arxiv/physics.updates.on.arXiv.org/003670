The flows around a NACA 0018 airfoil at a Reynolds number of 10250 and angles of attack of alpha = 0 (A0)
and alpha = 10 (A10) are modelled using resolvent analysis and limited experimental measurements
obtained from particle image velocimetry. The experimental mean velocity profiles are data-assimilated
so that they are solutions of the incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations forced
by Reynolds stress terms which are derived from experimental data. Spectral proper orthogonal
decompositions (SPOD) of the velocity fluctuations and nonlinear forcing find low-rank behaviour
at the shedding frequency and its higher harmonics for the A0 case. In the A10 case, low-rank behaviour
is observed for the velocity fluctuations in two bands of frequencies. Resolvent analysis of the
data-assimilated means identifies low-rank behaviour only in the vicinity of the shedding frequency
for A0 and none of its harmonics. The resolvent operator for the A10 case, on the other hand, identifies
two linear mechanisms whose frequencies are a close match with those identified by SPOD. It is also
shown that the second linear mechanism, corresponding to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in
the shear layer, cannot be identified just by considering the time-averaged experimental measurements
as a mean flow due to the fact that experimental data are missing near the leading edge. The A0 case
is classified as an oscillator where the flow is organised around an intrinsic instability while
the A10 case behaves like an amplifier whose forcing is unstructured. For both cases, resolvent
modes resemble those from SPOD when the operator is low-rank. To model the higher harmonics where
this is not the case, we add parasitic resolvent modes, as opposed to classical resolvent modes which
are the most amplified, by approximating the nonlinear forcing from limited triadic interactions
of known resolvent modes.
