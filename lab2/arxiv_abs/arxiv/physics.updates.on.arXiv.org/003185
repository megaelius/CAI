This paper presents an efficient high-order sharp-interface method for solving the three-dimensional
(3D) Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on a nonuniform Cartesian grid with irregular
domain boundaries. The new approach is based on the combination of the fourth-order compact finite
difference scheme and the preconditioned stabilized biconjugate-gradient (BiCGSTAB) method.
Contrary to the original immersed interface method by LeVeque and Li [1], the new method does not
require jump corrections, instead, the (regular) compact finite difference stencil is adjusted
at the irregular grid points (in the vicinity of the interfaces of the immersed bodies) to obtain
a solution that is sharp across the interface while keeping the fourth-order global accuracy. The
contribution of the present work is the design of a fourth-order-accurate 3D Poisson solver whose
accuracy and efficiency does not deteriorate in the presence of an immersed boundary. This is attributed
to (i) the modification of the discrete operators near immersed boundaries does not lead to a wide
grid stencil due to the compact nature of the discretization and (ii) a preconditioning technique
whose efficiency and cost are independent of the complexity of the geometry and the presence or not
of an immersed boundary. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated and validated over a range of problems including smooth and irregular boundaries.
The test cases show that the new method is fourth-order accurate in the maximum norm whether an immersed
boundary is present or not, on uniform or nonuniform grids. Furthermore, the efficiency of the preconditioned
BiCGSTAB is demonstrated with regard to convergence rate and `extra' floating-point operation
($FLOP_{extra}$) which is due to the presence of immersed boundaries.
