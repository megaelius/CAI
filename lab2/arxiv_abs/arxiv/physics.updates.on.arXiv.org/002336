Dramatic raising of Deep Learning (DL) approach and its capability in biomedical applications
lead us to explore the advantages of using DL for sleep Apnea-Hypopnea severity classification.
To reduce the complexity of clinical diagnosis using Polysomnography (PSG), which is multiple
sensing platform, we incorporates our proposed DL scheme into one single Airflow (AF) sensing signal
(subset of PSG). Seventeen features have been extracted from AF and then fed into Deep Neural Networks
to classify in two studies. First, we proposed a binary classifications which use the cutoff indices
at AHI = 5, 15 and 30 events/hour. Second, the multiple Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (SAHS) severity
classification was proposed to classify patients into 4 groups including no SAHS, mild SAHS, moderate
SAHS, and severe SAHS. For methods evaluation, we used a higher number of patients than related works
to accommodate more diversity which includes 520 AF records obtained from the MrOS sleep study (Visit
2) database. We then applied the 10-fold cross-validation technique to get the accuracy, sensitivity
and specificity. Moreover, we compared the results from our main classifier with other two approaches
which were used in previous researches including the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Adaboost-Classification
and Regression Trees (AB-CART). From the binary classification, our proposed method provides
significantly higher performance than other two approaches with the accuracy of 83.46 %, 85.39
% and 92.69 % in each cutoff, respectively. For the multiclass classification, it also returns a
highest accuracy of all approaches with 63.70 %.
