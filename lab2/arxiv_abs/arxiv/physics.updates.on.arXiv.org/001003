We study the theory of Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria in one spatial dimension, as well as its application
to current sheet and flux tube models. The 'inverse problem' is that of determining a Vlasov-Maxwell
equilibrium distribution function self-consistent with a given magnetic field. We develop the
theory of inversion using expansions in Hermite polynomials of the canonical momenta. Sufficient
conditions for the convergence of a Hermite expansion are found, given a pressure tensor. For large
classes of DFs, we prove that non-negativity of the distribution function is contingent on the magnetisation
of the plasma, and make conjectures for all classes. The inverse problem is considered for nonlinear
'force-free Harris sheets'. By applying the Hermite method, we construct new models that can describe
sub-unity values of the plasma beta $(\beta_{pl})$ for the first time. Whilst analytical convergence
is proven for all $\beta_{pl}$, numerical convergence is attained for $\beta_{pl}= 0.85$, and
then $\beta_{pl} = 0.05$ after a 're-gauging' process. We consider the properties that a pressure
tensor must satisfy to be consistent with 'asymmetric Harris sheets', and construct new examples.
It is possible to analytically solve the inverse problem in some cases, others must be tackled numerically.
We present new exact Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria for asymmetric current sheets, which can be written
as a sum of shifted Maxwellian distributions, ideal for implementations in particle-in-cell simulations.
We study the correspondence between the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of equilibrium
in cylindrical geometry, and then attempt to find Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria for the nonlinear
force-free 'Gold-Hoyle' model. However, it is necessary to include a background field, which can
be arbitrarily weak if desired. The equilibrium can be electrically non-neutral, depending on
the bulk flows.
