Accurate determination of particle track reconstruction parameters will be a major challenge
for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) experiments. The expected increase in the
number of simultaneous collisions at the HL-LHC and the resulting high detector occupancy will
make track reconstruction algorithms extremely demanding in terms of time and computing resources.
The increase in number of hits will increase the complexity of track reconstruction algorithms.
In addition, the ambiguity in assigning hits to particle tracks will be increased due to the finite
resolution of the detector and the physical closeness of the hits. Thus, the reconstruction of charged
particle tracks will be a major challenge to the correct interpretation of the HL-LHC data. Most
methods currently in use are based on Kalman filters which are shown to be robust and to provide good
physics performance. However, they are expected to scale worse than quadratically. Designing
an algorithm capable of reducing the combinatorial background at the hit level, would provide a
much cleaner initial seed to the Kalman filter, strongly reducing the total processing time. One
of the salient features of Quantum Computers is the ability to evaluate a very large number of states
simultaneously, making them an ideal instrument for searches in a large parameter space. In fact,
different R\&D initiatives are exploring how Quantum Tracking Algorithms could leverage such
capabilities. In this paper, we present our work on the implementation of a quantum-based track
finding algorithm aimed at reducing combinatorial background during the initial seeding stage.
We use the publicly available dataset designed for the kaggle TrackML challenge.
