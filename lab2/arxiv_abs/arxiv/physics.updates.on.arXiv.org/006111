Predicting the spatial configuration of gas molecules in nanopores of shale formations is crucial
for fluid flow forecasting and hydrocarbon reserves estimation. The key challenge in these tight
formations is that the majority of the pore sizes are less than 50 nm. At this scale, the fluid properties
are affected by nanoconfinement effects due to the increased fluid-solid interactions. For instance,
gas adsorption to the pore walls could account for up to 85% of the total hydrocarbon volume in a tight
reservoir. Although there are analytical solutions that describe this phenomenon for simple geometries,
they are not suitable for describing realistic pores, where surface roughness and geometric anisotropy
play important roles. To describe these, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used since they
consider fluid-solid and fluid-fluid interactions at the molecular level. However, MD simulations
are computationally expensive, and are not able to simulate scales larger than a few connected nanopores.
We present a method for building and training physics-based deep learning surrogate models to carry
out fast and accurate predictions of molecular configurations of gas inside nanopores. Since training
deep learning models requires extensive databases that are computationally expensive to create,
we employ active learning (AL). AL reduces the overhead of creating comprehensive sets of high-fidelity
data by determining where the model uncertainty is greatest, and running simulations on the fly
to minimize it. The proposed workflow enables nanoconfinement effects to be rigorously considered
at the mesoscale where complex connected sets of nanopores control key applications such as hydrocarbon
recovery and CO2 sequestration.
