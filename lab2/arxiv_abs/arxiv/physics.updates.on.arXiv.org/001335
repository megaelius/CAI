We study the solvation free energy of two different conformations (helix and extended) of two different
peptides (deca-alanine and deca-glycine) in two different solvents (water and aqueous guanidinium
chloride, GdmCl). The free energies are obtained using the quasichemical organization of the potential
distribution theorem, an approach that naturally provides the repulsive (solvophobic or cavity)
and attractive (solvophilic) contributions to solvation. The solvophilic contribution is further
parsed into a chemistry contribution arising from solute interaction with the solvent in the first
solvation shell and a long-range contribution arising from non-specific interactions between
the solute and the solvent beyond the first solvation shell. The cavity contribution is obtained
for two different envelopes, $\Sigma_{SE}$ which theory identifies as the solvent excluded volume
and a larger envelope ($\Sigma_G$) beyond which solute-solvent interactions are Gaussian. For
both envelopes, the cavity contribution in water is proportional to the surface area of the envelope.
The same does not hold for GdmCl(aq), revealing limitations of using molecular area to assess solvation
energetics, especially in mixed solvents. The $\Sigma_G$-cavity contribution predicts that
GdmCl(aq) should favor the more compact state, contrary to the role of GdmCl in unfolding proteins.
The chemistry contribution attenuates this effect, but still the net local (chemistry plus $\Sigma_G$-packing)
contribution is inadequate in capturing the role of GdmCl. With the inclusion of the long-range
contribution, which is dominated by van~der~Waals interaction, aqueous GdmCl favors the extended
conformation over the compact conformation. Our finding emphasizes the importance of weak, but
attractive, long-range dispersion interactions in protein solution thermodynamics.
