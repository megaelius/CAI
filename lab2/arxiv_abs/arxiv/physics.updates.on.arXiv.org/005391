Our purpose in this study was to present an integral-transform approach to the analytical solutions
of the Pennes's bioheat transfer equation and to apply it to the calculation of temperature distribution
in tissues in hyperthermia with magnetic nanoparticles (magnetic hyperthermia). The validity
of our method was investigated by comparison with the analytical solutions obtained by the Green's
function method for point and shell heat sources and the numerical solutions obtained by the finite-difference
method for Gaussin-distributed and step-function sources. There was good agreement between the
radial profiles of temperature calculated by our method and those obtained by the Green's function
method. There was also good agreement between our method and the finite-difference method except
for the central temperature for a step-function source that had approximately a 0.3% difference.
We also found that the equations describing the steady-state solutions for point and shell sources
obtained by our method agreed with those obtained by the Green's function method. These results
appear to indicate the validity of our method. In conclusion, we presented an integral-transform
approach to the bioheat transfer problems in magnetic hyperthermia, and this study demonstrated
the validity of our method. The analytical solutions presented in this study will be useful for gaining
some insight into the heat diffusion process during magnetic hyperthermia, for testing numerical
codes and/or more complcated approaches, and for performing sensitivity analysis and optimization
of the parameters that affect the thermal diffusion process in magnetic hyperthermia.
