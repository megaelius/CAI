Numerical simulations on fluid dynamics problems primarily rely on spatially or/and temporally
discretization of the governing equation into the finite-dimensional algebraic system solved
by computers. Due to complicated nature of the physics and geometry, such process can be computational
prohibitive for most real-time applications and many-query analyses. Therefore, developing
a cost-effective surrogate model is of great practical significance. Deep learning (DL) has shown
new promises for surrogate modeling due to its capability of handling strong nonlinearity and high
dimensionality. However, the off-the-shelf DL architectures fail to operate when the data becomes
sparse. Unfortunately, data is often insufficient in most parametric fluid dynamics problems
since each data point in the parameter space requires an expensive numerical simulation based on
the first principle, e.g., Naiver--Stokes equations. In this paper, we provide a physics-constrained
DL approach for surrogate modeling of fluid flows without relying on any simulation data. Specifically,
a structured deep neural network (DNN) architecture is devised to enforce the initial and boundary
conditions, and the governing partial differential equations are incorporated into the loss of
the DNN to drive the training. Numerical experiments are conducted on a number of internal flows
relevant to hemodynamics applications, and the forward propagation of uncertainties in fluid
properties and domain geometry is studied as well. The results show excellent agreement on the flow
field and forward-propagated uncertainties between the DL surrogate approximations and the first-principle
numerical simulations.
