We study vortex patterns in a prototype nonlinear optical system: counterpropagating laser beams
in a photorefractive crystal, with or without the background photonic lattice. The vortices are
effectively planar and described by the winding number and the "flavor" index, stemming from the
fact that we have two parallel beams propagating in opposite directions. The problem is amenable
to the methods of statistical field theory and generalizes the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition of the XY model to the "two-flavor" case. In addition to the familiar conductor and insulator
phases, we also have the perfect conductor (vortex proliferation in both beams/"flavors") and
the frustrated insulator (energy costs of vortex proliferation and vortex annihilation balance
each other). In the presence of disorder in the background lattice, a novel phase appears which shows
long-range correlations and absence of long-range order, thus being analogous to spin glasses.
An important benefit of this approach is that qualitative behavior of patterns can be known without
intensive numerical work over large areas of the parameter space. More generally, we would like
to draw attention to connections between the (classical) pattern-forming systems in photorefractive
optics and the methods of (quantum) condensed matter and field theory: on one hand, we use the field-theoretical
methods (renormalization group, replica formalism) to analyze the patterns; on the other hand,
the observed phases are analogous to those seen in magnetic systems, and make photorefractive optics
a fruitful testing ground for condensed matter systems. As an example, we map our system to a doped
$O(3)$ antiferromagnet with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ defects, which has the same structure of the phase
diagram.
