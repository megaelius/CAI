In this contribution, the capabilities of the turbulence-resolving Eulerian-Eulerian two-phase
flow model to predict the suspension of mono-dispersed finite-sized solid particles in a boundary
layer flow is investigated. For neutrally buoyant particles the two-fluid model having a standard
non-linear drag law accurately predicts the average concentration profile. However, for heavier-than-fluid
particles, having settling velocity on the order of the bed friction velocity, the two-fluid model
significantly under-estimates the turbulent dispersion of particles. In this contribution,
it is hypothesized that finite-size effects are important in this case and a correction model for
the drag law is proposed to validate this hypothesis. This model is based on the assumption that the
turbulent flow scales larger than the particle diameter will contribute to the resolved relative
velocity between the two phases whereas eddies smaller than the particle diameter will have two
effects (i) they will reduce the particle response time by adding a sub-particle scale eddy viscosity
to the drag coefficient and (ii) they will contribute to increase the production of granular temperature.
Integrating finite-size effects allows to quantitatively predict concentration profile for
heavier-than-fluid particles without altering the very good prediction of the original two-fluid
model for neutrally buoyant particles. The proposed modification of the two-fluid model extends
its range of applicability to tackle heavier-than-fluid particles having a size belonging to the
inertial range of turbulence and allows to envision more complex applications in terms of flow forcing
conditions i.e. sheet-flow, wave-driven transport, turbidity currents and/or flow geometries
i.e. ripples, dunes, scour.
