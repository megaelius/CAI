Subduction is a crucial part of the long-term H$_2$O and CO$_2$ cycling between Earth's exosphere
and interior. However, there is broad disagreement over how much H$_2$O and CO$_2$ is liberated
from subducting slabs to mantle wedge and transported to island-arc volcanoes. In the companion
paper Part I, we parameterize the metamorphic reactions involving H$_2$O and CO$_2$ for representative
subducting lithologies. On this basis, a two-dimensional reactive transport model is constructed
in this Part II. We assess the various controlling factors of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O release from subducting
slabs. Model results show that up-slab fluid flow directions produce flux peak of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O
at subarc depths. Moreover, infiltration of H$_2$O-rich fluids sourced from hydrated slab mantle
enhances decarbonation or carbonation at lithological interfaces, increases slab surface fluxes,
and redistributes CO$_2$ from basalt and gabbro layers to the overlying sedimentary layer. As a
result, diapiric removal of slab surface sediments leads to elevated CO$_2$ and H$_2$O fluxes along
the slab surface; the migration of sedimentary diapirs can serve as a crucial avenue for carbon transfer
from slabs to mantle wedge. The modelled subduction efficiency of H$_2$O ranges from $\sim$20%
to $\sim$90%, and that of CO$_2$ from $\sim$80% to $\sim$100%, indicating a large fraction of CO$_2$
is recycled to mantle depth beyond $\sim$200 km. This higher estimate of subduction efficiency
arises from consideration of open-system fractionation effects within the interior of the lithological
layers. It is potentially an overestimate because local flow focusing and ionic carbon species
are neglected in our model.
