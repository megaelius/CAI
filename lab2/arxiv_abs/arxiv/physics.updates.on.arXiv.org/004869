Development of the next generations of cancer therapy modalities is currently a crucial requirement
of oncology. Advances in nanotechnology are bringing us closer to the development of dual and multifunctional
nanoparticles that are challenging the traditional distinction between diagnostic and treatment
agents. The chase of innovative, multifunctional, more efficient, and safer treatments is a major
challenge in preclinical nanoparticle-mediated thermotherapeutic research for breast cancer.
Here, we report that iron oxide nanoparticles have the dual capacity to act as both magnetic and drug
delivery agents. The aim of this work was to investigate the in vitro effect of the loading of doxorubicin
(DOX) on negatively charged polycarboxylic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and Rhodamine
B functionalized SPIONs on breast carcinoma cell lines. For proper analysis and understanding
of cell behavior after administration of DOX-SPIONs compared with free DOX, a complex set of in vitro
tests, including production of MTT assay, cell cycle determination, and cellular uptake, were
utilized. In summary, we have developed a magnetic nanoparticle-based drug delivery system that
sequentially delivers the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin to breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231).
The drug-coated nanoparticles, DOX-NPs, were assembled stepwise, with doxorubicin adsorbed
to bare iron oxide nanoparticles first, by electrostatic reaction and allowed for the complexation
of doxorubicin. In contrast, they were internalized to a much greater extent in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells and were cytotoxic due to the synergistic action of the two drugs and the effects of hyperthermia.
The drug-coated particles were able to inhibit growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells
in vitro, indicating that the system has potential to act as an antimetastatic chemothermotherapeutic
agent.
