Previous work (S. Davidovits and N. J. Fisch, "Sudden viscous dissipation of compressing turbulence,"
Phys. Rev. Lett., 116(105004), 2016) demonstrated that the compression of a turbulent field can
lead to a sudden viscous dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and suggested this mechanism
could potentially be used to design new fast-ignition schemes for inertial confinement fusion.
We expand on previous work by accounting for finite Mach numbers, rather than relying on a zero-Mach-limit
assumption as previously done. The finite-Mach-number formulation is necessary to capture a self-consistent
feedback mechanism in which dissipated TKE increases the temperature of the system, which in turn
modifies the viscosity and thus the TKE dissipation itself. Direct numerical simulations with
a tenth-order accurate Pad\'e scheme were carried out to analyze this self-consistent feedback
loop for compressing turbulence. Results show that, for finite Mach numbers, the sudden viscous
dissipation of TKE still occurs, both for the solenoidal and dilatational turbulent fields. As
the domain is compressed, oscillations in dilatational TKE are encountered due to the highly-oscillatory
nature of the pressure dilatation. An analysis of the source terms for the internal energy shows
that the mechanical work term dominates the viscous turbulent dissipation. As a result, the effect
of the suddenly dissipated TKE on temperature is minimal for the Mach numbers tested. Moreover,
an analytical expression is derived that confirms the dissipated TKE does not significantly alter
the temperature evolution for low Mach numbers, regardless of compression speed. The self-consistent
feedback mechanism is thus quite weak for subsonic turbulence, which could limit its applicability
for inertial confinement fusion.
