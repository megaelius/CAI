After swallowing a liquid or a semi-liquid food product, a thin film responsible for the dynamic
profile of aroma release coats the pharyngeal mucosa. The objective of the present article was to
understand and quantify physical mechanisms explaining pharyngeal mucosa coating. An elastohydrodynamic
model of swallowing was developed for Newtonian liquids that focused on the most occluded region
of the pharyngeal peristaltic wave. The model took lubrication by a saliva film and mucosa deformability
into account. Food bolus flow rate and generated load were predicted as functions of three dimensionless
variables: the dimensionless saliva flow rate, the viscosity ratio between saliva and the food
bolus, and the elasticity number. Considering physiological conditions, the results were applied
to predict aroma release kinetics. Two sets of conditions were distinguished. The first one was
obtained when the saliva film is thin, in which case food bolus viscosity has a strong impact on mucosa
coating and on flavour release. More importantly, we demonstrated the existence of a second set
of conditions. It was obtained when the saliva film is thick and the food bolus coating the mucosa
is very diluted by saliva during the swallowing process and the impact of its viscosity on flavour
release is weak. This last phenomenon explains physically in vivo observations for Newtonian food
products found in the literature. Moreover, in this case, the predicted thickness of the mix of food
bolus with saliva coating the mucosa is approximately of 20 $\mu$m; value in agreement with orders
of magnitude found in the literature.
