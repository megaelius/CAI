Spatial networks such as streets organize and constrain urban transportation. These networks
may be planned according to clear organizing principles or they may evolve organically through
accretion, but their configurations and orientations help define a city's spatial logic and order.
Measures of entropy reveal a city's streets' order and disorder. Past studies have explored individual
cases of orientation and entropy, but little is known about broader patterns and trends worldwide.
This study examines street network orientation, configuration, and entropy in 100 cities around
the world using OpenStreetMap data and OSMnx. It measures the entropy of street bearings in weighted
and unweighted network models, along with each city's street length entropy, median street segment
length (a linear proxy for grain), average circuity, average node degree (how many streets emanate
from each intersection/dead-end), and the network's proportions of four-way intersections and
dead-ends. It also develops a new indicator of grid-order that quantifies how a city's street network
follows the ordering logic of a single orthogonal grid. It finds significant statistical relationships
between a city's griddedness/entropy and other indicators of spatial order, including street
circuity and multiple measures of connectivity. These indicators, taken in concert, reveal the
extent and nuance of the grid. On average, American cities are far more grid-like than cities in the
rest of the world and exhibit far less orientation entropy and street circuity. These methods demonstrate
automatic, scalable, reproducible tools to empirically measure and visualize city spatial order,
illustrating urban transportation system patterns and configurations around the world.
