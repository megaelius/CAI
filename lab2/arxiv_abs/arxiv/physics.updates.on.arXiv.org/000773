Many complex systems are modular. Such systems can be represented as "component systems", i.e.,
sets of elementary components, such as LEGO bricks in LEGO sets. The bricks found in a LEGO set reflect
a target architecture, which can be built following a set-specific list of instructions. In other
component systems, instead, the underlying functional design and constraints are not obvious
a priori, and their detection is often a challenge of both scientific and practical importance,
requiring a clear understanding of component statistics. Importantly, some quantitative invariants
appear to be common to many component systems, most notably a common broad distribution of component
abundances, which often resembles the well-known Zipf's law. Such "laws" affect in a general and
non-trivial way the component statistics, potentially hindering the identification of system-specific
functional constraints or generative processes. Here, we specifically focus on the statistics
of shared components, i.e., the distribution of the number of components shared by different system-realizations,
such as the common bricks found in different LEGO sets. To account for the effects of component heterogeneity,
we consider a simple null model, which builds system-realizations by random draws from a universe
of possible components. Under general assumptions on abundance heterogeneity, we provide analytical
estimates of component occurrence, which quantify exhaustively the statistics of shared components.
Surprisingly, this simple null model can positively explain important features of empirical component-occurrence
distributions obtained from data on bacterial genomes, LEGO sets, and book chapters. Specific
architectural features and functional constraints can be detected from occurrence patterns as
deviations from these null predictions, as we show for the illustrative case of the "core" genome
in bacteria.
