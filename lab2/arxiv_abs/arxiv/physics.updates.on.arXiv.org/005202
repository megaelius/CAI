This study investigates how students and researchers shape their knowledge and perception of educational
topics. The mindset or forma mentis of 159 Italian high school students and of 59 international researchers
in STEM are reconstructed through forma mentis networks, i.e., cognitive networks of concepts
connected by free associations and enriched with sentiment labels. The layout of conceptual associations
between positively/negatively/neutrally perceived concepts is informative on how people build
their own mental constructs or beliefs about specific topics. Researchers displayed mixed positive/neutral
mental representations of ``teacher'', ``student'' and, ``scientist''. Students' conceptual
associations of ``scientist'' were highly positive and largely non-stereotypical, although
links about the ``mad scientist'' stereotype persisted. Students perceived ``teacher'' as a complex
figure, associated with positive aspects like mentoring/knowledge transmission but also to negative
sides revolving around testing and grading. ``School'' elicited stronger differences between
the two groups. In the students' mindset, ``school'' was surrounded by a negative emotional aura
or set of associations, indicating an anxious perception of the school setting, mixing scholastic
concepts, anxiety-eliciting words, STEM disciplines like maths and physics, and exam-related
notions. Researchers' positive stance of ``school'' included concepts of fun, friendship, and
personal growth instead. Along the perspective of Education Research, the above results are discussed
as quantitative evidence for test- and STEM anxiety co-occurring in the way Italian students perceive
education places and their actors. Detecting these patterns in student populations through forma
mentis networks offers new, simple to gather yet detailed knowledge for future data-informed intervention
policies and action research.
