Implementation of a parity-time (PT) symmetric microwave photonic system in the optical wavelength
space with spatial singularity is proposed. In the proposed PT-symmetric microwave photonic system,
the gain and loss modes are confined in a single spatial resonator, which is different from a conventional
PT-symmetric system in which the two modes are localized in two physically separated resonators
to form one-dimensional spatial potential symmetry as required by the simplest one-dimensional
parity transformation. We show that PT-symmetry can be implemented between subspaces in non-spatial
parameter spaces, in which the gain and loss modes can perfectly overlay spatially but are distinguishable
in the designated parameter space. The resultant spatial singularity enables the possibility
in implementing PT-symmetric systems with increased structural simplicity, integration density
and long-term stability. To prove the concept, a PT-symmetric optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)
in the optical wavelength space is implemented. The OEO has a single-loop architecture, with the
gain and loss microwave modes carried by two optical wavelengths to form two mutually coupled wavelength-space
resonators (WSRs). PT-symmetry is achieved by controlling the wavelength spacing and the power
contrast. The operation of PT symmetry in the OEO is verified by the generation of a 10-GHz microwave
signal with a low phase noise of 129.3 dBc/Hz at 10-kHz offset frequency and a high sidemode suppression
ratio (SMSR) of 66.22 dB. Compared with a conventional spatial PT-symmetric system, one in the wavelength
space features a much simpler configuration, better stability and greater resilience to environmental
interferences.
