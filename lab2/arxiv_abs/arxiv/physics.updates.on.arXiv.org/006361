This paper promotes a measure to validate the hydrostatic approximation via scaling the nontraditional
Coriolis term (NCT) in the zonal momentum equation. To demonstrate the scaling, this study simulates
large-scale flow forced by a prescribed heat source mimicking the intertropical convergence zone
(ITCZ) using a linearized forced-dissipative model. The model solves two similar equations between
which the only difference is inclusion of NCTs. The equations are derived using the following approximations:
anelastic, equatorial beta-plane, linearized, zonally symmetric, steady, and a constant dissipation
coefficient. The large-scale flows simulated with and without NCTs are compared in terms of the
meridional-vertical circulation, the zonal wind, and the potential temperature. Both results
appear like the Hadley circulation. With the model parameters controlled, the results without
NCTs minus with NCTs are linear biases due to omitting NCTs. The most prominent bias is a westerly
wind bias in the ITCZ heating region that emerges because omitting NCTs prevents the associated
westward acceleration when heating-induced vertical motion is present. The zonal wind bias divided
by the zonal wind with NCTs is 0.120 $\pm$ 0.007 in terms of the westerly maximum and 0.0452 $\pm$ 0.0005
in terms of the root mean square (RMS) when the prescribed ITCZ mimics the observed ITCZ in May over
the East Pacific. These normalized measures of the zonal wind bias increase with a narrower ITCZ
or an ITCZ closer to the equator because of a weaker subtropical jet stream given the same vertical
heating profile. This difference can be traced by a nondimensional parameter scaling the ratio
of the NCT to the traditional Coriolis term. The scaling encourages restoring NCTs into global models.
