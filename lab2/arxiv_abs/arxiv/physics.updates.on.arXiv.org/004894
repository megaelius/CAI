Wave shape (i.e. skewness or asymmetry) plays an important role in beach morphology evolution,
remote sensing, and ship safety. Wind's influence on ocean waves has been extensively studied theoretically
in the context of growth, but most theories are phase averaged and cannot predict wave shape. Most
laboratory and numerical studies similarly focus on wave growth. A few laboratory experiments
have demonstrated that wind can change wave shape, and two-phase numerical simulations have also
noted wind-induced wave shape changes. However, wind's effect on wave shape is poorly understood,
and no theory for it exists. For weakly nonlinear waves, wave shape parameters are the phase of the
harmonic relative to the primary frequency (or harmonic phase HP, zero for a Stokes wave) and relative
amplitude of the harmonic to the primary. Here, surface pressure profiles (denoted Jeffreys, Miles,
and Generalized Miles) are prescribed based on wind-wave generation theories. Theoretical solutions
are derived for quasi-periodic progressive waves and the wind-induced changes to HP, relative
harmonic amplitude, as well as already known phase speed changes and growth rates. The wave shape
parameters depend upon the chosen surface pressure profile, pressure magnitude and phase relative
to the wave profile, and the nondimensional depth. Wave asymmetry is linked to the nondimensional
growth rate. Atmospheric large eddy simulations constrain pressure profile parameters. HP predictions
are qualitatively consistent with laboratory observations. This theory, together with the observables
of HP and relative harmonic amplitude, can provide insight into the actual wave surface pressure
profile.
