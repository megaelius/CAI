For developing a detailed network model of the brain based on image reconstructions, it is necessary
to spatially resolve crossing nerve fibers. The accuracy hereby depends on many factors, including
the spatial resolution of the imaging technique. 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) allows the
three-dimensional reconstruction of nerve fiber pathways in whole brain sections with micrometer
resolution, but leaves uncertainties in pixels containing crossing fibers. Here we introduce
Scattered Light Imaging (SLI) to resolve the substructure of nerve fiber crossings. The measurement
is performed on the same unstained histological brain sections as in 3D-PLI. By illuminating the
brain sections from different angles and measuring the transmitted (scattered) light under normal
incidence, SLI provides information about the underlying nerve fiber structure. A fully automated
evaluation of the resulting light intensity profiles has been developed, which allows the user
to extract the individual fiber orientations in regions with crossing nerve fibers, for each image
pixel at once. We validate the reconstructed nerve fiber orientations against results from previous
simulation studies, scatterometry measurements, and fiber orientations obtained from 3D-PLI.
We demonstrate in different brain samples (human optic tracts, vervet monkey brain, rat brain)
that the fiber orientations can be reliably reconstructed for up to three crossing nerve fiber bundles
in each image pixel with a resolution of up to 6.5 $\mu$m. We show that SLI also yields reliable fiber
directions in brain regions with low 3D-PLI signals coming from regions with a low density of myelinated
nerve fibers or out-of-plane fibers. In combination with 3D-PLI, the technique can be used for a
full reconstruction of the three-dimensional nerve fiber architecture in the brain.
