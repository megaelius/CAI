Here we investigate ground and metastable negative ion formation in low-energy electron collisions
with the actinide atoms Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu through the elastic total cross sections (TCSs) calculations.
For these atoms, the presence of two or more open d- and f- subshell electrons presents a formidable
computational task for conventional theoretical methods, making it difficult to interpret the
calculated results. Our robust Regge pole methodology which embeds the crucial electron correlations
and the vital core-polarization interaction is used for the calculations. These are the major physical
effects mostly responsible for stable negative ion formation in low-energy electron scattering
from complex heavy systems. We find that the TCSs are characterized generally by Ramsauer-Townsend
minima, shape resonances and dramatically sharp resonances manifesting ground and metastable
negative ion formation during the collisions. The extracted from the ground states TCSs anionic
binding energies (BEs) are found to be 3.09 eV, 2.98 eV, 3.03 eV, 3.06 eV and 3.25 eV for Th, Pa, U, Np
and Pu, respectively. Interestingly, an additional polarization-induced metastable TCS with
anionic BE value of 1.22 eV is created in Pu due to the size effect. We also found that our excited states
anionic BEs for several of these atoms compare well with the existing theoretical electron affinities
including those calculated using the relativistic configuration-interaction method. We conclude
that the existing theoretical calculations tend to identify incorrectly the BEs of the resultant
excited anionic states with the electron affinities of the investigated actinide atoms; this suggests
a need for an unambiguous definition of electron affinity.
