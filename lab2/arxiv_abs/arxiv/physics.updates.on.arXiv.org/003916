This paper concerns anisotropic two-dimensional and planar elasticity models within the frameworks
of classical linear elasticity and the bond-based peridynamic theory of solid mechanics. We begin
by reviewing corresponding models from the classical theory of linear elasticity. This review
includes a new elementary and self-contained proof that there are exactly four material symmetry
classes of the elasticity tensor in two dimensions. We also summarize classical plane strain and
plane stress linear elastic models and explore their connections to the pure two-dimensional linear
elastic model, relying on the definitions of the engineering constants. We then provide a novel
formulation for pure two-dimensional anisotropic bond-based linear peridynamic models, which
accommodates all four material symmetry classes. We further present innovative formulations
for peridynamic plane strain and plane stress, which are obtained using direct analogies of the
classical planar elasticity assumptions, and we specialize these formulations to a variety of
material symmetry classes. The presented anisotropic peridynamic models are constrained by Cauchy's
relations, which are an intrinsic property of bond-based peridynamic models. The uniqueness of
the presented peridynamic plane strain and plane stress formulations in this work is that we directly
reduce three-dimensional models to two-dimensional formulations, as opposed to matching two-dimensional
peridynamic models to classical plane strain and plane stress formulations. This results in significant
computational savings, while retaining the dynamics of the original three-dimensional bond-based
peridynamic problems under suitable assumptions.
