There is a long standing debate about whether or not the annual modulation signal reported by the
DAMA/LIBRA collaboration is induced by Weakly Interacting Massive Particles~(WIMP) in the galaxy's
dark matter halo scattering from nuclides in their NaI(Tl) crystal target/detector. This is because
regions of WIMP-mass vs. WIMP-nucleon cross-section parameter space that can accommodate the
DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 modulation signal in the context of the standard WIMP dark matter galactic halo
and isospin-conserving~(canonical), spin-independent~(SI) WIMP-nucleon interactions have
been excluded by many of other dark matter search experiments including COSINE-100, which uses
the same NaI(Tl) target/detector material. Moreover, the recently released DAMA/LIBRA-phase2
results are inconsistent with an interpretation as WIMP-nuclide scattering via the canonical
SI interaction and prefer, instead, isospin-violating or spin-dependent interactions. Dark
matter interpretations of the DAMA/LIBRA signal are sensitive to the NaI(Tl) scintillation efficiency
for nuclear recoils, which is characterized by so-called quenching factors~(QF), and the QF values
used in previous studies differ significantly from recently reported measurements, which may
have led to incorrect interpretations of the DAMA/LIBRA signal. In this article, the compatibility
of the DAMA/LIBRA and COSINE-100 results, in light of the new QF measurements is examined for different
possible types of WIMP-nucleon interactions. The resulting allowed parameter space regions associated
with the DAMA/LIBRA signal are explicitly compared with 90\% confidence level upper limits from
the initial 59.5~day COSINE-100 exposure. With the newly measured QF values, the allowed 3$\sigma$
regions from the DAMA/LIBRA data are still generally excluded by the COSINE-100 data.
