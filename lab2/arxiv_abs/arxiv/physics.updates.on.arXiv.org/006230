We demonstrate a cryogenic non-local refrigeration engine, employing Coulomb-coupled systems,
that circumvents the need for a change in the energy resolved system-to-reservoir coupling, demanded
by the recently proposed non-local refrigerators. We demonstrate that an intentionally introduced
energy difference between the ground states of adjacent tunnel coupled quantum dots, associated
with Coulomb coupling, is sufficient to extract heat from a remote target reservoir. Investigating
the performance and operating regime using quantum-master-equation (QME) approach, we point
out to some crucial aspects of the proposed refrigeration engine. In particular, comparing the
performance of the proposed refrigeration engine with the optimal set-up, we demonstrate that
the maximum cooling power for the proposed set-up is limited to about $70\%$ of the optimal design.
Proceeding further, we point out that to achieve a target reservoir temperature, lower compared
to the average temperature of the current path, the applied voltage must be greater than a given threshold
voltage $V_{TH}$, that increases with decrease in the target reservoir temperature. In addition,
we demonstrate that the maximum cooling power, as well as the coefficient of performance deteriorates
as one approaches a lower target reservoir temperature. Despite a degraded performance compared
to the optimal set-up, the novelty of the proposed refrigeration engine is the integration of fabrication
simplicity along with descent cooling power. The idea proposed in this paper may pave the way towards
the realization of efficient non-local cryogenic refrigeration systems.
