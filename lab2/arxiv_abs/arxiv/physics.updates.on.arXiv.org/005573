In this work, we propose a fully discrete energy stable scheme for the phase-field moving contact
line model with variable densities and viscosities. The mathematical model consists of a Cahn-Hilliard
equation, a Navier-Stokes equation and the generalized Navier boundary condition for the moving
contact line. A scalar auxiliary variable is adopted to transform the governing system into an equivalent
form, allowing the double well potential to be treated semi-explicitly. A stabilization term is
added to balance the explicit nonlinear term originating from the surface energy at fluid-solid
interface. A pressure stabilization method is used to decouple the computation of velocity and
pressure. Some subtle implicit-explicit treatments are adopted to deal with convention and stress
terms. We establish a rigorous proof of energy stability for the proposed time-marching scheme.
Then a finite difference method on staggered grids is used to spatially discretize the constructed
time-marching scheme. We further prove that the fully discrete scheme also satisfies the discrete
energy dissipation law. Numerical results demonstrate accuracy and energy stability of the proposed
scheme. Using our numerical scheme, we analyze the contact line dynamics through a shear flow driven
droplet sliding case. Three-dimensional droplet spreading is also investigated on a chemically
patterned surface. Our numerical simulation accurately predicts the expected energy evolutions
and it successfully reproduces expected phenomena that an oil droplet contracts inwards on a hydrophobic
zone and spreads outwards quickly on a hydrophilic zone.
