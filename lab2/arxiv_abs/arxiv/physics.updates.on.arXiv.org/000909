The conversion of magnetic energy into other forms during solar flares is one of the outstanding
open problems in solar physics. It is generally accepted that magnetic reconnection plays a crucial
role in these conversion processes. To achieve the rapid energy release required in solar flares,
an anomalous resistivity, orders of magnitude higher than the Spitzer resistivity, is often used
in MHD simulations of reconnection. Spitzer resistivity is based on Coulomb scattering, which
becomes negligible at the high energies achieved by accelerated particles. As a result, simulations
of particle acceleration in reconnection events are often performed in the absence of any interaction
between accelerated particles and any background plasma. This need not be the case for scattering
associated with anomalous resistivity caused by turbulence within solar flares, as the higher
resistivity implies an elevated scattering rate. We present results of test particle calculations,
with and without pitch angle scattering, subject to fields derived from MHD simulations of two-dimensional
(2D) X-point reconnection. Scattering rates proportional to the ratio of the anomalous resistivity
to the local Spitzer resistivity, as well as at fixed values, are considered. Pitch angle scattering,
which is independent of the anomalous resistivity, causes higher maximum energies in comparison
to those obtained without scattering. Scattering rates which are dependent on the local anomalous
resistivity tend to produce fewer highly energised particles due to weaker scattering in the separatrices,
even though scattering in the current sheet may be stronger when compared to resistivity-independent
scattering. Strong scattering also causes an increase in the number of particles exiting the computational
box in the reconnection outflow region, as opposed to along the separatrices as is the case in the
absence of scattering.
