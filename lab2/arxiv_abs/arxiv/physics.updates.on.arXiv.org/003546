Purpose: B1+ and T1 corrections and dynamic multi-coil shimming approaches were proposed to improve
the fidelity of high isotropic resolution Generalized slice dithered enhanced resolution (gSlider)
diffusion imaging. Methods: An extended reconstruction incorporating B1+ inhomogeneity and
T1 recovery information was developed to mitigate slab-boundary artifacts in short-TR gSlider
acquisitions. Slab-by-slab dynamic B0 shimming using a multi-coil integrated {\Delta}B0/Rx
shim-array, and high in-plane acceleration (Rinplane=4) achieved with virtual-coil GRAPPA were
also incorporated into a 1 mm isotropic resolution gSlider acquisition/reconstruction framework
to achieve an 8-11 fold reduction in geometric distortion compared to single-shot EPI. Results:
The slab-boundary artifacts were alleviated by the proposed B1+ and T1 corrections compared to
the standard gSlider reconstruction pipeline for short-TR acquisitions. Dynamic shimming provided
>50% reduction in geometric distortion compared to conventional global 2nd order shimming. 1 mm
isotropic resolution diffusion data show that the typically problematic temporal and frontal
lobes of the brain can be imaged with high geometric fidelity using dynamic shimming. Conclusions:
The proposed B1+ and T1 corrections and local-field control substantially improved the fidelity
of high isotropic resolution diffusion imaging, with reduced slab-boundary artifacts and geometric
distortion compared to conventional gSlider acquisition and reconstruction. This enabled high-fidelity
whole-brain 1 mm isotropic diffusion imaging with 64 diffusion-directions in 20 minutes using
a 3T clinical scanner.
