Recent numerical simulations indicate that streamwise-preferential anisotropic porous materials
have the potential to reduce skin friction in turbulent flows through a similar mechanism to riblets.
This paper reports particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements made in turbulent boundary layers
at $Re_\tau \approx 360$ over 3D-printed porous substrates exhibiting such streamwise-preferential
permeability. The porous material has normalized streamwise permeability $\sqrt{K_{xx}^+}\approx
3.0$ and wall-normal and spanwise permeabilities $\sqrt{K_{yy}^+} = \sqrt{K_{zz}^+} \approx
1.1$. This material is flush-mounted into a cutout in the downstream half of a flat-plate boundary
layer setup in a water channel facility. Measurements made at several locations along the porous
substrate provide insight into boundary layer development. For fully-developed conditions,
the mean profiles show the presence of a logarithmic region over the porous material with similar
constants to those found over a smooth wall. A technique that estimates the mean profile at single-pixel
resolution from the particle images suggests the presence of an interfacial slip velocity of $U_s^+
\approx \sqrt{K_{xx}^+}$ over the porous substrate. Friction velocity estimates obtained from
outer layer fits to the mean profile suggest a marginal increase in drag over the porous substrate.
PIV measurements show a decrease in the intensity of streamwise velocity fluctuations in the near-wall
region and an increase in the intensity of wall-normal velocity fluctuations. These observations
are consistent with simulation results, which suggest that materials with $\sqrt{K_{yy}^+} >
0.4$ are susceptible to the emergence of spanwise rollers similar to Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices
that degrade drag reduction performance. Velocity spectra indicate that such structures emerge
in the experiments as well.
