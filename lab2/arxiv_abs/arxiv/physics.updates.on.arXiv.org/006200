A model of the columnar functional organization of neocortical association areas is studied. The
neuronal network is composed of many Hebbian autoassociators, or modules, each of which interacts
with a relatively small number of the others. Every module encodes and stores a number of elementary
percepts, or features. Memory items, or patterns, are peculiar combinations of features sparsely
distributed over the multi-modular network. Any feature stored in any module can be involved in
several of the stored patterns; feature-sharing is in fact source of local ambiguities and, consequently,
a potential cause of erroneous memory retrieval activity spreading through the model network.
The memory retrieval dynamics of the large multi-modular autoassociator is investigated by means
of quantitative analysis and numerical simulations. An oscillatory retrieval process is found
to be very efficient in overcoming feature-sharing drawbacks; it requires a mechanism that modulates
the robustness of local attractors to noise, and neuronal activity sparseness such that quiescent
and active modules are about equally noisy. Correlated activation of interconnected modules and
extramodular neuronal contacts more effective than the intramodular ones seem to be general requirements
in order to efficiently achieve satisfactory quality of memory retrieval. It is also shown that,
even in ideal conditions, some spots of the network cannot be reached by retrieval activity spread.
The locations of these activity isles depend on the pattern to retrieve and on the cue, while their
extension only depends on architecture of the graph and statistics of the stored patterns. The existence
of these isles determines an upper-bound to retrieval quality that does not depend on the specific
retrieval dynamics adopted, nor on whether feature-sharing is permitted. The oscillatory retrieval
process nearly saturates this bound.
