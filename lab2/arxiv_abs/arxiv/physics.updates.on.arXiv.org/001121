Ferrogels and magnetoelastomers are composite materials obtained by embedding magnetic particles
of mesoscopic size in a crosslinked polymeric matrix. They combine the reversible elastic deformability
of polymeric materials with the high responsivity of ferrofluids to external magnetic fields.
These materials stand out, for example, for large magnetostriction as well as significant increase
of the elastic moduli in the presence of external magnetic fields. By means of X-ray micro-computed
tomography, position and size of each magnetic particle can be measured with a high degree of accuracy.
We here use data extracted from real magnetoelastic samples as input for coarse-grained dipole-spring
modeling and calculations to investigate magnetostriction, stiffening, and changes in the normal
modes spectrum. More precisely, we assign to each particle a dipole moment proportional to its volume
and set a randomized network of springs between them that mimics the behavior of the polymeric elastic
matrix. Extending our previously developed methods, we compute the resulting structural changes
in the systems, their overall distortions, as well as the frequency-dependent elastic moduli when
magnetic interactions are turned on. Particularly, with increasing magnetization, we observe
the formation of chain-like aggregates, resulting in significant overall deformations. Interestingly,
the static elastic moduli can first show a slight decrease with growing amplitude of the magnetic
interactions, before a pronounced increase appears upon the chain formation. The change of the
dynamic moduli with increasing magnetization depends on the frequency and can even show nonmonotonic
behavior. Overall, we demonstrate how theory and experiments can complement each other to learn
more about the dynamic behavior of this interesting class of materials.
