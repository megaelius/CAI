In recent years, there has been growing interest in studying games on multiplex networks that account
for interactions across linked social contexts. However, little is known about how potential cross-context
interference, or spillover, of individual behavioural strategy impact overall cooperation.
We consider three plausible spillover modes, quantifying and comparing their effects on the evolution
of cooperation. In our model, social interactions take place on two network layers: one represents
repeated interactions with close neighbours in a lattice, the other represents one-shot interactions
with random individuals across the same population. Spillover can occur during the social learning
process with accidental cross-layer strategy transfer, or during social interactions with errors
in implementation due to contextual interference. Our analytical results, using extended pair
approximation, are in good agreement with extensive simulations. We find double-edged effects
of spillover on cooperation: increasing the intensity of spillover can promote cooperation provided
cooperation is favoured in one layer, but too much spillover is detrimental. We also discover a bistability
phenomenon of cooperation: spillover hinders or promotes cooperation depending on initial frequencies
of cooperation in each layer. Furthermore, comparing strategy combinations that emerge in each
spillover mode provides a good indication of their co-evolutionary dynamics with cooperation.
Our results make testable predictions that inspire future research, and sheds light on human cooperation
across social domains and their interference with one another.
