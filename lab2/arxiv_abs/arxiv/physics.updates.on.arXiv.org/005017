We present a high-precision temporal-spatial phase-demodulation algorithm for phase-shifting
interferometry (PSI) affected by random/systematic phase-stepping errors. Laser interferometers
in standard optical-shops suffer from several error sources including random phase-shift deviations.
Even calibrated phase-shifters do not achieve floating-point linear accuracy, as routinely obtained
in multimedia video-projectors for fringe-projection profilometry. In standard optical-shops,
calibrated phase-shifting interferometers suffer from nonlinearities due to vibrations, turbulence,
and environmental fluctuations (temperature, pressure, humidity, air composition) still under
controlled laboratory conditions. These random phase-step errors (even if they are small), increases
the uncertainty of the phase measurement. This is particularly significant if the wavefront tolerance
is tightened to high precision optics. We show that these phase-step errors precludes high-precision
wavefront measurements because its uncertainty increases to around lambda/10. We develop an analytical
expression based on optical-wavefront formalism showing that these phase-step nonlinearities
appear as a spurious conjugate signal degrading the desired wavefront. Removing this spurious
conjugate constitutes the central objective of the proposed nonlinear phase-shifting algorithm
(nPSA). Using this nPSI algorithm we demodulate experimental interferograms subject to small
vibrations and phase-shifter nonlinearities, obtaining a high-precision spurious-free, demodulated
wavefront. We show that our artifact-free, temporal-spatial quadrature filtering, accomplishes
an equivalent wavefront precision as the one obtained from floating-point linear phase-shifting
interferometry.
