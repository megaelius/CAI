The intra-axonal water exchange time {\tau}i, a parameter associated with axonal permeability,
could be an important biomarker for understanding demyelinating pathologies such as Multiple
Sclerosis. Diffusion-Weighted MRI is sensitive to changes in permeability, however, the parameter
has remained elusive due to the intractability of the mathematical models that incorporate it.
Machine learning based computational models can potentially be used to estimate such parameters,
and recently, a theoretical framework using a random forest (RF) suggests this is a promising approach.
In this study, we adopt such an RF approach and experimentally investigate its suitability as a biomarker
for demyelinating pathologies through direct comparison with histology. For this, we use an in-vivo
cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model of demyelination with available ex-vivo electron microscopy (EM)
data. We test our model on noise-free simulations and find very strong correlations between the
predicted and ground truth parameters. For realistic noise levels as in our in-vivo data, the performance
is affected, however, the parameters are still well estimated. We apply our RF model on in-vivo data
from 8 CPZ and 8 wild-type (WT) mice and validate the RF estimates using histology. We find a strong
correlation between the in-vivo RF estimates of {\tau}i and the EM measurements of myelin thickness
({\rho_\tau}i = 0.82), and between RF estimates and EM measurements of intra-axonal volume fraction
({\rho_f} = 0.98). When comparing {\tau}i in CPZ and WT mice we find a statistically significant
decrease in the corpus callosum of the CPZ compared to the WT mice, in line with our expectations that
{\tau}i is lower in regions where the myelin sheath is damaged. Overall, these results demonstrate
the suitability of machine learning compartment models with permeability as a potential biomarker
for demyelinating pathologies.
