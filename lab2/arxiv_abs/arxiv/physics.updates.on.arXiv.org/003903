Global probabilistic inversion within the latent space learned by a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) has been recently demonstrated. Compared to inversion on the original model space, using
the latent space of a trained GAN can offer the following benefits: (1) the generated model proposals
are geostatistically consistent with the prescribed prior training image (TI), and (2) the parameter
space is reduced by orders of magnitude compared to the original model space. Nevertheless, exploring
the learned latent space by state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may still
require a large computational effort. As an alternative, parameters in this latent space could
possibly be optimized with much less computationally expensive gradient-based methods. We show
that due to the typically highly nonlinear relationship between the latent space and the associated
output space of a GAN, gradient-based deterministic inversion may fail even when considering a
linear forward physical model. We tested two deterministic inversion approaches: a quasi-Newton
gradient descent using the Adam algorithm and a Gauss-Newton (GN) method that makes use of the Jacobian
matrix calculated by finite-differencing. For a channelized binary TI and a synthetic linear crosshole
ground penetrating radar (GPR) tomography problem involving 576 measurements with low noise,
we observe that when allowing for a total of 10,000 iterations only 13% of the gradient descent trials
locate a solution that has the required data misfit. The tested GN inversion was unable to recover
a solution with the appropriate data misfit. Our results suggest that deterministic inversion
performance strongly depends on the inversion approach, starting model, true reference model,
number of iterations and noise realization. In contrast, computationally-expensive probabilistic
global optimization always finds an appropriate solution.
