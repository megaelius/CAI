We use experiments and direct numerical simulations to probe the phase-space of low-curvature
Taylor--Couette (TC) flow in the vicinity of the ultimate regime. The cylinder radius ratio is fixed
at $\eta=r_i/r_o=0.91$. Non-dimensional shear drivings (Taylor numbers $\text{Ta}$) in the
range $10^7\leq\text{Ta}\leq10^{11}$ are explored for both co- and counter-rotating configurations.
In the $\text{Ta}$ range $10^8\leq\text{Ta}\leq10^{10}$, we observe two local maxima of the angular
momentum transport as a function of the cylinder rotation ratio, which can be described as either
as "co-" and "counter-rotating" due to their location or as "broad" and "narrow" due to their shape.
We confirm that the broad peak is accompanied by the strengthening of the large-scale structures,
and that the narrow peak appears once the driving (Ta) is strong enough. As first evidenced in numerical
simulations by Brauckmann \emph{et al.}~(2016), the broad peak is produced by centrifugal instabilities
and that the narrow peak is a consequence of shear instabilities. We describe how the peaks change
with $\text{Ta}$ as the flow becomes more turbulent. Close to the transition to the ultimate regime
when the boundary layers (BLs) become turbulent, the usual structure of counter-rotating Taylor
vortex pairs breaks down and stable unpaired rolls appear locally. We attribute this state to changes
in the underlying roll characteristics during the transition to the ultimate regime. Further changes
in the flow structure around $\text{Ta}\approx10^{10}$ cause the broad peak to disappear completely
and the narrow peak to move. This second transition is caused when the regions inside the BLs which
are locally smooth regions disappear and the whole boundary layer becomes active.
