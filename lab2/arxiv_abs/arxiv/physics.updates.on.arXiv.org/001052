We investigate the feasibility of activating coherent mechanical oscillations in lasing microspheres
by modulating the laser emission at a mechanical eigenfrequency. To this aim, 1.5% Nd3+:Barium-Titanium-Silicate
microspheres with diameters around 50 {\mu}m were used as high quality factor (Q>10^6) whispering
gallery mode lasing cavities. We have implemented a pump-and-probe technique in which the pump
laser used to excite the Nd3+ ions is focused on a single microsphere with a microscope objective
and a probe laser excites a specific optical mode with the evanescent field of a tapered fibre. The
studied microspheres show monomode and multi-mode lasing action, which can be modulated in the
best case up to 10 MHz. We have optically transduced thermally-activated mechanical eigenmodes
appearing in the 50-70 MHz range, the frequency of which decreases with increasing the size of the
microspheres. In a pump-and-probe configuration we observed modulation of the probe signal up
to the maximum pump modulation frequency of our experimental setup, i.e., 20 MHz. This modulation
decreases with frequency and is unrelated to lasing emission, pump scattering or thermal effects.
We associate this effect to free-carrier-dispersion induced by multiphoton pump light absorption.
On the other hand, we conclude that, in our current experimental conditions, it was not possible
to resonantly excite the mechanical modes. Finally, we discuss on how to overcome these limitations
by increasing the modulation frequency of the lasing emission and decreasing the frequency of the
mechanical eigenmodes displaying a strong degree of optomechanical coupling.
