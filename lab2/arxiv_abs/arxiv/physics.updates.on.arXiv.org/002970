The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a TeV-scale high-luminosity linear $e^+e^-$ collider under
development at CERN. Following the CLIC conceptual design published in 2012, this report provides
an overview of the CLIC project, its current status, and future developments. It presents the CLIC
physics potential and reports on design, technology, and implementation aspects of the accelerator
and the detector. CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in stages, at centre-of-mass energies
of 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV, respectively. CLIC uses a two-beam acceleration scheme, in which 12
GHz accelerating structures are powered via a high-current drive beam. For the first stage, an alternative
with X-band klystron powering is also considered. CLIC accelerator optimisation, technical developments
and system tests have resulted in an increased energy efficiency (power around 170 MW) for the 380
GeV stage, together with a reduced cost estimate at the level of 6 billion CHF. The detector concept
has been refined using improved software tools. Significant progress has been made on detector
technology developments for the tracking and calorimetry systems. A wide range of CLIC physics
studies has been conducted, both through full detector simulations and parametric studies, together
providing a broad overview of the CLIC physics potential. Each of the three energy stages adds cornerstones
of the full CLIC physics programme, such as Higgs width and couplings, top-quark properties, Higgs
self-coupling, direct searches, and many precision electroweak measurements. The interpretation
of the combined results gives crucial and accurate insight into new physics, largely complementary
to LHC and HL-LHC. The construction of the first CLIC energy stage could start by 2026. First beams
would be available by 2035, marking the beginning of a broad CLIC physics programme spanning 25-30
years.
