We present a comprehensive theoretical description for an irradiation of an ultrashort light pulse
normally on thin materials based on first-principles time-dependent density functional theory.
As the most elaborate scheme, we develop a microscopic description solving Maxwell equations for
light electromagnetic fields and the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation for electron dynamics
simultaneously in the time domain using a common spatial grid. We call it the microscopic Maxwell-TDDFT
scheme. We test this scheme for silicon thin films of various thickness, from a few atomic layers
to a few tens of nm. We show that the microscopic Maxwell-TDDFT scheme provides a satisfactory description
incorporating the electronic structure of thin films in the first-principles level, multiple
reflections of the electromagnetic fields at the surfaces, and nonlinear light-matter interaction
when the incident light pulse is strong. However, the calculation becomes expensive as the thickness
increases. We then consider two limiting cases of extremely thin and sufficiently thick films and
develop approximate schemes. For the extremely thin case including two-dimensional atomic-layered
materials, a two-dimensional macroscopic electromagnetism is developed: a two-dimensional
susceptibility is introduced for a weak field, while time evolution equation is derived for an intense
field. For sufficiently thick films, the microscopic Maxwell-TDDFT scheme is expected to coincide
with a description utilizing ordinary macroscopic electromagnetism. We numerically confirm
it comparing the calculated results: For a weak field, a comparison is made with a description using
the bulk dielectric susceptibility. For a strong field, a comparison is made with a multiscale Maxwell-TDDFT
scheme which the authors' group developed previously.
