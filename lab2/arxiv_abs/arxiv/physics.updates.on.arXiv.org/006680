Lithium--sulfur (Li/S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage devices
beyond lithium-ion batteries because of their high energy density of 2600 Wh/kg and an affordable
cost of sulfur. Meanwhile, some challenges inherent to Li/S batteries remain to be tackled, for
instance, the polysulfide (PS) shuttle effect, the irreversible solidification of Li$_2$S, and
the volume expansion of the cathode material during discharge. On the molecular level, these issues
originate from the structural and solubility behavior of the PS species in bulk and in the electrode
confinement. In this study, we use classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop a working
model for PS of different chain lengths in applied electrolyte solutions of lithium bistriflimide
(LiTFSI) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) mixtures. We investigate conductivities,
diffusion coefficients, solvation structures, and clustering behavior and verify our simulation
model with experimental measurements available in literature and newly performed by us. Our results
show that diffusion coefficients and conductivities are significantly influenced by the chain
length of PS. The conductivity contribution of the short chains, like Li$_2$S$_4$, is lower than
of longer PS chains, such as Li$_2$S$_6$ or Li$_2$S$_8$, despite the fact that the diffusion coefficient
of Li$_2$S$_4$ is higher than for longer PS chains. The low conductivity of Li$_2$S$_4$ can be attributed
to its low degree of dissociation and even to a formation of large clusters in the solution. It is also
found that an addition of 1 M LiTFSI into PS solutions considerably reduces the clustering behavior.
Our simulation model enables future systematic studies in various solvating and confining systems
for the rational design of Li/S electrolytes.
