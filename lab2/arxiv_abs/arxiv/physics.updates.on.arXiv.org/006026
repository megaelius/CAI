Recent advances in the study of synthetic dimensions revealed a possibility to employ the frequency
space as an additional degree of freedom which allows for investigating and exploiting higher-dimensional
phenomena in a priori low-dimensional systems. However, the influence of nonlinear effects on
the synthetic frequency dimensions was studied only under significant restrictions. In the present
paper, we develop a generalized mean-field model for the optical field envelope inside a single
driven-dissipative resonator with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities, whose frequencies are
coupled via an electro-optical resonant temporal modulation. The leading order equation takes
the form of driven Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a cosine potential. We numerically investigate
the nonlinear dynamics in such microring resonator with a synthetic frequency dimension in the
regime where parametric frequency conversion occurs. In the case of anomalous dispersion, we find
that the presence of electro-optical mode coupling confines and stabilizes the chaotic modulation
instability region. This leads to the appearance of a novel type of stable coherent structures which
emerge in the synthetic space with restored translational symmetry, in a region of parameters where
conventionally only chaotic modulation instability states exist. This structure appears in the
center of the synthetic band and, therefore, is referred to as Band Soliton. Finally, we extend our
results to the case of multiple modulation frequencies with controllable relative phases creating
synthetic lattices with nontrivial geometry. We show that an asymmetric synthetic band leads to
the coexistence of chaotic and coherent states of the electromagnetic field inside the cavity i.e.
dynamics that can be interpreted as chimera-like states. Recently developed $\chi^{(2)}$ microresonators
can open the way to experimentally explore our findings.
