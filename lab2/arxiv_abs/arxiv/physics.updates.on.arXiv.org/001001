We perform numerical simulations of a turbulent channel flow over an hyper-elastic wall. In the
fluid region the flow is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, while the
solid is a neo-Hookean material satisfying the incompressible Mooney-Rivlin law. The multiphase
flow is solved with a one-continuum formulation, using a monolithic velocity field for both the
fluid and solid phase, which allows the use of a fully Eulerian formulation. The simulations are
carried out at Reynolds bulk $Re=2800$ and examine the effect of different elasticity and viscosity
of the deformable wall. We show that the skin friction increases monotonically with the material
elastic modulus. The turbulent flow in the channel is affected by the moving wall even at low values
of elasticity since non-zero fluctuations of vertical velocity at the interface influence the
flow dynamics. The near-wall streaks and the associated quasi-streamwise vortices are strongly
reduced near a highly elastic wall while the flow becomes more correlated in the spanwise direction,
similarly to what happens for flows over rough and porous walls. As a consequence, the mean velocity
profile in wall units is shifted downwards when shown in logarithmic scale, and the slope of the inertial
range increases in comparison to that for the flow over a rigid wall. We propose a correlation between
the downward shift of the inertial range, its slope and the wall-normal velocity fluctuations at
the wall, extending results for the flow over rough walls. We finally show that the interface deformation
is determined by the fluid fluctuations when the viscosity of the elastic layer is low, while when
this is high the deformation is limited by the solid properties.
