Purpose: Asymmetric gradient waveforms are attractive for diffusion encoding due to their superior
efficiency, however, the asymmetry may cause a residual gradient moment at the end of the encoding.
Depending on the experiment setup, this residual moment may cause significant signal bias and image
artifacts. The purpose of this study was to develop an asymmetric gradient waveform design for tensor-valued
diffusion encoding that is not affected by concomitant gradient. Methods: The Maxwell index was
proposed as a scalar invariant that captures the effect of concomitant gradients and was constrained
in the numerical optimization to 100 (mT/m)$^2$ms to yield Maxwell-compensated waveforms. The
efficacy of this design was tested in an oil phantom, and in a healthy human brain. For reference,
waveforms from literature were included in the analysis. Simulations were performed to investigate
if the design was valid for a wide range of experiments and if it could predict the signal bias. Results:
Maxwell-compensated waveforms showed no signal bias in oil or in the brain. By contrast, several
waveforms from literature showed gross signal bias. In the brain, the bias was large enough to markedly
affect both signal and parameter maps, and the bias could be accurately predicted by theory. Conclusion:
Constraining the Maxwell index in the optimization of asymmetric gradient waveforms yields efficient
tensor-valued encoding with concomitant gradients that have a negligible effect on the signal.
This waveform design is especially relevant in combination with strong gradients, long encoding
times, thick slices, simultaneous multi-slice acquisition and large/oblique FOVs.
