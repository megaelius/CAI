A nonlocal response theory was developed to describe a many-electron system within the neighborhood
of a nanostructure radiating the longitudinal and transverse electric fields, which are fundamentally
reduced to the scalar and vector potentials (SP and VP). The coexistence of the SP and VP incidences
distinguishes such a near-field optical system from the ordinary optical system, in which only
the VP (under the Coulomb gauge) incidence survives far from the light source. This fact is the motivation
for equal treatment of the SP and VP as the cause of the response in the near-field optical system.
In the semiclassical treatment, the linear and nonlinear single susceptibilities are derived
in the form of Heisenberg operators by the functional derivatives of the action integral of the matter
with respect to the SP and VP. These single susceptibilities relate the SP and VP (as the cause) to
the induced charge and current densities (as the result), and guarantee charge conservation and
gauge invariance; this theory is free from gauge-fixing. It is necessary to consider the quantum
many-electron effect (exchange-correlation effect) to make the ground state bounded in the non-perturbed
system. This is done by employing the fundamental idea of density functional theory, instead of
the ordinary unequal treatment of the SP and VP, that is, remaking the SP into a Coulomb interaction
between electron charges. Applying the present linear response theory to the non-metallic material
in a limited near-field optical system reveals that the electric field with the associated permittivity
is not suitable quantity to describe the response, instead, the SP and VP with associate single susceptibility
are essential.
