With X-ray radiation protection and dose management constantly gaining interest in interventional
radiology, novel procedures often undergo prospective dose studies using anthropomorphic phantoms
to determine expected dose values. Due to inherent uncertainties, these dose values might not allow
for patient-specific risk assessment. Therefore, first the aim of this study is to quantify the
influence of these parameters on local X-ray dose to evaluate their relevance in the assessment
of patient-specific organ doses. Second, this knowledge further enables validating a simulation
approach, which allows employing physiological material models and patient-specific geometries.
Phantom dosimetry experiments using MOSFET dosimeters were conducted reproducing imaging scenarios
in prostatic arterial embolization (PAE). Associated organ-equivalent dose of prostate, bladder,
colon and skin was determined. Dose deviation induced by possible small displacements of the patient
was reproduced by moving the X-ray source. Dose deviation induced by material differences was investigated
by analyzing two different commonly used phantoms. We reconstructed the experiments using Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations, a reference male geometry, and different material properties. Overall,
MC simulated organ dose values are in accordance with the measured ones for the majority of cases.
Marginal displacements of X-ray source relative to the phantoms lead to deviations of 6% to 135%
in organ dose values, while skin dose remains relatively constant. Regarding the impact of phantom
material composition, underestimation of internal organ dose values by 12% to 20% is prevalent
in all simulated phantoms. Skin dose, however, can be estimated with low deviation of 1% to 8% at least
for two materials. Prospective reference dose studies might not extend to precise patient-specific
dose assessment.
