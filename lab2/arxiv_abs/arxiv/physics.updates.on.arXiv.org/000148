Macroscopic electroencephalographic (EEG) fields can be an explicit top-down neocortical mechanism
that directly drives bottom-up processes that describe memory, attention, and other neuronal
processes. The top-down mechanism considered are macrocolumnar EEG firings in neocortex, as described
by a statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions (SMNI), developed as a magnetic vector
potential $\mathbf{A}$. The bottom-up process considered are $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves prominent
in synaptic and extracellular processes that are considered to greatly influence neuronal firings.
Here, the complimentary effects are considered, i.e., the influence of $\mathbf{A}$ on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
momentum, $\mathbf{p}$. The canonical momentum of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field,
$\mathbf{\Pi} = \mathbf{p} + q \mathbf{A}$ (SI units), is calculated, where the charge of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
is $q = - 2 e$, $e$ is the magnitude of the charge of an electron. Calculations demonstrate that macroscopic
EEG $\mathbf{A}$ can be quite influential on the momentum $\mathbf{p}$ of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
ions, in both classical and quantum mechanics. Molecular scales of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ wave dynamics
are coupled with $\mathbf{A}$ fields developed at macroscopic regional scales measured by coherent
neuronal firing activity measured by scalp EEG. The project has three main aspects: fitting $\mathbf{A}$
models to EEG data as reported here, building tripartite models to develop $\mathbf{A}$ models,
and studying long coherence times of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves in the presence of $\mathbf{A}$
due to coherent neuronal firings measured by scalp EEG.
