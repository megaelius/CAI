Quantum mechanics places significant restrictions on the hydrodynamics of superfluid flows.
Despite this it has been observed that turbulence in superfluids can, in a statistical sense, share
many of the properties of its classical brethren; coherent bundles of superfluid vortices are often
invoked as an important feature leading to this quasi-classical behavior. A recent experimental
study [E. Rusaouen, B. Rousset, and P.-E. Roche, EPL, {\bf 118}, 1, 14005, (2017)] inferred the presence
of these bundles through intermittency in the pressure field, however direct visualization of
the quantized vortices to corroborate this finding was not possible. In this work, we performed
detailed numerical simulations of superfluid turbulence at the level of individual quantized
vortices through the vortex filament model. Through course-graining of the turbulent fields,
we find compelling evidence supporting these conclusions at low temperature. Moreover, elementary
simulations of an isolated bundle show that the number of vortices inside a bundle can be directly
inferred from the magnitude of the pressure dip, with good theoretical agreement derived from the
HVBK equations. Full simulations of superfluid turbulence show strong spatial correlations between
course-grained vorticity and low pressure regions, with intermittent vortex bundles appearing
as deviations from the underlying Maxwellian (vorticity) and Gaussian (pressure) distributions.
Finally, simulations of a decaying random tangle in an ultra-quantum regime show a unique fingerprint
in the evolution of the pressure distribution, which we argue can be fully understood using the HVBK
framework.
