Purpose: In many clinical MRI scenarios, existing imaging information can be used to significantly
shorten acquisition time or to improve Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper the authors present
a framework for fast MRI by exploiting a reference image (FASTMER). Methods: The proposed approach
utilizes the possible similarity of the reference image that exists in many clinical MRI imaging
scenarios. Such scenarios include similarity between adjacent slices in high resolution MRI,
similarity between various contrasts in the same scan and similarity between different scans of
the same patient. The authors take into account that the reference image may exhibit low similarity
with the acquired image and develop an iterative weighted approach for reconstruction, which tunes
the weights according to the degree of similarity. Results: Experimental results demonstrate
the performance of the method in three different clinical MRI scenarios: SNR improvement in high
resolution brain MRI, exploiting similarity between T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery (FLAIR) for fast FLAIR scanning and utilizing similarity between baseline and follow-up
scans for fast follow-up. Results outperform reconstruction results of existing state-of-the-art
methods. Conclusions: The authors present a method for fast MRI by exploiting a reference image.
The method is based on an iterative reconstruction approach that supports cases in which similarity
to the reference scan is not guaranteed, which enables the applicability of the method to a variety
of MRI applications. Thanks to the existence of reference images in various clinical imaging scenarios,
the proposed framework can play a major part in improving reconstruction in many MR applications.
