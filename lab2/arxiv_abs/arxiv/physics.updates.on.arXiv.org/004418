Purpose: Many tools exist for quantifying magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. Literature
comparing them is sparse but indicates potential methodological bias. We benchmark MRS analysis
tools to elucidate this. Methods: Four series of phantom experiments, including both solutions
and tissue-mimicking gels, with constant concentrations of NAA, Creatine, Glutamine and Glutamate,
and iteratively increased concentrations of GABA are performed. MEGA-PRESS spectra are acquired
and quantified with several state-of-the-art MRS analysis tools (LCModel, TARQUIN, JMRUI, GANNET)
and in-house code (LWFIT). GABA-to-NAA ratios for reported metabolite amplitudes are compared
to the ground truth of known concentration ratios. Overall estimation accuracy is assessed by linear
fits of reported vs. actual ratios and coefficients of determination. Simulations further elucidate
the experimental results. Results: Significant differences in reported GABA-to-NAA amplitude
ratios are observed. TARQUIN consistently overestimates, while most tools underestimate ratios
to varying degrees compared to the ground truth. Underestimationdue to reduced editing efficiency
is predicted by simulations. LCModel performs comparatively well for well-resolved solution
spectra but struggles for intentionally miscalibrated spectra and gel spectra mimicking in-vivo
conditions. GANNET shows better consistency and robustness to calibration errors but greater
underestimation related to how the 3 ppm GABA peak is fitted. Surprisingly, simple peak integration
with minimal pre-processing yields the most consistent and accurate results compared to the ground
truth. Conclusions: A methodological dependence is observed not only in the quantification results
for individual spectra, but in GABA-to-NAA gradients across experimental series, systematic
offsets and coefficients of determination.
