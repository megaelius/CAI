The coherence of the interaction of light with a collisionless gas (Einstein 1917) founds the theory
of gas lasers. It is, for the understanding of universe, a simpler and more powerful tool than the
big bang which requires questionable supplements (dark matter, MOND, etc..). The Impulsive Stimulated
Raman Scattering (ISRS) redshifts gradually light pulses which cross excited atomic hydrogen
H*, so that the redshift is a measure of the column density of H*. Thus, the distance of the hot stars,
surrounded by much H*, is exaggerated by the use of Hubble's law. Local exaggerated distances create
voids in the maps of galaxies which become spongy. The interpretation of spectra of quasars, the
periodicity of galaxy redshifts introduce an experimental "Karlsson's constant" exactly computed
by ISRS. The need for dark matter comes from the exaggeration of the distance, therefore the size
of galaxies. Without dark matter, celestial mechanics provides a reliable distance of spiral galaxies.
Coherence also introduces superradiance and mode competition that explain that only the limbs
of Str\"omgren spheres are visible as circles maybe punctuated by an even number of dots: Too numerous,
the figures assigned to gravitational lenses can be such limbs. The coincidence of the ignition
of the rings of SNR1987A with the extinction of the star is due to a multiphoton coherent scattering
of star light, which amplifies the superradiant emission of the rings.. A blueshift of microwaves
crossing H* resulting, between 10 and 15 AU, of the expansion of solar wind, explains the "anomalous
acceleration" of Pioneer probes. All is obtained without any change in theories of standard spectroscopy.
