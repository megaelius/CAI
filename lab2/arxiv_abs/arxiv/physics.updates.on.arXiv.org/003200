Mask-based pattern generation is a crucial step in microchip production. The next-generation
extreme-ultraviolet- (EUV) lithography instruments with a wavelength of \SI{13.5}{\nano\meter}
is currently under development. In principle, this should allow patterning down to a resolution
of a few nanometers in a single exposure. However, there are many technical challenges, including
those due to the very high energy of the photons. Lithography with metastable atoms has been suggested
as a cost-effective, less-complex alternative to EUV lithography. The great advantage of atom
lithography is that the kinetic energy of an atom is much smaller than that of a photon for a given wavelength.
However, up till now no method has been available for making masks for atom lithography that can produce
arbitrary, high resolution patterns. Here we present a solution to this problem. First, traditional
binary holography is extended to near-field binary holography, based on Fresnel diffraction.
By this technique, we demonstrate that it is possible to make masks that can generate arbitrary patterns
in a plane in the near field (from the mask) with a resolution down to the nanometer range using a state
of the art metastable helium source. We compare the flux of this source to that of an established EUV
source (ASML, NXE:3100) and show that patterns can potentially be produced at comparable speeds.
Finally, we present an extension of the grid-based holography method for a grid of hexagonally shaped
subcells. Our method can be used with any beam that can be modeled as a scalar wave, including other
matter-wave beams such as helium ions, electrons or acoustic waves.
