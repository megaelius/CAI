Viscous fingering experiments in Hele-Shaw cells lead to striking pattern formations which have
been the subject of intense focus among the physics and applied mathematics community for many years.
In recent times, much attention has been devoted to devising strategies for controlling such patterns
and reducing the growth of the interfacial fingers. We continue this research by reporting on numerical
simulations, based on the level set method, of a generalised Hele-Shaw model for which the geometry
of the Hele-Shaw cell is altered. First, we investigate how imposing constant and time-dependent
injection rates in a Hele-Shaw cell that is either standard, tapered or rotating can be used to reduce
the development of viscous fingering when an inviscid fluid is injected into a viscous fluid over
a finite time period. We perform a series of numerical experiments comparing the effectiveness
of each strategy to determine how these non-standard Hele-Shaw configurations influence the morphological
features of the inviscid-viscous fluid interface. Tapering plates in either converging or diverging
directions leads to reduced metrics of viscous fingering at the final time when compared to the standard
parallel configuration, especially with carefully chosen injection rates; for the rotating plate
case, the effect is even more dramatic, with sufficiently large rotation rates completely stabilising
the interface. Next, we illustrate how the number of non-splitting fingers can be controlled by
injecting the inviscid fluid at a time-dependent rate while increasing the gap between the plates.
Simulations compare well with previous experimental results for various injection rates and geometric
configurations. Further, we demonstrate how the fully nonlinear dynamics of the problem affect
the number of fingers that emerge and how well this number agrees with predictions from linear stability
analysis.
