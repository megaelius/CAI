The highly heterogeneous and biologically active continental shelf-seas are important components
of the oceanic carbon sink. Carbon rich water from shelf-seas is exported at depth to the open ocean,
a process known as the continental shelf pump, with open-ocean surface water moving (transported)
onto the shelf driving the export at depth. Existing methods to study shelf-wide exchange focus
on the wind or geostrophic currents, often ignoring their combined effect, spatial heterogeniety
or any other ageostrophic components. Here we investigate the influence that wind, wave and current
interactions can have on surface transport and carbon export across continental shelves. Using
a 21 year global re-analysis dataset we confirm that geostrophic and wind driven Ekman processes
are important for the transport of water onto shelf seas; but the dominance of each is location and
season dependent. A global wave model re-analysis shows that one type of ageostrophic flow, Stokes
drift due to waves, can also be significant. A regional case study using two submesocale model simulations
identifies that up to 100% of the cross-shelf surface flow in European seas can be due to ageostrophic
components. Using these results and grouping shelf-seas based on their observed carbon accumulation
rates shows that differences in rates are consistent with imbalances between the processes driving
atmosphere-ocean exchange at the surface and those driving carbon export at depth. Therefore expected
future changes in wind and wave climate support the need to monitor cross-shelf transport and the
size of the continental shelf-sea carbon pump. The results presented show that the Sea Surface Kinematics
Multiscale monitoring satellite mission (SKIM), will be capable of providing measurements of
the total cross-shelf current, which are now needed to enable routine monitoring of the global continental
shelf-sea carbon pump.
