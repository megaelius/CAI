Quantifying the mechanisms of tracer dispersion in the ocean remains a central question in oceanography,
for problems ranging from nutrient delivery to phytoplankton, to the early detection of contaminants.
Until now, most of the analysis has been based on Lagrangian concepts of transport, often focusing
on the identification of features that minimize exchange, or more recently, on network tools which
focus on connectivity and exchange of information. Neither of these approaches, however, allows
us to rank the geographical sites of major water passage, and at the same time, to select them so that
they monitor waters coming from independent parts of the ocean. These are instead key criteria when
deploying an observing network. Here we address this issue by estimating at any point the extent
of the ocean surface which transits through it in a given time window. With such quantities we are
able to rank the sites with major fluxes that intercept waters originating from different regions.
We show that this information leads to the optimization of an observing network, where a set of sampling
sites can be chosen so as to maximize the monitored upstream surface. The same analysis, applied
instead backward in time, allows us to identify the major sources which feed a target region. The
method is applied to the Kerguelen area in the Southern Ocean, using altimetry-derived velocity
fields that are validated by observed trajectories of 43 surface drifters, along with statistics
on the temporal persistence of the stations determined in this study. We then identify possible
hotspots of micro-nutrient enrichment for the recurrent spring phytoplanktonic bloom in the Kerguelen
region. Possible applications to other fields, such as larval dispersion or contaminant detection,
are then discussed.
