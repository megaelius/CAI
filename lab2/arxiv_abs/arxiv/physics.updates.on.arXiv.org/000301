A new potential vorticity is derived by using a specific entropy formulation expressed in terms
of a moist-air entropy potential temperature. The new formulation is compared with Ertel's version
and with others based on virtual and equivalent potential temperatures. The new potential vorticity
is subject to conservative properties ensured by the Second Law applied to the moist-air material
derivatives. It is shown that the upper tropospheric and stratospheric (dry) structures are nearly
the same as those obtained with Ertel's component. Moreover, new structures are observed in the
low troposphere, with negative values associated with moist frontal regions. The negative values
are observed in the frontal regions where slantwise convection instabilities may take place, but
they are smaller than those observed with the equivalent potential vorticity. The main purpose
of the article is to diagnose the behaviour of the new potential vorticity from numerical output
generated by the ARPEGE NWP model, with the help of isobaric charts and vertical cross-sections.
Two inversion methods are suggested. The first method could be based on the invertibility principle
verified by the virtual potential vorticity, with a possibility to control and modify separately
potential vorticity components in the (dry) upper and (moist) lower atmospheric levels. The other
method may consist of an inversion process directly applied to the new moist-air entropy potential
vorticity, because the negative values and the solenoidal term are smaller than those observed
with equivalent potential vorticity, as shown by numerical evaluations.
