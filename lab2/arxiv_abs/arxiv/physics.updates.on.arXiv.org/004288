Increasingly complex, non-linear World-Earth system models are used for describing the dynamics
of the biophysical Earth system and the socio-economic and socio-cultural World of human societies
and their interactions. Identifying pathways towards a sustainable future in these models for
informing policy makers and the wider public, e.g. pathways leading to a robust mitigation of dangerous
anthropogenic climate change, is a challenging and widely investigated task in the field of climate
research and broader Earth system science. This problem is particularly difficult when constraints
on avoiding transgressions of planetary boundaries and social foundations need to be taken into
account. In this work, we propose to combine recently developed machine learning techniques, namely
deep reinforcement learning (DRL), with classical analysis of trajectories in the World-Earth
system. Based on the concept of the agent-environment interface, we develop an agent that is generally
able to act and learn in variable manageable environment models of the Earth system. We demonstrate
the potential of our framework by applying DRL algorithms to two stylized World-Earth system models.
Conceptually, we explore thereby the feasibility of finding novel global governance policies
leading into a safe and just operating space constrained by certain planetary and socio-economic
boundaries. The artificially intelligent agent learns that the timing of a specific mix of taxing
carbon emissions and subsidies on renewables is of crucial relevance for finding World-Earth system
trajectories that are sustainable on the long term.
