In the present work, we report a detailed description of the symmetry properties of the eight-atomic
molecule ethane, with the aim of facilitating the variational calculations of rotation-vibration
spectra of ethane and related molecules. Ethane consists of two methyl groups $\text{CH}_3$ where
the internal rotation (torsion) of one $\text{CH}_3$ group relative to the other is of large amplitude
and involves tunneling between multiple minima of the potential energy function. The molecular
symmetry group of ethane is the 36-element group $G_{36}$ but the construction of symmetrized basis
functions is most conveniently done in terms of the 72-element extended molecular symmetry group
$G_{36}\text{(EM)}$. This group can subsequently be used in the construction of block-diagonal
matrix representations of the ro-vibrational Hamiltonian for ethane. The derived transformation
matrices associated with $G_{36}\text{(EM)}$ have been implemented in the variational nuclear
motion program TROVE (Theoretical ROVibrational Energies). TROVE variational calculations
will be used as a practical example of a $G_{36}\text{(EM)}$ symmetry adaptation for large systems
with a non-rigid, torsional degree of freedom. We present the derivation of irreducible transformation
matrices for all 36 (72) operations of $G_{36}\text{(M)}$ ($G_{36}\text{(EM)}$) and also describe
algorithms for a numerical construction of these matrices based on a set of four (five) generators.
The methodology presented is illustrated on the construction of the symmetry-adapted representations
both of the potential energy function of ethane and of the rotation, torsion and vibration basis
set functions.
