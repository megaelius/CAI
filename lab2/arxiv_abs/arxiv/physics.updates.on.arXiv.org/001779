The interaction of electromagnetic waves with metallic nanostructures generates resonant oscillations
of the conduction-band electrons at the metal surface. These resonances can lead to large enhancements
of the incident field and to the confinement of light to small regions, typically several orders
of magnitude smaller than the incident wavelength. The accurate prediction of these resonances
entails several challenges. Small geometric variations in the plasmonic structure may lead to
large variations in the electromagnetic field responses. Furthermore, the material parameters
that characterize the optical behavior of metals at the nanoscale need to be determined experimentally
and are consequently subject to measurement errors. It then becomes essential that any predictive
tool for the simulation and design of plasmonic structures accounts for fabrication tolerances
and measurement uncertainties. In this paper, we develop a reduced order modeling framework that
is capable of real-time accurate electromagnetic responses of plasmonic nanogap structures for
a wide range of geometry and material parameters. The main ingredients of the proposed method are:
(i) the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method to numerically solve the equations governing
electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric and metallic media, (ii) a reference domain formulation
of the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations to account for geometry variations; and (iii) proper
orthogonal decomposition and empirical interpolation techniques to construct an efficient reduced
model. To demonstrate effectiveness of the models developed, we analyze geometry sensitivities
and explore optimal designs of a 3D periodic annular nanogap structure.
