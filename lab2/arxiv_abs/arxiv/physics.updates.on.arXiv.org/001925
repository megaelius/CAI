Sheared granular layers undergoing stick slip behavior are broadly employed to study the physics
and dynamics of earthquakes. Here, a two dimensional implementation of the combined finite discrete
element method (FDEM), which merges the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element method
(DEM), is used to explicitly simulate a sheared granular fault system including both gouge and plate,
and to investigate the influence of different normal loads on seismic moment, macroscopic friction
coefficient, kinetic energy, gouge layer thickness, and recurrence time between slips. In the
FDEM model, the deformation of plates and particles is simulated using the FEM formulation while
particle particle and particle plate interactions are modeled using DEM derived techniques. The
simulated seismic moment distributions are generally consistent with those obtained from the
laboratory experiments. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that with increasing
normal load, (i) the kinetic energy of the granular fault system increases; (ii) the gouge layer
thickness shows a decreasing trend; and (iii) the macroscopic friction coefficient does not experience
much change. Analyses of the slip events reveal that, as the normal load increases, more slip events
with large kinetic energy release and longer recurrence time occur, and the magnitude of gouge layer
thickness decrease also tends to be larger; while the macroscopic friction coefficient drop decreases.
The simulations not only reveal the influence of normal loads on the dynamics of sheared granular
fault gouge, but also demonstrate the capabilities of FDEM for studying stick slip dynamic behavior
of granular fault systems.
