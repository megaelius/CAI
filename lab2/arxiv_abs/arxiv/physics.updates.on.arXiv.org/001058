The reactor antineutrino energy spectra and flux were reevaluated during the preparation of the
recent experiments devoted to the measurement of $\theta_{13}$. Consequently some discrepancies
between data and the theoretical predictions in reactor antineutrino experiments at short distances
were observed when using the new predicted flux and spectra. This problem has been called the Reactor
Antineutrino Anomaly (RAA), which together with the gallium anomaly, both show discrepancies
with respect to the expectations at the $\sim$ 3 $\sigma$ level. Oscillations into a light sterile
neutrino state ($\Delta m^{2} \sim 1eV^{2}$) could account for such deficits. The SoLid experiment
has been conceived to give an unambiguous response to the hypothesis of a light sterile neutrino
as the origin of the RAA. To this end, SoLid is searching for an oscillation pattern at short baselines
(6-9 m) in the energy spectrum of the $\overline{\nu}_{e}$'s emitted by the SCK\raisebox{-0.9ex}{\scalebox{2.8}{$\cdot$}}CEN
BR2 reactor in Belgium. The detector uses a novel technology, combining PVT (cubes of 5$\times$5$\times$5
cm$^3$) and $^6$LiF:ZnS (sheets $\sim$ 250 $\mu$m thickness) scintillators. It is highly segmented
(modules of 10 planes of 16$\times$16 cubes), and it's read out by a network of wavelength shifting
fibers and SiPMs. The fine segmentation and the hybrid technology of the detector allows the clear
identification of the neutrino signals, reducing significantly backgrounds. Thus, a high experimental
sensitivity can be achieved. A 288 kg prototype was deployed in 2015, showing the feasibility of
the detection principle. A full scale detector (1.6 tons) is currently under construction, the
data taking with the first detector modules is expected by the end of 2017.
