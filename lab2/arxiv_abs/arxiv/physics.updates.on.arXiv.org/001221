Biophysical modeling is the mediator of evaluating the cellular structure of biological tissues
using diffusion-weighted MRI. It is however the bottleneck of microstructural MRI. Beyond the
complexity of diffusion, the current development is hindered by the fact that biophysical models
heavily rely on diffusion-specific properties of diverse cellular compartments that are still
unknown and must be measured in vivo. Obtaining such parameters by straightforward fitting is hindered
by the degenerated landscape of the likelihood functions, in particular, the signal obtained for
multiple diffusion directions and moderate diffusion weighting strength is not enough to estimate
these parameters: different parameter constellations explain the signal equally well. The aim
of this study is to measure the central parameter of white matter models, namely the intra-axonal
water diffusivity in the normal human brain. Proper estimation of this parameter is complicated
due to (i) the presence of both intra- and extra-axonal water compartments and (ii) the orientation
dispersion of axons. Our measurement involves an efficient suppression of extra-axonal space
and all cellular processes oriented outside a narrow cone around the principal fiber direction.
This is achieved using a planar water mobility filter -- a strong diffusion weighting that suppresses
signal from all molecules that are mobile in the plane transverse to the fiber bundle. Following
the planar filter, the diffusivity in the remaining compartment is measured using linear and isotropic
weighting. We find the specifically averaged intra-axonal diffusivity $D_0 = 2.25\pm 0.03{\,\rm
\mu m^2/ms}$ for the timing of the applied gradients. Extrapolation to the infinite diffusion time
gives $D_\infty \approx 2.0{\,\rm \mu m^2/ms}$. This result imposes a strong limitation on the
parameter selection for biophysical modeling of diffusion-weighted MRI.
