As a result of a collaboration between Jefferson Lab and niobium manufacturer CBMM, ingot niobium
was explored as a possible material for superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavity fabrication.
The first single cell cavity from large grain high purity niobium was fabricated and successfully
tested at Jefferson Lab in 2004. This pioneering work triggered research activities in other SRF
laboratories around the world. Large grain niobium became not only an interesting alternative
material for cavity builders, but also material scientists and surface scientists were eager to
participate in the development of this material. Most of the original expectations for this material
of being less costly and allowing less expensive fabrication and treatment procedures at the same
performance levels in cavities have been met. Many single cell cavities made from material of different
suppliers have been tested successfully and several multi-cell cavities have shown the performances
comparable to the best cavities made from standard poly-crystalline niobium. Several 9-cell cavities
fabricated by Research Instruments and tested at DESY exceeded the best performing fine grain cavities
with a record accelerating gradient of Eacc = 45.6 MV/m. Recently- at JLab- by using a new furnace
treatment procedure a single cell cavity made of ingot niobium performed at a remarkably high Q0-value
(~5x10^10) at an accelerating gradient of ~20 MV/m, at 2K. Such performance levels push the state-of-the
art of SRF technology to new limits and are of great interest for future accelerators. This contribution
reviews the development of ingot niobium technology and attempts to make a case for this material
being the choice for future accelerators.
