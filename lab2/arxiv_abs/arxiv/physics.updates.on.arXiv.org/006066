Data-driven turbulence modeling is a newly emerged research area in thermal hydraulics simulation
of nuclear power plant (NPP). The most common CFD method used in NPP thermal hydraulics simulation
is Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method, which still has acknowledged deficiencies
not only in the calculation speed but also in the complexity of choosing turbulence model and parameters
for different flow patterns. Data-driven turbulence modeling aims to develop a RANS-based method
which not only computationally efficient but also applicable to different flow patterns. To achieve
this goal, the first step is to develop an approach to properly perform RANS for selected flow patterns.
In this work, a machine learning approach is selected to achieve this goal. The main purpose of this
study is to perform a data-driven approach to model turbulence Reynolds stress leveraging the potential
of massive direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The approach is validated by a turbulence flow
validation case: a parallel plane quasi-steady state turbulence flow case. The work contains three
parts. The first part is database preparation. In this step, turbulence properties (Reynolds stress)
are extracted from DNS results, which are considered as "physically correct data". Meanwhile,
flow features are extracted from RANS results, which are considered as "data to be corrected". The
second part is surrogate model establishment. In this step, a data-driven regression function
is trained between flow features and turbulence properties obtained from the previous step. The
last part is model validation, which is applying trained data-driven regression function to a test
case to validate this approach.
