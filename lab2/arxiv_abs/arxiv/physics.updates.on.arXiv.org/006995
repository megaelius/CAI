We are modelling multi-scale, multi-physics uncertainty in wave-current interaction (WCI).
To model uncertainty in WCI, we introduce stochasticity into the wave dynamics of two classic models
of WCI; namely, the Generalised Lagrangian Mean (GLM) model and the Craik--Leibovich (CL) model.
The key idea for the GLM approach is the separation of the Lagrangian (fluid) and Eulerian (wave)
degrees of freedom in Hamilton's principle. This is done by coupling an Euler--Poincar\'e {\it
reduced Lagrangian} for the current flow and a {\it phase-space Lagrangian} for the wave field.
WCI in the GLM model involves the nonlinear Doppler shift in frequency of the Hamiltonian wave subsystem,
which arises because the waves propagate in the frame of motion of the Lagrangian-mean velocity
of the current. In contrast, WCI in the CL model arises because the fluid velocity is defined relative
to the frame of motion of the Stokes mean drift velocity, which is usually taken to be prescribed,
time independent and driven externally. We compare the GLM and CL theories by placing them both into
the general framework of a stochastic Hamilton's principle for a 3D Euler--Boussinesq (EB) fluid
in a rotating frame. In other examples, we also apply the GLM and CL methods to add wave physics and
stochasticity to the familiar 1D and 2D shallow water flow models. The differences in the types of
stochasticity which arise for GLM and CL models can be seen by comparing the Kelvin circulation theorems
for the two models. The GLM model acquires stochasticity in its Lagrangian transport velocity for
the currents and also in its group velocity for the waves. The Kelvin circulation theorem stochastic
CL model can accept stochasticity in its both its integrand and in the Lagrangian transport velocity
of its circulation loop.
