According to our current conception of physics, any valid physical theory is assumed to describe
the objective evolution of a unique external world. However, this assumption is challenged by quantum
theory, which suggests that physical systems should not always be understood as having objective
properties which are simply revealed by measurement. Furthermore, as argued below, several other
conceptual puzzles in the foundations of physics and related fields point to possible limitations
of our current perspective and motivate the exploration of alternatives. Thus, in this paper, I
propose such an alternative approach (related to Solomonoff induction) which starts with a (rigorously
formalized) concept of "observer state" as its primary notion, and does not from the outset assume
the existence of a "world" or physical laws. Using tools from algorithmic information theory, I
show that the resulting theory predicts, as a consequence of this, that it appears to observers as
if there is a world that evolves according to algorithmically simple, computable, probabilistic
laws. In contrast to the standard view, objective reality is not assumed on this approach but rather
provably emerges as an asymptotic statistical phenomenon. The resulting theory dissolves puzzles
like cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem, makes concrete predictions for thought experiments
involving the duplication and computer simulation of observers, and predicts novel phenomena
such as "probabilistic zombies" governed by observer-dependent probabilistic chances. It identifies
some phenomena of quantum theory (Bell inequality violation and no-signalling) as typical consequences
of information-theoretic features of an agent's memory, and suggests that we shift our attention
in the foundations of quantum mechanics from "what is really going on?" to questions about algorithms,
causality and computational models.
