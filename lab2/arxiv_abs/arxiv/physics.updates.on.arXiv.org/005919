We present three distinct examples where phaseless auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC)
can be reliably performed with a single-determinant trial wavefunction with essential symmetry
breaking. We first utilized essential time-reversal symmetry breaking with ph-AFQMC to compute
the triplet-singlet energy gap in the TS12 set. We found statistically better performance of ph-AFQMC
with complex-restricted orbitals than with spin-unrestricted orbitals. We then showed the utilization
of essential spin symmetry breaking when computing the single-triplet gap of a known biradicaloid,
C$_{36}$. ph-AFQMC with spin-unrestricted Hartree-Fock (ph-AFQMC+UHF) fails catastrophically
even with spin-projection and predicts no biradicaloid character. With approximate Brueckner
orbitals obtained from regularized orbital-optimized second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation
theory ($\kappa$-OOMP2), ph-AFQMC quantitatively captures strong biradicaloid character of
C$_{36}$. Lastly, we applied ph-AFQMC to the computation of the quintet-triplet gap in a model iron
porphyrin complex where brute-force methods with a small active space fail to capture the triplet
ground state. We show unambiguously that neither triplet nor quintet is strongly correlated using
UHF, $\kappa$-OOMP2, and coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) performed on UHF and
$\kappa$-OOMP2 orbitals. There is no essential symmetry breaking in this problem. By virtue of
this, we were able to perform UHF+ph-AFQMC reliably with a cc-pVTZ basis set and predicted a triplet
ground state for this model geometry. The largest ph-AFQMC in this work correlated 186 electrons
in 956 orbitals. Our work highlights the utility, scalability, and accuracy of ph-AFQMC with a single
determinant trial wavefunction with essential symmetry breaking for systems mainly dominated
by dynamical correlation with little static correlation.
