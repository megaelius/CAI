The hydrodynamic and thermal characteristics of a freely-vibrating circular cylinder in mixed
convection flow are numerically investigated at low Reynolds numbers. The numerical investigations
are conducted for a range of parameters, Ur = [2.0, 10], Pr = [0.7, 10] and Ri = [0.5, 2.0]. Whereas the
Reynolds number, the mass ratio and the damping ratio are fixed. A secondary VIV lock-in region is
found in the cases of high Richardson number Ri=2.0 for high reduced velocity values, in which the
buoyancy-driven flow is non-trivial. A wide VIV lock-in region is formed with tremendous energy
transfer between fluid and structure, which is extremely meaningful for hydropower harvesting.
The influences of Prandtl and Richardson numbers on the hydrodynamics, structural dynamics and
heat transfer are discussed in detail. The temperature contours are concentrated around cylinder
for the cases of high Prandtl number, which are associated with high mean Nusselt values. The influence
on heat transfer efficiency over the cylinder's surface is quantified via the calculation of mean
Nusselt number and its fluctuation for different circumstances. The energy transfer coefficient
is employed to quantify the energy transfer between fluid and structure in mixed convection flow.
The phase angle difference between the transverse displacement of cylinder and the lift force is
used to support the discussions of energy transfer. A stabilized finite element formulation in
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian description is derived. The structural dynamics and vortex-induced
vibration are documented for various environments, e.g., different reduced velocity, Prandtl
numbers and Richardson numbers. The influence of structural dynamics on the heat transfer efficiency
over a heated cylinder is recorded and discussed as well. The obtained numerical results match well
with literature and the established empirical formula.
