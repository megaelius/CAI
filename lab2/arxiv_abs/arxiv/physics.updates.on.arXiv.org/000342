In a uniformly rotating fluid, inertial waves propagate along rays that are inclined to the rotation
axis by an angle that depends on the wave frequency. In closed domains, multiple reflections from
the boundaries may cause inertial waves to focus on to particular structures known as wave attractors.
Such structures have previously been studied from a theoretical point of view, in laboratory experiments,
in linear numerical calculations and in some recent numerical simulations. In the present paper,
two-dimensional direct numerical simulations of an inertial wave attractor are presented. In
the linear regime, we first recover the results of the linear calculations and asymptotic theory
of Ogilvie (2005) who considered a prototypical problem involving the focusing of linear internal
waves into a narrow beam centred on a wave attractor in a steady state. The velocity profile of the
beam and its scalings with the Ekman number, as well as the asymptotic value of the dissipation rate,
are found to be in agreement with the linear theory. We also find that, as the beam builds up around
the wave attractor, the power input by the applied force reaches its limiting value more rapidly
than the dissipation rate, which saturates only when the beam has reached its final thickness. In
the nonlinear regime, the beam is strongly affected and becomes unstable to a subharmonic instability.
This instability transfers energy to secondary waves possessing shorter wavelengths and lower
frequencies. The onset of the instability of a narrow inertial wave beam is investigated by means
of a separate linear analysis and the results, such as the onset of the instability, are found to be
consistent with the global simulations of the wave attractor. The excitation of such secondary
waves described theoretically in this work has also been seen in recent laboratory experiments
on internal gravity waves.
