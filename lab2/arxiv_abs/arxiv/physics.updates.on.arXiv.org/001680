Due to high exploitation costs and other environmental issues, it would be desirable to phase out
large cinema projection systems based on standard xenon lamps in favor of laser based projection
devices. Lasers provide longer lifetime and wider color gamut of light output. But the high degree
of coherence of these sources also lead to the formation of granular structures, usually known as
speckle. When an imaging system is involved, as in the cinema projection case because of the capacity
of the human eye to form an image of the screen, we speak about subjective speckle. In order to remove
this spatial random pattern, different methods have been studied as temporal and/or spatial coherence
reduction. But most of them can't be used in the context of cinema projection because they don't respect
the cinematography projection standard. In our work, we have studied the possibility to reduce
the subjective speckle either by changing the coherence of the light source or by studying the influence
of the different elements constituting the projection display in the conditions imposed by cinematography
industry. Thanks to a lasers array formed by N independant semiconductor lasers, we have measured
the evolution of the subjective speckle contrast in function of the number of sources. The resulting
contrast discreases as a square root function and reach a saturation level when a light pipe is used.
This behavior is directly due to the light pipe which limit at its output the spatial coherence of
the source. Futhermore, in a different configuration, we have studied the influence of diffusers
and the magnification of the projector zoom. It has been demonstrated that magnification plays
an important role on the speckle formation because it increases the coherence length determined
by the light pipe. On the contrary, the diffusers placed before the light pipe doesn't change the
subjective speckle.
