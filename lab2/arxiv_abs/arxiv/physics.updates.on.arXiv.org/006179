We describe a generalized formalism, addressing the fundamental problem of reflection and transmission
of complex optical waves at a plane dielectric interface. Our formalism involves the application
of generalized operator matrices to the incident constituent plane wave fields to obtain the reflected
and transmitted constituent plane wave fields. We derive these matrices and describe the complete
formalism by implementing these matrices. This formalism, though physically equivalent to Fresnel
formalism, has greater mathematical elegance and computational efficiency as compared to the
latter. We utilize exact 3D expressions of the constituent plane wavevectors and electric fields
of the incident, reflected and transmitted waves, which enable us to seamlessly analyse plane waves,
paraxial and non-paraxial beams, highly diverging and tightly focused beam-fields as well as waves
of miscellaneous wavefront-shapes and properties using the single formalism. The exact electric
field expressions automatically include the geometric phase information; while we retain the
wavefront curvature information by using appropriate multiplicative factors. We demonstrate
our formalism by obtaining the reflected and transmitted fields in a simulated Gaussian beam model;
in particular, by exploring the existence and nature of phase vortex in the longitudinal electric
field component of the reflected beam -- thus showing spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion.
Finally, we briefly discuss how our generalized formalism is capable of analysing the reflection-transmission
problem of a very large class of complex optical waves -- by referring to some novel works from the
current literature as exemplary cases.
