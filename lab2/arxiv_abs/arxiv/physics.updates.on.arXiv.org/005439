The radial speed of a coronal mass ejection (CME) determines the shock-driving capability of a CME
as indicated by the presence of a type II radio burst. Here we report on the April 18, 2014 CME that was
associated with a type II radio burst in the metric and interplanetary domains. We used the radio-burst
data provided by the San Vito Solar Observatory of the Radio Solar Telescope Network and data from
the Wind spacecraft. The CME is a full halo in the field of view of the coronagraphs on board the Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The CME was also observed by the coronagraphs on board the
Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). We computed the CME shock and flux rope speeds
based on the multi-view observations by the different coronagraphs and by EUV instruments. We determined
the shock speed from metric and interplanetary radio observations and found them to be consistent
with white-light observations, provided the metric type II burst and its continuation into the
decameter-hectometric domain are produced at the shock flanks, where the speed is still high enough
to accelerate electrons that produce the type II bursts. Interestingly, there was an interplanetary
type II burst segment consistent with an origin at the shock nose suggesting that the curved shock
was crossing plasma levels separated by a few solar radii. We conclude that the CME speed is high enough
to produce the interplanetary Type II burst and a solar energetic particle (SEP) event. However,
the speed is not high enough to produce a ground level enhancement (GLE) event, which requires the
shock to form at a height of ~1.5 Rs.
