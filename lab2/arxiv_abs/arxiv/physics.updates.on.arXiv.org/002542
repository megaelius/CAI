The sequential fully implicit (SFI) method was introduced along with the development of the multiscale
finite volume (MSFV) framework, and has received considerable attention in recent years. Each
time step for SFI consists of an outer loop to solve the coupled system, in which there is one inner
Newton loop to implicitly solve the pressure equation and another loop to implicitly solve the transport
equations. Limited research has been conducted that deals with the outer coupling level to investigate
the convergence performance. In this paper we extend the basic SFI method with several nonlinear
acceleration techniques for improving the outer-loop convergence. Specifically, we consider
numerical relaxation, quasi-Newton (QN) and Anderson acceleration (AA) methods. The acceleration
techniques are adapted and studied for the first time within the context of SFI for coupled flow and
transport in porous media. We reveal that the iterative form of SFI is equivalent to a nonlinear block
Gauss-Seidel (BGS) process. The effectiveness of the acceleration techniques is demonstrated
using several challenging examples. The results show that the basic SFI method is quite inefficient,
suffering from slow convergence or even convergence failure. In order to better understand the
behaviors of SFI, we carry out detailed analysis on the coupling mechanisms between the sub-problems.
Compared with the basic SFI method, superior convergence performance is achieved by the acceleration
techniques, which can resolve the convergence difficulties associated with various types of coupling
effects. We show across a wide range of flow conditions that the acceleration techniques can stabilize
the iterative process, and largely reduce the outer iteration count.
