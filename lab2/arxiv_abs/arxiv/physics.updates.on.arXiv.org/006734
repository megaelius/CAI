Two thermal adiabatic boundary conditions arise on the semitransparent window owing to the fact
that whether semitransparent window allows the energy to leave the system by radiation mode of heat
transfer. It is assumed that being low conductivity of semitransparent material, energy does not
leave by conduction mode of heat transfer. This does mean that the semitransparent window may behave
as only conductively adiabatic (qc = 0) or combinedly conductively and radiatively adiabatic (qc
+ qr = 0). In the present work, the above two thermal adiabatic boundary conditions have been investigated
in natural convection problem for the Rayleigh number (Ra) 10^5 and Prandtl number(Pr) 0.71 in a
cavity, whose left vertical wall has been divided into upper and lower parts in the ratio of 4:6. The
upper section is semitransparent window, while lower section is isothermal wall at a temperature
of 296K. A collimated beam is irradiated with different value (0, 100, 500 and 1000 W/m2) on the semitransparent
window at an angle of 45^0 . The cavity is heated from the bottom by convective heating with free stream
temperature of 305K and heat transfer coefficient of 50 W/m2K while right wall is also isothermal
at same temperature as of lower left wall and upper wall is adiabatic. All walls are opaque for radiation
except semitransparent window. The results reveal that the dynamics of both the vortices inside
the cavity change drastically with irradiation value and also with the boundary conditions on the
semitransparent window. The temperature and Nusselt number increase inside the cavity multifold
for combinedly conductively and radiatively adiabatic condition than the only conductively adiabatic
condition on the semitransparent window.
