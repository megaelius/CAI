An analysis of calibration for reduced-order models (ROMs) is presented in this work. The Galerkin
and least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) methods are tested on compressible flows involving
a disparity of temporal scales. A novel calibration strategy is proposed for the LSPG method and
two test cases are analyzed. The first consists of a subsonic airfoil flow where boundary layer instabilities
are responsible for trailing-edge noise generation and the second comprises a supersonic airfoil
flow with a transient period where a detached shock wave propagates upstream at the same time that
shock-vortex interaction occurs at the trailing edge. Results show that calibration produces
stable and long-time accurate for both cases. In order to reduce the computational costs of the LSPG
models, an accelerated greedy missing point estimation (MPE) algorithm is employed for hyper-reduction.
For the first case investigated, LSPG solutions obtained with hyper-reduction show good comparison
with those obtained by the full order model. However, for the supersonic case the transient features
of the flow need to be properly captured by the sampled points. Otherwise, the dynamics of the moving
shock wave are not fully recovered. The impact of different time-marching schemes is also assessed
and, differently than reported in literature, Galerkin models are shown to be more accurate than
those computed by LSPG when the non-conservative form of the Navier-Stokes equations are solved.
For the supersonic case, the Galerkin and LSPG models (without hyper-reduction) capture the overall
dynamics of the detached and oblique shock waves along the airfoil. However, when shock-vortex
interaction occurs at the trailing-edge, the Galerkin ROM is able to capture the high-frequency
fluctuations from vortex shedding while the LSPG presents a more dissipative solution, not being
able to recover the flow dynamics.
