3D printing methods which enable control over the position and orientation of embedded particles
have promising applications in cell patterning and composite scaffolds. Extrusion-based additive
manufacturing techniques such as fused deposition modeling and direct ink writing can experience
particle patterning defects at corners which could hinder cell survival at corners and create unintended
property gradients. Here, we propose models which predict the behavior of deposited lines at corners
for moderate viscosity inks which are impacted by both capillarity and viscous dissipation. Using
direct ink writing with acoustophoresis and a Carbopol-based support gel, we write polygons out
of dental resin-based composite inks containing a narrow distribution of microparticles at the
center of the filament. A Laplace pressure differential between the inner and outer surfaces of
the corner drives corner smoothing, wherein the inner radius of the corner increases. Double deposition,
or printing on the same area twice, drives corner swelling, wherein excess ink is diverted to the
outer edge of the corner. Fast turns at corners produce ringing, wherein vibrations in the stage
manifest in oscillations in the print path. Swelling and ringing effects are apparent in the particle
distributions at corners immediately after deposition, while smoothing effects are apparent
after the printed structure has had time to relax. When the nozzle returns to write a neighboring
line, it imposes shear stresses which mitigate inconsistencies in microstructure at corners by
erasing defects which appeared during relaxation. Using a support bath instead of layer-by-layer
support suppresses microstructural corner defects.
