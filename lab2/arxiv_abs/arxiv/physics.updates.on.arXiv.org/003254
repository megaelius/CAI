When studying the dynamics of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers, and their polarization
properties, the spin-flip model appears to be the simplest model qualitatively reproducing all
dynamical features that have been observed experimentally. Nonetheless, because of the fast time-scale
of the spin-relaxation processes, the specific role and the importance of the spin-population
difference - which is one of the specific feature of the spin-flip model - has been continuously questioned.
In fact, the debate regarding the possible adiabatic elimination of the spin-population remains
fully open. In this paper, our goal is to put a full stop to this debate by demonstrating that this variable
is indeed essential to preserve the most complex dynamical features predicted by the spin-flip
model, such as polarization chaos. To do so, we first perform a detailed analysis, focusing on the
chaotic dynamics, to determine the minimal embedding dimension for the spin-flip model. As the
latter confirms that a reduction of the model could be envisaged, we then consider the adiabatic
elimination of the spin-population difference to highlight and explain its failure to reproduce
essential dynamical features obtained in the original model. (c) 2019 IEEE. Personal use of this
