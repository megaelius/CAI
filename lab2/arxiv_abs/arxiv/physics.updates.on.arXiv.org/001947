We develop a new computational tool and framework for characterizing the scattering of photons
by energy-nonconserving Hamiltonians into unidirectional (chiral) waveguides, for example,
with coherent pulsed excitation. The temporal waveguide modes are a natural basis for characterizing
scattering in quantum optics, and afford a powerful technique based on a coarse discretization
of time. This overcomes limitations imposed by singularities in the waveguide-system coupling.
Moreover, the integrated discretized equations can be faithfully converted to a continuous-time
result by taking the appropriate limit. This approach provides a complete solution to the scattered
photon field in the waveguide, and can also be used to track system-waveguide entanglement during
evolution. We further develop a direct connection between quantum measurement theory and evolution
of the scattered field, demonstrating the correspondence between quantum trajectories and the
scattered photon state. Our method is most applicable when the number of photons scattered is known
to be small, i.e. for a single-photon or photon-pair source. We illustrate two examples: analytical
solutions for short laser pulses scattering off a two-level system and numerically exact solutions
for short laser pulses scattering off a spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) or spontaneous
four-wave mixing (SFWM) source. Finally, we note that our technique can easily be extended to systems
with multiple ground states and generalized scattering problems with both finite photon number
input and coherent state drive, potentially enhancing the understanding of, e.g., light-matter
entanglement and photon phase gates.
