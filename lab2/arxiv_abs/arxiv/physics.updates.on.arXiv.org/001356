In this study, the Vlasov-Poisson equation with or without collision term for plasma is solved by
the unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS). The Vlasov equation is a differential equation describing
time evolution of the distribution function of plasma consisting of charged particles with long-range
interaction. The distribution function is discretized in discrete particle velocity space. After
the Vlasov equation is integrated in finite volumes of physical space, the numerical flux across
a cell interface and source term for particle acceleration are computed to update the distribution
function at next time step. The flux is decided by Riemann problem and variation of distribution
function in discrete particle velocity space is evaluated with central difference method. A electron-ion
collision model is introduced in the Vlasov equation. This finite volume method for the UGKS couples
the free transport and long-range interaction between particles. The electric field induced by
charged particles is controlled by the Poisson's equation. In this paper, the Poisson's equation
is solved using the Green's function for two dimensional plasma system subjected to the symmetry
or periodic boundary conditions. Two numerical tests of the linear Landau damping and the Gaussian
beam are carried out to validate the proposed method. The linear electron plasma wave damping is
simulated based on electron-ion collision operator. Compared with previous methods, it is shown
that the current method is able to obtain accurate results of the Vlasov-Poisson equation with a
time step much larger than the particle collision time. Highly non-equilibrium and rarefied plasma
flows, such as electron flows driven by electromagnetic field, can be simulated easily.
