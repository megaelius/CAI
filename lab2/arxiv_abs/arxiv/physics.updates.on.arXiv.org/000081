We study the turbulent decay of fluctuations using results from 2D, particle-in-cell (PIC) collisionless
plasma simulations with realistic electron-proton mass ratio and a guide field out of the simulation
plane. A fluctuation power spectrum with approximately power law form is created down to scales
of order the electron gyroradius. Where there is an X-point magnetic field line geometry we find
signatures of reconnection such as electron bulk inflows and outflows. The reconnection signatures
persist even when the reconnection sites are only several electron gyroradii across. Although
the reconnection sites do not dominate the electron temperature variation, they are generally
associated with regions of strong parallel electron temperature anisotropy. By tracking simulation
particles we find that electrons are accelerated along the guide field near reconnection sites,
and that in the reconnection outflows there is a mixing of electrons from spatially separated locations.
The topology of magnetic field lines connected to the reconnection site allows this mixing of different
electron populations, and the formation of multi-peaked velocity distribution functions, and
consequently strong parallel temperature anisotropy. In a fully 3D system the multi-peaked distribution
functions would be expected to generate further waves via kinetic instabilities. The proposed
mechanism of generating anisotropy within collisionless plasma turbulence will be relevant to
space and astrophysical systems, where there is evidence that the evolution of the plasma is associated
with temperature anisotropy instability thresholds. The presence of reconnection sites leads
to electron energy gain, nonlocal velocity space mixing and the formation of strong temperature
anisotropy; this is evidence of an important, but not yet quantified, role for reconnection in the
dissipation of turbulent fluctuations.
