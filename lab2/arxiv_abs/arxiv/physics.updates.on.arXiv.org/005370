Progress in integrated nanophotonics has enabled large-scale programmable photonic integrated
circuits (PICs) for general-purpose electronic-photonic systems on a chip. Relying on the weak,
volatile thermo-optic or electro-optic effects, such systems usually exhibit limited reconfigurability
along with high energy consumption and large footprints. These challenges can be addressed by resorting
to chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) that provide substantial
optical contrast in a self-holding fashion upon phase transitions. However, current PCM-based
integrated photonic applications are limited to single devices or simple PICs due to the poor scalability
of the optical or electrical self-heating actuation approaches. Thermal-conduction heating
via external electrical heaters, instead, allows large-scale integration and large-area switching,
but fast and energy-efficient electrical control is yet to show. Here, we model electrical switching
of GST-clad integrated nanophotonic structures with graphene heaters based on the programmable
GST-on-silicon platform. Thanks to the ultra-low heat capacity and high in-plane thermal conductivity
of graphene, the proposed structures exhibit a high switching speed of ~80 MHz and high energy efficiency
of 19.2 aJ/nm^3 (6.6 aJ/nm^3) for crystallization (amorphization) while achieving complete phase
transitions to ensure strong attenuation (~6.46 dB/micron) and optical phase (~0.28 dB/micron
at 1550 nm) modulation. Compared with indium tin oxide and silicon p-i-n heaters, the structures
with graphene heaters display two orders of magnitude higher figure of merits for heating and overall
performance. Our work facilitates the analysis and understanding of the thermal-conduction heating-enabled
phase transitions on PICs and supports the development of the future large-scale PCM-based electronic-photonic
systems.
