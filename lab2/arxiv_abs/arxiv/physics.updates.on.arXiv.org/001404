This work presents a generalized muon trajectory estimation (GMTE) algorithm to estimate the path
of a muon in either uniform or nonuniform media. The use of cosmic ray muons in nuclear nonproliferation
and safeguards verification applications has recently gained attention due to the nonintrusive
and passive nature of the inspection, penetrating capabilities, as well as recent advances in detectors
that measure position and direction of the individual muons before and after traversing the imaged
object. However, muon image reconstruction techniques are limited in resolution due to low muon
flux and the effects of multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS). Current reconstruction algorithms
rely on overly simple assumptions for muon path estimation through the imaged object. For robust
muon tomography, efficient and flexible physics based algorithms are needed to model the MCS process
and accurately estimate the most probable trajectory of a muon as it traverses an object. In the present
work, the use of a Bayesian framework and a Gaussian approximation of MCS are explored for estimation
of the most likely path of a cosmic ray muon traversing uniform or nonuniform media and undergoing
MCS. The algorithm's precision is compared to Monte Carlo simulated muon trajectories. It was found
that the algorithm is expected to be able to predict muon tracks to less than 1.5 mm RMS for 0.5 GeV muons
and 0.25 mm RMS for 3 GeV muons, a 50 percent improvement compared to SLP and 15 percent improvement
when compared to PoCA. Further, a 30 percent increase in useful muon flux was observed relative to
PoCA. Muon track prediction improved for higher muon energies or smaller penetration depth where
energy loss is not significant. The effect of energy loss due to ionization is investigated, and
a linear energy loss relation that is easy to use is proposed.
