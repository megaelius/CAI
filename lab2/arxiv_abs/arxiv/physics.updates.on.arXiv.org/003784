Selecting a cohort from a set of candidates is a common task within and beyond academia. Admitting
students, awarding grants, choosing speakers for a conference are situations where human biases
may affect the make-up of the final cohort. We propose a new algorithm, Entrofy, designed to be part
of a larger decision making strategy aimed at making cohort selection as just, quantitative, transparent,
and accountable as possible. We suggest this algorithm be embedded in a two-step selection procedure.
First, all application materials are stripped of markers of identity that could induce conscious
or sub-conscious bias. During blind review, the committee selects all applicants, submissions,
or other entities that meet their merit-based criteria. This often yields a cohort larger than the
admissible number. In the second stage, the target cohort can be chosen from this meritorious pool
via a new algorithm and software tool. Entrofy optimizes differences across an assignable set of
categories selected by the human committee. Criteria could include gender, academic discipline,
experience with certain technologies, or other quantifiable characteristics. The Entrofy algorithm
yields the computational maximization of diversity by solving the tie-breaking problem with provable
performance guarantees. We show how Entrofy selects cohorts according to pre-determined characteristics
in simulated sets of applications and demonstrate its use in a case study. This cohort selection
process allows human judgment to prevail when assessing merit, but assigns the assessment of diversity
to a computational process less likely to be beset by human bias. Importantly, the stage at which
diversity assessments occur is fully transparent and auditable with Entrofy. Splitting merit
and diversity considerations into their own assessment stages makes it easier to explain why a given
candidate was selected or rejected.
