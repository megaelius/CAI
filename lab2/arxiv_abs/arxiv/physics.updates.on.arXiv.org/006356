Omega bianisotropic metasurfaces (OBMS) provide wave-control capabilities not previously available
with Huygens' metasurfaces (HMS). These enhanced capabilities derive from the additional degree
of freedom provided by OBMS, and are based on analyses of zero-thickness surfaces with abstract
surface impedance properties. However, the design of practical metasurfaces has proven tedious.
Herein, we propose a novel, easily designed structure to realize OBMSs. Extending our previous
work, we show that an asymmetrical cascade of two judiciously engineered Fabry-Perot (FP) etalons
could form an OBMS meta-atom to provide desired wave control capabilities. Implementing this FP-OBMS
for anomalous refraction, we show that bianisotropy effectively produces a virtual anti-reflective
coating over a HMS, leading to the OBMS efficiency enhancement. This intriguing observation, backed
by an approximate closed-form solution, provides an original physical interpretation of the mechanism
underlying perfect anomalous refraction, and is used to explain for the first time differences
in the angular response of OBMS in comparison to HMS. Implementing the FP-OBMS for the more intricate
functionality of beam-splitting, we show that the FP-OBMS are capable of non-local excitation
of surface waves required to this end, despite being electrically thick. These results, verified
via full-wave computations, demonstrate the ability of the proposed configuration to meticulously
reproduce the scattering properties of ideal (abstract) zero-thickness OBMS, thereby paving
the path to practical realization of wave transmission with exotic functionalities, some of which
have never before been associated with a physical structure.
