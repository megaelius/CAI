Blood flow in sickle cell disease (SCD) can substantially differ from normal blood flow due to significant
alterations in the physical properties of the red blood cells (RBCs). Chronic complications, such
as inflammation of the endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls, are associated with SCD, for
reasons that are unclear. Here, detailed boundary integral simulations are performed to investigate
an idealized model flow flow in SCD, a binary suspension of flexible biconcave discoidal fluid-filled
capsules and stiff curved prolate capsules that represent healthy and sickle RBCs, respectively,
subjected to pressure-driven flow in a planar slit. The key observation is that, unlike healthy
RBCs that concentrate around the center of the channel and form an RBC-depleted layer (i.e. cell-free
layer) next to the walls, sickle cells are largely drained from the bulk of the suspension and aggregate
inside the cell-free layer, displaying strong margination. These cells are found to undergo a rigid-body-like
rolling orbit near the walls. Furthermore, the additional shear stress on the walls induced by the
presence of marginated cells is computed. Compared to the small fluctuations in wall shear stress
for a suspension of healthy RBCs, large local peaks in wall shear stress are observed for the binary
suspensions, due to the proximity of the marginated stiff cells to the walls. As endothelial cells
are known to mechanotransduce physical forces such as aberrations in shear stress and convert them
to physiological processes such as activation of inflammatory signals, these results may aid in
understanding mechanisms for endothelial dysfunction associated with SCD.
