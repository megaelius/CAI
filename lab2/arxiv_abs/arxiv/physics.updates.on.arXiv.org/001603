Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are often corrupted with unintended artifacts which need
to be removed for extracting meaningful clinical information from them. Typically a priori knowledge
of the nature of the artifacts is needed for such purpose. Artifact contamination of EEG is even more
prominent for pervasive EEG systems where the subjects are free to move and thereby introducing
a wide variety of motion-related artifacts. This makes hard to get a priori knowledge about their
characteristics rendering conventional artifact removal techniques often ineffective. In this
paper, we explore the performance of two hybrid artifact removal algorithms: Wavelet packet transform
followed by Independent Component Analysis (WPTICA) and Wavelet Packet Transform followed by
Empirical Mode Decomposition (WPTEMD) in pervasive EEG recording scenario, assuming existence
of no a priori knowledge about the artifacts and compare their performance with two existing artifact
removal algorithms. Artifact cleaning performance has been measured using Root Mean Square Error
(RMSE) and Artifact to Signal Ratio (ASR) - an index similar to traditional Signal to Noise Ratio
(SNR), and also by observing normalized power distribution topography over the scalp. Comparison
has been made first using semi-simulated signals and then with real experimentally acquired EEG
data with commercially available 19-channel pervasive EEG system Enobio corrupted by eight types
of artifact. Our explorations show that WPTEMD consistently gives best artifact cleaning performance
not only in semi-simulated scenario but also in the case of real EEG data containing artifacts.
