We investigate the classical dynamics of extended charged bodies. This remains an unsolved problem:
in the literature, no causally correct, self-consistent dynamical theory of extended charged
bodies exists. Deterministic, causally correct equations can be produced only in the point charge
limit; this has the unfortunate effect of infinite self-energies, requiring some renormalization
procedure. We review the history of the development of electrodynamics leading to this fact. We
then investigate limitations on possible self-consistent, non-point-charge, electrodynamic
theories. Assuming general relativity, the standard electromagnetic stress-energy tensor and
Maxwell's equations, requiring the evolution be well defined by momentum conservation produces
a very restrictive constraint on possible total stress-energy tensors. This leads to a simple,
self-consistent theory. The theory is then independently derived using a Lagrangian. For non-point
charges, we show in order to conserve charge during metric variation, the electromagnetic field
tensor density (or the current vector density) must be held constant, rather than the electromagnetic
potential 1-form; this is used as the fundamental electromagnetic field. However, rather than
requiring invariance against arbitrary field variations, the stress-energy tensor and equations
of motion arise solely from the more general principle of diffeomorphism invariance. In the theory
of this paper, new short-range forces are realized due to current-current interactions. We find
no charged, static, spherically symmetric solutions exist. However, when gravity is primarily
responsible for binding the charge together, we find the behavior of the charge density near the
center of a static, spinning charge distribution would be constrained, such that if a rotation model
and angular momentum are set, the charge would be set; it would be quantized.
