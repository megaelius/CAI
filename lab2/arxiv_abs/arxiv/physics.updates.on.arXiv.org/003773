To take into account nuclear quantum effects on the dynamics of atoms, the path integral molecular
dynamics (PIMD) method used since 1980s is based on the formalism developed by R. P. Feynman. However,
the huge computation time required for the PIMD reduces its range of applicability. Another drawback
is the requirement of additional techniques to access time correlation functions (ring polymer
MD or centroid MD). We developed an alternative technique based on a quantum thermal bath (QTB) which
reduces the computation time by a factor of ~20. The QTB approach consists in a classical Langevin
dynamics in which the white noise random force is replaced by a Gaussian random force having the power
spectral density given by the quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The method has yielded
satisfactory results for weakly anharmonic systems: the quantum harmonic oscillator, the heat
capacity of a MgO crystal, and isotope effects in 7 LiH and 7 LiD. Unfortunately, the QTB is subject
to the problem of zero-point energy leakage (ZPEL) in highly anharmonic systems, which is inherent
in the use of classical mechanics. Indeed, a part of the energy of the high-frequency modes is transferred
to the low-frequency modes leading to a wrong energy distribution. We have shown that in order to
reduce or even eliminate ZPEL, it is sufficient to increase the value of the frictional coefficient.
Another way to solve the ZPEL problem is to combine the QTB and PIMD techniques. It requires the modification
of the power spectral density of the random force within the QTB. This combination can also be seen
as a way to speed up the PIMD.
