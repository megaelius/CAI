Extraction of non-equilibrium hot carriers generated by plasmon decay in metallic nanostructures
is an increasingly exciting prospect for utilizing plasmonic losses, but the search for optimum
plasmonic materials with long-lived carriers is ongoing. Transition metal nitrides are an exciting
class of new plasmonic materials with superior thermal and mechanical properties compared to conventional
noble metals, but their suitability for plasmonic hot carrier applications remains unknown. Here,
we present fully first-principles calculations of the plasmonic response, hot carrier generation
and subsequent thermalization of all group IV, V and VI transition metal nitrides, fully accounting
for direct and phonon-assisted transitions as well as electron-electron and electron-phonon
scattering. We find the largest frequency ranges for plasmonic response in ZrN, HfN and WN, between
those of gold and silver, while we predict strongest absorption in the visible spectrum for the VN,
NbN and TaN. Hot carrier generation is dominated by direct transitions for most of the relevant energy
range in all these nitrides, while phonon-assisted processes dominate only below 1 eV plasmon energies
primarily for the group IV nitrides. Finally, we predict the maximum hot carrier lifetimes to be
around 10 fs for group IV and VI nitrides, a factor of 3 - 4 smaller than noble metals, due to strong electron-phonon
scattering. However, we find longer carrier lifetimes for group V nitrides, comparable to silver
for NbN and TaN, while exceeding 100 fs (twice that of silver) for VN, making them promising candidates
for efficient hot carrier extraction.
