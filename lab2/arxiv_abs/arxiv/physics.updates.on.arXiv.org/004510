The strength of the lithosphere is typically modelled based on constitutive equations for steady-state
flow. However, models of lithospheric flexure reveal differences in lithospheric strength that
are difficult to reconcile based on such flow laws. Recent rheological data from low-temperature
deformation experiments on olivine suggest that this discrepancy may be largely explained by strain
hardening. Details of the mechanical data, specifically the effects of temperature-independent
back stresses stored in the samples, indicate that strain hardening in olivine occurs primarily
due to long-range elastic interactions between dislocations. These interpretations provided
the basis for a new flow law that incorporates hardening by development of back stress. Here, we test
this hypothesis by examining the microstructures of olivine samples deformed plastically at room
temperature either in a deformation-DIA apparatus at differential stresses of < 4.3 GPa or in a nanoindenter
at applied contact stresses of > 10.2 GPa. High-angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction
maps reveal the presence of geometrically necessary dislocations with densities commonly above
10$^{14}$ m$^{-2}$ and intragranular heterogeneities in residual stress on the order of 1 GPa in
both sets of samples. Scanning transmission electron micrographs reveal straight dislocations
aligned along slip bands and interacting with dislocations of other types that act as obstacles.
The stress heterogeneities and accumulations of dislocations along their slip planes are consistent
with strain hardening resulting from long-range back-stresses acting between dislocations.
These results corroborate the mechanical data in supporting the form of the new flow law for low-temperature
plasticity and provide new microstructural criteria for identifying the operation of this deformation
mechanism in natural samples.
