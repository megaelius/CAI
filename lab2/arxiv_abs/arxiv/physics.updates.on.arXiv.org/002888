The generation of microbubbles upon the collision and interaction of liquid bodies in a gaseous
environment is a ubiquitous process in two-phase flows, including large-scale phenomena like
ship wakes, breaking waves and rain showers. These collision and interaction events involve the
relative approach of pairs of liquid-gas interfaces. As these interfaces approach, the smallest
length scales of the system are dynamically reduced. This evolving disparity in length scales is
numerically challenging to resolve without the employment of subgrid-scale (SGS) impact and breakup
models. In this study, a physics-based impact and breakup model for the generation of these microbubbles
is developed and implemented. The objectives of this study are to develop a computational algorithm
that identifies interface collision events that contribute to the formation of microbubbles,
to formulate a physics-based breakup model that predicts the distribution of microbubble sizes
using the characteristics of the originating gas film, and to integrate these modules into a two-phase
flow solver that accurately captures the effects of bubbles of all sizes. In these proceedings,
an SGS model suitable for the aforementioned problems is proposed, and the steps involved in implementing
the proposed SGS model in a macroscale flow solver are outlined. Two aspects of the development of
this SGS model are then discussed in detail. First, the formulation and implementation of the first
step of the SGS model, the collision detection algorithm, is detailed. Second, preliminary findings
of a numerical investigation intended to shed light on breakup processes in turbulent two-phase
flows are presented.
