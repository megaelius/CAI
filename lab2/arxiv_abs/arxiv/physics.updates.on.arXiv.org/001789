A complex network is a condensed representation of the relational topological framework of a complex
system. A main reason for the existence of such networks is the transmission of items through the
entities of these complex systems. Here, we consider a communicability function that accounts
for the routes through which items flow on networks. Such a function induces a natural embedding
of a network in a Euclidean high-dimensional sphere. We use one of the geometric parameters of this
embedding, namely the angle between the position vectors of the nodes in the hyperspheres, to extract
structural information from networks. Such information is extracted by using machine learning
techniques, such as nonmetric multidimensional scaling and K-means clustering algorithms. The
first allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the communicability hyperspheres to 3-dimensional
ones that allow network visualization. The second permits to cluster the nodes of the networks based
on their similarities in terms of their capacity to successfully deliver information through the
network. After testing these approaches in benchmark networks and compare them with the most used
clustering methods in networks we analyze two real-world examples. In the first, consisting of
a citation network, we discover citation groups that reflect the level of mathematics used in their
publications. In the second, we discover groups of genes that coparticipate in human diseases,
reporting a few genes that coparticipate in cancer and other diseases. Both examples emphasize
the potential of the current methodology for the discovery of new patterns in relational data.
