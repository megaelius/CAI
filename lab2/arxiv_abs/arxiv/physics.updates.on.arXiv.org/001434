Conformational changes drive protein function, including catalysis, allostery, and signaling.
X-ray diffuse scattering from protein crystals has frequently been cited as a probe of these correlated
motions, with significant potential to advance our understanding of biological dynamics. However,
recent work challenged this prevailing view, suggesting instead that diffuse scattering primarily
originates from rigid body motions and could therefore be applied to improve structure determination.
To investigate the nature of the disorder giving rise to diffuse scattering, and thus the potential
applications of this signal, a diverse repertoire of disorder models was assessed for its ability
to reproduce the diffuse signal reconstructed from three protein crystals. This comparison revealed
that multiple models of intramolecular conformational dynamics, including ensemble models inferred
from the Bragg data, could not explain the signal. Models of rigid body or short-range liquid-like
motions, in which dynamics are confined to the biological unit, showed modest agreement with the
diffuse maps, but were unable to reproduce experimental features indicative of long-range correlations.
Extending a model of liquid-like motions to include disorder across neighboring proteins in the
crystal significantly improved agreement with all three systems and highlighted the contribution
of intermolecular correlations to the observed signal. These findings anticipate a need to account
for intermolecular disorder in order to advance the interpretation of diffuse scattering to either
extract biological motions or aid structural inference.
