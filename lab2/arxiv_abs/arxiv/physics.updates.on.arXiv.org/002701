The photoacoustic (PA) effect consisting of the generation of an acoustic signal based on the absorption
of light has already demonstrated its potential for various spectroscopic applications for both
gaseous and solid samples. The signal produced during photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) measurement
is, however, usually weak and needs to be amplified. This is achieved by using a photoacoustic cell
resonator where acoustic resonances are utilized to significantly boost the signal. Therefore,
a PA resonator has a significant role in PAS measurement set-ups. When designing or optimizing a
new PA resonator, numerical methods are generally used to simulate the photoacoustic signal generation.
In this paper, the amplitude mode expansion (AME) method is presented as a quick and accurate simulation
tool. The method is used to simulate the photoacoustic signal in a multi-scale T-cell resonator
over a wide frequency range. The AME method is based on eigenmode expansion and introduction of losses
by quality factors. The AME simulation results are compared and analyzed against the results from
the viscothermal method. Reasonably good agreement is obtained between the two methods. However,
small frequency shifts in the resonances of the AME method are noted. The shifts are attributed to
the location of the dominant mode within the T-cell. The viscothermal method is considered the most
accurate method for simulating the photoacoustic signal in small resonators. However, it is computationally
very demanding. The AME method provides a much faster simulation alternative. This is particularly
useful in the design and optimization of photoacoustic resonators where numerical methods are
preferred over experimental measurements due to their speed and low cost.
