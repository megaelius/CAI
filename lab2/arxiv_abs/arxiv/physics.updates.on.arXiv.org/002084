The hot streak, loosely defined as winning begets more winnings, highlights a specific period during
which an individual's performance is substantially higher than her typical performance. While
widely debated in sports, gambling, and financial markets over the past several decades, little
is known if hot streaks apply to individual careers. Here, building on rich literature on lifecycle
of creativity, we collected large-scale career histories of individual artists, movie directors
and scientists, tracing the artworks, movies, and scientific publications they produced. We find
that, across all three domains, hit works within a career show a high degree of temporal regularity,
each career being characterized by bursts of high-impact works occurring in sequence. We demonstrate
that these observations can be explained by a simple hot-streak model we developed, allowing us
to probe quantitatively the hot streak phenomenon governing individual careers, which we find
to be remarkably universal across diverse domains we analyzed: The hot streaks are ubiquitous yet
unique across different careers. While the vast majority of individuals have at least one hot streak,
hot streaks are most likely to occur only once. The hot streak emerges randomly within an individual's
sequence of works, is temporally localized, and is unassociated with any detectable change in productivity.
We show that, since works produced during hot streaks garner significantly more impact, the uncovered
hot streaks fundamentally drives the collective impact of an individual, ignoring which leads
us to systematically over- or under-estimate the future impact of a career. These results not only
deepen our quantitative understanding of patterns governing individual ingenuity and success,
they may also have implications for decisions and policies involving predicting and nurturing
individuals with lasting impact.
