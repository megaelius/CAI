The observable outputs of many complex dynamical systems consist in time series exhibiting autocorrelation
functions of great diversity of behaviors, including long-range power-law autocorrelation functions,
as a signature of interactions operating at many temporal or spatial scales. Often, algorithms
able to generate correlated noises reproducing the properties of real time series produce \textsl{Gaussian}
outputs, while real, experimentally observed time series are often non-Gaussian, and may follow
distributions with a diversity of behaviors concerning the support, the symmetry or the tail properties.
Here, we study how the correlation of two Gaussian variables changes when they are transformed to
follow a different destination distribution. Specifically, we consider bounded and unbounded
distributions, symmetric and non-symmetric distributions, and distributions with different
tail properties, from decays faster than exponential to heavy tail cases including power-laws,
and we find how these properties affect the correlation of the final variables. We extend these results
to Gaussian time series which are transformed to have a different marginal distribution, and show
how the autocorrelation function of the final non-Gaussian time series depends on the Gaussian
correlations and on the final marginal distribution. As an application of our results, we propose
how to generalize standard algorithms producing Gaussian power-law correlated time series in
order to create synthetic time series with arbitrary distribution and controlled power-law correlations.
Finally, we show a practical example of this algorithm by generating time series mimicking the marginal
distribution and the power-law tail of the autocorrelation function of a real time series: the absolute
returns of stock prices.
