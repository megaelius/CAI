Purpose: To develop a MRI acquisition and reconstruction framework for volumetric cine visualisation
of the fetal heart and great vessels in the presence of maternal and fetal motion. Methods: Four-dimensional
depiction was achieved using a highly-accelerated multi-planar real-time balanced steady state
free precession acquisition combined with retrospective image-domain techniques for motion
correction, cardiac synchronisation and outlier rejection. The framework was evaluated and optimised
using a numerical phantom, and evaluated in a study of 20 mid- to late-gestational age human fetal
subjects. Reconstructed cine volumes were evaluated by experienced cardiologists and compared
with matched ultrasound. A preliminary assessment of flow-sensitive reconstruction using the
velocity information encoded in the phase of dynamic images is included. Results: Reconstructed
cine volumes could be visualised in any 2D plane without the need for highly-specific scan plane
prescription prior to acquisition or for maternal breath hold to minimise motion. Reconstruction
was fully automated aside from user-specified masks of the fetal heart and chest. The framework
proved robust when applied to fetal data and simulations confirmed that spatial and temporal features
could be reliably recovered. Expert evaluation suggested the reconstructed volumes can be used
for comprehensive assessment of the fetal heart, either as an adjunct to ultrasound or in combination
with other MRI techniques. Conclusion: The proposed methods show promise as a framework for motion-compensated
4D assessment of the fetal heart and great vessels.
