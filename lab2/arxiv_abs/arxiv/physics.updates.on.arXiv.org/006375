In collisionless and weakly collisional plasmas, the particle distribution function is a rich
tapestry of the underlying physics. However, actually leveraging the particle distribution function
to understand the dynamics of a weakly collisional plasma is challenging. The equation system of
relevance, the Vlasov-Maxwell-Fokker-Planck (VM-FP) system of equations, is difficult to numerically
integrate, and traditional methods such as the particle-in-cell method introduce counting noise
into the distribution function. In this thesis, we present a new algorithm for the discretization
of VM-FP system of equations for the study of plasmas in the kinetic regime. Using the discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) finite element method for the spatial discretization and a third order strong-stability
preserving Runge-Kutta for the time discretization, we obtain an accurate solution for the plasma's
distribution function in space and time. We both prove the numerical method retains key physical
properties of the VM-FP system, such as the conservation of energy and the second law of thermodynamics,
and demonstrate these properties numerically. These results are contextualized in the history
of the DG method. We discuss the importance of the algorithm being alias-free, a necessary condition
for deriving stable DG schemes of kinetic equations so as to retain the implicit conservation relations
embedded in the particle distribution function, and the computational favorable implementation
using a modal, orthonormal basis in comparison to traditional DG methods applied in computational
fluid dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate how the high fidelity representation of the distribution
function, combined with novel diagnostics, permits detailed analysis of the energization mechanisms
in fundamental plasma processes such as collisionless shocks.
