Exploiting the full potential of MBs for applications requires a good understanding of their complex
dynamics. Improved understanding of MB oscillations can lead to further enhancement in optimizing
their efficacy in many applications and also invent new ones. Previous studies have predominantly
addressed the behavior of a single isolated MB in an infinite liquid domain, whereas most applications
employ MBs in clusters. Oscillating MBs have been shown to generate secondary pressure waves that
modify the dynamics of the MBs in their proximity. A modified Keller-Miksis equation is used to account
for inter-bubble interactions. The oscillatory dynamics of each MB within clusters was computed
by numerically solving the resulting system of coupled nonlinear second order differential equations.
Frequency response analysis and bifurcation diagrams were employed to track the dynamics of interacting
MBs. Here we investigate the dynamics of polydisperse MB clusters over a wide range of acoustic and
geometric parameters. An emergent collective behavior within bubble clusters was observed whereby
individual dynamics of smaller bubbles were suppressed resulting in a collective behavior dominated
by the dynamics of the largest MB within the cluster. The emergent dynamics of smaller MBs within
bubble clusters can be characterized by constructive and destructive inter-bubble interactions.
In constructive interactions, the radial oscillations of smaller bubbles matched those of the
largest MB and their oscillations are amplified. In destructive interactions, the oscillations
of smaller bubbles are suppressed so that their oscillations match those of the largest MB. Furthermore,
a special case of constructive interactions is presented where dominant MB (largest) can force
smaller MBs into period doubling and subharmonic oscillations.
