Lock-In thermography is a useful Non Destructive Technique (NDT) for enhanced detection of defects
in components, as it amplifies the phase contrast where defects exist. This amplification was found
to be around 2-3 times compared to constant heating. The current used a Fuse Deposition Modelling
(FDM) 3D printer to print samples with known defects, in order to characterise the relative effects
of different variables on the Lock-In phase data. Samples were printed using ABS (Acrylonitrile
Butadiene Styrene) and PLA (Polylactic Acid) for comparisons, and variables such as print direction,
cameras, heating power, Lock-In frequency, as well as thickness, width and depth of defects were
explored. It was found that different materials resulted in different baselines, but had similar
phase contrast. A novel asynchronous technique was derived to enable Lock-In measurements with
5 different infrared cameras, and similar results were found. Even cheap cameras like the Seek Thermal
CompactXR were proven capable of detecting the same defects as other cameras such as the FLIR SC7500.
Heating power did not affect phase contrast, except for shallower defects up to 1.0 mm deep, where
higher power resulted in better contrast. As expected, deeper defects could only be detected using
lower Lock-In frequencies, and there was better phase contrast with wider, thicker and shallower
defects. It was shown that defects 4 mm in width could be detected automatically up to a depth of around
1.5 mm, based on the phase signal trends. Sub-sampling of frame data showed that at least 10 frames
were required per Lock-In period for minimal deviations in Lock-In phase contrast. Also, it was
shown that phase contrast was similar for shallower defects up to 1.5 mm deep, with data from 1 Lock-In
period, as long as the first frame was synchronised with the heating cycle.
