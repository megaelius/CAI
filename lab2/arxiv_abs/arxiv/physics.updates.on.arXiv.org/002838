In this study we present an inversion method which provides thermal plasma population parameters
from characteristics of chorus emissions only. Our ultimate goal is to apply this method to ground
based data in order to derive the lower energy boundary condition for many radiation belt models.
The first step is to test the chorus-inversion method on in-situ data of Van Allen Probes in the generation
region. Density and thermal velocity of energetic electrons (few keV - 100 keV) are derived from
frequency sweep rate and starting frequencies of chorus emissions through analysis of wave data
from Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science (EMFISIS) onboard the
Van Allen Probes. Nonlinear wave growth theory of \citet{omura2011triggering} serves as the basis
for our inversion method, assuming that the triggering wave is originated by the linear cyclotron
instability. We present sixteen, consecutive rising-tone emissions recorded in the generation
region between 11-12UT on 14 November 2012. The results of the inversion are compared with density
and thermal velocities (parallel and perpendicular) of energetic electrons derived from unidirectional
flux data of Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) instrument, showing a good agreement: the normalized
root-mean-square deviation between the measured and predicted values are $\sim13\%, \sim6\%$,
and $\sim10\%$, respectively. We found that the theoretical amplitudes are consistent with the
measured ones. The relation between linear and nonlinear wave growth agrees with our basic assumption,
namely, linear growth is a preceding process of nonlinear wave growth. We analyze electron distributions
at the relativistic resonant energy ranges.
