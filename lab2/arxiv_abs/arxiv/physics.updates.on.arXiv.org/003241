The broadly general characteristics of complex networks found across disciplines-- such as high
clustering coefficients and heavy-tailed degree distributions-- has long invited the question
of whether there are general generating mechanisms behind them. Here, we propose a theory of such
mechanisms and undertake several experiments which validate it. This theory proposes that there
are two key principles at work in the emergence of a network, constituting a `surface' factor and
a `depth' factor making up the existence probability of network edges. The surface factor describes
nodes as having tendencies for attachment which follow a log-normal distribution. The deep factor
suggests that beneath these potentials for attachment there exist any number of important latent
variables describing the nodes. These variables are formulated as a high-dimensional manifold
and the `distances' between pairs of nodes on this manifold constitute a similarity weighting informing
on the probability that any two nodes are connected. Using standard network measures, the topology
of 110 networks across a variety of disciplines shows agreement with a simple two-parameter model
based on this theory. Importantly, we show that the log-normal surface factor can explain the power-law-like
degree distributions of sparse networks and, more strongly, the variety of degree distributions
found across networks of different densities. We also demonstrate how inverting an estimated surface
factor of a complete weighted world city network provides more plausible clusters of nodes than
the original network based on geometric and cultural considerations. This theory proposes a new
fundamental formulation of complex networks with wide reaching consequences throughout the multidisciplinary
domain of complex systems.
