Flow past a high-lift low-pressure turbine (LPT) blade in a cascade could be quite complex as phenomena
like separation and transition are often involved. For a highly loadedT106A blade at a high incidence
and relatively low Reynolds number(25, 000 < Re < 1, 00, 000), separation-induced transition is
observed on the suction side of the blade, making it a challenging problem for model-based simulations.
In this work, computations for this flow are carried out using RANS and hybrid LES/RANS approaches.
The RANS simulations are performed with six popular low- Re turbulence models. While turbulence
models by themselves fail to predict any separation on the T106A blade, the four-equation Langtry-Menter
transition model predicts a short separation bubble. The characteristic of this bubble, however,
is very different from what is observed in experiments and DNS, and therefore transition is not accurately
predicted. An embedded hybrid LES/RANS approach, Limited numerical scales(LNS), with an automatic
switch to LES in sufficiently resolved grids, is then used for predictions on the sameRANS grid.
With the statistical turbulence on fine grids, LES-like behavior of LNS results in an unphysical
drop in Reynolds stresses as the turbulent fluctuations are not appropriately represented on the
resolved scale. Therefore, the LNS results are very similar to those obtained with turbulence models.
However, when synthetic turbulence with correct statistical characteristics is used to stimulate
the large eddies in the embedded LES zone, LNS is able to predict separation and recovers a solution
very close to DNS and experimental results.
