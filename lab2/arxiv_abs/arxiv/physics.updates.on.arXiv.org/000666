We describe a parallel linear-scaling computational framework developed to implement arbitrarily
large multi-state empirical valence bond (MS-EVB) calculations within CHARMM. Forces are obtained
using the Hellman-Feynmann relationship, giving continuous gradients, and excellent energy
conservation. Utilizing multi-dimensional Gaussian coupling elements fit to CCSD(T)-F12 electronic
structure theory, we built a 64-state MS-EVB model designed to study the F + CD3CN -> DF + CD2CN
reaction in CD3CN solvent. This approach allows us to build a reactive potential energy surface
(PES) whose balanced accuracy and efficiency considerably surpass what we could achieve otherwise.
We use our PES to run MD simulations, and examine a range of transient observables which follow in
the wake of reaction, including transient spectra of the DF vibrational band, time dependent profiles
of vibrationally excited DF in CD3CN solvent, and relaxation rates for energy flow from DF into the
solvent, all of which agree well with experimental observations. Immediately following deuterium
abstraction, the nascent DF is in a non-equilibrium regime in two different respects: (1) it is highly
excited, with ~23 kcal mol-1 localized in the stretch; and (2) not yet Hydrogen bonded to the CD3CN
solvent, its microsolvation environment is intermediate between the non-interacting gas-phase
limit and the solution-phase equilibrium limit. Vibrational relaxation of the nascent DF results
in a spectral blue shift, while relaxation of its microsolvation environment results in a red shift.
These two competing effects result in a post-reaction relaxation profile distinct from that observed
when DF vibration excitation occurs within an equilibrium microsolvation environment. The parallel
software framework presented in this paper should be more broadly applicable to a range of complex
reactive systems.
