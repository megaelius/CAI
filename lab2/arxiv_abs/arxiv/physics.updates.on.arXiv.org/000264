NEXT-MM is a general-purpose high pressure (10 bar, $\sim25$ l active volume) Xenon-based TPC,
read out in charge mode with an 8 cm $\times$8 cm-segmented 700 cm$^2$ plane (1152 ch) of the latest
microbulk-Micromegas technology. It has been recently commissioned at University of Zaragoza
as part of the R&D of the NEXT $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiment, although the experiment's first
stage is currently being built based on a SiPM/PMT-readout concept relying on electroluminescence.
Around 2 million events were collected during the last months, stemming from the low energy $\gamma$-rays
emitted by a $^{241}$Am source when interacting with the Xenon gas ($\epsilon$ = 26, 30, 59.5 keV).
The localized nature of such events above atmospheric pressure, the long drift times, as well as
the possibility to determine their production time from the associated $\alpha$ particle in coincidence,
allow the extraction of primordial properties of the TPC filling gas, namely the drift velocity,
diffusion and attachment coefficients. In this work we focus on the little explored combination
of Xe and trimethylamine (TMA) for which, in particular, such properties are largely unknown. This
gas mixture offers potential advantages over pure Xenon when aimed at Rare Event Searches, mainly
due to its Penning characteristics, wave-length shifting properties and reduced diffusion, and
it is being actively investigated by our collaboration. The chamber is currently operated at 2.7
bar, as an intermediate step towards the envisaged 10 bar. We report here its performance as well
as a first implementation of the calibration procedures that have allowed the extension of the previously
reported energy resolution to the whole readout plane (10.6%FWHM@30keV).
