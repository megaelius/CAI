Purpose: Experimental measurements of bone mineral density distributions (BMDDs) enable a determination
of secondary mineralisation kinetics in bone, but the maximum degree of mineralisation and how
this maximum is approached remain uncertain. We thus test computationally different hypotheses
on late stages of bone mineralisation by simulating BMDDs in low turnover conditions. Materials
and Methods: An established computational model of the BMDD that accounts for mineralisation and
remodelling processes was extended to limit mineralisation to various maximum calcium capacities
of bone. Simulated BMDDs obtained by reducing turnover rate from the reference trabecular BMDD
under different assumptions on late stage mineralisation kinetics were compared with experimental
BMDDs of low-turnover bone. Results: Simulations show that an abrupt stopping of mineralisation
near a maximum calcium capacity induces a pile-up of minerals in the BMDD statistics that is not observed
experimentally. With a smooth decrease of mineralisation rate, imposing low maximum calcium capacities
helps to match peak location and width of simulated low turnover BMDDs with peak location and width
of experimental BMDDs, but results in a distinctive asymmetric peak shape. No tuning of turnover
rate and maximum calcium capacity was able to explain the differences found in experimental BMDDs
between trabecular bone (high turnover) and femoral cortical bone (low turnover). Conclusions:
Secondary mineralisation in human bone does not stop abruptly, but continues slowly up to a calcium
content greater than 30 wt% Ca. The similar mineral heterogeneity seen in trabecular and femoral
cortical bones at different peak locations was unexplained by turnover differences tested.
