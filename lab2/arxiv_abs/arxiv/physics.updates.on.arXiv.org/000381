In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated
patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time, and include other
types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity,
and it is important to take such "multilayer" features into account to try to improve our understanding
of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize "traditional" network theory
by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in
a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple
disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions
in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts)
and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the
large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary
of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other, and provide a thorough discussion
that compares, contrasts, and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks,
multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks, and many others. We also survey
and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts
to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly
expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected
components, tensor decompositions, and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks.
We conclude with a summary and an outlook.
