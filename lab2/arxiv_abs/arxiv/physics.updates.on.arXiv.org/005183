Martian bow shocks, the solar wind interacting with an unmagnetized planet, are studied. We theoretically
investigated how solar parameters, such as the solar wind dynamic pressure and the solar extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) flux, influence the bow shock location, which is still currently not well understood.
We present the formula for the location of the bow shock nose of the unmagnetized planet. The bow shock
location, the sum of the ionopause location and bow shock standoff distance, is calculated in the
gasdynamics approach. The ionopause location is determined using thermal pressure continuity,
i.e., the solar wind thermal pressure equal to the ionospheric pressure, according to tangential
discontinuity. The analytical formula of the ionopause nose location and the ionopause profile
around the nose are obtained. The standoff distance is calculated using the empirical model. Our
derived formula shows that the shock nose location is a function of the scale height of ionosphere,
the dynamic pressure of the solar wind and the peak ionospheric pressure. The theoretical model
implies that the shock nose location is more sensitive to the solar EUV flux than solar wind dynamics
pressure. Further, we theoretically show that the bow shock location is proportional to the solar
wind dynamic pressure to the power of negative C, where C is about the ratio of the ionospheric scale
height to the distance between bow shock nose and the planet center. This theory matches the gasdynamics
simulation and is consistent with the spacecraft measurement result by Mars Express [Hall, et al.
