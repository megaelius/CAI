In this paper, we propose a microcavity supported by a designed photonic crystal structure (PhC)
that supplies both tunability of cavity modes and quality factor of cavity. Low symmetric defect
region provides a trigger effect for the frequency shifting by means of rotational manipulation
of small symmetry elements. Deviation of effective filling ratio as a result of rotational modification
within the defect region results in the emanation of cavity modes at different frequencies. Here,
we numerically demonstrate the frequency shifting for each obtained mode with respect to defect
region architecture. In addition to wavelength tunability, quality factor, mode volume, and Purcell
factors are analyzed for the slightly modified structures. Also, electric field distributions
of each mode that emerge at distinct frequencies have been also studied at adjusted frequency modes
which are observed for all rotational modification scenarios as $\theta_{rot} =[0^\circ,15^\circ,30^\circ,
40^\circ] $. After the investigations in 2D of silicon material ($\epsilon_r=12$), 3D simulations
are performed and the collected data is used for the stacking approximation of 3D structures to get
the 2D, thus the cross-checking of the quality factor that acquired from the 2D simulation can be
executed by comparison with 3D. Limited 3D results are projected to approximate 2D ones step by step
and get an exponential trend which reaches in the limit to the $10^8$ value for Q-factor. Besides,
2D and 3D simulations of alumina ($\epsilon_r=9.61$) in terms of mode analysis and quality factor
have been repeated considering the microwave experiments. Therefore, experimental analysis
is compared with the numerical results and good agreement between the two is found.
