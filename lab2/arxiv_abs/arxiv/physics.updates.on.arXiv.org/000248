We investigate the relevance of dynamic quantum coherence in the energy transfer efficiency of
molecular aggregates. We contrast the dynamics after excitation of a quantum mechanical system
with that of a classical system. We demonstrate how a classical description of an ensemble average
can be satisfactorily interpreted either as a single system driven by a continuous force or as an
ensemble of systems each driven by an impulsive force. We derive the time evolution of the density
matrix for an open quantum system excited by light or by a neighboring antenna. We argue that unlike
in the classical case, the quantum description does not allow for a formal decomposition of the dynamics
into sudden jumps in the quantum mechanical state. Rather, there is a natural finite time-scale
associated with the excitation process. We propose a simple experiment how to test the influence
of this time scale on the yield of photosynthesis. Because photosynthesis is intrinsically an average
process, the efficiency of photosynthesis can be assessed from the quantum mechanical expectation
value calculated from the second-order response theory, which has the same validity as the perturbative
description of ultrafast experiments. We demonstrate using typical parameters of the currently
most studied photosynthetic antenna, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and a typical energy
transfer rate from the chlorosome baseplate, that dynamic coherences are averaged out in the complex
despite excitation proceeding through a coherent superposition of its eigenstates. The dynamic
coherence averages out even when the FMO model is completely free of all dissipation and dephasing.
We conclude that under natural excitation conditions coherent dynamics cannot be responsible
for the remarkable efficiency of the photosynthesis even when considering the dynamics at a single
molecular level.
