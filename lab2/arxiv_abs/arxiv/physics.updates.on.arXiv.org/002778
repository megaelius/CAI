Modern technology has drastically changed the way we interact and consume information. For example,
online social platforms allow for seamless communication exchanges at an unprecedented scale.
However, we are still bounded by cognitive and temporal constraints. Our attention is limited and
extremely valuable. Algorithmic personalisation has become a standard approach to tackle the
information overload problem. As result, the exposure to our friends' opinions and our perception
about important issues might be distorted. However, the effects of algorithmic gatekeeping on
our hyper-connected society are poorly understood. Here, we devise an opinion dynamics model where
individuals are connected through a social network and adopt opinions as function of the view points
they are exposed to. We apply various filtering algorithms that select the opinions shown to users
i) at random ii) considering time ordering or iii) their current beliefs. Furthermore, we investigate
the interplay between such mechanisms and crucial features of real networks. We found that algorithmic
filtering might influence opinions' share and distributions, especially in case information
is biased towards the current opinion of each user. These effects are reinforced in networks featuring
topological and spatial correlations where echo chambers and polarisation emerge. Conversely,
heterogeneity in connectivity patterns reduces such tendency. We consider also a scenario where
one opinion, through nudging, is centrally pushed to all users. Interestingly, even minimal nudging
is able to change the status quo moving it towards the desired view point. Our findings suggest that
simple filtering algorithms might be powerful tools to regulate opinion dynamics taking place
on social networks
