This study proposes a novel design of glucose sensor with enhanced selectivity and sensitivity
by using graphene Schottky diodes, which is composed of Graphene (G)/Platinum Oxide (PtO)/n-Silicon
(Si) heterostructure. The sensor was tested with different glucose concentrations and interfering
solutions to investigate its sensitivity and selectivity. Different structures of the device
were studied by adjusting the platinum oxide film thickness to investigate its catalytic activity.
It was found that the film thickness plays a significant role in the efficiency of glucose oxidation
and hence in overall device sensitivity. 0.8-2 uA output current was obtained in the case of 4-10
mM with a sensitivity of 0.2 uA/mM.cm2. Besides, results have shown that 0.8 uA and 15 uA were obtained
by testing 4 mM glucose on two different PtO thicknesses, 30 nm, and 50 nm, respectively. The sensitivity
of the device was enhanced by 150% (i.e., up to 30 uA/mM.cm2) by increasing the PtO layer thickness.
This was attributed to both the increase of the number of active sites for glucose oxidation as well
as the increase in the graphene layer thickness, which leads to enhanced charge carriers concentration
and mobility. Moreover, theoretical investigations were conducted using the Density Function
Theory (DFT) to understand the detection method and the origins of selectivity better. The working
principle of the sensors puts it in a competitive position with other non-enzymatic glucose sensors.
DFT calculations provided a qualitative explanation of the charge distribution across the graphene
sheet within a system of a platinum substrate with D-glucose molecules above. The proposed G/PtO/n-Si
heterostructure has proven to satisfy these factors, which opens the door for further developments
of more reliable non-enzymatic glucometers for continuous glucose monitoring systems.
