Various kinetic Monte Carlo algorithms become inefficient when some of the population sizes in
a system are large, which gives rise to a large number of reaction events per unit time. Here, we present
a new acceleration algorithm based on adaptive and heterogeneous scaling of reaction rates and
stoichiometric coefficients. The algorithm is conceptually related to the commonly used idea
of accelerating a stochastic simulation by considering a sub-volume $\lambda \Omega$ ($0<\lambda<1$)
within a system of interest, which reduces the number of reaction events per unit time occurring
in a simulation by a factor $1/\lambda$ at the cost of greater error in unbiased estimates of first
moments and biased overestimates of second moments. Our new approach offers two unique benefits.
First, scaling is adaptive and heterogeneous, which eliminates the pitfall of overaggressive
scaling. Second, there is no need for an \emph{a priori} classification of populations as discrete
or continuous (as in a hybrid method), which is problematic when discreteness of a chemical species
changes during a simulation. The method requires specification of only a single algorithmic parameter,
$N_c$, a global critical population size above which populations are effectively scaled down to
increase simulation efficiency. The method, which we term partial scaling, is implemented in the
open-source BioNetGen software package. We demonstrate that partial scaling can significantly
accelerate simulations without significant loss of accuracy for several published models of biological
systems. These models characterize activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK, prion
protein aggregation, and T-cell receptor signaling.
