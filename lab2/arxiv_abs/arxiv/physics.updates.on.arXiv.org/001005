We propose a numerical methodology for the numerical simulation of distinct, interacting physical
processes described by a combination of compressible, inert and reactive forms of the Euler equations,
multiphase equations and elastoplastic equations. These systems of equations are usually solved
by coupling finite element and CFD models. Here we solve them simultaneously, by recasting all the
equations in the same, hyperbolic form and solving them on the same grid with the same finite-volume
numerical schemes. The proposed compressible, multiphase, hydrodynamic formulation can employ
a hierarchy of five reactive and non-reactive flow models, which allows simple to more involved
applications to be directly described by the appropriate selection. The communication between
the hydrodynamic and elastoplastic systems is facilitated by means of mixed-material Riemann
solvers at the boundaries of the systems, which represent physical material boundaries. To this
end we derive approximate mixed Riemann solvers for each pair of the above models based on characteristic
equations. The components for reactive flow and elastoplastic solid modelling are validated separately
before presenting validation for the full, coupled systems. Multi-dimensional use cases demonstrate
the suitability of the reactive flow-solid interaction methodology in the context of impact-driven
initiation of reactive flow and structural response due to violent reaction in automotive (e.g.
car crash) or defence (e.g. explosive reactive armour) applications. Several types of explosives
(C4, Deetasheet, nitromethane, gaseous fuel) in gaseous, liquid and solid state are considered.
