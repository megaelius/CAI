In this paper we describe inflation driven by a real massless scalar inflaton field $\varphi$ whose
potential is identically equal to zero. The Einstein gravitational field equations are formulated
on an eight-dimensional spacetime manifold of four space dimensions and four time dimensions.
The field equations are sourced by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the real massless scalar
inflaton field $\varphi$. For the case of a diagonal metric, two periodic solution classes for the
coupled Einstein field equations are obtained that exhibit temporal exponential \textbf{deflation
of three of the four time dimensions} and temporal exponential inflation of three of the four space
dimensions. For brevity this phenomenon is sometimes simply called ``inflation." We show that
\textbf{the extra time dimensions do not generally induce the exponentially rapid growth of fluctuations
of quantum fields.} Also, unphysical closed timelike curves are not observed in this model. For
the first solution class \textbf{the universe does not cool during inflation}. Reheating \cite{PhysRevD.56.3258}
is a non-issue. Comoving coordinates for the two non-inflating/deflating dimensions are chosen
to be $(x^4, x^8)$. The $x^4$ coordinate corresponds to our universe's observed physical time dimension,
while the $x^8$ coordinate corresponds to a new spatial dimension that is assumed to be compact.
Quadratic $\partial_{x^8}\,\varphi$ terms are seen to play the role of an effective inflaton potential
in the dynamical field equations. In this model, after ``inflation" the observable physical macroscopic
world appears to a classical observer to be a homogeneous, isotropic universe with three space dimensions
and one time dimension.
