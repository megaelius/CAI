Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows for the determination of atomic structures
and concentrations of different chemicals in a biochemical sample of interest. MRS is used in vivo
clinically to aid in the diagnosis of several pathologies that affect metabolic pathways in the
body. Typically, this experiment produces a one dimensional (1D) 1H spectrum containing several
peaks that are well associated with biochemicals, or metabolites. However, since many of these
peaks overlap, distinguishing chemicals with similar atomic structures becomes much more challenging.
One technique capable of overcoming this issue is the localized correlated spectroscopy (L-COSY)
experiment, which acquires a second spectral dimension and spreads overlapping signal across
this second dimension. Unfortunately, the acquisition of a two dimensional (2D) spectroscopy
experiment is extremely time consuming. Furthermore, quantitation of a 2D spectrum is more complex.
Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged in the field of medicine as a powerful force capable
of diagnosing disease, aiding in treatment, and even predicting treatment outcome. In this study,
we utilize deep learning to: 1) accelerate the L-COSY experiment and 2) quantify L-COSY spectra.
We demonstrate that our deep learning model greatly outperforms compressed sensing based reconstruction
of L-COSY spectra at higher acceleration factors. Specifically, at four-fold acceleration, our
method has less than 5% normalized mean squared error, whereas compressed sensing yields 20% normalized
mean squared error. We also show that at low SNR (25% noise compared to maximum signal), our deep learning
model has less than 8% normalized mean squared error for quantitation of L-COSY spectra. These pilot
simulation results appear promising and may help improve the efficiency and accuracy of L-COSY
experiments in the future.
