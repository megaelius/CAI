High harmonic generation (HHG) is a manifestation of the strongly nonlinear response of matter
to intense laser fields and has, as the basis for coherent XUV sources a variety of applications.
Recently, HHG from atoms in a phase and polarization structured laser was demonstrated and interpreted
based on the transverse electric field component of the driving pulse. Here we point out that as dictated
by Maxwell equations, such fields have a longitudinal component which in general has a fundamental
influence on the charge dynamics. For instance, its interplay with the transversal field component
enables endowing the emitted radiation locally with circular polarization and a defined polarity.
It is shown that the time-dependent Stokes parameters defining the polarization state of HHG can
be tuned by varying the waist of the driving field which in turn, changes the ratio between the longitudinal
and transverse electric-field components of the driving laser. In addition, employing a multipole
expansion of the produced harmonics exposes the specific multipolar character and the relation
to the spatial structure of the driving field polarization states. The scheme proposed here allows
a full polarization control of the emitted harmonics by only one driving laser. A tighter focusing
of the driving pulse renders possible the emission of harmonics with both even and odd spatial symmetry.
The underlying mechanism is due to the fundamental interplay between the transverse and longitudinal
components of the laser's electromagnetic vector potential. The ratio between those components
is controllable by just focusing the laser spot, pointing to an accessible tool for polarization
and polarity control of the high harmonics.
