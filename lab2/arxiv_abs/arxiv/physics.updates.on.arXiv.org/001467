Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the skin is gaining recognition and is increasingly
applied to dermatological research. A key dermatological parameter inferred from an OCT image
is the epidermal (Ep) thickness as a thickened Ep can be an indicator of a skin disease. Agreement
in the literature on the signal characters of Ep and the subjacent skin layer, the dermis (D), is evident.
Ambiguities of the OCT signal interpretation in the literature is however seen for the transition
region between the Ep and D, which from histology is known as the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ);
a distinct junction comprised by the lower surface of a single cell layer in epidermis connected
to an even thinner basement membrane, attached to the underlying dermis. In this work we investigate
the impact of an improved axial and lateral resolution on the applicability of OCT for imaging of
the skin. To this goal, OCT images are compared produced by a commercial OCT system and by an in-house
built ultrahigh resolution (UHR-) OCT system for dermatology. In 11 healthy volunteers, we investigate
the DEJ signal characteristics. We perform a detailed analysis of the dark (low) signal band clearly
seen for UHR-OCT in the DEJ region where we, by using a transition function, find the signal transition
of axial sub-resolution character, which can be directly attributed to the exact location of DEJ,
both in normal (thin/hairy) and glabrous (thick) skin. For selected healthy volunteers, we investigate
the dermal papillae and the vellus hairs and identify distinct features that only UHR-OCT can resolve.
Differences are seen in tracing hairs of diameter below 20mm, and in imaging the dermal papillae
where capillary structures are identified in the hand palm, not previously reported in OCT studies
and specifically for glabrous skin not reported in any other in vivo optical imaging studies.
