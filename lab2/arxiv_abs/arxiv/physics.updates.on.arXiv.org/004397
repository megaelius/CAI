The $GW$ approximation to many-body perturbation theory is a reliable tool for describing charged
electronic excitations, and it has been successfully applied to a wide range of extended systems
for several decades using a plane-wave basis. However, the $GW$ approximation has been used to test
limited spectral properties of a limited set of finite systems (e.g. frontier orbital energies
of closed-shell $sp$ molecules) only for about a decade using a local-orbital basis. Here, we calculate
the quasiparticle spectra of closed- and open-shell molecular anions with partially and completely
filled 3$d$ shells (shallow and deep 3$d$ states, respectively), ScO$^{-}$, TiO$^{-}$, CuO$^{-}$,
and ZnO$^{-}$, using various levels of $GW$ theory, and compare them to experiments to evaluate
the performance of the $GW$ approximation on the electronic structure of small molecules containing
3$d$ transition metals. We find that the $G$-only eigenvalue self-consistent $GW$ scheme with
$W$ fixed to the PBE level ($G_{n}W_{0}$@PBE), which gives the best compromise between accuracy
and efficiency for solids, also gives good results for both localized ($d$) and delocalized ($sp$)
states of 3$d$-transition-metal oxide molecules. The success of $G_{n}W_{0}$@PBE in predicting
electronic excitations in these systems reasonably well is likely due to the fortuitous cancellation
effect between the overscreening of the Coulomb interaction by PBE and the underscreening by the
neglect of vertex corrections. Together with the absence of the self-consistent field convergence
error (e.g. spin contamination in open-shell systems) and the $GW$ multi-solution issue, the $G_{n}W_{0}$@PBE
scheme gives the possibility to predict the electronic structure of complex real systems (e.g.
molecule-solid and $sp$-$d$ hybrid systems) accurately and efficiently.
