Although earthquake prediction is a big challenge in the world, some simple observational tools
can capture many physical signals and demonstrate that an earthquake (EQ) may be forthcoming in
short period. Many researchers have studied the significant variation of atmospheric electrostatic
field related to the forthcoming earthquake. However, until now, there is not a compelling physical
mechanism which can explain why atmospheric electrostatic abnormal signal could appear just before
an earthquake. Here we present a precursor signal and propose a brief physical interpretation.
Under fair air conditions, if the near-surface atmospheric electrostatic field Ez (oriented down
when it is positive) presents a very stable negative anomaly (from -100 V/m to -5000 V/m), it will
forebode that an earthquake (seismicity from 3-8) would take place in the next several to tens of
hours within a distance less than 100 km. We name this prediction technique as "DC Ez Determination"(DED).
In addition, the mechanism of such abnormal quasi-static electric field before a forthcoming earthquake
has been proposed here: (1) Radon gas releases from the rock clefts near the epicenter during seismogenic
process. (2) {\alpha} particles are produced due to the radioactive decay of Radon gas in the air.
(3) {\alpha} particle ionizing radiation creates more positive particles in the air, which is much
more effective than that {\beta} and {\gamma} particles produced during Radon radioactive decay.
(4) The new positive particles change formal positive atmospheric electric field (Ez) into stably
negative near the earth-surface. (5) The closer the instrument is to the epicenter, the more likely
it is to observe the negative Ez signal related to the earthquake. It is recommended to establish
an instrument network to capture the reliable precursor and make some warnings before the earthquake
disaster.
