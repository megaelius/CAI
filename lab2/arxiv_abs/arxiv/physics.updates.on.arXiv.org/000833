Tearing modes with real frequencies in the plasma frame (i.e. in addition to the Doppler shift due
to $E\times B$ rotation) are of potential importance because of their effect on the locking process.
In particular, it has recently been shown [J. M. Finn, A. J. Cole, and D. P. Brennan, Phys. Plasmas
(Letters), 22:120701, 2015] that the Maxwell torque on the plasma in the presence of an applied error
field is modified significantly for tearing modes having real frequencies near marginal stability.
In addition, it is known [J. M. Finn and R. A. Gerwin, Phys. Plasmas, 3:2344, 1996] that resistive
wall tearing modes can be destabilized below their no-wall limits by rotation, if the tearing modes
have real frequencies near marginal stability. In this paper we first derive the tearing mode dispersion
relation with pressure gradient, field line curvature and parallel dynamics in the resistive-inertial
(RI) regime, neglecting the divergence of the $E\times B$ drift and perpendicular resistivity.
The results show that the usual Glasser effect, a toroidal effect which involves real frequencies,
occurs in this simplified model, which ignores perpendicular resistivity and the divergence of
the $E\times B$ drift. We also find, using a similar simple model, the surprising result that in the
viscoresistive regime with pressure gradient, favorable curvature due to toroidal effects, and
parallel dynamics, a similar Glasser-like effect is found. We show that in both regimes the existence
of tearing modes with complex frequencies is related to nearby electrostatic resistive interchange
modes with complex frequencies. We discuss the effect on locking to an error field and the significant
lowering of the threshold for destabilization of resistive wall tearing modes, which can be much
more pronounced than the weak effect observed for RI tearing modes without pressure-curvature
drive in Finn and Gerwin, 1996.
