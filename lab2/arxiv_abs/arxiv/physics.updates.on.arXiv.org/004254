Our collective understanding of azimuthally-asymmetric features within the coherent structure
of a tropical cyclone (TC) continues to improve with the availability of more detailed observations
and high-resolution model outputs. However, a precise understanding of how these asymmetries
impact TC intensity changes is lacking. Prior attempts at investigating the asymmetric impacts
follow a mean-eddy partitioning that condenses the effect of all the asymmetries into one term and
fails to highlight the differences in the role of asymmetries at different scales. In this study,
we present a novel energetics-based approach to analyze the asymmetric impacts at multiple length-scales
during periods of TC rapid intensity changes. Using model outputs of TCs under low and high shear,
we compute the different energy pathways that enhance/suppress the growth of multi-scale asymmetries
in the wavenumber (WN) domain. We then compare and contrast the energetics of the mean flow field
(WN 0) with that of the persistent, coherent vortex-scale asymmetric structures (WNs 1,2) and the
more local, transient, sub-vortex-scale asymmetries (WNs $\geq$ 3). We find in our case-studies
that the dominant mechanisms of growth/decay of the asymmetries are the baroclinic conversion
from available potential to kinetic energy at individual scales of asymmetries, and the transactions
of kinetic energy between the asymmetries of various length-scales; rather than the barotropic
mean-eddy transactions as is typically assumed. Our case-study analysis further shows that the
growth/decay of asymmetries is largely independent of the mean. Certain aspects of eddy energetics
can potentially serve as early-warning indicators of TC rapid intensity changes.
