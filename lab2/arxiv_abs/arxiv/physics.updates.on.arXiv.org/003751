Gravitational-wave observations of double compact object (DCO) mergers are providing new insights
into the physics of massive stars and the evolution of binary systems. Making the most of expected
near-future observations for understanding stellar physics will rely on comparisons with binary
population synthesis models. However, the vast majority of simulated binaries never produce DCOs,
which makes calculating such populations computationally inefficient. We present an importance
sampling algorithm, STROOPWAFEL, that improves the computational efficiency of population studies
of rare events, by focusing the simulation around regions of the initial parameter space found to
produce outputs of interest. We implement the algorithm in the binary population synthesis code
COMPAS, and compare the efficiency of our implementation to the standard method of Monte Carlo sampling
from the birth probability distributions. STROOPWAFEL finds $\sim$25-200 times more DCO mergers
than the standard sampling method with the same simulation size, and so speeds up simulations by
up to two orders of magnitude. Finding more DCO mergers automatically maps the parameter space with
far higher resolution than when using the traditional sampling. This increase in efficiency also
leads to a decrease of a factor $\sim$3-10 in statistical sampling uncertainty for the predictions
from the simulations. This is particularly notable for the distribution functions of observable
quantities such as the black hole and neutron star chirp mass distribution, including in the tails
of the distribution functions where predictions using standard sampling can be dominated by sampling
noise.
