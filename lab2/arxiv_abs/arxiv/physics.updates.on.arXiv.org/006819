In the year 2000, in a paper titled Quantum Theory Needs No 'Interpretation', Chris Fuchs and Asher
Peres presented a series of instrumentalist arguments against the role played by 'interpretations'
in QM. Since then --quite regardless of the publication of this paper-- the number of interpretations
has experienced a continuous growth constituting what Adan Cabello has characterized as a "map
of madness". In this work, we discuss the reasons behind this dangerous fragmentation in understanding
and provide new arguments against the need of interpretations in QM which --opposite to those of
Fuchs and Peres-- are derived from a representational realist understanding of theories --grounded
in the writings of Einstein, Heisenberg and Pauli. Furthermore, we will argue that there are reasons
to believe that the creation of 'interpretations' for the theory of quanta has functioned as a trap
designed by anti-realists in order to imprison realists in a labyrinth with no exit. Taking as a standpoint
the critical analysis by David Deutsch to the anti-realist understanding of physics, we attempt
to address the references and roles played by 'theory' and 'observation'. In this respect, we will
argue that the key to escape the anti-realist trap of interpretation is to recognize that --as Einstein
told Heisenberg almost one century ago-- it is only the theory which can tell you what can be observed.
Finally, we will conclude that what QM needs is not a new interpretation but instead, a theoretical
(formal-conceptual) consistent, coherent and unified scheme which allows us to understand what
the theory is really talking about.
