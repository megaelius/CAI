This study presents an experimental measurement of pedestrians' body rotation in bidirectional
streams. A mock-up corridor monitored using a camera placed on azimuthal position is used to study
pedestrians' behavior in unidirectional and bidirectional flows. Additionally, a commercial
tablet is fixed on the chest of sample pedestrians to examine their body rotation (or yawing) which
cannot be obtained using position tracking alone. Angular velocity is recorded and simultaneously
stored in a central location using a wireless network, thus allowing the analysis of body movements
with a high sampling rate and a limited delay. To investigate the influence of major/minor flow proportion
(flow-ratio) on bidirectional streams two different situations were tested: the balanced configuration
(with equal flows in both directions) and an unbalanced configuration (with different major and
minor flow). Results clearly show that unidirectional flow is more stable compared to the bidirectional
case, requiring less time to cross the experimental section and showing a very small amount of rotation
during the whole experiment. Both bidirectional configurations showed high values of body rotation,
in particular during lane formation and dissolution. Finally, rotation directly measured on pedestrians'
body was compared with the one obtained indirectly by analyzing pedestrians' trajectories. The
comparison shows that, at least from a qualitative point of view, both methods are in agreement,
thus suggesting that even properties which can only be measured by motion sensing could be obtained
indirectly through the analysis of trajectories. Concluding, it has been suggested that while
lanes help smooth out bidirectional flows, larger instabilities are observed compared to the unidirectional
case. Lane separation and/or appropriate guidance are therefore required.
