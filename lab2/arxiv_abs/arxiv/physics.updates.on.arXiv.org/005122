Despite the extensive usage of oxide glasses for a few millennia, the composition-property relationships
in these materials still remain poorly understood. While empirical and physics-based models have
been used to predict properties, these remain limited to a few select compositions or a series of
glasses. Designing new glasses requires a priori knowledge of how the composition of a glass dictates
its properties such as stiffness, density, or processability. Thus, accelerated design of glasses
for targeted applications remain impeded due to the lack of universal composition-property models.
Herein, using deep learning, we present a methodology for the rational design of oxide glasses.
Exploiting a large dataset of glasses comprising of up to 37 oxide components and more than 100,000
glass compositions, we develop high-fidelity deep neural networks for the prediction of eight
properties that enable the design of glasses, namely, density, Young's modulus, shear modulus,
hardness, glass transition temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, liquidus temperature,
and refractive index. These models are by far the most extensive models developed as they cover the
entire range of human-made glass compositions. We demonstrate that the models developed here exhibit
excellent predictability, ensuring close agreement with experimental observations. Using these
models, we develop a series of new design charts, termed as glass selection charts. These charts
enable the rational design of functional glasses for targeted applications by identifying unique
compositions that satisfy two or more constraints, on both compositions and properties, simultaneously.
The generic design approach presented herein could catalyze machine-learning assisted materials
design and discovery for a large class of materials including metals, ceramics, and proteins.
