This article examines the use of characteristic methods in stratified two-phase pipe flow simulations
for obtaining non-dissipative flow predictions. A Roe scheme and several methods based on the principle
of characteristics are presented for the two-fluid model. The main focus is finding numerically
efficient ways of capturing wave dynamics and flow regime transitions through direct simulation.
Characteristic methods offer the possibility of simulating hyperbolic systems without numerical
dissipation. These methods do however lack certain fundamental conservation properties. Challenges
related to information scattering and clustering in space and time, particularly around shocks,
are also an issue in some method variants. Hybridisations with the finite volume method are proposed
which overcome these shortcomings. All methods are compared, evaluating predictions on the onset
of linear wave growth and simulations of non-linear, discontinuous roll-waves. The following
observations are made: 1. Characteristic methods are excellent at predicting the onset of linear
hydrodynamic instability, even with a small number of computational nodes. 2. Dissipative errors
in finite volume methods and characteristic hybrids will be closely linked to the Courant number.
The Roe scheme and the characteristic hybrids give very little dissipation error as the Courant
number approaches unity. This then becomes a question of numerical stability. 3. Adapting dynamic
grid cells, moving along with the characteristics information drift, greatly improves simulation
efficiency by allowing for longer time steps. Dynamic grid cells are also useful for alleviating
the need for interpolation in characteristic methods. These methods easily out-perform the more
basic upwind and Lax-Friedrich schemes.
