We study compressible turbulent flow in a circular pipe, at computationally high Reynolds number.
Classical related issues are addressed and discussed in light of the DNS data, including validity
of compressibility transformations, velocity/temperature relations, passive scalar statistics,
and size of turbulent eddies.Regarding velocity statistics, we find that Huang's transformation
yields excellent universality of the scaled Reynolds stresses distributions, whereas the transformation
proposed by Trettel and Larsson (2016) yields better representation of the effects of strong variation
of density and viscosity occurring in the buffer layer on the mean velocity distribution. A clear
logarithmic layer is recovered in terms of transformed velocity and wall distance coordinates
at the higher Reynolds number under scrutiny ($\Rey_{\tau} \approx 1000$), whereas the core part
of the flow is found to be characterized by a universal parabolic velocity profile. Based on formal
similarity between the streamwise velocity and the passive scalar transport equations, we further
propose an extension of the above compressibility transformations to also achieve universality
of passive scalar statistics. Analysis of the velocity/temperature relationship provides evidence
for quadratic dependence which is very well approximated by the thermal analogy proposed by Zhang
et Al.(2014). The azimuthal velocity and scalar spectra show an organization very similar to canonical
incompressible flow, with a bump-shaped distribution across the flow scales, whose peak increases
with the wall distance. We find that the size growth effect is well accounted for through an effective
length scale accounting for the local friction velocity and for the local mean shear.
