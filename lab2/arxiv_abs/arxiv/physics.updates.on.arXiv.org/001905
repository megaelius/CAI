Most of the currently popular Eulerian vortex identification criteria, including the Q criterion,
the Delta criterion and the Lambda_ci criterion, are based on the analysis of the velocity gradient
tensor. More specifically, these criteria are exclusively determined by the eigenvalues of the
velocity gradient tensor or the related invariants and thereby can be regarded as eigenvalue-based
criteria. However, these criteria have been found to be plagued with two shortcomings: (1) these
criteria fail to identify the swirl axis or orientation; (2) these criteria are prone to contamination
by shearing. In this paper, an alternative eigenvector-based definition of Rortex is introduced.
The real eigenvector of the velocity gradient tensor is used to define the direction of Rortex as
the possible axis of the local fluid rotation, and the rotational strength obtained in the plane
perpendicular to the possible local axis is defined as the magnitude of Rortex. This alternative
definition is mathematically equivalent to our previous one but allows a much more efficient implementation.
Furthermore, a complete and systematic interpretation of scalar, vector and tensor versions of
Rortex is presented to provide a unified and clear characterization of the instantaneous local
rigidly rotation. By relying on the tensor interpretation of Rortex, a new decomposition of the
velocity gradient tensor is proposed to shed light on the analytical relations between Rortex and
eigenvalue-based criteria. It can be observed that shearing always manifests its effect on the
imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues and consequently contaminates eigenvalue-based criteria,
while Rortex can exclude the shearing contamination and accurately quantify the local rotational
strength.
