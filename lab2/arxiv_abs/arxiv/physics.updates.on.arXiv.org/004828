In the framework of the PPN formalism, we propose and substantiate a hypothesis according to which
we can measure the value of the cosmological gravitational potential $\Phi_\text{CP}$ at the location
of the Solar System. By the cosmological gravitational potential, we mean the potential formed
by all the matter of the Universe (including dark matter and dark energy). At the same time, we believe
that this global potential is spatially uniform on the scales of the solar system, and its value significantly
exceeds the Newtonian gravitational potential of the Sun $\varphi_\text{S}$ (where $|\varphi_\text{S}|/c^2\sim
10^{-8}$ in orbit of the Earth). Our method is based on the experimental measurement of the PPN parameters
$\beta$ and $\gamma$, where information on $\Phi_\text{CP}$ is contained in the differences ($\beta
-1$) and ($\gamma -1$). Starting from the cosmological description of the Universe within the framework
of GR (i.e., $\gamma_0=\beta_0=1$ in the initial cosmological reference frame), we have shown
that from the viewpoint of the local (laboratory) observer, the following relations hold for the
post-Newtonian parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$: $|\gamma-1|\sim |\Phi_\text{CP}|/c^2 $ and
$|\beta-1|\sim |\Phi_\text{CP}|/c^2$. This leads to the estimate: $|\beta-1|>10^{-6}$ and
$|\gamma-1|>10^{-6}$ for gravitational experiments in the Solar system. The obtained results
open up new unique opportunities for exploring the Universe, testing various theories of gravity
and cosmological models. In particular, we determined an experimental cosmological test for GR.
In addition, a unique post-Newtonian model of gravity has also been found, which is insensitive
to cosmological potential and for which $\gamma= \gamma_0=\beta=\beta_0=1$ is always from the
viewpoint of the cosmological and any laboratory observers. However, this model differs from Einstein's
theory.
