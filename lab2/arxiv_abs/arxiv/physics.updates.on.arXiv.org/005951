Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) and its particle-driven counterpart, plasma wakefield acceleration
(PWFA), are commonly treated as separate, though related branches of high-gradient plasma-based
acceleration. However, novel proposed schemes are increasingly residing at the interface of both
concepts where the understanding of their interplay becomes crucial. Here, we report on experiments
covering a wide range of parameters by using nanocoulomb-class quasi-monoenergetic electron
beams from LWFA with a 100-TW-class laser. Based on a controlled electron injection, these beams
reach record-level performance in terms of laser-to-beam energy transfer efficiency (up to 10%),
spectral charge density (regularly exceeding 10 pC/MeV) and divergence (1 mrad full width at half
maximum divergence). The impact of charge fluctuations on the energy spectra of electron bunches
is assessed for different laser parameters, including a few-cycle laser, followed by a presentation
of results on beam loading in LWFA with two electron bunches. This scenario is particularly promising
to provide high-quality electron beams by using one of the bunches to either tailor the laser wakefield
via beam loading or to drive its own, beam-dominated wakefield. We present experimental evidence
for the latter, showing a varying acceleration of a low-energy witness beam with respect to the charge
of a high-energy drive beam in a spatially separate gas target. With the increasing availability
of petawatt-class lasers the access to this new regime of laser-plasma wakefield acceleration
will be further facilitated, thus providing new paths towards low-emittance beam generation for
future plasma-based colliders or light sources.
