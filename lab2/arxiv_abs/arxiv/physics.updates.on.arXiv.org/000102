An extrapolation of the genetic complexity of organisms to earlier times suggests that life began
before the Earth was formed. Life may have started from systems with single heritable elements that
are functionally equivalent to a nucleotide. The genetic complexity, roughly measured by the number
of non-redundant functional nucleotides, is expected to have grown exponentially due to several
positive feedback factors: gene cooperation, duplication of genes with their subsequent specialization,
and emergence of novel functional niches associated with existing genes. Linear regression of
genetic complexity on a log scale extrapolated back to just one base pair suggests the time of the
origin of life 9.7 billion years ago. This cosmic time scale for the evolution of life has important
consequences: life took ca. 5 billion years to reach the complexity of bacteria; the environments
in which life originated and evolved to the prokaryote stage may have been quite different from those
envisaged on Earth; there was no intelligent life in our universe prior to the origin of Earth, thus
Earth could not have been deliberately seeded with life by intelligent aliens; Earth was seeded
by panspermia; experimental replication of the origin of life from scratch may have to emulate many
cumulative rare events; and the Drake equation for guesstimating the number of civilizations in
the universe is likely wrong, as intelligent life has just begun appearing in our universe. Evolution
of advanced organisms has accelerated via development of additional information-processing
systems: epigenetic memory, primitive mind, multicellular brain, language, books, computers,
and Internet. As a result the doubling time of complexity has reached ca. 20 years. Finally, we discuss
the issue of the predicted technological singularity and give a biosemiotics perspective on the
increase of complexity.
