Pixelated PET systems produce higher count rates as they integrate several detecting channels
per detector module. An increased data flow from the detectors posses higher needs on the bandwidth
requirements. We aim to optimize the bandwidth usage efficiency by filtering on the fly the detected
events with non valid energies. PET systems with a SiPM-ASIC readout scheme are being extensively
used to get enhanced images on Time-Of-Flight PET scanners. These kind of digital readout systems
are specially interesting for the application of on-line processing techniques given the ease
of access to each detected event digital information. This study purses the analysis of on-line
processing techniques on the DAQ front-end level (on-detector electronics) for pixelated PET
systems with SiPM-ASIC readout. In particular, we worked with a tunable on-line energy discriminating
stage. For the optimization of its hardwired internal limits we analyzed the system energy space.
We explored different solutions dependent or not on the system's energy calibration. Results obtained
through the different filter versions confirm the minimal resources consumption of such processing
techniques implemented at DAQ front-end level. Our experiences showed how the filtering process
reduces the bandwidth needs excluding from the data stream all non valid energy events and thus improving
the system sensitivity under saturation conditions. Additionally, these experiments highlight
how setting proper energy limits we ensure the preservation of the system performance, which maintains
its original energy and time resolution. Under the light of these findings, we see a great potential
on the application of on-line processing techniques for Time-Of-Flight PET at the DAQ font-end
level (on-detector electronics) and so we envisaged more complex processing methods.
