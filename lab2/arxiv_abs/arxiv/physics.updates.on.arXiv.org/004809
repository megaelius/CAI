Beam lattice materials are characterized by a periodic microstructure realizing a geometrically
regular pattern of elementary cells. In these microstructured materials, the dispersion properties
governing the free dynamic propagation of elastic waves can be studied by formulating parametric
lagrangian models and applying the Floquet-Bloch theory. Within this framework, governing the
wave propagation by means of spectral design techniques and/or energy dissipation mechanisms
is a major issue of theoretical and applied interest. Specifically, the wave propagation can be
inhibited by purposely designing the microstructural parameters to open band gaps in the material
spectrum at target center frequencies. Based on these motivations, a general dynamic formulation
for determining the dispersion properties of beam lattice metamaterials, equipped with local
resonators is presented. The mechanism of local resonance is realized by tuning periodic auxiliary
masses, viscoelastically coupled with the beam lattice microstructure. As peculiar aspect, the
viscoelastic coupling is derived by a mechanical formulation based on the Boltzmann superposition
integral, whose kernel is approximated by a Prony series. Consequently, the free propagation of
damped waves is governed by a linear homogeneous system of integral-differential equations of
motion. Therefore, differential equations of motion with frequency-dependent coefficients
are obtained by applying the bilateral Laplace transform. The corresponding complex-valued branches
characterizing the dispersion spectrum are determined and parametrically analyzed. Particularly,
the spectra corresponding to Taylor series approximations of the equation coefficients are investigated.
