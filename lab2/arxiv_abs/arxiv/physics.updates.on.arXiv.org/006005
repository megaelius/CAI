Background: Dataset skills are used in STEM fields from healthcare work to astronomy research.
Few fields explicitly teach students the skills to analyze datasets, and yet the increasing push
for authentic science implies these skills should be taught. Purpose: The overarching motivation
is to understand learning of dataset skills within an astronomy context. Specifically, when participants
work with a 200-entry Google Sheets dataset of astronomical data about quasars, what are they learning,
how are they learning it, and who is doing the learning? Sample: The authors studied a matched set
of participants (n=87) consisting of 54 university undergraduate students (34 male, 18 female),
and 33 science educators (16 male, 17 female). Design and methods: Participants explored a three-phase
dataset activity and were given an eight-question multiple-choice pre/post-test covering skills
of analyzing datasets and astronomy content, with questions spanning Bloom's Taxonomy. Pre/post-test
scores were compared and a t-test performed for subsamples by population. Results: Participants
exhibited learning of both dataset skills and astronomy content, indicating that dataset skills
can be learned through this astronomy activity. Participants exhibited gains in both recall and
synthesis questions, indicating learning is non-sequential. Female undergraduate students
exhibited lower levels of learning than other populations. Conclusions: Implications of the study
include a stronger dataset focus in post-secondary STEM education and among science educators,
and the need for further investigation into how instructors can ameliorate the challenges faced
by female undergraduate students.
