The formalism of partial information decomposition provides independent or non-overlapping
components constituting total information content provided by a set of source variables about
the target variable. These components are recognised as unique information, synergistic information
and, redundant information. The metric of net synergy, conceived as the difference between synergistic
and redundant information, is capable of detecting synergy, redundancy and, information independence
among stochastic variables. And it can be quantified, as it is done here, using appropriate combinations
of different Shannon mutual information terms. Utilisation of such a metric in network motifs with
the nodes representing different biochemical species, involved in information sharing, uncovers
rich store for interesting results. In the current study, we make use of this formalism to obtain
a comprehensive understanding of the relative information processing mechanism in a diamond motif
and two of its sub-motifs namely bifurcation and integration motif embedded within the diamond
motif. The emerging patterns of synergy and redundancy and their effective contribution towards
ensuring high fidelity information transmission are duly compared in the sub-motifs and independent
motifs (bifurcation and integration). In this context, the crucial roles played by various time
scales and activation coefficients in the network topologies are especially emphasised. We show
that the origin of synergy and redundancy in information transmission can be physically justified
by decomposing diamond motif into bifurcation and integration motif.
