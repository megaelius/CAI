The objective of this paper is to examine population response to COVID-19 and associated policy
interventions through detecting early-warning signals in time series of visits to points of interest
(POIs). Complex systems, such as cities, demonstrate early-warning signals when they approach
phase transitions responding to external perturbation, including crises, policy changes, and
human behavior changes. In urban systems, population visits to POIs represent a state in the complex
systems that are cities. These states may undergo phase transitions due to population response
to pandemic risks and intervention policies. In this study, we conducted early-warning signal
detection on population visits to POIs to examine population response to pandemic risks. We examined
two early-warning signals, the increase of autocorrelation at-lag-1 and standard deviation,
in time series of population visits to POIs in 17 metropolitan cities in the United States of America.
The results show that: (1) early-warning signals for population response to COVID-19 were detected
between February 14 and March 11, 2020 in 17 cities; (2) detected population response had started
prior to shelter-in-place orders in 17 cities; (3) early-warning signals detected from the essential
POIs visits appeared earlier than those from non-essential POIs; and 4) longer time lags between
detected population response and shelter-in-place orders led to a less decrease in POI visits.
The results show the importance of detecting early-warning signals during crises in cities as complex
systems. Early-warning signals could provide important insights regarding the timing and extent
of population response to crises to inform policy makers.
