We present numerical simulations of laminar and turbulent channel flow of an elastoviscoplastic
fluid. The non-Newtonian flow is simulated by solving the full incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
coupled with the evolution equation for the elastoviscoplastic stress tensor. The laminar simulations
are carried out for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, Bingham numbers and ratios of the fluid and total
viscosity, while the turbulent flow simulations are performed at a fixed bulk Reynolds number equal
to 2800 and weak elasticity. We show that in the laminar flow regime the friction factor increases
monotonically with the Bingham number (yield stress) and decreases with the viscosity ratio, while
in the turbulent regime the the friction factor is almost independent of the viscosity ratio and
decreases with the Bingham number, until the flow eventually returns to a fully laminar condition
for large enough yield stresses. Three main regimes are found in the turbulent case, depending on
the Bingham number: for low values, the friction Reynolds number and the turbulent flow statistics
only slightly differ from those of a Newtonian fluid; for intermediate values of the Bingham number,
the fluctuations increase and the inertial equilibrium range is lost. Finally, for higher values
the flow completely laminarises. These different behaviors are associated with a progressive
increases of the volume where the fluid is not yielded, growing from the centerline towards the walls
as the Bingham number increases. The unyielded region interacts with the near-wall structures,
forming preferentially above the high speed streaks. In particular, the near-wall streaks and
the associated quasi-streamwise vortices are strongly enhanced in an highly elastoviscoplastic
fluid and the flow becomes more correlated in the streamwise direction.
