This work examines the effect of the embedded magnetic field strength on the non-linear development
of the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) (with a field-aligned interface) in an ideal
gas close to the incompressible limit in three dimensions. Numerical experiments are conducted
in a domain sufficiently large so as to allow the predicted critical modes to develop in a physically
realistic manner. The ratio between gravity, which drives the instability in this case (as well
as in several of the corresponding observations), and magnetic field strength is taken up to a ratio
which accurately reflects that of observed astrophysical plasma, in order to allow comparison
between the results of the simulations and the observational data which served as inspiration for
this work. This study finds reduced non-linear growth of the rising bubbles of the RTI for stronger
magnetic fields, and that this is directly due to the change in magnetic field strength, rather than
the indirect effect of altering characteristic length scales with respect to domain size. By examining
the growth of the falling spikes, the growth rate appears to be enhanced for the strongest magnetic
field strengths, suggesting that rather than affecting the development of the system as a whole,
increased magnetic field strengths in fact introduce an asymmetry to the system. Further investigation
of this effect also revealed that the greater this asymmetry, the less efficiently the gravitational
energy is released. By better understanding the under-studied regime of such a major phenomenon
in astrophysics, deeper explanations for observations may be sought, and this work illustrates
that the strength of magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas influences observed RTI in subtle
and complex ways.
