We introduce a \textit{non-modal} analysis technique that characterizes the diffusion properties
of spectral element methods for linear convection-diffusion systems. While strictly speaking
only valid for linear problems, the analysis is devised so that it can give critical insights on two
questions: (i) Why do spectral element methods suffer from stability issues in under-resolved
computations of nonlinear problems? And, (ii) why do they successfully predict under-resolved
turbulent flows even without a subgrid-scale model? The answer to these two questions can in turn
provide crucial guidelines to construct more robust and accurate schemes for complex under-resolved
flows, commonly found in industrial applications. For illustration purposes, this analysis technique
is applied to the hybridized discontinuous Galerkin methods as representatives of spectral element
methods. The effect of the polynomial order, the upwinding parameter and the P\'eclet number on
the so-called \textit{short-term diffusion} of the scheme are investigated. From a purely non-modal
analysis point of view, polynomial orders between $2$ and $4$ with standard upwinding are well suited
for under-resolved turbulence simulations. For lower polynomial orders, diffusion is introduced
in scales that are much larger than the grid resolution. For higher polynomial orders, as well as
for strong under/over-upwinding, robustness issues can be expected. The non-modal analysis results
are then tested against under-resolved turbulence simulations of the Burgers, Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations. While devised in the linear setting, our non-modal analysis succeeds to predict the
behavior of the scheme in the nonlinear problems considered.
