A recently proposed model of the Dirac electron, which describes observed properties of the particle
correctly, is in the present paper shown to be also able to explain quantum interference by classical
probabilities. According to this model, the electron is not point-like, but rather an "entity"
formed by a fast periodic motion of a quantum whose energy is equal to the rest energy of the electron.
Only after a time span equal to the period of that periodic motion the "entity" becomes the electron,
with its properties, mass, spin, charge, etc.. When in motion with respect to the observer, the "dynamic
substructure" of the electron described in this way, leads to a certain time structure of its detection
probability, if the space-time point of detection is taken as the space-time point of the quantum.
In the typical "two slit" experimental situation, this leads to a periodic detection probability
with a frequency of twice the De Broglie frequency. This result is identical to the result obtained
by the quantum mechanical description of the moving electron by the free particle wave function.
The different interpretations of the established interference pattern, inherent in the two alternative
theoretical descriptions is outlined, and the relation between the two descriptions discussed.
It is concluded that quantum interference is well explained with classical probabilities, without
quantum mechanics and without paradoxes. In view of the demonstrated merits of the model on the one
hand, and the new aspects regarding the established theories it implies on the other, a more thorough
investigation of its role in relation to relativistic quantum mechanics, and to quantum field theory
is suggested. Some of the interesting aspects are summarized.
