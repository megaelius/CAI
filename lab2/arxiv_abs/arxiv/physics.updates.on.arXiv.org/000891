Biochemical reactions typically occur at low copy numbers, but at once in crowded and diverse environments.
Space and stochasticity therefore play an essential role in biochemical networks. Spatial-stochastic
simulations have become a prominent tool for understanding how stochasticity at the microscopic
level influences the macroscopic behavior of such systems. However, while particle-based models
guarantee the level of detail necessary to accurately describe the microscopic dynamics at very
low copy numbers, the algorithms used to simulate them oftentimes imply trade-offs between computational
efficiency and accuracy. eGFRD (enhanced Green's Function Reaction Dynamics) is an exact algorithm
that evades such trade-offs by partitioning the N-particle system into M<N analytically tractable
one- and two-particle systems; the analytical solutions (Green's functions) then are used to implement
an event-driven particle-based scheme that allows particles to make large jumps in time and space
while retaining access to their state variables at any moment. Here we present "eGFRD2", a new eGFRD
version that implements the principle of eGFRD in all dimensions, enabling efficient simulation
of biochemical reaction-diffusion processes in the 3D cytoplasm, on 2D planes representing membranes,
and on 1D elongated cylinders representative of, e.g., cytoskeletal tracks or DNA; in 1D, it also
incorporates convective motion used to model active transport. We find that, for low particle densities,
eGFRD2 is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than optimized Brownian Dynamics. We exemplify the capabilities
of eGFRD2 by simulating an idealized model of Pom1 gradient formation, which involves 3D diffusion,
active transport on microtubules, and autophosphorylation on the membrane, confirming recent
results on this system and demonstrating that it can efficiently operate under genuinely stochastic
conditions.
