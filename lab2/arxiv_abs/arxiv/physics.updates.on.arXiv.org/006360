Purpose: Dual-energy CT (DECT) has been shown to derive stopping power ratio (SPR) map with higher
accuracy than conventional single energy CT (SECT) by obtaining the energy dependence of photon
interactions. However, DECT is not as widely implemented as SECT in proton radiation therapy simulation.
This work presents a learning-based method to synthetize DECT images from SECT for proton radiation
therapy. Methods: The proposed method uses a residual attention generative adversarial network.
Residual blocks with attention gates were used to force the model focus on the difference between
DECT maps and SECT images. To evaluate the accuracy of the method, we retrospectively investigated
20 head-and-neck cancer patients with both DECT and SECT scans available. The high and low energy
CT images acquired from DECT acted as learning targets in the training process for SECT datasets
and were evaluated against results from the proposed method using a leave-one-out cross-validation
strategy. To evaluate our method in the context of a practical application, we generated SPR maps
from sDECT using physics-based dual-energy stoichiometric method and compared the maps to those
generated from DECT. Results: The synthesized DECT images showed an average mean absolute error
around 30 Hounsfield Unit (HU) across the whole-body volume. The corresponding SPR maps generated
from synthetic DECT showed an average normalized mean square error of about 1% with reduced noise
level and artifacts than those from original DECT. Conclusions: The accuracy of the synthesized
DECT image by our machine-learning-based method was evaluated on head and neck patient, and potential
feasibility for proton treatment planning and dose calculation was shown by generating SPR map
using the synthesized DECT.
