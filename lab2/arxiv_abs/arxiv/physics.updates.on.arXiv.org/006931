The electronic wavefunctions of an atom or molecule are affected by its interactions with its environment.
These interactions dictate electronic and optical processes at interfaces, and is especially
relevant in the case of thin film optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells. In these devices,
charge transport and interfaces between multiple layers occur along the thickness or vertical
direction, and thus such electronic interactions are crucial in determining the device properties.
Here, we introduce a new in-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry data analysis method called DART with
the ability to directly probe electronic coupling due to intermolecular interactions along the
thickness direction using vacuum-deposited organic semiconductor thin films as a model system.
The analysis, which does not require any model fitting, reveals direct observations of electronic
coupling between frontier orbitals under optical excitations leading to delocalization of the
corresponding electronic wavefunctions with thickness or, equivalently, number of molecules
away from the interface in C60 and MeO-TPD deposited on an insulating substrate (SiO2). Applying
the same methodology for C60 deposited on phthalocyanine thin films, the analyses shows strong,
anomalous features - in comparison to C60 deposited on SiO2 - of the electronic wavefunctions corresponding
to specific excitation energies in C60 and phthalocyanines. Translation of such interactions
in terms of dielectric constants reveals plasmonic type resonance absorptions resulting from
oscillations of the excited state wavefunctions between the two materials across the interface.
Finally, reproducibility, angstrom-level sensitivity and simplicity of the method are highlighted
showcasing its applicability for studying electronic coupling between any vapor-deposited material
systems where real-time measurements during deposition are possible.
