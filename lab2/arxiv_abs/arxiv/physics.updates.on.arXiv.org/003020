We present a unified analysis framework that simultaneously covers self-modulation and parametric
instability of a short, relativistically intense laser pulse propagating inside an underdense
plasma. The key point in our approach is formulation of the plasma wave in terms of quantities which
become motion constants in the absence of pulse evolutions. This leads to (i) a transparent characterization
of the self-consistent plasma evolutions in the presence of laser pulse evolutions and (ii) recovering
the simple coupled-oscillator form for field-plasma perturbations, even in the presence of strong
initial wakefield. The latter facilitate instability studies in the strongly nonlinear regime.
We firstly consider analytical solution of our basic equations, and find new closed results for
pulse self-modulation at general conditions. Specially, precise expressions are obtained for
spatiotemporal frequency chirp and envelop evolutions, indicating that the latter is driven by
the former and that the envelope attains fine modulations which produce long wavelength low-frequency
modes via beating the carrier mode. Moreover, plasma wave variations are found to convect and amplify
away from the pulse front. After then, we issue destabilization of the self-modulating laser pulse
by parametric exponentiation of the initial noise content. In this regard, we assess different
regime of nonlinear scattering at different pulse shapes and peak intensities, manifesting anomalous
behaviors ranging from wild positioning of the Stokes wave in dispersion plane to broadening in
the scattered spectrum and halting the instability. Our analyses describe the pulse break-up phenomenon
in its different regimes and are assisted and verified by numerous fluid and particle-in-cell simulations.
