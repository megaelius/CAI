EXSY, TOCSY and NOESY lie at the foundation of homonuclear NMR experiments in organic and pharmaceutical
chemistry, as well as in structural biology. Limited magnetization transfer efficiency is an intrinsic
downside of these methods, particularly when targeting rapidly exchanging species such as labile
protons ubiquitous in polysaccharides, sidechains and backbones of proteins, and in bases and
sugars of nucleic acids: the fast decoherence imparted on these protons through solvent exchanges,
greatly reduces their involvement in homonuclear correlation experiments. We have recently discussed
how these decoherences can be visualized as an Anti-Zeno Effect, that can be harnessed to enhance
the efficiency of homonuclear transfers within Looped PROjected SpectroscopY (L-PROSY) leading
to 200-300% enhancements in NOESY and TOCSY cross-peaks for amide groups in biomolecules. This
study demonstrates that even larger sensitivity gains per unit time, equivalent to reductions
by several hundred-folds in the duration of experiments, can be achieved by looping inversion or
using saturation procedures. In the ensuing experiments a priori selected frequencies are encoded
according to Hadamard recipes, and subsequently resolved along the indirect dimension via linear
combinations. Magnetization-transfer (MT) processes reminiscent of those occurring in CEST
provide significant enhancements in the resulting cross-peaks, in only a fraction of acquisition
time of a normal 2D experiment. The effectiveness of the ensuing three-way polarization transfer
interplay between water, labile and non-labile protons was corroborated experimentally for proteins,
homo-oligosaccharides and nucleic acids. In all cases, cross-peaks barely detectable in conventional
2D NMR counterparts, were measured ca. 10-fold faster and with 200-600% signal enhancements by
the Hadamard MT counterparts.
