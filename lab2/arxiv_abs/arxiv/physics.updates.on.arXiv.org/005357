Purpose, To develop a high scanning efficiency, motion corrected imaging strategy for free-breathing
pulmonary MRI by combining a motion compensation reconstruction with a UTE acquisition, called
iMoCo UTE. Methods, An optimized golden angle ordering radial UTE sequence was used to continuously
acquire data for 5 minutes. All readouts were grouped to different respiratory motion states based
on self-navigator signals, then motion resolved data was reconstructed by XD Golden angle RAdial
Sparse Parallel reconstruction (XD GRASP). One state from the motion resolved images was selected
as a reference, and motion fields from the other states to the reference were derived via non-rigid
registration. Finally, all motion resolved data and motion fields were reconstructed by using
an iterative motion compensation reconstruction with a total generalized variation sparse constraint.
Results, The iMoCo UTE strategy was evaluated in volunteers and non-sedated pediatric patient(4-6
y/o) studies. Images reconstructed with iMoCo UTE provided sharper anatomical lung structures,
and higher apparent SNR and CNR, compared to using other motion correction strategies, such as soft-gating,
motion resolved reconstruction, and non-rigid motion compensation(MoCo). iMoCo UTE also showed
promising results in an infant study. Conclusions, The proposed iMoCo UTE combines self-navigation,
motion modeling, and a compressed sensing reconstruction to increase scan efficiency, SNR, and
reduce respiratory motion in lung MRI. This proposed strategy shows improvements in free breathing
lung MRI scans, especially in very challenging application situations, such as pediatric MRI studies.
