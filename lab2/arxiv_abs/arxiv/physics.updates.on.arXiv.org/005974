Turbulent dissipation is considered a main source of heating and acceleration in cosmological
plasmas. The alternating current Joule-like term, $\langle\delta j \cdot \delta E\rangle$, is
used to measure the energy transfer between electromagnetic (EM) fields and particles. Because
the electric field depends on the reference frame, in which frame to calculate $\langle\delta j\cdot
\delta E\rangle$ is an important issue. We compute the scale-dependent energy transfer rate spectrum
in wavevector space, and investigate the electric-field fluctuations in two reference frames:
$\delta E$ in the mean bulk flow frame and $\delta E'$ in the local bulk flow frame (non-inertial reference
frame). Considering Alfv\'enic waves, we find that $\langle\delta j\cdot\delta E^\prime\rangle$,
which neglects the contribution of work done by the ion inertial force, is not consistent with the
magnetic field energy damping rate ($2\gamma \delta B^2$) according to linear Maxwell-Vlasov
theory, while $\langle\delta j\cdot \delta E\rangle$ is exactly the same as $2\gamma \delta B^2$
in wavenumber space $(k_\parallel, k_\perp)$, where $\gamma$ is the linear damping rate. Under
typical conditions of solar wind at 1 au, we find in our theoretical calculation that the field energy
is mainly converted into proton kinetic energy leaving the residual minor portion for electrons.
Although the electrons gain energy in the direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field, they
return a significant fraction of their kinetic energy in the parallel direction. Magnetic-field
fluctuations can transfer particle energy between the parallel and perpendicular degrees of freedom.
Therefore, $\langle\delta j_\parallel\cdot \delta E_\parallel\rangle$ and $\langle\delta
j_\perp\cdot \delta E_\perp\rangle$ cannot solely describe the energy transfer in parallel direction
and perpendicular direction, respectively.
