Recent developments in numerical weather prediction have led to the use of correlated observation
error covariance (OEC) information in data assimilation and forecasting systems. However, diagnosed
OEC matrices are often ill-conditioned and may cause convergence problems for variational data
assimilation procedures. Reconditioning methods are used to improve the conditioning of covariance
matrices while retaining correlation information. In this paper we study the impact of using the
'ridge regression' method of reconditioning to assimilate Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer
(IASI) observations in the Met Office 1D-Var system. This is the first systematic investigation
of how changing target condition numbers affects convergence of a 1D-Var routine. This procedure
is used for quality control, and to estimate key variables (skin temperature, cloud top pressure,
cloud fraction) that are not analysed by the main 4D-Var data assimilation system. Our new results
show that the current (uncorrelated) OEC matrix requires more iterations to reach convergence
than any choice of correlated OEC matrix studied. This suggests that using a correlated OEC matrix
in the 1D-Var routine would have computational benefits for IASI observations. Using reconditioned
correlated OEC matrices also increases the number of observations that pass quality control. However,
the impact on skin temperature, cloud fraction and cloud top pressure is less clear. As the reconditioning
parameter is increased, differences between retrieved variables for correlated OEC matrices
and the operational diagonal OEC matrix reduce. As correlated choices of OEC matrix yield faster
convergence, using stricter convergence criteria along with these matrices may increase efficiency
and improve quality control.
