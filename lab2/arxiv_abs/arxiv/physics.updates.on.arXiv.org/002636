The inner regions of active galaxies host the most extreme and energetic phenomena in the universe
including, relativistic jets, supermassive black hole binaries, and recoiling supermassive
black holes. However, many of these sources cannot be resolved with direct observations. I review
how strong gravitational lensing can be used to elucidate the structures of these sources from radio
frequencies up to very high energy gamma rays. The deep gravitational potentials surrounding galaxies
act as natural gravitational lenses. These gravitational lenses split background sources into
multiple images, each with a gravitationally-induced time delay. These time delays and positions
of lensed images depend on the source location, and thus, can be used to infer the spatial origins
of the emission. For example, using gravitationally-induced time delays improves angular resolution
of modern gamma-ray instruments by six orders of magnitude, and provides evidence that gamma-ray
outbursts can be produced at even thousands of light years from a supermassive black hole, and that
the compact radio emission does not always trace the position of the supermassive black hole. These
findings provide unique physical information about the central structure of active galaxies,
force us to revise our models of operating particle acceleration mechanisms, and challenge our
assumptions about the origin of compact radio emission. Future surveys, including LSST, SKA, and
Euclid, will provide observations for hundreds of thousands of gravitationally lensed sources,
which will allow us to apply strong gravitational lensing to study the multi-wavelength structure
for large ensembles of sources. This large ensemble of gravitationally lensed active galaxies
will allow us to elucidate the physical origins of multi-wavelength emissions, their connections
to supermassive black holes, and their cosmic evolution.
