Hydraulic fracturing increases reservoir permeability by opening fractures and triggering slip
on natural fractures and faults. While seismic slip of small faults or fault patches is detectable
as microseismic events, the role of aseismic slip is poorly understood. From a modeling standpoint,
geomechanical analysis using the Coulomb criterion can determine if faults slip but not whether
slip is seismic or aseismic. Here we propose a computational methodology to predict fault slip,
and whether slip is seismic or aseismic, using rate-and-state friction. To avoid computational
costs associated with resolving small faults, we use the spring-slider idealization that treats
faults as points. Interaction between faults is neglected. The method is applied to study fault
slip from a hydraulic fracture that grows past a fault, without intersecting it. We represent the
hydraulic fracture stressing using an asymptotic expansion of stresses around the tip of a tensile
crack. We investigate the effect of fault length, orientation, and distance from the hydraulic
fracture. For velocity-weakening faults with stiffness smaller than a critical stiffness, slip
is seismic, whereas faults with stiffness greater than the critical stiffness slip aseismically.
Furthermore, we compare the spring-slider idealization with a finite element analysis that resolves
spatially variable slip. The spring-slider idealization provides reasonably accurate predictions
of moment and even moment-rate history, especially for faults having stiffness close to or larger
than the critical stiffness. Differences appear for large faults where rupture propagation is
important, though differences might still be negligible for many applications.
