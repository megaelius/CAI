Contributions of the pre-ionized H$_2$ (PI-H$_2$) and ionized H$_2^+$ subsystems of the two-electron
H$_2$ system to its high-order harmonic generation in 8-cycle $\sin^{2}$-like ultrafast intense
laser pulses are calculated and analyzed based on the solution of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger
equation (TDSE) for the one-dimensional two-electronic H$_2$ system with fixed nuclei. The laser
pulses have $\lambda\ =\ 390\ \&\ 532$ nm wavelengths and $I=1\times 10^{14}$, 5$\times 10^{14}$,
1$\times 10^{15}$ \&\ 5$\times 10^{15}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ intensities. It is found that at the two lower
intensities, the PI-H$_2$ subsystem dominantly produces the HHG spectra. While, at the two higher
intensities, both PI-H$_2$ and ionized H$_2^+$ subsystems contribute comparably to the HHG spectra.
In the H$_2^+$ subsystem, the symmetry of the populations of H$_2^+$(I) and H$_2^+$(II) regions
(left and right regions of H$_2^+$ subsystem) is broken by increasing the laser intensity. Complex
patterns and even harmonics also appear at these two higher intensities. For instance, at $1\times
10^{15}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ intensity and $\lambda$ = 532 nm, the even harmonics are appeared near cut-off
region. Interestingly, at $5\times 10^{15}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ intensity and $\lambda$ = 390 nm, the even
harmonics replaced by the odd harmonics with red shift. At $\lambda$ = 390 \&\ 532 nm and $I=1\times
10^{15}$ intensity, the two-electron cutoffs corresponding to nonsequential double-recombination
(NSDR) with maximum return kinetic energy of 4.70$U_p$ are detected. The HHG spectra of the whole
H$_2$ system obtained with and without nuclear dynamics treated classically are approximately
similar. However, at $1\times 10^{15}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ intensity and $\lambda$ = 532 nm, if we take into
account nuclear dynamics, the even harmonics which are appeared near cutoff region, replaced by
the odd harmonics with blue shift.
