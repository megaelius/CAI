Miles et al. [1] recently produced an analysis of the costs and benefits of lockdown policies in the
face of COVID-19, focussing on the case of the U.K. They argue that the March- June UK lockdown was
more costly than the benefit of lives saved, if the latter are evaluated using the NICE threshold
of {\pounds}30000 for a quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Looking forwards, they argue that the
costs of a lockdown for 13 weeks from mid-June would be vastly greater than the benefits under any
plausible QALY costing, even in a scenario in which easing lockdown led to a second infection wave
that caused more than 7000 deaths a week by mid-September. I note here two key problems that certainly
significantly affect their estimates and cast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, they cut off
their calculations arbitrarily after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic state at the end of
the period. That is, they assume that we should be indifferent between mid-September states of 13
deaths a week and 7500 deaths a week, and corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible
unless one assumes that (a) there is only a small chance of any future vaccine and no future improvements
in treatment or in non-medical interventions, (b) that COVID-19 will inevitably continue to propagate
until herd immunity is reached. Even under these assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly,
they ignore the costs of serious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality, and possible
lowering of life expectancy for COVID-19 survivors. These are uncertain, but clearly not negligible,
and plausibly comparable to or larger than the costs in lives lost.
