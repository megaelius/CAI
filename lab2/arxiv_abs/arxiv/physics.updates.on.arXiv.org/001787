There has been great interest in realizing quantum simulators of charged particles in artificial
gauge fields. Here, we perform the first quantum simulation explorations of the combination of
artificial gauge fields and disorder. Using synthetic lattice techniques based on parametrically-coupled
atomic momentum states, we engineer zigzag chains with a tunable homogeneous flux. The breaking
of time-reversal symmetry by the applied flux leads to analogs of spin-orbit coupling and spin-momentum
locking, which we observe directly through the chiral dynamics of atoms initialized to single lattice
sites. We additionally introduce precisely controlled disorder in the site energy landscape,
allowing us to explore the interplay of disorder and large effective magnetic fields. The combination
of correlated disorder and controlled intra- and inter-row tunneling in this system naturally
supports energy-dependent localization, relating to a single-particle mobility edge. We measure
the localization properties of the extremal eigenstates of this system, the ground state and the
most-excited state, and demonstrate clear evidence for a flux-dependent mobility edge. These
measurements constitute the first direct evidence for energy-dependent localization in a lower-dimensional
system, as well as the first explorations of the combined influence of artificial gauge fields and
engineered disorder. Moreover, we provide direct evidence for interaction shifts of the localization
transitions for both low- and high-energy eigenstates in correlated disorder, relating to the
presence of a many-body mobility edge. The unique combination of strong interactions, controlled
disorder, and tunable artificial gauge fields present in this synthetic lattice system should
enable myriad explorations into intriguing correlated transport phenomena.
