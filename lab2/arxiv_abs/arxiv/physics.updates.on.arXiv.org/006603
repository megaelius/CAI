A model is presented for the ion distribution function in a plasma at a solid target with a magnetic
field $\vec{B}$ inclined at a small angle, $ \alpha \ll 1$ (in radians), to the target. The ordering
$\alpha\gg\sqrt{Zm_{\rm e}/m_{\rm i}} $, where $m_{\rm e}$ and $m_{\rm i}$ are the electron and
ion mass respectively, and $Z$ is the charge state of the ion, is assumed such that electrons are adiabatic.
The size of electrostatic potential variations near the wall is $\sim T_{\rm e}/e$, where $T_{\rm
e}$ is the electron temperature and $e$ is the proton charge. A simple model, assuming a negligible
electron gyroradius, is used to calculate the wall potential. The electric field $\vec{E}$ near
the wall accelerates ions, although a substantial fraction of the kinetic energy acquired by the
ions goes in the components tangential to the target: parallel streaming and, mostly, $\vec{E}
\times \vec{B}$ drift. The normal velocity of an ion at the target, $v_x$, is a combination of: the
gyrophase dependent velocity of the ion due to the orbit moving a fraction $\alpha$ of a gyroradius
closer to the target at each gyration, giving $v_x \sim \sqrt{\alpha} v_{\rm t,i}$, where $v_{\rm
t,i}=\sqrt{2T_{\rm i}/m_{\rm i}}$ is the ion thermal velocity and $T_{\rm i}$ is the ion temperature;
the velocity acquired from the electric force, which typically overcomes the magnetic force close
to the target, giving $v_x \sim v_{\rm B}=\sqrt{ZT_{\rm e}/m_{\rm i}}$, where $v_{\rm B}$ is the
Bohm velocity. We derive expressions for the velocity distribution of ions at the target using a
large gyro-orbit model, shown to be accurate for $\tau=T_{\rm i}/(ZT_{\rm e})\gg 1$ and qualitatively
correct for $\tau \sim 1$. Importantly, the model captures how the kinetic energy of an ion reaching
the target is split between the normal and tangential velocity components, which is expected to
inform sputtering predictions.
