The capture and storage of CO2, a major component of greenhouse gases, are crucial steps that can
positively impact the global carbon balance. The capture of CO2 has been difficult due to its extremely
high stability. In this study, we propose a simple and yet effective approach for capture and storage
of CO2 by C6Li6. C6Li6 possesses a planar star-like structure, whose ionization energy is lower
than that of Li atom and hence, it behaves as a superalkali. Superalkalis are unusual species possessing
lower ionization energies than alkali atoms. We have systematically studied the interaction of
successive CO2 molecules with C6Li6 using long-range dispersion corrected density functional
{\omega}B97xD/6-311+G(d) calculations. We notice that these interactions lead to stable C6Li6-nCO2
complexes (n = 1-6) in which the structure of CO2 moieties is bent appreciably (122-125deg) due to
electron transfer from C6Li6, whose planarity is distorted only slightly (less than or equal to
7 deg). This clearly suggests that the CO2 molecules can successfully be activated and captured
by C6Li6. We have also analyzed bond-lengths and bond-angle of CO2, their charges and adsorption
energy as a function of the number of adsorbed CO2 (n). It has been also noticed that the bond-length
of CO2 in C6Li6-nCO2 complexes increases monotonically whereas adsorption energy decreases,
ranging 3.18-2.79 eV per CO2 with the increase in n. These findings not only establish the potential
of C6Li6 for capture and storage of CO2 molecules but also provide new insights into CO2-activation,
capture, and storage by systems having low ionization energies.
