The fundamental shear horizontal (SH0) wave in plate-like structures is of practical importance
in structural health monitoring due to its non-dispersive characteristics. However, compared
with Lamb wave, SH0 wave is less used in practice since it is difficult to be excited by using conventional
piezoelectric transducers. Recently, face-shear piezoelectric mode has been realized in PZT
ceramics and several face-shear piezoelectric transducers have been developed to excite pure
SH0 wave in plates. However, when controllable radiation pattern of SH0 wave is required, it is found
that no mathematical basis is available for designers to optimize the transducer's parameters.
In this work, based on the reciprocal theorem of elastodynamics and Huygens' principle, a theoretical
model is proposed to describe the SH0 wave field generated by arbitrary-shaped face-shear transducers
bonded on an infinite isotropic plate. It is proved that the wave field generated by a face-shear
transducer is equivalent to that generated by uniform in-plane tractions along its perimeter.
Then the proposed model is applied to two specific cases of a single square face-shear (d24) PZT wafer
and a bidirectional SH0 wave piezoelectric transducer(BSH-PT).Explicit analytical expressions
for both cases are successfully obtained. The accuracy of the obtained analytical model is verified
by both experiments and FEM simulations. Furthermore, some general guidelines based on the analytical
model are presented for optimization of the transducer's dimensions. Finally, based on the guidelines,
a new bidirectional SH0 wave piezoelectric transducer is proposed with very small beam divergence.
