The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a numerical approach for tackling problems described by a
Boltzmann type equation, where time, space and velocities are discretized. The method is widely
used in fluid dynamics, radiation transfer, neutron transport, and more recently for studying
diffusive-ballistic heat transport. The main disadvantage of the method is the ray effect problem,
caused by the finite set of propagation directions used to discretize the angular space. A higher
number of propagation directions would potentially solve the problem, but at the expense of increasing
the computational cost of the scheme. Here, we propose the worm-lattice Boltzmann method (worm-LBM),
which allows to implement multiple (as much as necessary) propagation directions, by alternating
the directions given by the standard next neighbor schemes in time. The method is demonstrated for
a 2D square scheme of the type D2Q[$M\times$8] ($M>1$), and can be straight forward generalized
for the 3D case. Moreover, to overcome the inherent problem of non-isotropic speed of propagation
in square schemes, we introduce a time adaptive scheme to impose a circular propagation. The method,
indeed, allows any angular distribution for the propagation velocities. The new worm-LBM is introduced
in the framework of phonon transport, and its suitability for addressing both the diffusive and
ballistic regimes is demonstrated. More generally, we show that it does not suffer from the long-standing
problems of direct discretization methods namely, numerical smearing, angular false scattering,
and ray effect. The worm-LBM, thus, has the potential to be at the forefront of the methods for addressing
transport studies.
