We study symplectic numerical integration of mechanical systems with a Hamiltonian specified
in non-canonical coordinates and its application to guiding-center motion of charged plasma particles
in magnetic confinement devices. The technique combines time-stepping in canonical coordinates
with quadrature in non-canonical coordinates and is applicable in systems where a global transformation
to canonical coordinates is known but its inverse is not. A fully implicit class of symplectic Runge-Kutta
schemes has recently been introduced and applied to guiding-center motion by [Zhang et al., Phys.
Plasmas 21, 32504 (2014); doi:10.1063/1.4867669]. Here a generalization of this approach with
emphasis on semi-implicit partitioned schemes is described together with methods to enhance their
performance. For application in toroidal plasma confinement configurations with nested magnetic
flux surfaces a global canonicalization of the guiding-center Lagrangian by a spatial transform
is presented that allows for for pre-computation of the required map in a parallel algorithm. Guiding-center
orbits are studied in stationary magnetic equilibrium fields of an axisymmetric tokamak and a realistic
three-dimensional stellarator configuration. Superior long-term properties of a symplectic
Euler method are demonstrated in comparison to a conventional adaptive Runge-Kutta scheme. Finally
statistics of fast fusion alpha particle losses over their slowing-down time are computed in the
stellarator field on a representative sample, reaching a speed-up of the symplectic Euler scheme
by more than a factor three compared to usual Runge-Kutta schemes while keeping the same statistical
accuracy and linear scaling with the number of computing threads.
