Discovered by Christopher Alexander, living structure is a physical phenomenon, through which
the quality of the built environment or artifacts can be judged objectively. It bears two distinguished
properties just like a tree: "far more small things than large ones" across all scales, and "more
or less similar things" on each scale. As a physical phenomenon, and mathematical concept, living
structure is essentially empirical, discovered and developed from miniscule observation in nature-
and human-made things, and it affects our daily lives in some substantial ways, such as where to put
a table or a flower vase in a room, helping us to make beautiful things and environments. Living structure
is not only empirical, but also philosophical and visionary, enabling us to see the world and space
in more meaningful ways. This paper is intended to defend living structure as a physical phenomenon,
clarifying some common questions and misgivings surrounding Alexander's design thoughts, such
as the objective or structural nature of beauty, building styles advocated by Alexander, and mysterious
nature of his concepts. We first illustrate living structure - essentially organized complexity,
as advocated by the late Jane Jacobs (1916-2006) - that is governed by two fundamental laws (scaling
law and Tobler's law), and generated in some step by step fashion by two design principles (differentiation
and adaptation) through the 15 structural properties. We then verify why living structure is primarily
empirical, drawing evidence from Alexander's own work, as well as our case studies applied to the
Earth's surface including cities, streets, and buildings, and two logos. Before reaching conclusions,
we concentrate on the most mysterious part of Alexander's work - the hypothesized "I" - as a substance
that pervasively exists everywhere, in order to make better sense of living structure in our minds.
