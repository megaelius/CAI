We present nonlinear resistive MHD simulations of the response of a rotating plasma to an error field
when the plasma has weakly damped linear tearing modes (TM's), stabilized by pressure gradient
and favorable curvature. Favorable curvature leads to the Glasser effect: the occurrence of real
frequencies and stabilization with positive stability index $\Delta'$. A cylinder with hollow
pressure is used to model the toroidal favorable curvature. Linear simulations with rotation and
an error field $\tilde{\psi}_w$ show, in agreement with analytic results, that the peak reconnected
flux occurs for a rotation rate near the TM phase velocity. Nonlinear simulations with small $\tilde{\psi}_w$
show that the real frequency and stabilization by favorable average curvature are masked by a nonlinear
effect that occurs for very thin islands: flattening of the pressure across the island, mainly due
to sound wave propagation. This flattening causes the disappearance of real frequencies destabilization
of the mode, allowing it to grow to large amplitude similar to a $\beta=0$ unstable TM. The flattening
of the current for larger islands saturates the mode nonlinearly. In the post-saturation phase,
the interaction of the error field with the destabilized spontaneous tearing mode, which rotates
with the plasma, leads to oscillations in the Maxwell torque and therefore modulations in the plasma
rotation. The islands also rotate with modulated phase velocity, undergoing small-amplitude
oscillations due to these modulations. We also present a quasilinear model with an unstable spontaneous
TM and error fields, showing that the superposition of these fields results in similar oscillations.
