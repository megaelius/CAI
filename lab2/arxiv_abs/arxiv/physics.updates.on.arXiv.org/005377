Context. Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) with energy in the GeV range can propagate to Earth from
their acceleration region near the Sun and produce Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs). The traditional
approach to interpreting and modelling GLE observations assumes particle propagation only parallel
to the magnetic field lines of interplanetary space, i.e. it is spatially 1D. Recent measurements
by PAMELA have characterised SEP properties at 1 AU for the ~100 MeV-1 GeV range at high spectral resolution.
Aims. We model the transport of GLE-energy solar protons through the Interplanetary Magnetic Field
(IMF) using a 3D approach, to assess the effect of the Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS) and drifts
associated to the gradient and curvature of the Parker spiral. The latter are influenced by the IMF
polarity. We derive 1 AU observables and compare the simulation results with data from PAMELA. Methods.
We use a 3D test particle model including a HCS. Monoenergetic populations are studied first to obtain
a qualitative picture of propagation patterns and numbers of crossings of the 1 AU sphere. Simulations
for power law injection are used to derive intensity profiles and fluence spectra at 1 AU. A simulation
for a specific event, GLE 71, is used to compare with PAMELA data. Results. Spatial patterns of 1 AU
crossings and the average number of crossings are strongly influenced by 3D effects, with significant
differences between periods of A+ and A- polarities. The decay time constant of 1 AU intensity profiles
varies depending on the polarity and position of the observer, and it is not a simple function of the
mean free path as in 1D models. Energy dependent leakage from the injection flux tube is particularly
important for GLE energy particles, in many cases resulting in a roll-over in the fluence spectrum.
