Recent studies have proposed that adding quinine sulfate dihydrate to water while performing Cherenkov
volumetric dosimetry improves the skewed percent depth dose measurement. The aim of this study
was to quantify the ability of quinine to convert directional Cherenkov emission to isotropic fluorescence
and evaluate its contribution to the total emitted light. Aqueous solutions of quinine were prepared
with distilled water at various concentrations (0.01 g/L to 1.2 g/L). The solutions were irradiated
with photon beams at 6 and 23 MV. The dependence of the light produced as a function of sample concentration
was studied using a spectrometer with a fixed integration time. Spectral measurements of the luminescent
solution and the blank solution (distilled water only) were taken to deconvolve the Cherenkov and
quinine contribution to the overall emission spectrum. Using a CCD camera, intensity profiles
were obtained for the blank and the 1.00 g/L solutions to compare them with the dose predicted by a
treatment planning system. The luminescent intensity of the samples was found to follow a logarithmic
trend as a function of the quinine concentration. The fraction of the Cherenkov emission produced
in the blank solution that was absorbed by the fluorophore was also found to vary logarithmically
as a function of concentration, with a maximum 7% absorption observed. Based on the spectral deconvolution
of the 1.00 g/L solution, 52.4% and 52.7% of the signal results from the quinine emission at 6 and 23
MV, respectively. The remaining fraction of the spectrum is due to the Cherenkov light that has not
been converted. While it was not mentioned in recent publications, adding quinine to water increased
the total light output significantly compared to the water-only signal. Consequently, it reinforces
the correlation between the solution intensity and the dose deposition.
