We address linear and nonlinear topological interface states in polariton condensates excited
at the interface of the honeycomb and Lieb arrays of microcavity pillars in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling and Zeeman splitting in the external magnetic field. Such interface states appear only
in total energy gaps of the composite structure when parameters of the honeycomb and Lieb arrays
are selected such that some topological gaps in the spectrum of one of the arrays overlap with topological
or nontopological gaps in the spectrum of the other array. This is in contrast to conventional edge
states at the interface of periodic topological and uniform trivial insulators, whose behavior
is determined exclusively by the spectrum of the topological medium. The number of emerging interface
states is determined by the difference of the Chern numbers of the overlapping gaps. Illustrative
examples with one or two coexisting unidirectional interface states are provided. The representative
feature of the system is the possibility of wide tuning of the concentration of power of the interface
states between two limiting cases when practically all power is concentrated either in the Lieb
or the honeycomb array. Localization of the interface states and their penetration depth into arrays
drastically vary with Bloch momentum or upon modification of the amplitude of the interface state
in the nonlinear regime. We illustrate topological protection of the interface states manifested
in the absence of backscattering on interface defects, and study their modulation instability
in the nonlinear regime. The latter leads to formation of quasisolitons whose penetration into
different arrays also depends on Bloch momentum. In addition, we discuss the impact of losses and
coherent pump leading to bistability of the interface states.
