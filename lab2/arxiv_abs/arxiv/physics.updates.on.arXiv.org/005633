The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is capable of performing a unique search for sterile neutrinos
through the exploitation of a matter enhanced resonant neutrino oscillation phenomena. As atmospheric
muon neutrinos pass the dense material within the Earth, neutral current elastic forward scattering
is predicted to induce a transition into a sterile state. This thesis presents two 3+1 sterile neutrino
analyses by searching for spectral differences in the reconstructed energy and zenith direction
of muon neutrino events, indicative of a transition into a sterile state. The first search probes
the parameter space $\Delta$m$^2_{41}$ and sin$^2$(2$\theta_{24}$) with relevant sensitivity
to the global best fit region for a 3+1 sterile neutrino hypothesis. The second search performs a
scan through sin$^2$(2$\theta_{24}$) and sin$^2$(2$\theta_{34}$) in the oscillation averaged
out region of high-$\Delta$m$^2_{41}$ ($\Delta$m$^2_{41}$ $\gtrsim$ 10eV$^2$). The analyses
are performed using an improved event selection, which was found to extract 305,891 well reconstructed
muon neutrino events with a sample purity above 99.9\%, from eight years of IceCube data. Novel simulation
techniques, along with updated calibration, and a re-assessment of the systematic uncertainties
are also discussed. The first analysis finds a best fit sterile hypothesis point at $\Delta$m$^2_{41}$
= 4.47eV$^2$ and sin$^2$($\theta_{24})$ =0.10, consistent with the no-sterile hypothesis at
the 8\% confidence level. The second analysis finds a best fit sterile hypothesis at sin$^2$($\theta_{34})$
= 0.40, sin$^2$($\theta_{24})$ = 0.006, consistent with the null hypothesis at the 19\% confidence
level. % and provides a significant improvement in the worlds measurements using muon neutrino
disappearance.
