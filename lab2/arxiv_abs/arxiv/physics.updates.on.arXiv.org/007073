Acoustic bianisotropy, also known as the Willis parameter, expands the field of acoustics by providing
nonconventional couplings between momentum and strain in constitutive relations. Sharing the
common ground with electromagnetics, the realization of acoustic bianisotropy enables the exotic
manipulation of acoustic waves in cooperation with a properly designed inverse bulk modulus and
mass density. While the control of entire constitutive parameters substantiates intriguing theoretical
and practical applications, a Willis metamaterial that enables independently and precisely designed
polarizabilities has yet to be developed to overcome the present restrictions of the maximum Willis
bound and the nonreciprocity inherent to the passivity of metamaterials. Here, by extending the
recently developed concept of virtualized metamaterials, we propose acoustic Willis metamaterials
that break the passivity and reciprocity limit while also achieving decoupled control of all constitutive
parameters with designed frequency responses. By instituting basis convolution kernels based
on parity symmetry for each polarization response, we experimentally demonstrate bianisotropy
beyond the limit of passive media. Furthermore, based on the notion of inverse design of the frequency
dispersion by means of digital convolution, purely nonreciprocal media and media with a broadband,
flat-response Willis coupling are also demonstrated. Our approach offers all possible independently
programmable extreme constitutive parameters and frequency dispersion tunability accessible
within the causality condition and provides a flexible platform for realizing the full capabilities
of acoustic metamaterials.
