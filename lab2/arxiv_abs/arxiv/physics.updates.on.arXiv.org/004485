The effect of magnetron power on the room temperature 1.54 $\mu$m infra-red photoluminescence
intensity of erbium doped AlN films grown by r. f. magnetron sputtering, has been studied. The AlN:Er
thin films were deposited on (001) Silicon substrates. The study presents relative photoluminescence
intensities of nanocrystallized samples prepared with identical sputtering parameters for two
erbium doping levels (0.5 and 1.5 atomic %). The structural evolution of the crystallites as a function
of the power is followed by transmission electron microscopy. Copyright line will be provided by

significant potential applications in the field of opto-electronic technology. Part of this technological
interest relies on the shielded 4f levels of the RE ions as they give rise to sharp and strong luminescence
peaks [1-5]. Among the RE elements, Er is preferred to its counterparts since the Er ions can produce
both visible light at 558 nm (green, one of the primary colours) and IR light at 1.54 $\mu$m whose spectrum
region coincides with the main low-loss region in the absorption spectrum of silica-based optical
fibres, combining so potential applications towards photonic devices and towards optical communication
devices operating in the infrared domain. These interesting emissions can however only be exploited
when placed into host matrixes. On one side, the shielding of the intra 4f levels prevents the shifting
of the RE 3+ energy levels and ensures the frequency emission stability. Moreover the intra 4f transitions
are parity forbidden for the isolated ions. Matrixes can render the Er 3+ ions optically active,
via a relaxation of selection rules due to crystal field effects. As silicon based materials were
tested in the 1960s to the 90s with no clear industrial success it was found that the
