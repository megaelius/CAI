The effect of turbulence on combined condensational and collisional growth of cloud droplets is
investigated using high-resolution direct numerical simulations. The motion of droplets is subjected
to both turbulence and gravity. We solve the thermodynamic equations that govern the supersaturation
field together with the hydrodynamic equations describing the turbulence. The collision-coalescence
process is approximated by a superparticle approach assuming unit collision and coalescence efficiency,
i.e., droplet coalesce upon collision. Condensational growth of cloud droplets due to supersaturation
fluctuations depends on the Reynolds number, while the collisional growth was previously found
to depend on the mean energy dissipation rate. Here we show that the combined processes depend on
both Reynolds number and the mean energy dissipation rate. Droplet size distributions broaden
either with increasing Reynolds number or mean energy dissipation rate in the range explored here.
Even though collisional growth alone is insensitive to Reynolds number, it is indirectly affected
by the large scales of turbulence through condensation. This is argued to be due to the fact that condensational
growth results in wider droplet-size distributions, which triggers collisional growth. Since
turbulence in warm clouds has a relatively small mean energy dissipation rate, but a large Reynolds
number, turbulence mainly affects the condensational growth and thus influences the collisional
growth indirectly through condensation. Thus, the combined condensational and collisional growth
of cloud droplets is mostly dominated by Reynolds number. This work, for the first time, numerically
demonstrates that supersaturation fluctuations enhance the collisional growth. It supports
the findings from laboratory experiments and the observations that supersaturation fluctuations
are important for precipitation.
