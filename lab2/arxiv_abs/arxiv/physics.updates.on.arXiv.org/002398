The JUNO liquid scintillator-based experiment, construction of which is on-going in Jiangmen
(China), will start operations in 2020 and will detect anti-neutrinos from nearby reactors; but
also solar neutrinos via elastic scattering on electrons. Its physics goals are broad; its primary
aim to measure the neutrino mass ordering demands to collect large statistics, which requires JUNO's
20 kt sensitive mass, and achieve an unprecedented energy resolution (3$\%/\sqrt{E}$). Thanks
to these characteristics, JUNO is in a very good position to contribute to the solar neutrino studies
in the line of previous experiments of similar technology. It will collect a large sample of neutrinos
from $^7$Be and $^8$B. In particular, for $^7$Be the target energy resolution will provide a powerful
tool to isolate the electron energy end point from backgrounds like $^{210}$Bi and $^{85}$Kr. At
the same time, challenges will have to be faced mainly related to the reduction and estimation of
the backgrounds. While a thorough LS purification campaign is being planned, the desired level
of purification is less aggressive than e.g. in Borexino. Also, cosmogenic backgrounds such as
cosmic ray muons traversing the relatively thin layer of ground above JUNO (700 m) and crossing the
detector will need to be vetoed with dedicated techniques for the extraction of $^8$B. In my talk
I reviewed JUNO's preliminary analysis strategy and challenges in the solar neutrino sector; and
provided the current estimates of its solar neutrino and background yields, with related energy
spectra, assuming two benchmark scenarios of scintillator radio-purity.
