The atmospheric temperatures and concentrations of Earth's five most important, greenhouse gases,
H$_2$O, CO$_2$, O$_3$, N$_2$O and CH$_4$ control the cloud-free, thermal radiative flux from the
Earth to outer space. Over 1/3 million lines having strengths as low as $10^{-27}$ cm of the HITRAN
database were used to evaluate the dependence of the forcing on the gas concentrations. For a hypothetical,
optically thin atmosphere, where there is negligible saturation of the absorption bands, or interference
of one type of greenhouse gas with others, the per-molecule forcings are of order $10^{-22}$ W for
H$_2$O, CO$_2$, O$_3$, N$_2$O and CH$_4$. For current atmospheric concentrations, the per-molecule
forcings of the abundant greenhouse gases H$_2$O and CO$_2$ are suppressed by four orders of magnitude.
The forcings of the less abundant greenhouse gases, O$_3$, N$_2$O and CH$_4$, are also suppressed,
but much less so. For current concentrations, the per-molecule forcings are two to three orders
of magnitude greater for O$_3$, N$_2$O and CH$_4$, than those of H$_2$O or CO$_2$. Doubling the current
concentrations of CO$_2$, N$_2$O or CH$_4$ increases the forcings by a few per cent. These forcing
results are close to previously published values even though the calculations did not utilize either
a CO$_2$ or H$_2$O continuum. The change in surface temperature due to CO$_2$ doubling is estimated
taking into account radiative-convective equilibrium of the atmosphere as well as water feedback
for the cases of fixed absolute and relative humidities as well as the effect of using a pseudoadiabatic
lapse rate to model the troposphere temperature. Satellite spectral measurements at various latitudes
are in excellent quantitative agreement with modelled intensities.
