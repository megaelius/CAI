Objective: Muscle contractions are commonly detected by performing EMG measurements. The major
disadvantage of this technique is that mechanical disturbances to the electrodes are in the same
frequency and magnitude range as the desired signal. In this work we propose an approach and a realized
measurement system to combine EMG and bioimpedance measurements for higher reliabilities of muscle
contraction detections. Methods: We propose the development of a modular four-channel measurement
system, whereat each channel is capable of acquiring EMG, the bioimpedance magnitude and phase,
simultaneously. The modules are synchronized by an additional interface board, which communicates
with a PC. A graphical user interface enables to control the bioimpedance excitation current in
a range from 100 {\mu}A to 1 mA in a frequency range from 50 kHz to 333 kHz. Results: A system characterization
demonstrated that bioimpedance magnitude changes of less than 250 ppm and phase changes below 0.05{\deg}
can be detected reliably. Measurements from a subject have shown the timing relationship between
EMG and bioimpedance signals as well as their robustness against mechanical disturbances. A measurement
of five exemplary hand gestures has demonstrated the increase of usable information for detecting
muscle contractions. Conclusion: Bioimpedance measurements of muscles provide useful information
about contractions. Furthermore, the usage of a known high-frequency excitation current enables
a reliable differentiation between the actual information and disturbances. Significance: By
combining EMG and bioimpedance measurements, muscle contractions can be detected much more reliably.
This setup can be adopted to prostheses and many other human-computer interfaces.
