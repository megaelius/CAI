The paper considers the motion of a body under the influence of gravity and drag of the surrounding
fluid. Depending on the fluid mechanical regime, the drag force can exhibit a linear, quadratic
or even more general dependence on the velocity of the body relative to the fluid. The case of quadratic
drag is substantially more complex than the linear case, as it nonlinearly couples both components
of the momentum equation, and no explicit analytic solution is known for a general trajectory. After
a detailed account of the literature, the paper provides such a solution in form of a series expansion.
This result is discussed in detail and related to other approaches previously proposed. In particular,
it is shown to yield certain approximate solutions proposed in the literature as limiting cases.
The solution technique employs a strategy to reduce systems of ordinary differential equations
with a triangular dependence of the right-hand side on the vector of unknowns to a single equation
in an auxiliary variable. For the particular case of quadratic drag, the auxiliary variable allows
an interpretation in terms of canonical coordinates of motion within the framework of Hamiltonian
mechanics. The proposed reduction strategy also permits to devise analytic solutions for more
general drag laws, such as general power laws or power laws with an additional linear contribution.
Furthermore, a generalization to variable velocity of the surrounding fluid is addressed by considering
a linear velocity profile, for which a solution in form of a series is provided as well. Throughout,
the results obtained are illustrated by numerical examples.
