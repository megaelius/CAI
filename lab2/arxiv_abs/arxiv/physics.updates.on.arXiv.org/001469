In [AIP Advances 6, 121707 (2016)], a soil structured with concrete columns distributed within
two specially designed seismic cloaks thanks to a combination of transformational elastodynamics
and effective medium theory was shown to detour Rayleigh waves of frequencies lower than 10 Hz around
a cylindrical region. The aforementioned studies motivate our exploration of interactions of
surface elastic waves propagating in a thick plate (with soil parameters) structured with concrete
pillars above it. Pillars are 40 m in height and the plate is 100 m in thickness, so that typical frequencies
under study are below 1 Hz, a frequency range of particular interest in earthquake engineering.
We demonstrate that three seismic cloaks allow for an unprecedented flow of elastodynamic energy.
These designs are achieved by first computing ideal cloaks' parameters deduced from a geometric
transform in the Navier equations that leads to almost isotropic and symmetric elasticity (4th
order) and density (2nd order) tensors. To do this we extend the theory of Non-Euclidean cloaking
for light as proposed by the theoretical physicists Leonhardt and Tyc. In a second step, ideal heterogeneous
nearly isotropic cloak's parameters are approximated by averaging elastic properties of sets
of pillars placed at the nodes of a bipolar coordinate grid, which is an essential ingredient in our
Non-Euclidean cloaking theory for elastodynamic waves. Cloaking effects are studied for a clamped
obstacle (reduction of the disturbance of the wave wavefront and its amplitude behind a clamped
obstacle). Protection is achieved through reduction of the wave amplitude within the center of
the cloak.These results represent a first step towards designs of Non-Euclidean seismic cloaks
for surface (Rayleigh and Love) waves propagating in semi-infinite elastic media structured with
pillars.
