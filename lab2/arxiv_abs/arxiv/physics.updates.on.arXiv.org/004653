The emergence of cooperation in the thermodynamic limit of social dilemmas is an emerging field
of research. While numerical approaches (using replicator dynamics) are dime a dozen, analytical
approaches are rare. A particularly useful analytical approach is to utilize a mapping between
the spin-1/2 Ising model in 1-D and the social dilemma game and calculate the magnetization, which
is the net difference between the fraction of cooperators and defectors in a social dilemma. In this
paper, we look at the susceptibility, which probes the net rate of change in the fraction of players
adopting a certain strategy, for both classical and quantum social dilemmas. The reason being,
in statistical mechanics problems, the thermodynamic susceptibility as compared to magnetization
is a more sensitive probe for microscopic behavior, e.g., observing small changes in a population
adopting a certain strategy. In this paper, we find the thermodynamic susceptibility for reward,
sucker's payoff and temptation in classical Prisoner's Dilemma to be positive, implying that rate
of change of players from defect to cooperate is greater than vice-versa, although the Nash Equilibrium
for the two-player game is to defect. In classical Hawk-Dove game, the thermodynamic susceptibility
for resource suggests that rate of switching of players to Hawk from Dove strategy is dominant. Entanglement
in Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma (QPD) has a non-trivial role in determining the behavior of thermodynamic
susceptibility. At maximal entanglement, we find that sucker's payoff and temptation increase
the rate of players switching to defect. In the zero-temperature limit, we find that there are two
second-order phase transitions in the game, marked by a divergence in the susceptibility. This
behavior is similar to that seen in Type-II superconductors wherein also two second-order phase
transitions are seen.
