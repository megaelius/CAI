We study translocation of semiflexible polymers driven by force $f_d$ inside a nanometer-scale
pore using our three-dimensional Langevin dynamics model. We show that the translocation time
$\tau$ increases with increasing bending rigidity $\kappa$. Similarly, the exponent $\beta$
for the scaling of $\tau$ with polymer length $N$, $\tau \sim N^\beta$, increases with increasing
$\kappa$ as well as with increasing $f_d$. By comparing waiting times between semiflexible and
fully flexible polymers we show that for realistic $f_d$ translocation dynamics is to a large extent,
but not completely, determined by the polymer's elastic length measured in number of Kuhn segments
$N_{\rm Kuhn}$. Unlike in driven translocation of flexible polymers, friction related to the polymer
segment on the trans side has a considerable effect on the resulting dynamics. This friction is intermittently
reduced by buckling of the polymer segment in the vicinity of the pore opening on the trans side. We
show that in the experimentally relevant regime, where viscosity is higher than in computer simulation
models, the probability for this buckling increases with increasing $f_d$, giving rise to larger
contribution to trans side friction at small $f_d$. Similarly to flexible polymers, we find significant
center of mass diffusion of the cis side polymer segment. This speeds up translocation, which effect
is larger for smaller $f_d$. However, this speed-up is smaller than the slowing down due to the trans
side friction. At large enough $N_{\rm Kuhn}$, the roles can be seen to be reversed and the dynamics
of flexible polymers be reached. However, for example, polymers used in translocation experiments
of DNA, are elastically so short, that the finite-length dynamics outlined here applies.
