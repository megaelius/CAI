It is known that spectral properties of the Fabry - Perot interferometer (FPI) depend on the spatial
characteristics of the incident radiation. This paper proposes a general method for taking this
dependence into account, based on the decomposition of the incident field into the angular spectrum
of plane waves, which are the FPI eigenfunctions. In the scalar approximation, the angular-frequency
transfer function and the point-spread function (Green function) of the FPI are calculated, which
enables to relate the spatial coherence functions of the incident and transmitted radiation and
to derive an expression for the output intensity I(r, k) and for the integral transmittance P(k)
depending on the wavenumber of the incident monochromatic radiation k. In the resulting expressions,
I(r, k) is completely determined by the Fourier transform of the input coherence function, and P(k)
is determined by the angular power spectrum (APS) of the incident radiation. For beams of small divergence
and high-quality FPIs, simplified formulas have been obtained that allow, in the first approximation,
for the dependence of the FPI parameters on the angle of incidence and on the radiation wavelength.
Analysis of the expressions obtained makes it possible to clarify an exact meaning of the well-known
regularities in the distortions of the FPI transmission band associated with the incident beam
deviation from the plane wave (shift to the shortwave region, broadening, reduction of the maximum
transmittance and the appearance of asymmetry). As examples, calculations of the integral transmittance
for three types of APS, corresponding to Gaussian and conical beams, and the output intensity distribution
I(r, k) for the input beam with a Gaussian APS are performed. Results are consistent with other theoretical
and experimental works.
