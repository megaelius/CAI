The first stage of the FCC (Future Circular Collider) is a high-luminosity electron-positron collider
(FCC-ee) with centre-of-mass energy ranging from 88 to 365 GeV, to study with high precision the
Z, W, Higgs and top particles, with samples of $5 \times 10^{12}$ Z bosons, $10^8$ W pairs, $10^6$
Higgs bosons and $10^6$ top quark pairs. A cornerstone of the physics program lays in the precise
(ppm) measurements of the W and Z masses and widths, as well as forward-backward asymmetries. To
this effect the centre-of-mass energy distribution should be determined with the high precision.
This document describes the capacity offered by FCC-ee, starting with transverse polarization
of the beams around the Z pole and the W pair threshold. A running scheme based on regular measurements
of the beam energy by resonant depolarization of pilot bunches, during physics data taking, is proposed.
The design for polarization wigglers, polarimeter and depolarizer is outlined. The $e^\pm$ beam
energies will be monitored with a relative precision of $10^{-6}$. The centre-of-mass energy is
derived subject to further corrections, related to the beam acceleration, synchrotron radiation
and beamstrahlung; these effects are identified and evaluated. Dimuon events $e^+e^- \to \mu^+
\mu^-$, recorded in the detectors, provide with great precision the beam crossing angle, the centre-of-mass
energy spread, and the $e^+$ and $e^-$ energy difference. Monitoring methods to minimize absolute
error and relative uncertainties are discussed. The impact on the physics measurements is given.
A programme of further simulations, design, monitoring and R&D is outlined.
