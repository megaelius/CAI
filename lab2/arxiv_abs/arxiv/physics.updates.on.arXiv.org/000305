The physics of instabilities in the precursor of relativistic collisionless shocks is of broad
importance in high energy astrophysics, because these instabilities build up the shock, control
the particle acceleration process and generate the magnetic fields in which the accelerated particles
radiate. Two crucial parameters control the micro-physics of these shocks: the magnetization
of the ambient medium and the Lorentz factor of the shock front; as of today, much of this parameter
space remains to be explored. In the present paper, we report on a new instability upstream of electron-positron
relativistic shocks and we argue that this instability shapes the micro-physics at moderate magnetization
levels and/or large Lorentz factors. This instability is seeded by the electric current carried
by the accelerated particles in the shock precursor as they gyrate around the background magnetic
field. The compensation current induced in the background plasma leads to an unstable configuration,
with the appearance of charge neutral filaments carrying a current of the same polarity, oriented
along the perpendicular current. This ``current-driven filamentation'' instability grows faster
than any other instability studied so far upstream of relativistic shocks, with a growth rate comparable
to the plasma frequency. Furthermore, the compensation of the current is associated with a slow-down
of the ambient plasma as it penetrates the shock precursor (as viewed in the shock rest frame). This
slow-down of the plasma implies that the ``current driven filamentation'' instability can grow
for any value of the shock Lorentz factor, provided the magnetization \sigma <~ 10^{-2}. We argue
that this instability explains the results of recent particle-in-cell simulations in the mildly
magnetized regime.
