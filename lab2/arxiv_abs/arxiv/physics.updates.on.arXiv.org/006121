Urban planning still lacks appropriate standards to define city boundaries across urban systems.
This issue has historically been left to administrative criteria, which can vary significantly
across countries and political systems, hindering a comparative analysis across urban systems.
However, the wide use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has now allowed the development
of new quantitative approaches to unveil how social dynamics relates to urban infrastructure.
In fact, ICT provide the potential to portray more accurate descriptions of the urban systems based
on the empirical analysis of millions of traces left by urbanites across the city. In this work, we
apply computational techniques over a large volume of mobile phone records to define urban boundaries,
through the analysis of travel patterns and the trajectory of urban dwellers in conurbations with
more than 100,000 inhabitants in Chile. We created and analyzed the network of interconnected places
inferred from individual travel trajectories. We then ranked each place using a spectral centrality
method. This allowed to identify places of higher concurrency and functional importance for each
urban environment. Urban scaling analysis is finally used as a diagnostic tool that allowed to distinguish
urban from non-urban spaces. The geographic assessment of our method shows a high congruence with
the current and administrative definitions of urban agglomerations in Chile. Our results can potentially
be considered as a functional definition of the urban boundary. They also provide a practical implementation
of urban scaling and data-driven approaches on cities as complex systems using increasingly larger
non-conventional datasets.
