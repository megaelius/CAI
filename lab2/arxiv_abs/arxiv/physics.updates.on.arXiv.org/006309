Ultrasound Tomography has seen a revival of interest in the past decade, especially for breast imaging,
due to improvements in both ultrasound and computing hardware. In particular, three-dimensional
ultrasound tomography, a fully tomographic method in which the medium to be imaged is surrounded
by ultrasound transducers, has become feasible. In this paper, a comprehensive derivation and
study of a robust framework for large-scale bent-ray ultrasound tomography in 3D for a hemispherical
detector array is presented. Two ray-tracing approaches are derived and compared. More significantly,
the problem of linking the rays between emitters and receivers, which is challenging in 3D due to
the high number of degrees of freedom for the trajectory of rays, is analysed both as a minimisation
and as a root-finding problem. The ray-linking problem is parameterised for a convex detection
surface and three robust, accurate, and efficient ray-linking algorithms are formulated and demonstrated.
To stabilise these methods, novel adaptive-smoothing approaches are proposed that control the
conditioning of the update matrices to ensure accurate linking. The nonlinear UST problem of estimating
the sound speed was recast as a series of linearised subproblems, each solved using the above algorithms
and within a steepest descent scheme. The whole imaging algorithm was demonstrated to be robust
and accurate on realistic data simulated using a full-wave acoustic model and an anatomical breast
phantom, and incorporating the errors due to time-of-flight picking that would be present with
measured data. This method can used to provide a low-artefact, quantitatively accurate, 3D sound
speed maps. In addition to being useful in their own right, such 3D sound speed maps can be used to initialise
full-wave inversion methods, or as an input to photoacoustic tomography reconstructions.
