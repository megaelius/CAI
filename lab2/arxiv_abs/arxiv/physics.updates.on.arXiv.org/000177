We study the spatiotemporal patterns resulting from different boundary conditions for a microscopic
traffic model and contrast it with empirical results. By evaluating the time series of local measurements,
the local traffic states are assigned to the different traffic phases of Kerner's three-phase traffic
theory. For this classification we use the rule-based FOTO-method, which provides `hard' rules
for this assignment. Using this approach, our analysis shows that the model is indeed able to reproduce
three qualitatively different traffic phases: free flow (F), synchronized traffic (S), and wide
moving jams (J). In addition, we investigate the likelihood of transitions between the three traffic
phases. We show that a transition from free flow (F) to a wide moving jam (J) often involves an intermediate
transition; first from free flow F to synchronized flow S and then from synchronized flow to a wide
moving jam. This is supported by the fact that the so called F->S transition (from free flow to
synchronized traffic) is much more likely than a direct F->J transition. The model under consideration
has a functional relation between traffic flow and traffic density. The fundamental hypothesis
of the three-phase traffic theory, however, postulates that the steady states of synchronized
flow occupy a two-dimensional region in the flow-density plane. Due to the obvious discrepancy
between the model investigated here and the postulate of the three-phase traffic theory, the good
agreement that we found could not be expected. For a more detailed analysis, we also studied the vehicle
dynamics at a microscopic level and provide a comparison of real detector data with simulated data
of the identical highway segment.
