A detailed comparison between the Boublik--Mansoori--Carnahan--Starling--Leland (BMCSL)equation
of state of hard-sphere mixtures is made with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of the same compositions.
The Lab\'ik and Smith simulation technique [Mol. Simul. \textbf{12}, 23 (1994)] was used to implement
the Widom particle insertion method to calculate the excess chemical potential, $\beta \mu_0^\text{ex}$,
of a test particle of variable diameter, $\sigma_0$, immersed in a hard-sphere fluid mixture with
different compositions and values of the packing fraction, $\eta$. Use is made of the fact that the
only polynomial representation of $\beta \mu_0^\text{ex}$ which is consistent with the limits
$\sigma_0\to 0$ and $\sigma_0\to\infty$ has to be of cubic form, \emph{i.e.}, $c_0(\eta)+\overline{c}_1(\eta)\sigma_0/M_{1}+\overline{c}_2(\eta)(\sigma_0/M_{1})^2+
\overline{c}_3(\eta)(\sigma_0/M_{1})^3$, where $M_{1}$ is the first moment of the distribution.
The first two coefficients, $c_0(\eta)$ and $\overline{c}_1(\eta)$, are known analytically,
while $\overline{c}_2(\eta)$ and $\overline{c}_3(\eta)$ were obtained by fitting the MD data
to this expression. This in turn provides a method to determine the excess free energy per particle,
$\beta a^\text{ex}$, in terms of $\overline{c}_2$, $\overline{c}_3$, and the compressibility
factor, $Z$. Very good agreement between the BMCSL formulas and the MD data is found for $\beta \mu^\text{ex}_0$,
$Z$, and $\beta a^\text{ex}$ for binary mixtures and continuous particle size distributions with
the top-hat analytic form. However, the BMCSL theory typically slightly underestimates the simulation
values, especially for $Z$, differences which the Boubl\'ik--Carnahan--Starling--Kolafa formulas
and an interpolation between two Percus--Yevick routes capture well in different ranges of the
system parameter space.
