Purpose: Siemens has developed several iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms on their CT scanners.
SAFIRE is available on most of their CT scanners. The latest algorithm, ADMIRE, is available on their
newest high-end CT scanners. The aim of our study was to compare the noise reduction properties of
the two IR algorithms using objective methods. Methods and Materials: The homogeneous module of
the Catphan phantom was scanned on a Siemens AS+ and a Siemens Flash CT scanner using an axial abdomen
protocol with fixed tube current at two dose levels. The images were reconstructed with an abdomen
filter (B30) using filtered back projection (FBP) and a low, medium, and high level of SAFIRE or ADMIRE.
Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) curves were calculated using these images. Then, an anthropomorphic
abdomen phantom (Kyoto Kagaku PH-5) was scanned using the same setup and exposure parameters. Fifty
axial images at the same slice location were used to calculate inter-image standard deviation maps.
Results: At full dose, the median values of the NPS curves were similar for both scanners at all IR
levels. At low dose the median values of the NPS curves were generally shifted towards lower spatial
frequencies, usually resulting in a more blotchy image texture. This shift was more prominent for
ADMIRE compared to SAFIRE for all IR levels. Based on the inter-image standard deviation maps of
the anthropomorphic phantom, ADMIRE removed noise near edges more efficiently than SAFIRE. Conclusion:
No significant improvement in maintaining noise structure were found for the ADMIRE algorithm.
Based on the inter-image standard deviation maps, ADMIRE removed noise near edges more efficiently
than SAFIRE.
