The brain perfusion ROI detection being a preliminary step, designed to exclude non-brain tissues
from analyzed DSC perfusion MR images. Its accuracy is considered as the key factor for delivering
correct results of perfusion data analysis. Despite the large variety of algorithms developed
on brain tissues segmentation, there is no one that works reliably and robustly on 2T-waited MR images
of a human head with abnormal brain anatomy. Therefore, thresholding method is still the state-of-the-art
technique that is widely used as a way of managing pixels involved in brain perfusion ROI. This paper
presents the analysis of effectiveness of thresholding techniques in brain perfusion ROI detection
on 2T-waited MR images of a human head with abnormal brain anatomy. Four threshold-based algorithms
implementation are considered: according to Otsu method as global thresholding, according to
Niblack method as local thresholding, thresholding in approximate anatomical brain location,
and brute force thresholding. The analysis is done using comparison of qualitative maps produced
from thresholded images and from the reference ones. Pearson correlation analysis showed strong
positive (r was ranged from 0.7123 to 0.8518, p<0.01) and weak positive (r<0.35, p<0.01) relationship
in case of conducted experiments with CBF, CBV, MTT and Tmax maps, respectively. Linear regression
analysis showed at level of 95% confidence interval that maps produced from thresholded images
were subject to scale and offset errors in all conducted experiments. The experimental results
showed that widely used thresholding methods are an ineffective way of managing pixels involved
in brain perfusion ROI. Thresholding as brain segmentation tool can lead to poor placement of perfusion
ROI and, as a result, produced maps will be subject to artifacts and can cause falsely high or falsely
low perfusion parameters assessment.
