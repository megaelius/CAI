A review of the present status, recent enhancements, and applicability of the SIESTA program is
presented. Since its debut in the mid-nineties, SIESTA's flexibility, efficiency and free distribution
has given advanced materials simulation capabilities to many groups worldwide. The core methodological
scheme of SIESTA combines finite-support pseudo-atomic orbitals as basis sets, norm-conserving
pseudopotentials, and a real-space grid for the representation of charge density and potentials
and the computation of their associated matrix elements. Here we describe the more recent implementations
on top of that core scheme, which include: full spin-orbit interaction, non-repeated and multiple-contact
ballistic electron transport, DFT+U and hybrid functionals, time-dependent DFT, novel reduced-scaling
solvers, density-functional perturbation theory, efficient Van der Waals non-local density
functionals, and enhanced molecular-dynamics options. In addition, a substantial effort has
been made in enhancing interoperability and interfacing with other codes and utilities, such as
Wannier90 and the second-principles modelling it can be used for, an AiiDA plugin for workflow automatization,
interface to Lua for steering SIESTA runs, and various postprocessing utilities. SIESTA has also
been engaged in the Electronic Structure Library effort from its inception, which has allowed the
sharing of various low level libraries, as well as data standards and support for them, in particular
the PSML definition and library for transferable pseudopotentials, and the interface to the ELSI
library of solvers. Code sharing is made easier by the new open-source licensing model of the program.
This review also presents examples of application of the capabilities of the code, as well as a view
of on-going and future developments.
