In the Large helical device, a change of energetic particle mode is observed as He concentration
is varied in ion-ITB type experiments, having constant electron density and input heating power
but with a clear increase of central ion temperature in He rich discharges. This activity consists
of bursty, but damped energetic interchange modes (EICs, X Du et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 p.155003
(2015)), whose occurrence rate is dramatically lower in the He-rich discharges. Mechanisms are
discussed for the changes in drive and damping of the modes with He concentration. These EIC bursts
consist of marked changes in the radial electric field, which is derived from the phase velocity
of turbulence measured with the 2D phase contrast imaging (PCI) system. Similar bursts are detected
in edge fast ion diagnostics. Ion thermal transport by gyro-Bohm scaling is recognised as a contribution
to the change in ion temperature, though fast ion losses by these EIC modes may also contribute to
the ion temperature dependence on He concentration, most particularly controlling the height
of an "edge-pedestal" in the $T_{i}$ profile. The steady-state level of fast ions is shown to be larger
in Helium rich discharges on the basis of a compact neutral particle analyser (CNPA), and the fast-ion
component of the diamagnetic stored energy. These events also have an influence on turbulence and
transport. The large velocity shear induced produced during these events transiently improves
confinement and suppresses turbulence, and has a larger net effect when bursts are more frequent
in Hydrogen discharges. This exactly offsets the increased gyro-Bohm related turbulence drive
in Hydrogen which results in the same time-averaged turbulence level in Hydrogen as in Helium.
