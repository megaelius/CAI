To date, analyses of magnetic induction in putative oceans in Jupiter's large icy moons have assumed
uniform conductivity in the modeled oceans. However, the phase and amplitude response of the induced
fields will be influenced by the increasing electrical conductivity along oceans' convective
adiabatic temperature profiles. Here, we examine the amplitudes and phase lags for magnetic diffusion
in modeled oceans of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. We restrict our analysis to spherically symmetric
configurations, treating interior structures based on self-consistent thermodynamics, which
account for variations in electrical conductivity with depth in convective oceans (Vance et al.,
2018). The numerical approach considers tens of radial layers. The induction response of the adiabatic
conductivity profile differs from oceans with uniform conductivity based on the ice-ocean interface
or the mean value of the adiabatic profile by more than 10% in many cases. In addition, we consider
the generation of induced magnetic fields by oceanic fluid motions that might be used to probe the
ocean flows directly (e.g., Chave, 1983; Tyler, 2011; Minami, 2017). Assuming turbulent convection
(Soderlund et al., 2014), we find that these signals can dominate induction signal at low latitudes,
which underscores the need for spatial coverage in magnetic induction investigations. Based on
end-member ocean compositions (Zolotov, 2008; Zolotov & Kargel, 2009), we quantify the residual
magnetic induction signals that might be used to infer the oxidation state of Europa's ocean and
to investigate stable liquids within and under high-pressure ices in Ganymede and Callisto. Fully
exploring this parameter space for the sake of planned missions requires electrical conductivity
measurements in fluids at low temperature and to high salinity and pressure.
