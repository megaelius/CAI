The paper focuses on applying the algebra of octonions to explore the influence of electric-charge
gradients on the electric-current derivatives, revealing some of major influence factors of high
pulse electric-currents. J. C. Maxwell was the first scholar to utilize the algebra of quaternions
to study the physical properties of electromagnetic fields. The contemporary scholars employ
simultaneously the quaternions and octonions to investigate the physical properties of electromagnetic
fields, including the octonion field strength, field source, linear momentum, angular momentum,
torque, and force and so forth. When the octonion force is equal to zero, it is able to achieve eight
equations independent of each other, including the fluid continuity equation, current continuity
equation, force equilibrium equation, and second-force equilibrium equation and so on. One of
inferences derived from the second-force equilibrium equation is that the charge gradient and
current derivative are interrelated closely, two of them must satisfy the need of the second-force
equilibrium equation synchronously. Meanwhile the electromagnetic strength and linear momentum
both may exert an influence on the current derivative to a certain extent. The above states that the
charge gradient and current derivative are two correlative physical quantities, they must meet
the requirement of second-force equilibrium equation. By means of controlling the charge gradients
and other physical quantities, it is capable of restricting the development process of current
derivatives, reducing the damage caused by the instantaneous impact of high pulse electric-currents,
enhancing the anti-interference ability of electronic equipments to resist the high pulse electric-currents
and their current derivatives. Further the second-force equilibrium equation is able to explain
two types of superconducting currents.
