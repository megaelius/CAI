We argue that the classical theory of electromagnetism is based on Maxwell's macroscopic equations,
an energy postulate, a momentum postulate, and a generalized form of the Lorentz law of force. These
seven postulates constitute the foundation of a complete and consistent theory, thus eliminating
the need for actual (i.e., physical) models of polarization P and magnetization M, these being the
distinguishing features of Maxwell's macroscopic equations. In the proposed formulation, P(r,t)
and M(r,t) are arbitrary functions of space and time, their physical properties being embedded
in the seven postulates of the theory. The postulates are self-consistent, comply with the requirements
of the special theory of relativity, and satisfy the laws of conservation of energy, linear momentum,
and angular momentum. One advantage of the proposed formulation is that it side-steps the long-standing
Abraham-Minkowski controversy surrounding the electromagnetic momentum inside a material medium
by simply "assigning" the Abraham momentum density E(r,t) x H(r,t)/c^2 to the electromagnetic
field. This well-defined momentum is thus taken to be universal as it does not depend on whether the
field is propagating or evanescent, and whether or not the host medium is homogeneous, transparent,
isotropic, dispersive, magnetic, linear, etc. In other words, the local and instantaneous momentum
density is uniquely and unambiguously specified at each and every point of the material system in
terms of the E and H fields residing at that point. Any variation with time of the total electromagnetic
momentum of a closed system results in a force exerted on the material media within the system in accordance
with the generalized Lorentz law.
