The atmospheric reaction of H$_2$S with Cl has been reinvestigated to check if, as previously suggested,
only explicit dynamical computations can lead to an accurate evaluation of the reaction rate because
of strong recrossing effects and the breakdown of the variational extension of transition state
theory. For this reason, the corresponding potential energy surface has been thoroughly investigated,
thus leading to an accurate characterization of all stationary points, whose energetics has been
computed at the state of the art. To this end, coupled-cluster theory including up to quadruple excitations
has been employed, together with the extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and also incorporating
core-valence correlation, spin-orbit, and scalar relativistic effects as well as diagonal Born-Oppenheimer
corrections. This highly accurate composite scheme has also been paralleled by less expensive
yet promising computational approaches. Moving to kinetics, variational transition state theory
and its variable reaction coordinate extension for barrierless steps have been exploited, thus
obtaining a reaction rate constant (8.16 x 10$^{-11}$ cm$^3$ molecule$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ at 300 K
and 1 atm) in remarkable agreement with the experimental counterpart. Therefore, contrary to previous
claims, there is no need to invoke any failure of the transition state theory, provided that sufficiently
accurate quantum-chemical computations are performed. The investigation of the puzzling case
of the H$_2$S + Cl system allowed us to present a robust approach for disclosing the thermochemistry
and kinetics of reactions of atmospheric and astrophysical interest.
