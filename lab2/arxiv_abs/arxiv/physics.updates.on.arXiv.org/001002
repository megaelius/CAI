The evolution of protoplanetary disks is believed to be driven largely by angular momentum transport
resulting from magnetized disk winds and turbulent viscosity. The ionization of the disk that is
essential for these processes has been thought due to host star coronal X-rays but could also arise
from energetic particles produced by coronal flares or by travelling shock waves and advected by
the stellar wind. We have performed test-particle numerical simulations of energetic protons
propagating into a realistic T~Tauri stellar wind, including a superposed small-scale magnetostatic
turbulence. The isotropic (Kolmogorov power spectrum) turbulent component is synthesised along
the individual particle trajectories. We have investigated the particle energy range, $[0.1 -
10]$ GeV, consistent with expectations from {\it Chandra} X-ray observations of large flares on
T~Tauri stars and with recent indications by the {\it Herschel} Space Observatory of a significant
contribution of energetic particles to the disk ionization of young stars. In contrast with a previous
theoretical study finding dominance of energetic particle ionization over X-ray ionization throughout
the disk, we find that the disk ionization is likely dominated by X-rays over much of its area except
within narrow regions where the energetic particles are channeled onto the disk by the strongly-tangled
and turbulent magnetic field lines. The radial thickness of such regions is $\sim 5$ stellar radii
close to the star and broadens with increasing radial distance. In these regions, the disk ionization
due to energetic particles can locally dominate the stellar X-ray contribution. This likely continues
out to large distances from the star ($10$ AU or greater) where particles can be copiously advected
and diffused by the turbulent wind.
