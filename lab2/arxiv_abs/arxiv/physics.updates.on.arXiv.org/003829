Driven by machine-learning tasks neural networks have demonstrated useful capabilities as nonlinear
hypothesis classifiers. The underlying technologies performing the dot product multiplication,
the summation, and the nonlinear thresholding on the input data in electronics, however, are limited
by the same capacitive challenges known from electronic integrated circuits. The optical domain,
in contrast, provides low delay interconnectivity suitable for such node distributed non Von Neumann
architectures relying on dense node to node communication. Thus, once the neural network's weights
are set, the delay of the network is just given by the time of flight of the photon, which is in the picosecond
range for photonic integrated circuits. However, the functionality of memory for storing the trained
weights does not exists in optics, thus demanding a fresh look to explore synergies between photonics
and electronics in neural networks. Here we provide a roadmap to pave the way for emerging hybridized
photonic electronic neural networks by taking a detailed look into a single node's perceptron,
discussing how it can be realized in hybrid photonic electronic heterogeneous technologies. We
show that a set of materials exist that exploit synergies with respect to a number of constrains including
electronic contacts, memory functionality, electrooptic modulation, optical nonlinearity,
and device packaging. We find that the material ITO, in particular, could provide a viable path for
both the perceptron weights and the nonlinear activation function, while simultaneously being
a foundry process near material. We finally identify a number of challenges that, if solved, could
accelerate the adoption of such heterogeneous integration strategies of emerging memory materials
into integrated photonics platforms for real time responsive neural networks.
