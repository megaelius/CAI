Observations of brown dwarfs (BDs), free-floating planetary-mass objects, and directly imaged
extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) exhibit rich evidence of large-scale weather. Understanding
the mechanisms driving the vigorous atmospheric circulation of BDs and directly imaged EGPs and
its effects on their observed lightcurve variability and spectral properties is a pressing need.
Our previous work has suggested a strong role of radiative cloud feedback on inducing a spontaneous
time evolution in a simple one-dimensional framework. Yet the radiative cloud feedback in a three-dimensional
(3D) dynamical framework remains unexplored for conditions relevant to these objects. Here we
present a series of atmospheric circulation models that self-consistently couple dynamics with
idealized cloud formation and its radiative effects. We demonstrate that vigorous atmospheric
circulation can be triggered and self-maintained by cloud radiative feedback. The circulation
is dominated by cloud-forming and clear-sky vortices that evolve over timescales from several
to tens of hours. The typical horizontal lengthscales of dominant vortices are strongly constrained
by the rotation, showing a linear dependence on the inverse of rotation rate with stronger rotation
leading to thinner clouds. Domain-mean outgoing radiative flux exhibits variability over timescales
of tens of hours due to the statistical evolution of storms. The circulation driven by cloud radiative
feedback represents a natural mechanism generating significant surface inhomogeneity as well
as irregular flux variability. Our results also have important implications for near-IR colors
of dusty BDs and EGPs, including the scatter in the near-IR color-magnitude diagram and the viewing-geometry
dependent near-IR colors.
