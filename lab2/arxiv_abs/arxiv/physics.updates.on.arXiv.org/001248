The Mid-Pleistocene Transition, the shift from 41 kyr to 100 kyr glacial-interglacial cycles that
occurred roughly 1 Myr ago, is often considered as a change in internal climate dynamics. Here we
revisit the model of Quaternary climate dynamics that was proposed by Saltzman and Maasch (1988).
We show that it is quantitatively similar to a scalar equation for the ice dynamics only when combining
the remaining components into a single delayed feedback term. The delay is the sum of the internal
times scales of ocean transport and ice sheet dynamics, which is on the order of 10 kyr. We find that,
in the absence of astronomical forcing, the delayed feedback leads to bistable behaviour, where
stable large-amplitude oscillations of ice volume and an equilibrium coexist over a large range
of values for the delay. We then apply astronomical forcing. We perform a systematic study to show
how the system response depends on the forcing amplitude. We find that over a wide range of forcing
amplitudes the forcing leads to a switch from small-scale oscillations of 41 kyr to large-amplitude
oscillations of roughly 100 kyr without any change of other parameters. The transition in the forced
model consistently occurs near the time of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition as observed in data records.
This provides evidence that the MPT could have been primarily a forcing-induced switch between
attractors of the internal dynamics. Small additional random disturbances make the forcing-induced
transition near 800 kyr BP even more robust. We also find that the forced system forgets its initial
history during the small-scale oscillations, in particular, nearby initial conditions converge
prior to transitioning. In contrast to this, in the regime of large-amplitude oscillations, the
oscillation phase is very sensitive to random perturbations, which has a strong effect on the timing
of the deglaciation events.
