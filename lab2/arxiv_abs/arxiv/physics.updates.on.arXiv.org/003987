We study airplane boarding in the limit of large number of passengers using geometric optics in a
Lorentzian metric. The airplane boarding problem is naturally embedded in a 1+1 dimensional space-time
with a flat Lorentzian metric. The duration of the boarding process can be calculated based on a representation
of the one-dimensional queue of passengers attempting to reach their seats, into a two-dimensional
space-time diagram. The ability of a passenger to delay other passengers depends on their queue
positions and row designations. This is equivalent to the causal relationship between two events
in space-time, whereas two passengers are time-like separated if one is blocking the other, and
space-like if both can be seated simultaneously. Geodesics in this geometry can be utilized to compute
the asymptotic boarding time, since space-time geometry is the many-particle (passengers) limit
of airplane boarding. Our approach naturally leads to a novel definition of an effective refractive
index. The introduction of an effective refractive index enables, for the first time, an analytical
calculation of the average boarding time for groups of passengers with different aisle-clearing
time distribution. In the past, airline companies attempted to shorten the boarding times by trying
boarding policies that either allow slow or fast passengers to board first. Our analytical calculations,
backed by discrete-event simulations, support the counter-intuitive result that the total boarding
time is shorter with the slow passengers boarding before the fast passengers. This is a universal
result, valid for any combination of the parameters that characterize the problem --- percentage
of slow passengers, ratio between aisle-clearing times between the fast and the slow groups, and
the density of passengers along the aisle. We find an improvement of up to 28% compared with the Fast-First
boarding policy.
