The stability of a cantilevered elastic sheet in a uniform flow has been studied extensively due
to its importance in engineering and its prevalence in natural structures. Varying the flow speed
can give rise to a range of dynamics including limit cycle behaviour and chaotic motion of the cantilevered
sheet. Recently, the "inverted flag" configuration - a cantilevered elastic sheet aligned with
the flow impinging on its free edge - has been observed to produce large-amplitude flapping over
a finite band of flow speeds. This flapping phenomenon has been found to be a vortex-induced vibration,
and only occurs at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. In all cases studied, the inverted flag
has been formed from a cantilevered sheet of rectangular morphology, i.e. the planform of its elastic
sheet is a rectangle. Here, we investigate the effect of the inverted flag's morphology on its resulting
stability and dynamics. We choose a trapezoidal planform which is explored using experiment and
an analytical theory for the divergence instability of an inverted flag of arbitrary morphology.
Strikingly, for this planform we observe that the flow speed range over which flapping occurs scales
approximately with the flow speed at which the divergence instability occurs. This provides a means
by which to predict and control flapping. In a biological setting, leaves in a wind can also align
themselves in an inverted flag configuration. Motivated by this natural occurrence we also study
the effect of adding an artificial "petiole" (a thin elastic stalk that connects the sheet to the
clamp) on the inverted flag's dynamics. We find that the petiole serves to partially decouple fluid
forces from elastic forces and increases the freedom by which the flapping dynamics can be tuned.
These results highlight the intricacies of the flapping instability and account for some of the
varied dynamics of leaves in nature.
