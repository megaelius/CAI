We develop the theory of a special type of scattering state in which a set of asymptotic channels are
chosen as inputs and the complementary set as outputs, and there is zero reflection back into the
input channels. In general an infinite number of such solutions exist at discrete complex frequencies.
Our results apply to linear electromagnetic and acoustic wave scattering and also to quantum scattering,
in all dimensions, for arbitrary geometries including scatterers in free space, and for any choice
of the input/output sets. We refer to such a state as reflection-zero (R-zero) when it occurs off
the real-frequency axis and as an Reflectionless Scattering Mode (RSM) when it is tuned to a real
frequency as a steady-state solution. Such reflectionless behavior requires a specific monochromatic
input wavefront, given by the eigenvector of a filtered scattering matrix with eigenvalue zero.
Steady-state RSMs may be realized by index tuning which do not break flux conservation or by gain-loss
tuning. RSMs of flux-conserving cavities are bidirectional while those of non-flux-conserving
cavities are generically unidirectional. Cavities with ${\cal PT}$-symmetry have unidirectional
R-zeros in complex-conjugate pairs, implying that reflectionless states naturally arise at real
frequencies for small gain-loss parameter but move into the complex-frequency plane after a spontaneous
${\cal PT}$-breaking transition. Numerical examples of RSMs are given for one-dimensional cavities
with and without gain/loss, a ${\cal PT}$ cavity, a two-dimensional multiwaveguide junction,
and a two-dimensional deformed dielectric cavity in free space. We outline and implement a general
technique for solving such problems, which shows promise for designing photonic structures which
are perfectly impedance-matched for specific inputs, or can perfectly convert inputs from one
set of modes to a complementary set.
