Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers have been the dominant technology in the field
of mid-infrared (MIR)spectroscopy for decades. Supercontinuum laser sources operating in the
MIR spectral region now offer the potential to enrich the field of FTIR spectroscopy due to their
distinctive properties, such as high-brightness, broadband spectral coverage and enhanced stability.
In our contribution, we introduce this advanced light source as a replacement for conventional
thermal emitters. Furthermore, an approach to efficient coupling of pulsed MIR supercontinuum
sources to FTIR spectrometers is proposed and considered in detail. The experimental part is devoted
to pulse-to-pulse energy fluctuations of the applied supercontinuum laser, performance of the
system, as well as the noise and long-term stability. Comparative measurements performed with
a conventional FTIR instrument equipped with a thermal emitter illustrate that similar noise levels
can be achieved with the supercontinuum-based system. The analytical performance of the supercontinuum-based
FTIR spectrometer was tested for a concentration series of aqueous formaldehyde solutions in a
liquid flow cell (500 $\mu$m path length) and compared with the conventional FTIR (130 $\mu$m path
length). The results show a four-times-enhanced detection limit due to the extended path length
enabled by the high brightness of the laser. In conclusion, FTIR spectrometers equipped with novel
broadband MIR supercontinuum lasers could outperform traditional systems providing superior
performance, e.g., interaction path lengths formerly unattainable, while maintaining low noise
levels known from highly stable thermal emitters.
