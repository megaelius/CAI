Atomic-scale materials synthesis via layer deposition techniques present a unique opportunity
to control material structures and yield systems that display unique functional properties that
cannot be stabilized using traditional bulk synthetic routes. However, the deposition process
itself presents a large, multidimensional space that is traditionally optimized via intuition
and trial and error, slowing down progress. Here, we present an application of deep reinforcement
learning to a simulated materials synthesis problem, utilizing the Stein variational policy gradient
(SVPG) approach to train multiple agents to optimize a stochastic policy to yield desired functional
properties. Our contributions are (1) A fully open source simulation environment for layered materials
synthesis problems, utilizing a kinetic Monte-Carlo engine and implemented in the OpenAI Gym framework,
(2) Extension of the Stein variational policy gradient approach to deal with both image and tabular
input, and (3) Developing a parallel (synchronous) implementation of SVPG using Horovod, distributing
multiple agents across GPUs and individual simulation environments on CPUs. We demonstrate the
utility of this approach in optimizing for a material surface characteristic, surface roughness,
and explore the strategies used by the agents as compared with a traditional actor-critic (A2C)
baseline. Further, we find that SVPG stabilizes the training process over traditional A2C. Such
trained agents can be useful to a variety of atomic-scale deposition techniques, including pulsed
laser deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, if the implementation challenges are addressed.
