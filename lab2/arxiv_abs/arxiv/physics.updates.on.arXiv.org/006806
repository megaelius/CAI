2D quantum confined hybrid materials are of great interest from a solid state physics standpoint
because of the rich multibody phenomena hosted, their tunability and easy synthesis allowing to
create material libraries. In addition, from a technological standpoint, 2D hybrids are promising
candidates for efficient, tunable, low cost materials impacting a broad range of optoelectronic
devices. Different approaches and materials have therefore been investigated, with the notable
example of 2D metal halide hybrid perovskites. Despite the remarkable properties of such materials,
the presence of toxic elements like lead are not desirable in applications and their ionic lattices
may represent a limiting factor for stability under operating conditions. Alternative, non-ionic
2D materials made of non-toxic elements are therefore desirable. In order to expand the library
of possible hybrid quantum wells materials, here we consider an alternative platform based on non-toxic,
self-assembled, metal-organic chalcogenides. While the optical properties have been recently
explored and some unique excitonic characters highlighted, photo-generation of carriers and
their transport in these lamellar inorganic/organic nanostructures, critical optoelectronic
aspects, remain totally unexplored. We hereby report the first electrical investigation of the
air-stable [AgSePh] 2D coordination polymer in form of nanocrystal (NC) films readily synthesized
in situ and at low temperature, compatible with flexible plastic substrates. The wavelength-dependent
photo-response of the NC films suggests possible use of this materials as near-UV photodetector.
We therefore built a lateral photo-detector, achieving a sensitivity of 0.8 A/W at 370 nm thanks
to a photoconduction mechanism, and a cutoff frequency of ~400 Hz, and validated its reliability
as air-stable UV detector on flexible substrates.
