Spin wave excitations --- collective and de-localized atomic excitations in an ensemble with well
defined wavevector ${\bf k}$ --- are the natural basis to characterize the interaction of the atomic
medium with light. Naturally, optical fields excite spin waves whose wavevector $|{\bf k}|=\omega/c$
is phase matched to the dispersion relation of light itself. Conversely, such waves exhibit a collectively
enhanced emission into a specific direction, a key idea behind efficient atom-light interfaces.
Recently, however, the properties and possible applications of spin waves with highly mismatched
wavevector $|{\bf k}| \neq \omega/c$ have begun to attract significant interest. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate a technique to coherently and all-optically convert between phase matched and mismatched
spin waves, overcoming the natural tendency for mismatched excitations to de-couple from light
in the first place. Our technique is based upon imparting state- and spatially-dependent geometric
phases with high precision and speed, on time scales much faster than emission time itself, using
sub-nanosecond shaped pulses. We verify this control through the redirection, turn-off, and coherent
recall of collectively enhanced emission. We demonstrate $\sim70\%$ control efficiency, currently
limited by hyperfine interaction and spontaneous decay, and discuss possible routes toward achieving
$\sim99\%$ efficiencies. Our work represents a first step toward accurate and efficient control
of electric dipole spin waves for studying many-body dissipative dynamics of excited gases, as
well as for numerous quantum optical applications.
