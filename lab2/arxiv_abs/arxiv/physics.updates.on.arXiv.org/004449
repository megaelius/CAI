This paper presents a theory to obtain the force per unit length acting on a slender filament with
a non-circular cross-section moving in a fluid at low Reynolds number. Using a regular perturbation
of the inner solution, we show that the force per unit length has $O(1/ln(2A))$ + $O(\alpha/ln^2(2A))$
contributions driven by the relative motion of the particle and the local fluid velocity and an $O(\alpha/(ln(2A)A))$
contribution driven by the gradient in the imposed fluid velocity. Here, the aspect ratio ($A=l/a_0$)
is defined as the ratio of the size of the particle ($l$) and the cross-sectional dimension ($a_0$);
and $\alpha$ is the amplitude of the non-circular perturbation. Using thought experiments, we
show that two-lobed and three-lobed cross-sections affect the response to relative motion and
velocity gradients, respectively. A two-dimensional Stokes flow calculation is used to extend
the perturbation analysis to cross-sections that deviate significantly from a circle (i.e., $\alpha
\sim O(1)$). We demonstrate the ability of our method to accurately compute the resistance to translation
and rotation of a slender triaxial ellipsoid. Furthermore, we illustrate novel dynamics of straight
rods in a simple shear flow that translate and rotate quasi-periodically if they have two-lobed
cross-section; and rotate chaotically and translate diffusively if they have a combination of
two- and three-lobed cross-sections. Finally, we show the remarkable ability of our theory to accurately
predict the motion of rings, retaining great accuracy for moderate aspect ratios ($\sim 10$) and
cross-sections that deviate significantly from a circle, thereby making our theory a computationally
inexpensive alternative to other Stokes flow solvers.
