Squire & Hopkins (2017) showed that coupled dust-gas mixtures are generically subject to 'resonant
drag instabilities' (RDIs), which drive violently-growing fluctuations in both. But the role
of magnetic fields and charged dust has not yet been studied. We therefore explore the RDI in gas which
obeys ideal MHD and is coupled to dust via both Lorentz forces and drag, with an external acceleration
(e.g. gravity, radiation) driving dust drift through gas. We show this is always unstable, at all
wavelengths and non-zero values of dust-to-gas ratio, drift velocity, dust charge, 'stopping
time' or drag coefficient (for any drag law), or field strength; moreover growth rates depend only
weakly (sub-linearly) on these parameters. Dust charge and magnetic fields do not suppress instabilities,
but give rise to a large number of new instability 'families,' each with distinct behavior. The 'MHD-wave'
(magnetosonic or Alfven) RDIs exhibit maximal growth along 'resonant' angles where the modes have
a phase velocity matching the corresponding MHD wave, and growth rates increase without limit with
wavenumber. The 'gyro' RDIs are driven by resonances between drift and Larmor frequencies, giving
growth rates sharply peaked at specific wavelengths. Other instabilities include 'acoustic'
and 'pressure-free' modes (previously studied), and a family akin to cosmic ray instabilities
which appear when Lorentz forces are strong and dust streams super-Alfvenically along field lines.
We discuss astrophysical applications in the warm ISM, CGM/IGM, HII regions, SNe ejecta/remnants,
Solar corona, cool-star winds, GMCs, and AGN.
