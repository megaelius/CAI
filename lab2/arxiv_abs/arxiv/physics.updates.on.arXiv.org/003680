Colloidal zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles are frequently used in the field of organic photovoltaics
for the realization of solution-producible, electron-selective interfacial layers. Despite
of the widespread use, there is a lack of detailed investigations regarding the impact of structural
properties of the particles on the device performance. In this work, ZnO nanoparticles with varying
surface-area-to-volume ratio were synthesized and implemented into polymer-fullerene bulk
heterojunction solar cells with a gas-permeable top electrode. By comparing the electrical characteristics
before and after encapsulation, it was found that the internal surface area of the ZnO layer plays
a crucial role under conditions where oxygen can penetrate the solar cells. The adsorption of oxygen
species at the nanoparticle surface causes band bending and electron depletion next to the surface.
Both effects result in the formation of a barrier for electron injection and extraction at the ZnO/bulk
heterojunction interface and were more pronounced in case of small ZnO nanocrystals (high surface-area-to-volume
ratio). Different transport-related phenomena in the presence of oxygen are discussed in detail,
i.e., Ohmic losses, expressed in terms of series resistance, as well as the occurrence of space-charge-limited
currents, related to charge accumulation in the polymer-fullerene blend. Since absorption of
UV light can cause desorption of adsorbed oxygen species, the electrical properties depend also
on the illumination conditions. With the help of systematic investigations of the current versus
voltage characteristics of solar cells under different air exposure and illumination conditions
as well as studies of the photoconductivity of pure ZnO nanoparticle layers, we gain detailed insight
into the role of the ZnO nanoparticle surface for the functionality of the organic solar cells.
