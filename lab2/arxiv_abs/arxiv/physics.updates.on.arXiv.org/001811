Scalable and efficient numerical simulations continue to gain importance, as computation is firmly
established as the third pillar of discovery, alongside theory and experiment. Meanwhile, the
performance of computing hardware grows through increasing heterogeneous parallelism, enabling
simulations of ever more complex models. However, efficiently implementing scalable codes on
heterogeneous, distributed hardware systems becomes the bottleneck. This bottleneck can be alleviated
by intermediate software layers that provide higher-level abstractions closer to the problem
domain, hence allowing the computational scientist to focus on the simulation. Here, we present
OpenFPM, an open and scalable framework that provides an abstraction layer for numerical simulations
using particles and/or meshes. OpenFPM provides transparent and scalable infrastructure for
shared-memory and distributed-memory implementations of particles-only and hybrid particle-mesh
simulations of both discrete and continuous models, as well as non-simulation codes. This infrastructure
is complemented with portable implementations of frequently used numerical routines, as well
as interfaces to third-party libraries. We present the architecture and design of OpenFPM, detail
the underlying abstractions, and benchmark the framework in applications ranging from Smoothed-Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) to Molecular Dynamics (MD), Discrete Element Methods (DEM), Vortex Methods,
stencil codes, high-dimensional Monte Carlo sampling (CMA-ES), and Reaction-Diffusion solvers,
comparing it to the current state of the art and existing software frameworks.
