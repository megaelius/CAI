This study focuses on the Rijke tube problem, which includes features relevant to the modeling of
thermoacoustic coupling in reactive flows: a compact acoustic source, an empirical model for the
heat source, and nonlinearities. This thermo-acoustic system features a complex dynamical behavior.
In order to synthesize accurate time-series, we tackle this problem from a numerical point-of-view,
and start by proposing a dedicated solver designed for dealing with the underlying stiffness, in
particular, the retarded time and the discontinuity at the location of the heat source. Stability
analysis is performed on the limit of low-amplitude disturbances by means of the projection method
proposed by Jarlebring (2008), which alleviates the linearization with respect to the retarded
time. The results are then compared to the analytical solution of the undamped system, and to Galerkin
projection methods commonly used in this setting. This analysis provides insight into the consequences
of the various assumptions and simplifications that justify the use of Galerkin expansions based
on the eigenmodes of the unheated resonator. We illustrate that due to the presence of a discontinuity
in the spatial domain, the eigenmodes in the heated case, predicted by using Galerkin expansion,
show spurious oscillations resulting from the Gibbs phenomenon. By comparing the modes of the linear
to that of the nonlinear regime, we are able to illustrate the mean-flow modulation and frequency
switching. Finally, time-series in the fully nonlinear regime, where a limit cycle is established,
are analyzed and dominant modes are extracted. The analysis of the saturated limit cycles shows
the presence of higher frequency modes, which are linearly stable but become significant through
nonlinear growth of the signal. This bimodal effect is not captured when the coupling between different
frequencies is not accounted for.
