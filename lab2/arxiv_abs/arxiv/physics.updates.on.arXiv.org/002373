Using GILD and GL no scattering modeling and inversion, we find a class of the nonzero solution of
the zero scattering nonlinear inversion equation and use it to create our GLHUA cloak with relative
EM parameter not less than 1 for each layer with any thickness. major new ingredients are: (1) In the
outer layer, R1 < r < R2, the relative radial electric permittivity and radial magnetic permeability
equal to 1; the relative angular electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are equal to 0.5((H/C)^(Alpha)+(C/H)^(Alpha)),C=R2-R1,
H= r-R1; (2) In the inner layer cloak R0 < r < R1 , the relative radial electric permittivity and radial
magnetic permeability equal to 1; the relative angular electric permittivity and magnetic permeability
are equal to 0.5((H/C)(R0/r))^(Alpha)+((C/H)(r/R0))^(Alpha)),C=R1-R0, H= R1-r; (3) The phase
velocity of wave in GLHUA cloak is less than light speed and tends to zero at r=R1;(4) We proved that
GLHUA cloak is complete invisible cloak with concealment; in GLHUA cloak, the EM wave field is going
to zero at r=R1. The incident wave excited in outside of GLHUA cloak can not be disturbed by cloak,
and the wave can not propagation penetrate into the concealment; (5) The incident wave excited in
concealment can not propagation to go to outside of the cloak, the incident wave can not be disturbed
in the concealment.(6) The idea and no scattering modeling and inversion and practicable GLHUA
cloak are new invisible natural science attract more researcher's effort. In my [33].we discover
negative space, in which sphere radial R is negative. We found an exact full EM wave propagation solution
of the EM equation in the GLHUA double layer invisible cloak, which is breakthrough progress. Analytical
EM wave propagation in GLHUA cloak is published in this version. We create a novel sphere radial transformation
from negative infinite to R_1 sphere radial transformation.
