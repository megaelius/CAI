Non-ionising energy loss of radiation produces point defects and defect clusters in silicon, which
result in a signifcant degradation of sensor performance. In this contribution results from TSC
(Thermally Stimulated Current) defect spectroscopy for silicon pad diodes irradiated by electrons
to fluences of a few $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and energies between 3.5 and 27 MeV for isochronal annealing
between 80 and 280{\deg}C, are presented. A method based on SRH (Shockley-Read-Hall) statistics
is introduced, which assumes that the ionisation energy of the defects in a cluster depends on the
fraction of occupied traps. The dfference of ionisation energy of an isolated point defect and a
fully occupied cluster, $\Delta E_a$, is extracted from the TSC data. For the VOi (vacancy-oxygen
interstitial) defect $\Delta E_a = 0$ is found, which cofirms that it is a point defect, and validates
the method for point defects. For clusters made of deep acceptors the $\Delta E_a$ values for different
defects are determined after annealing at 80{\deg}C as a function of electron energy, and for the
irradiation with 15 MeV electrons as a function of annealing temperature. For the irradiation with
3.5 MeV electrons the value $\Delta E_a = 0$ is found, whereas for the electron energies of 6 to 27 MeV
$\Delta E_a > 0$. This agrees with the expected threshold of about 5 MeV for cluster formation by electrons.
The $\Delta E_a$ values determined as a function of annealing temperature show that the annealing
rate is different for different defects. A naive diffusion model is used to estimate the temperature
dependencies of the diffusion of the defects in the clusters.
