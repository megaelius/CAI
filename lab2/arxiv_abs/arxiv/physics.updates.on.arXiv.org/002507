Deep understanding of plasmonic nanoparticles (PNPs)-light interaction over semiconductors
surface shows great promises in enhancing their optoelectronic devices efficiency beyond the
conventional limit. However, PNP-light interaction critically decided by the distribution density
of PNPs over the semiconductor surface which is not entirely understood. Here, a systematic study
depicting how the interparticle gap between Silver (Ag) NPs influences the performance of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3
based solar-blind photodetector. Interestingly, a remarkable transition is observed, where
the varied interparticle gap not only changes the polarity but also reverses the traditional photodetector
behaviour. The positive transient response of bare \b{eta}-Ga2O3 photodetector with feeble DUV
light switches its behaviour remarkably to 20 times enhance negative-photoresponse when decorated
by sparsely-spaced Ag-PNPs with ultra-high responsivity of 107.47 A/W at moderate power and an
incredible report-highest responsivity of 4.29 mA/W on single semiconducting \b{eta}-Ga2O3
layer at self-powered mode. Moreover, as the density of the Ag-PNPs was further increased, the photocurrent
decreases with illumination which dynamically reverses the traditional photodetector to unnatural
anomalous effect. In particular, our study represents the first demonstration of plasmonic tuning
effect to two active dynamic switching modes; i.e. reverse switchable and anomalous behaviour,
the fundamentals of which have not studied experimentally yet. Finally, we propose a unified well-explained
model to rationalize all observed experimental trends while set-up fundamental basis for establishing
potential applications.
