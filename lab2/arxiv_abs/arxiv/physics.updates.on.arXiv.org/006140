Droplets abound in nature and technology. In general, they are multicomponent, and, when out of
equilibrium, with gradients in concentration, implying flow and mass transport. Moreover, phase
transitions can occur, with either evaporation, solidification, dissolution, or nucleation
of a new phase. The droplets and their surrounding liquid can be binary, ternary, or contain even
more components, and with several even in different phases. In the last two decades the rapid advances
in experimental and numerical fluid dynamical techniques has enabled major progress in our understanding
of the physicochemical hydrodynamics of such droplets, further narrowing the gap from fluid dynamics
to chemical engineering and colloid & interfacial science and arriving at a quantitative understanding
of multicomponent and multiphase droplet systems far from equilibrium, and aiming towards a one-to-one
comparison between experiments and theory or numerics. This review will discuss various examples
of the physicochemical hydrodynamics of droplet systems far from equilibrium and our present understanding
of them. These include immiscible droplets in a concentration gradient, coalescence of droplets
of different liquids, droplets in concentration gradients emerging from chemical reactions (including
droplets as microswimmers) and phase transitions such as evaporation, solidification, dissolution,
or nucleation, and droplets in ternary liquids, including solvent exchange, nano-precipitation,
and the so-called ouzo effect. We will also discuss the relevance of the physicochemical hydrodynamics
of such droplet systems for many important applications, including in chemical analysis and diagnostics,
microanalysis, pharmaceutics, synthetic chemistry and biology, chemical and environmental
engineering, the oil and remediation industries, inkjet-printing, for micro- and nano-materials,
and in nanotechnolgoy.
