We revisit the problem of how energy transfer through the turbulent cascade operates in compressible
hydrodynamic turbulence. In general, there is no conservative compressible cascade since the
kinetic and internal energy reservoirs can exchange energy through pressure dilatation. Moreover,
statistically stationary turbulence at high Mach number can only be maintained in nearly isothermal
gas, i.e. if excess heat produced by shock compression and kinetic energy dissipation is continuously
removed from the system. We mimic this process by a linear cooling term in numerical simulations
of turbulence driven by stochastic forcing. This allows us to investigate turbulence statistics
for a broad range of Mach numbers. We compute the rate of change of kinetic and internal energy in wavenumber
shells caused by advective, compressive, and pressure dilatation effects and constrain power-law
fits to compressible turbulence energy spectra to a range of wavenumbers in which the total energy
transfer is close to zero. The resulting scaling exponents are significantly affected by the forcing.
Depending on the root mean square Mach number, we find a nearly constant advective component of the
cross-scale flux of kinetic energy at intermediate wavenumbers for particular mixtures of solenoidal
and compressive modes in the forcing. This suggests the existence of a natural, Mach number dependent
mixture of forcing modes. Our findings also support an advection-dominated regime at high Mach
numbers with specific scaling exponents (Burgers scaling for the pure velocity fluctuation $u$
and Kolmogorov scaling for the mass-weighted variable $v=\rho^{1/3}u$)
