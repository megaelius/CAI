The influence of the ambient pressure on the breakup process is investigated by means of PIV and shadowgraphy
in the configuration of a planar prefilming airblast atomizer. Other investigated parameters
are the gas velocity and the film loading. It is found that the gas velocity in the vicinity of the prefilmer
partly matches the analytical profile from the near-wake theory. The shadowgraphy images of the
liquid phase allow to extract characteristic quantities of the liquid accumulation at the atomizing
edge. Two different characteristic lengths, the ligament velocity and a breakup frequency are
determined. In addition, the spray Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) and the mean droplet velocity are
given for each operating point. A scaling law of these quantities with regard to ambient pressure
is derived. A correlation is observed between the characteristic length of the accumulation and
the SMD, thus promoting the idea that the liquid accumulation determines the primary spray characteristics.
An threshold to distinguish the zones between primary and secondary breakup is proposed based on
an objective criterion. It is also shown that taking non-spherical droplets into account significantly
modifies the shape of the dropsize distribution, thus stressing the need to use shadowgraphy when
investigating primary breakup. The ambient pressure and the velocity are varied accordingly to
keep the aerodynamic stress $\rho_g U_g^2$ constant. This leads to almost identical liquid accumulation
and spray characteristics, confirming that the aerodynamic stress is a key parameter to characterize
prefilming airblast breakup. Finally, SMD correlations from the literature are compared to the
present experiment. Most of the correlations calibrated with LDA/LDT measurement underestimate
the SMD. This highlights the need to use shadrowgraphy for calibrating primary breakup models.
