Helium (He) nanodroplets irradiated by intense near-infrared laser pulses form a nanoplasma by
avalanche-like electron impact ionizations even at lower laser intensities where He is not directly
field ionized, provided that the droplets contain a few dopant atoms which provide seed electrons
for the electron impact ionization avalanche. In this theoretical paper on calcium and xenon doped
He droplets we elucidate the mechanism which induces ionization avalanches, termed ignition.
We find that the partial loss of seed electrons from the activated droplets starkly assists ignition,
as the Coulomb barrier for ionization of helium is lowered by the electric field of the dopant cations,
and this deshielding of the cation charges enhances their electric field. In addition, the dopant
ions assist the acceleration of the seed electrons (slingshot effect) by the laser field, supporting
electron impact ionizations of He and also causing electron loss by catapulting electrons away.
The dopants' ability to lower the Coulomb barriers at He as well as the slingshot effect decrease
with the spatial expansion of the dopant, causing a dependence of the dopants' ignition capability
on the dopant mass. Here, we develop criteria (impact count functions) to assess the ignition capability
of dopants, based on (i) the spatial overlap of the seed electron cloud with the He atoms and (ii) the
overlap of their kinetic energy distribution with the distribution of Coulomb barrier heights
at He. The relatively long time delays between the instants of dopant ionization and ignition (incubation
times) for calcium doped droplets are determined to a large extent by the time it takes to deshield
the dopant ions.
