We present the proton and neutron vector form factors in a convenient parametric form that is optimized
for momentum transfers $\lesssim$ few GeV$^2$. The form factors are determined from a global fit
to electron scattering data and precise charge radius measurements. A new treatment of radiative
corrections is applied. This parametric representation of the form factors, uncertainties and
correlations provides an efficient means to evaluate many derived observables. We consider two
classes of illustrative examples: first, neutrino-nucleon scattering cross sections at GeV energies
for neutrino oscillation experiments; second, nucleon structure corrections for atomic spectroscopy.
The neutrino-nucleon charged current quasielastic (CCQE) cross section differs by 3-5% compared
to commonly-used form factor models when the vector form factors are constrained by recent high-statistics
electron-proton scattering data from the A1 collaboration. Nucleon structure parameter determinations
include: the magnetic and Zemach radii of the proton and neutron, $[r_M^p, r_M^n] = [0.739(41)(23),
0.776(53)(28)]$ fm and $[r_Z^p, r_Z^n] = [ 1.0227(94)(51), -0.0445(14)(3)]$ fm, with the dominant
uncertainty propagating from the experimental data and radiative corrections, and the second
error due to the fitting procedure; the Friar radius of nucleons, $[(r^p_F)^3, (r^n_F)^3] = [ 2.246(58)(2),
0.0093(6)(1)]\,{\rm fm}^3$; the electric curvatures, $[\langle r^4 \rangle^p_E, \langle r^4
\rangle^n_E ] = [1.08(28)(5), -0.33(24)(3)]~{\rm fm}^4$; and bounds on the magnetic curvatures,
$[ \langle r^4 \rangle^p_M, \langle r^4 \rangle^n_M ] = [ -2.0(1.7)(0.8), -2.3(2.1)(1.1)]~{\rm
fm}^4$.
