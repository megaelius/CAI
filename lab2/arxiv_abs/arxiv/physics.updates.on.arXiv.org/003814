Tipping points occur in a lot of systems in various disciplines such as ecology, climate science,
economy or engineering. Tipping points are critical thresholds in system parameters or state variables
at which a tiny perturbation can lead to a qualitative change of the system. Many systems with tipping
points can be modeled as networks of coupled multistable subsystems, e.g. coupled patches of vegetation,
connected lakes, interacting climate tipping elements or multiscale infrastructure systems.
In such networks, tipping events in one subsystem are able to induce tipping cascades via domino
effects. Here, we investigate the effects of network topology on the occurrence of such cascades.
Numerical cascade simulations with a conceptual dynamical model for tipping points are conducted
on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Watts-Strogatz and Barab\'asi-Albert networks. We find that clustered
and spatially organized networks increase the vulnerability of networks and can lead to tipping
of the whole network. This effect is only present in dynamical models of tipping interactions and
is not captured by threshold models of contagion processes. We highlight how this result for global
properties of the network can be linked to small-scale motifs such as feedback loops and feed-forward
loops. Additionally, the model is applied to a network generated from moisture-recycling simulations
of the Amazon rainforest and results of cascade simulations are compared to those from the model
networks. Consistently, we observe that the spatially structured moisture-recycling network
is more vulnerable to tipping cascades than more disordered random network topologies. These results
could be useful to evaluate which systems are vulnerable or resilient due to their network topology
and might help to design systems accordingly.
