Objectives: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors
with poor prognosis in adults. The purpose of this study is to develop a machine-learning based classification
method using radio-mic features of multi-parametric MRI to classify high-grade gliomas (HGG)
and low-grade gliomas (LGG). Methods: Multi-parametric MRI of 80 patients, 40 HGG and 40 LGG, with
gliomas from the MICCAI BRATs 2015 training database were used in this study. Each patient's T1,
contrast-enhanced T1, T2, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRIs as well as the tumor
contours were provided in the database. Using the given contours, radiomic features from all four
multi-parametric MRIs were extracted. Of these features, a feature selection process using two-sample
T-test and least absolute shrinkage, selection operator (LASSO), and a feature correlation threshold
was applied to various combinations of T1, contrast-enhanced T1, T2, and FLAIR MRIs separately.
These selected features were then used to train, test, and cross-validate a random forest to differentiate
HGG and LGG. Finally, the classification accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate
the classification method. Results: Optimized parameters showed that on average, the overall
accuracy of our classification method was 0.913 or 73 out of 80 correct classifications, 36/40 for
HGG and 37/40 for LGG, with an AUC of 0.956 based on the combination with FLAIR, T1, T1c and T2 MRIs.
Conclusion: This study shows that radio-mic features derived from multi-parametric MRI could
be used to accurately classify high and lower grade gliomas. The radio-mic features from multi-parametric
MRI in combination with even more advanced machine learning methods may further elucidate the underlying
tumor biology and response to therapy.
