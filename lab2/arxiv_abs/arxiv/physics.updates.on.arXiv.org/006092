The unprecedented cessation of human activities during the COVID-19 pandemic has affected global
energy use and CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use and cement production. Here we show that the decrease
in global fossil CO2 emissions during the first quarter of 2020 was of 5.8% (542 Mt CO2 with a 20% 1-{\sigma}
uncertainty). Unlike other emerging estimates, ours show the temporal dynamics of emissions based
on actual emissions data from power generation (for 29 countries) and industry (for 73 countries),
on near real time activity data for road transportation (for 132 countries), aviation and maritime
transportation, and on heating degree days for commercial and residential sectors emissions (for
206 countries). These dynamic estimates cover all of the human induced CO2 emissions from fossil
fuel combustion and cement production. The largest share of COVID-related decreases in emissions
are due to decreases in industry (157.9 Mt CO2, -7.1% compared to 2019), followed by road transportation
(145.7 Mt CO2, -8.3%), power generation (131.6 Mt CO2, -3.8%), residential (47.8 Mt CO2, -3.6%),
fishing and maritime transport (35.5Mt CO2, -13.3%) and aviation (33.4 Mt CO2, -8.0%). Regionally,
decreases in emissions from China were the largest and earliest (-10.3%), followed by Europe (EU-27
& UK) (-4.3%) and the U.S. (-4.2%). Relative decreases of regional CO2 emissions are consistent
with regional nitrogen oxides concentrations observed by satellites and ground-based networks.
Despite the unprecedented decreases in CO2 emissions and comparable decreases in economic activities,
we monitored decreases in the carbon intensity (Emission per unit of GDP) in China (3.5%), the U.S.
(4.5%) and Europe (5.4%) over the first quarter, suggesting that carbon-intensive activities
have been disproportionally impacted.
