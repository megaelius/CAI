Nuclear diagnostics provide essential measurements used to infer plasma properties, such as the
ion temperature, areal density and shape of the hotspot and cold fuel, in inertial confinement fusion
experiments during stagnation. A suite of synthetic nuclear diagnostics has been developed to
post-process radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations performed with the code Chimera. These
provide experimental observables based on simulated capsule properties and can be used to assess
alternative experimental and data analysis techniques. These diagnostics include neutron spectroscopy,
primary and scattered neutron imaging, neutron activation, {\gamma}-ray time histories and carbon
{\gamma}-ray imaging. Novel features of the neutron spectrum have been analysed to infer additional
plasma parameters. The nT and nD backscatter edges have been shown to provide an ion temperature
and bulk velocity measurement. Areal density asymmetries created by low mode perturbations have
been inferred from the slope of the downscatter spectrum down to 10 MeV. The fluence compensation
technique has been applied with multiple energy gates along the same line of sight. Each energy range
is related to a range of scattering angles and hence these images probe different parts of the shell.
Synthetic neutron activation diagnostics showed significant aliasing of high mode areal density
asymmetries when observing a capsule implosion with 3D multimode perturbations applied. Carbon
{\gamma}-ray imaging was used to image the ablator at high convergence ratio. Spikes of ablator,
which would pose a considerable threat to the performance of the capsule, were visible. Time histories
of both the fusion and carbon {\gamma} signals showed a greater time difference in peak intensity
compared to a symmetric simulation. This difference was attributed to increased neutron fluence
on ablator spikes approaching the hotspot late in time.
