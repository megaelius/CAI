We present a fractional model to clarify the dynamical evolution of how and under what circumstances--in
a multi-agent economic area--newly founded ventures prolong their existence throughout the market.
Since the increase in the number of newly-established firms in a market may generally lead to the
reduction of the market share of players in the contest, after a while some may be faded out in the market.
In this regard, considering a long term evolution, all firms are exposed to be eliminated and to give
up their market share. That is why managers have the concern of attracting more customers to satisfy
at least a minimum market share, and ideally prolong their firm's lifetime. On the other side, due
to the establishment of more newly founded ventures in a certain industry, it is vital to be flexible
and run new strategies. The triggered strategies not only must be on time but also must be led to lengthening
the additional survival time. In the present study, it is shown that the existence of memory or lack
of memory in the evolution may not be the case, but also having a strategy plays a significant role
in survival. Hence, in spite of expo-sure to the risk of missing market share, the recalling of the
past offered services and products of the weaker firm -- compared with the whole market -- may prolong
the time-length of surviving in the market. In this regard, managers corresponding to the weaker
firm will be able to quantitatively make decisions toward two main concepts, firstly the strategical
usage of their firms' reputation and secondly, launching new features and services. The aim behind
this optimization is to delay the time of reaching a minimum market share.
