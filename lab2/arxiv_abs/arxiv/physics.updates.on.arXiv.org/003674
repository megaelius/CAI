We outline the fundamental coherent radiation emission processes from a bunched charged particles
beam. In contrast to spontaneous emission of radiation from a random electron beam that is proportional
to the number of particles, a pre-bunched electron beam can emit spontaneously coherent radiation
proportional to the number of particles - squared, through the process of (spontaneous) superradiance
(SP-SR) (in the sense of Dicke's). The coherent SP-SR emission of a bunched electron beam can be even
further enhanced by a process of stimulated-superradiance (ST-SR) in the presence of a seed injected
radiation field. In this review, these coherent radiation emission processes for both single bunch
and periodically bunched beams are considered in a model of radiation mode expansion. The general
model of coherent spontaneous emission is extended to the nonlinear regime, particularly for undulator
(wiggler) interaction: Tapering-Enhanced Stimulated Superradiant Amplification (TESSA).
Processes of SP-SR and TESSA take place in tapered wiggler seed-injected FELs. In such FELs, operating
in the X-Ray regime, these processes are convoluted with other effects. However these fundamental
emission concepts are useful guidelines for the strategy of wiggler tapering efficiency and power
enhancement. Based on this model, we review previous theories and experiments on coherent radiation
sources based on SP-SR (coherent undulator radiation, synchrotron radiation, Smith-Purcell
radiation etc.), in the THz regime and on-going works on tapered wiggler efficiency-enhancement
concepts in all optical frequency regimes up to X-Rays.
