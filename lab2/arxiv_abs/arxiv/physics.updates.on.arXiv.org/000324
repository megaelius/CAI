We analytically calculate some orbital effects induced by the Lorentz-invariance/momentum-conservation
PPN parameter $\alpha_3$ in a gravitationally bound binary system made of a compact primary orbited
by a test particle. We neither restrict ourselves to any particular orbital configuration nor to
specific orientations of the primary's spin axis $\boldsymbol{\hat{\psi}}$. We use our results
to put preliminary upper bounds on $\alpha_3$ in the weak-field regime by using the latest data from
Solar System's planetary dynamics. By linearly combining the supplementary perihelion precessions
$\Delta\dot\varpi$ of the Earth, Mars and Saturn, determined with the EPM2011 ephemerides, we
infer $|\alpha_3|\lesssim 6\times 10^{-10}$. Our result is about 3 orders of magnitude better
than the previous weak-field constraints existing in the literature, and of the same order of magnitude
of the bound expected from the future BepiColombo mission to Mercury. It is, by construction, independent
of the other preferred-frame PPN parameters $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$, both preliminarily constrained
down to a $\approx 10^{-6}$ level. The wide pulsar-white dwarf binary PSR J0407+1607 yields a preliminary
upper bound on the strong-field version $\hat{\alpha}_3$ of the Lorentz-invariance/momentum-conservation
PPN parameter of the order of $3\times 10^{-17}$. It relies upon certain assumptions on the unknown
values of the pulsar's spin axis orientation $\boldsymbol{\hat{\psi}}$, the orbital node $\Omega$
and the inclination $I$. Neither the pulsar's proper motion, still undetected, nor a possible value
of the pulsar's mass $m_{\rm p}$ up to two solar masses substantially affect our result.
