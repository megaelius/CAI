In numerical investigations of stringent problems in science and engineering research, non-physical
negative density or pressure may emerge and cause blow-ups of the computation. We build on the realization
that the positivity of density and pressure can be preserved in an efficient way of exploiting the
advantage of discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume (DG/FV) hybrid computation framework.
We thus present an effective and simple method with great practical significance to maintain the
positivity of density and pressure in solving the reactive Euler equations. The approach is able
to maximize the multiscale capability of the DG method by achieving both positivity-preserving
and oscillation-free solution in the subgrid level. In the designed scheme, a priori detection
and computation with hyperbolic tangent function prevent the occurrence of negativity in the flux
evaluation, while a posteriori detection and computation with the first-order Godunov scheme
guarantee the positivity of subcell solution. The a priori computation achieves bounded reconstruction
and less oscillatory solution so that the a posteriori computation can be active in few cells where
the extremely complex computation condition appears. Furthermore, the valuable information
from the reconstruction process is utilized to design the indication strategy that identifies
the DG and FV cells, and the technique of adaptively choosing reconstruction candidates is adopted
to overcome the excessive numerical dissipation in the shock-capturing scheme. Numerical tests,
including demanding examples in stiff detonation simulation, demonstrate the positivity-preserving,
non-oscillatory and subcell resolution property of the present method.
