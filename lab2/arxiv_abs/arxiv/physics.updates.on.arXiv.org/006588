Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) encountered the primary low-latitude magnetopause reconnection
site when the inter-spacecraft separation exceeded the upstream ion inertial length. Classical
signatures of the ion diffusion region (IDR), including a sub-ion-Alfv\'enic de-magnetized ion
exhaust, a super-ion-Alfv\'enic magnetized electron exhaust, and Hall electromagnetic fields,
are identified. The opening angle between the magnetopause and magnetospheric separatrix is $30^\circ\pm5^\circ$.
The exhaust preferentially expands sunward, displacing the magnetosheath. Intense pileup of
reconnected magnetic flux occurs between the magnetosheath separatrix and the magnetopause in
a narrow channel intermediate between the ion and electron scales. The strength of the pileup (normalized
values of 0.3-0.5) is consistent with the large angle at which the magnetopause is inclined relative
to the overall reconnection coordinates. MMS-4, which was two ion inertial lengths closer to the
X-line than the other three spacecraft, observed intense electron-dominated currents and kinetic-to-electromagnetic-field
energy conversion within the pileup. MMS-1, 2, and 3 did not observe the intense currents nor the
particle-to-field energy conversion but did observe the pileup, indicating that the edge of the
generation region was contained within the tetrahedron. Comparisons with particle-in-cell simulations
reveal that the electron currents and large inclination angle of the magnetopause are interconnected
features of the asymmetric Hall effect. Between the separatrix and the magnetopause, high-density
inflowing magnetosheath electrons brake and turn into the outflow direction, imparting energy
to the normal magnetic field and generating the pileup. The findings indicate that electron dynamics
are likely an important influence on the magnetic field structure within the ion diffusion region.
