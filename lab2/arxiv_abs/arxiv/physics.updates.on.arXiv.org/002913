Explaining how and why some species evolved to have more complex social structures than others has
been a long-term goal for many researchers in animal behavior because it would provide important
insight into the links between evolution and ecology, sociality, and cognition. However, despite
long-standing interest, the evolution of social complexity is still poorly understood. This may
be due in part to a focus more on the feasibility of quantifying aspects of sociality and less consideration
for what features of complexity these measures can detect. Any given approach to studying complexity
can tell us some things about animal sociality, but may miss others, so it is critical to decide first
how to approach conceptualizing complexity before jumping in to quantifying it. Here, we highlight
four fundamental concepts that are commonly used in the field of complex systems: (1) micro and macro
scales of organization, (2) compression and coarse-graining, (3) emergent macro-level patterns,
and (4) downward causation from macro to micro scales. These are particularly applicable to animal
social systems, but are not often explicitly addressed. We summarize these concepts and then show
how they can provide a rigorous foundation for conceptualizing social complexity. Using these
concepts, we re-examine several existing animal social complexity approaches and show how each
relates to these fundamental concepts. Ultimately, researchers need to critically evaluate any
measure of animal social complexity in order to balance the biological relevance of the aspect of
sociality they are quantifying with the feasibility of obtaining enough data.
