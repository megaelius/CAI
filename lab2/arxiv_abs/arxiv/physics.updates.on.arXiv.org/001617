Aims: The arrhythmogenic role of atrial complex morphology such as left atrial appendage (LAA)
has not yet been clearly elucidated. We hypothesized that bumpy tissue geometry can induce action
potential duration (APD) dispersion and wavebreak in atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods: We simulated
2D-bumpy atrial model by varying the degree of bumpiness and 3D-left atrial (LA) model of 14 patients
with persistent AF. Additionally, in 30 patients with persistent AF, we analyzed curvature map
of LA geometry, and complex fractionated atrial electrogram-cycle length (CFAE-CL), Shannon
entropy (ShEn), and approximate entropy (ApEn) of bipolar electrogram. Results: In 2D-bumpy model,
APD dispersion increased with increasing surface bumpiness (p<0.001), and wavebreak occurred
spontaneously when the surface bumpiness was higher, showing phase transition-like behavior
(p<0.001). Additionally, 2D-bumpy model with bumpiness gradient showed that spiral wave drifted
in the direction of higher bumpiness, and phase singularity (PS) points were mostly located in areas
with higher bumpiness. In 3D-LA model, PS density was higher in LAA compared to other LA parts (p<0.05).
In 30 persistent AF patients, the surface bumpiness of LAA was 5.8-times that of other LA parts (p<0.001),
and exceeded critical bumpiness to induce wavebreak. Also, all clinical wave dynamics parameters
of bipolar electrogram were significantly dominant in LAA (p<0.001). Conclusion: The bumpy tissue
geometry promotes APD dispersion, wavebreak, and spiral wave drift in in-silico human atrial tissue.
Both simulation results and dominant clinical wave dynamics parameters in LAA imply that LAA is
an arrhythmogenic bumpy structure in AF.
