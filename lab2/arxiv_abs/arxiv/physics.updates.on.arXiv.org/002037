This paper presents a comprehensive optimisation study to maximise the light collection efficiency
of scintillating cube elements used in the SoLid detector. Very short baseline reactor experiments,
like SoLid, look for active to sterile neutrino oscillation signatures in the anti-neutrino energy
spectrum as a function of the distance to the core and energy. Performing a precise search requires
high light yield of the scintillating elements and uniformity of the response in the detector volume.
The SoLid experiment uses an innovative hybrid technology with two different scintillators: polyvinyltoluene
scintillator cubes and $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) screens. A precision test bench based on a $^{207}$Bi calibration
source has been developed to study improvements on the energy resolution and uniformity of the prompt
scintillation signal of antineutrino interactions. A trigger system selecting the 1~MeV conversion
electrons provides a Gaussian energy peak and allows for precise comparisons of the different detector
configurations that were considered to improve the SoLid detector light collection. The light
collection efficiency is influenced by the choice of wrapping material, the position of the $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag)
screen, the type of fibre, the number of optical fibres and the type of mirror at the end of the fibre.
This study shows that large gains in light collection efficiency are possible compared to the SoLid
SM1 prototype. The light yield for the SoLid detector is expected to be at least 52$\pm$2 photo-avalanches
per MeV per cube, with a relative non-uniformity of 6 %, demonstrating that the required energy resolution
of at least 14 % at 1 MeV can be achieved.
