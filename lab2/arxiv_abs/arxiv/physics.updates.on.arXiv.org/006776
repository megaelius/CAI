Lagrangian stochastic models are widely used to predict and analyze turbulent dispersion in complex
environments, such as in various terrestrial and marine canopy flows. However, due to a lack of empirical
data, it is still not understood how particular features of highly inhomogeneous canopy flows affect
the Lagrangian statistics. In this work, we study Lagrangian short time statistics by analyzing
empirical Lagrangian trajectories in sub-volumes of space that are small in comparison with the
canopy height. For the analysis we used 3D Lagrangian trajectories measured in a dense canopy flow
model in a wind-tunnel, using an extended version of real-time 3D particle tracking velocimetry
(3D-PTV). One of our key results is that the random turbulent fluctuations due to the intense dissipation
were more dominant than the flow's inhomogeneity in affecting the short-time Lagrangian statistics.
This amounts to a so-called quasi-homogeneous regime of Lagrangian statistics at small scales.
Using the Lagrangian dataset we calculate the Lagrangian autocorrelation function and the second-order
Lagrangian structure-function, and extract associated parameters, namely a Lagrangian velocity
decorrelation timescale, $T_i$, and the Kolmogorov constant, $C_0$. We demonstrate that in the
quasi-homogeneous regime, both these functions are well represented using a second-order Lagrangian
stochastic model that was designed for homogeneous flows. Furthermore, we show that the spatial
variations of the Lagrangian separation of scales, $T_i/\tau_\eta$, and the Kolmogorov constant,
$C_0$, cannot be explained by the variation of the Reynolds number, $Re_\lambda$, in space, and
that $T_i/\tau_\eta$ was small as compared with homogeneous turbulence predictions at similar
$Re_\lambda$. We thus hypothesize that this occurred due to the so-called "wake production", and
show empirical results supporting our hypothesis.
