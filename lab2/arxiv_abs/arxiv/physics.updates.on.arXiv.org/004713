We investigate the sensitivity of reduced order models (ROMs) to training data resolution as well
as sampling rate. In particular, we consider proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), coupled with
Galerkin projection (POD-GP), as an intrusive reduced order modeling technique. For non-intrusive
ROMs, we consider two frameworks. The first is using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), and the second
is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). For ANN, we utilized a residual deep neural network,
and for DMD we have studied two versions of DMD approaches; one with hard thresholding and the other
with sorted bases selection. Also, we highlight the differences between mean-subtracting the
data (i.e., centering) and using the data without mean-subtraction. We tested these ROMs using
a system of 2D shallow water equations for four different numerical experiments, adopting combinations
of sampling rates and resolutions. For these cases, we found that the DMD basis obtained with hard
threshodling is sensitive to sampling rate, performing worse at very high rates. The sorted DMD
algorithm helps to mitigate this problem and yields more stabilized and converging solution. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that both DMD approaches with mean subtraction provide significantly more accurate
results than DMD with mean-subtracting the data. On the other hand, POD is relatively insensitive
to sampling rate and yields better representation of the flow field. Meanwhile, resolution has
little effect on both POD and DMD performances. Therefore, we preferred to train the neural network
in POD space, since it is more stable and better represents our dataset. Numerical results reveal
that an artificial neural network on POD subspace (POD-ANN) performs remarkably better than POD-GP
and DMD in capturing system dynamics, even with a small number of modes.
