Topology transcends boundaries that conventionally delineate physical, biological and engineering
sciences. Our ability to mathematically describe topology, combined with our access to precision
tracking and manipulation approaches, has triggered a fresh appreciation of topological ramifications,
specifically in mediating key functions in biological systems spanning orders of magnitude in
length and time scales. Microbial ecosystems, a frequently encountered example of living matter,
offer a rich test bed where the role of topological defects and their mechanics can be explored in
the context of microbial composition, structure and functions. Emergent processes, triggered
by anisotropy and activity characteristic of such structured, out-of-equilibrium systems, underpin
fundamental properties in microbial systems. An inevitable consequence of anisotropy is the long-range
orientational (or positional) correlations, which give rise to topological defects nucleating
due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The scene stealer of this emerging cross-disciplinary field
is the topological defects: singularities embedded within the material field that elicit novel,
if not unexpected, dynamics that are at the heart of active processes underpinning soft and living
matter systems. In this short review, I have put together a summary of the key recent advances that
highlight the interface of liquid crystal physics and the physical ecology of microbes; and combined
it with original experimental data on sessile species as a case to demonstrate how this interface
offers a biophysical framework that could help to decode and harness active microbial processes
in 'true' ecological settings. Topology and its functional manifestations - a crucial and well-timed
topic - offer a rich opportunity for both experimentalists and theoreticians willing to take up
an exciting journey across scales and disciplines.
