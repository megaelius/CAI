Any type of non-buoyant material in the ocean is transported horizontally by currents during its
sinking journey. This lateral transport can be far from negligible for small sinking velocities.
To estimate its magnitude and direction, the material is often modelled as a set of Lagrangian particles
advected by current velocities that are obtained from Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs).
State-of-the-art OGCMs are strongly eddying, providing results with a spatial resolution in the
order of 10 km on a daily frequency. Many long term climate modelling simulations (e.g. in paleoclimate)
rely on lower spatial resolution models that do not capture mesoscale features. It remains unclear
how much the absence of mesoscale features in low-resolution models influences the Lagrangian
particle transport. In this study, we simulate the transport of sinking Lagrangian particles using
low- and high-resolution OGCMs, and assess the lateral transport differences resulting from the
difference in spatial and temporal model resolution. We find major differences between the transport
in the non-eddying OGCM and in the eddying OGCM. Addition of stochastic noise to the particle trajectories
in the non-eddying OGCM parameterises the effect of eddies well in some cases (e.g. in the North Pacific
gyre). The effect of a coarser temporal resolution (5-daily versus monthly) is smaller compared
to a coarser spatial resolution (0.1$^{\circ}$ versus 1$^{\circ}$ horizontally). We recommend
to apply sinking Lagrangian particles only with velocity fields from eddying OGCMs, requiring
high-resolution models in e.g. paleoceanographic studies. To increase the accessibility of our
particle trace simulations, we launch planktondrift.science.uu.nl, an online tool to reconstruct
the surface origin of sedimentary particles in a specific location.
