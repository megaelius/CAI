Magnetic clouds (MCs) are large-scale interplanetary transient structures in the heliosphere
that travel from the Sun into the interplanetary medium. The internal magnetic field lines inside
the MCs are twisted, forming a flux rope (FR). This magnetic field structuring is determined by its
initial solar configuration, by the processes involved during its eruption from the Sun, and by
the dynamical evolution during its interaction with the ambient solar wind. One of the most important
properties of the magnetic structure inside MCs is the twist of the field lines forming the FR (the
number of turns per unit length). The detailed internal distribution of twist is under debate mainly
because the magnetic field (B) in MCs is observed only along the spacecraft trajectory, and thus
it is necessary to complete observations with theoretical assumptions. Estimating the twist from
the study of a single event is difficult because the field fluctuations significantly increase
the noise of the observed B time series and thus the bias of the deduced twist. The superposed epoch
applied to MCs has proven to be a powerful technique, permitting the extraction of their common features,
and removing the peculiarity of individual cases. We apply a superposed epoch technique to analyse
the magnetic components in the local FR frame of a significant sample of moderately asymmetric MCs
observed at 1 au. From the superposed profile of B components in the FR frame, we determine the typical
twist distribution in MCs. The twist is nearly uniform in the FR core (central half part), and it increases
moderately, up to a factor two, towards the MC boundaries. This profile is close to the Lundquist
field model limited to the FR core where the axial field component is above about one-third of its
central value.
