Purpose: To present a closed formalism calculating charged particle radiation damage induced
in DNA, based on a simplified molecular model. The formalism is valid for all types of charged particles
and due to its closed nature is suited to provide fast conversion of dose to DNA-damage. Methods:
The induction of complex DNA--damaged is modelled using the standard scattering theory with a simplified
effective potential. This leads to a proposal to use the Breit-Wigner expression to model the probability
of the complex damage inelastic scatter as a function of kinetic energy of the scattered particle.
A microscopic phenomenological Monte Carlo code is used to predict the damage to a DNA molecule embedded
in a cell. The model is fit to the result of the simulation for four particles: electrons, protons,
alpha--particles, and Carbon ions. The model is then used to predict the damage in a cell as a function
of kinetic energy. Finally, a framework is proposed and implemented to provide data that can be assessed
experimentally, by predicting the relative biological effectiveness over the track of a pristine
proton beam. Results: The mathematical expression describes the model adequately using the relevant
statistical methodologies. This for all particle types with an almost perfect fit for protons,
while the other particles seem to provide some discrepancies at very low energies. The implementation
calculating a strict version of the RBE based on complex damage alone is corroborated by clinical
data. In two appendices, the model is applied and validated to provide clinical relevant data for
proton therapy and extended using predicting a variable upper limit of biological effectiveness
depending on the type of charged particle
