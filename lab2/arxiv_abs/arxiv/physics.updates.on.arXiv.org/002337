It is now almost clear that there is no meaningful internal symmetry higher than the one family GUTs
like as $SU(5)$, $SO(10)$, or $E(6)$ for classification of all observed quarks and leptons. Any
attempt to describe all three quark-lepton families in the GUT framework leads to higher symmetries
with enormously extended representations which contain lots of exotic states as well that never
been detected in an experiment. This may motivate us to continue seeking a solution in some subparticle
or preon models for quark and leptons just like as in the nineteen-sixties the spectroscopy of hadrons
had required to seek a solution in the quark model for hadrons. At that time, there was very popular
some concept invoked by Murray Gell-Mann and called the Eightfold Way according to which all low-lying
baryons and mesons are grouped into octets. We now find that this concept looks much more adequate
when it is applied to elementary preons and composite quarks and leptons. Remarkably, just the eight
left-handed and right-handed preons and their generic metaflavor symmetry $SU(8)$ may determine
the fundamental constituens of material world. This result for an admissible number of preons,
$N=8$, appears as a solution to the 't Hooft's anomaly matching condition provided that (1) this
condition is satisfied separately for the $L$-preon and $R$-preon composites and (2) these composites
fill only one multiplet of some $SU(N)$ symmetry group rather than a set of its multiplets. We next
show that a partial $L$-$R$ symmetry breaking reduces an initially emerged vectorlike $SU(8)$
theory down to the conventional $SU(5)$ GUT with an extra local family symmetry $SU(3)_{F}$ and
three standard generations of quarks and leptons.
