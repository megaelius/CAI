Simulating complex physical systems often involves solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
with some closures due to the presence of multi-scale physics that cannot be fully resolved. Therefore,
reliable and accurate closure models for unresolved physics remains an important requirement
for many computational physics problems, e.g., turbulence simulation. Recently, several researchers
have adopted generative adversarial networks (GANs), a novel paradigm of training machine learning
models, to generate solutions of PDEs-governed complex systems without having to numerically
solve these PDEs. However, GANs are known to be difficult in training and likely to converge to local
minima, where the generated samples do not capture the true statistics of the training data. In this
work, we present a statistical constrained generative adversarial network by enforcing constraints
of covariance from the training data, which results in an improved machine-learning-based emulator
to capture the statistics of the training data generated by solving fully resolved PDEs. We show
that such a statistical regularization leads to better performance compared to standard GANs,
measured by (1) the constrained model's ability to more faithfully emulate certain physical properties
of the system and (2) the significantly reduced (by up to 80%) training time to reach the solution.
We exemplify this approach on the Rayleigh-Benard convection, a turbulent flow system that is an
idealized model of the Earth's atmosphere. With the growth of high-fidelity simulation databases
of physical systems, this work suggests great potential for being an alternative to the explicit
modeling of closures or parameterizations for unresolved physics, which are known to be a major
source of uncertainty in simulating multi-scale physical systems, e.g., turbulence or Earth's
climate.
