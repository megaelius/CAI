Tensegrity structures are special architectures made by floating compressed struts kept together
by a continuous system of tensed cables. The multiplicity of shapes that tensegrity structures
can assume and their intrinsic capability to be deployable and assembled, so storing (and releasing)
elastic energy, have motivated their success as paradigm -pioneeringly proposed by Donald E. Ingber-
to explain some underlying mechanisms regulating dynamics of living cells. The interlaced structure
of the cell cytoskeleton, constituted by actin and intermediate filaments and microtubules which
continuously change their spatial organization and pre-stresses through polymerization/depolymerization,
seems to steer migration, adhesion and cell division by obeying the tensegrity construct. Even
though rough calculations lead to estimate discrepancies when comparing axial stiffness of actin
filaments and microtubules and recent works have shown bent microtubules, no one has yet tried to
remove the hypothesis of rigid struts in tensegrities when used to idealize the cytoskeleton mechanics.
With reference to the 30-element tensegrity cell paradigm, we introduce both compressibility
and bendability of the struts and rewrite the theory to take into account nonlinear elasticity of
both tendons and bars, so abandoning the classical linear stress-strain assumptions. By relaxing
the hypothesis of rigidity of the struts, we demonstrate that some quantitative confirmations
and many extreme and somehow counterintuitive mechanical behaviors actually exploited by cells
for storing/releasing energy, resisting to applied loads and deforming by modulating their overall
elasticity and shape through pre-stress changes and instability-guided configurational switching,
can be all theoretically found.
