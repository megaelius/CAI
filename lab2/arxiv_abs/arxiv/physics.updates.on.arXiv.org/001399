In two-dimensional flow, the vortex sheet corresponding to inviscid flow separation at a sharp
edge is generated by a vortex doublet, which arises as a result of representing the solid surfaces
as vortex doublet sheets. Namely, the inviscid limit of the attached boundary layer and its image
layer inside the surface comprise the doublet sheet. The sheet strength represents the amount of
circulation in the layer and the net strength of interacting layers at the sharp edge relates to the
shed circulation. This net strength is a global quantity that represents communication of flow
changes to the shedding point. The shedding of a vortex sheet is interpreted as the doublet sheet
being `torn apart,' such that one layer is the vortex sheet shed into the fluid and the other layer
is the image sheet. The unsteady Kutta condition is manifested by requiring that the strength of
the doublet induce a flow that instantaneously and mutually neutralizes itself with the singular
pressure gradient of the flow attempting to navigate around the sharp edge. The neutralization
of the pressure gradient is accomplished by the inviscid generation of vorticity at the edge and
is also the mechanism that tears apart the doublet. These results are obtained at the level of the
Euler equation (momentum) instead of Bernoulli's equation (energy). As such, there is a finite
force exactly at the sharp edge that is associated with the inviscid generation of vorticity and
is proportional to the change of the doublet strength. Furthermore, this force corresponds to an
`acceleration reaction' of the fluid that is impulsively accelerated as it passes the sharp edge,
which in turn communicates an instantaneous change in the total kinetic energy of the fluid to infinity.
For a finite body, this force is finite even for an impulsive acceleration. Example simulations
are presented for validation of the derived shedding equations.
