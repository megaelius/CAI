We design and characterize spatially-modulated compact axilens devices that flexibly combine
efficient point focusing and grating selectivity and are compatible with scalable top-down fabrication
based on 4-level phase mask configurations. Moreover, we establish that these optical structures
can simultaneously focus incident radiation of selected wavelengths at predefined locations
with larger focal depths compared to traditional Fresnel lenses. In addition, the proposed devices
are polarization insensitive and maintain a large focusing efficiency over a broad spectral band.
Specifically, we select and characterize modulated axilens configurations designed for long-wavelength
infrared (LWIR) operation in the $6-12~\mu$m wavelength range and in the $4-6~\mu$m mid-wavelength
infrared (MWIR) range. These devices are ideally suited for monolithic integration atop the substrate
layers of infrared focal plane arrays (IR-FPAs) for use in multi-band LWIR photo-detection. We
systematically study their focusing efficiency, spectral response, and cross talk ratio, and
we demonstrate linear control of multi-wavelength focusing on a single plane. Our design method
leverages Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (RS) diffraction theory that is validated numerically using the
Finite Element Method (FEM). Finally, we demonstrate the application of spatially modulated axilenses
to the realization of compact, single-lens spectrometer. By optimizing our devices, we achieve
a minimum distinguishable wavelength interval of $\Delta\lambda=242nm$ at $\lambda_0=8{\mu}m$.
This provides an opportunity of creating ultra-compact (100${\mu}m$) spectrometer in the LWIR
with a minimum distinguishable wavelength $~200nm$. The proposed devices add fundamental spectroscopic
capabilities to compact imaging devices for a number of applications ranging from spectral sorting
to LWIR and MWIR imaging and detection.
