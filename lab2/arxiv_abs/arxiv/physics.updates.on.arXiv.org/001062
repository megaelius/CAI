Sea-level rise (SLR) is magnifying the frequency and severity of coastal flooding. The rate and
amount of global mean sea-level (GMSL) rise is a function of the trajectory of global mean surface
temperature (GMST). Therefore, temperature stabilization targets (e.g., 1.5 {\deg}C and 2.0
{\deg}C of warming above pre-industrial levels, as from the Paris Agreement) have important implications
for coastal flood risk. Here, we assess differences in the return periods of coastal floods at a global
network of tide gauges between scenarios that stabilize GMST warming at 1.5 {\deg}C, 2.0 {\deg}C,
and 2.5 {\deg}C above pre-industrial levels. We employ probabilistic, localized SLR projections
and long-term hourly tide gauge records to construct estimates of the return levels of current and
future flood heights for the 21st and 22nd centuries. By 2100, under 1.5 {\deg}C, 2.0 {\deg}C, and
2.5 {\deg}C GMST stabilization, median GMSL is projected to rise 47 cm with a very likely range of
28-82 cm (90% probability), 55 cm (very likely 30-94 cm), and 58 cm (very likely 36-93 cm), respectively.
As an independent comparison, a semi-empirical sea level model calibrated to temperature and GMSL
over the past two millennia estimates median GMSL will rise within < 13% of these projections. By
2150, relative to the 2.0 {\deg}C scenario, GMST stabilization of 1.5 {\deg}C inundates roughly
5 million fewer inhabitants that currently occupy lands, including 40,000 fewer individuals currently
residing in Small Island Developing States. Relative to a 2.0 {\deg}C scenario, the reduction in
the amplification of the frequency of the 100-yr flood arising from a 1.5 {\deg}C GMST stabilization
is greatest in the eastern United States and in Europe, with flood frequency amplification being
reduced by about half.
