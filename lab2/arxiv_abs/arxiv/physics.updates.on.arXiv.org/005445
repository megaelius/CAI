Remote sensing observations, products and simulations are fundamental sources of information
to monitor our planet and its climate variability. Uncovering the main modes of spatial and temporal
variability in Earth data is essential to analyze and understand the underlying physical dynamics
and processes driving the Earth System. Dimensionality reduction methods can work with spatio-temporal
datasets and decompose the information efficiently. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), also
known as Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) in geophysics, has been traditionally used to analyze
climatic data. However, when nonlinear feature relations are present, PCA/EOF fails. In this work,
we propose a nonlinear PCA method to deal with spatio-temporal Earth System data. The proposed method,
called Rotated Complex Kernel PCA (ROCK-PCA for short), works in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
to account for nonlinear processes, operates in the complex kernel domain to account for both space
and time features, and adds an extra rotation for improved flexibility. The result is an explicitly
resolved spatio-temporal decomposition of the Earth data cube. The method is unsupervised and
computationally very efficient.We illustrate its ability to uncover spatio-temporal patterns
using synthetic experiments and real data. Results of the decomposition of three essential climate
variables are shown: satellite-based global Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Soil Moisture
(SM), and reanalysis Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data. The ROCK-PCA method allows identifying
their annual and seasonal oscillations, as well as their non-seasonal trends and spatial variability
patterns.
