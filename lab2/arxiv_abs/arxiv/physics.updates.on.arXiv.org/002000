AVO4 vanadates are materials of technological importance due to their variety of functional properties.
They have applications as scintillators, thermophosphors, photocatalysts, cathodoluminescence,
and laser-host materials. Studies at HP-HT are helpful for understanding the physical properties
of the solid state, in special, the phase behavior of AVO4 materials. For instance, they have contributed
to understand the macroscopic properties of vanadates in terms of microscopic mechanisms. A great
progress has been made in the last decade towards the study of the pressure-effects on the structural,
vibrational, and electronic properties of AVO4 compounds. Thanks to the combination of experimental
and theoretical studies, novel metastable phases with interesting physical properties have been
discovered and the HP structural sequence followed by AVO4 oxides has been understood. Here, we
will review HP studies carried out on the phase behavior of different AVO4 compounds. The studied
materials include rare-earth vanadates and other compounds; for example, BiVO4, FeVO4, CrVO4,
and InVO4. In particular, we will focus on discussing the results obtained by different research
groups, who have extensively studied vanadates up to pressures exceeding 50 GPa. We will make a systematic
presentation and discussion of the results reported in the literature. In addition, with the aim
of contributing to the improvement of the actual understanding of the high-pressure properties
of ternary oxides, the HP behavior of vanadates will be compared with related compounds; including
phosphates, chromates, and arsenates. The behavior of nanomaterials under compression will also
be briefly described and compared with their bulk counterpart. Finally, the implications of the
reported studies on technological developments and geophysics will be commented and possible
directions for the future studies will be proposed.
