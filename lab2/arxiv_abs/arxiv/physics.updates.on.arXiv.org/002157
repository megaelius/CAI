We present the design, construction and characterization of an experimental system capable of
supporting a broad class of quantum simulation experiments with hundreds of spin qubits using Be-9
ions in a Penning trap. This article provides a detailed overview of the relevant subsystems and
their integration. We begin with a description of a dual-trap design separating loading and experimental
zones. The experimental zone trap electrodes are designed to provide wide-angle optical access
for lasers as required for the engineering of spin-motional coupling across large ion crystals
while simultaneously providing a harmonic trapping potential. We describe a near-zero-loss liquid-cryogen-based
superconducting magnet, employed in both trapping and establishing a quantization field for ion
spin-states, and equipped with a dual-stage remote-motor LN2/LHe recondenser. Experimental
measurements via a nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) probe demonstrate part-per-million homogeneity
over 7 mm-diameter cylindrical volume, and confirm that the pulse tube does not have a discernible
effect on the measured NMR linewidth. Next we describe a custom-engineered inbore optomechanical
system which delivers UV laser light to the trap and holds multiple aligned optical objectives for
top- and sideview imaging in the experimental trap region. We describe design choices including
the use of non-magnetic goniometers and translation stages for precision alignment. Further,
the optomechanics feature integration of UV-compatible fiber optics decoupling the system from
remote light sources. Using this system we present site-resolved images of ion crystals and demonstrate
the ability to realize both planar and three-dimensional ion arrays via control by rotating wall
electrodes and radial laser beams. The paper concludes with a brief outlook towards extensions
of the experimental setup and future studies.
