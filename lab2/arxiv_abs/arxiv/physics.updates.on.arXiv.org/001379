In this paper we present a novel pressure-based semi-implicit finite volume solver for the equations
of compressible ideal, viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The new method is conservative
for mass, momentum and total energy and in multiple space dimensions it is constructed in such a way
as to respect the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field exactly, also in the presence
of resistive effects. This is possible via the use of multi-dimensional Riemann solvers on an appropriately
staggered grid for the time evolution of the magnetic field and a double curl formulation of the resistive
terms. The new semi-implicit method for the MHD equations proposed here discretizes all terms related
to the pressure in the momentum equation and the total energy equation implicitly, making again
use of a properly staggered grid for pressure and velocity. The time step of the scheme is restricted
by a CFL condition based only on the fluid velocity and the Alfv\'en wave speed and is not based on the
speed of the magnetosonic waves. Our new method is particularly well-suited for low Mach number
flows and for the incompressible limit of the MHD equations, for which it is well-known that explicit
density-based Godunov-type finite volume solvers become increasingly inefficient and inaccurate
due to the increasingly stringent CFL condition and the wrong scaling of the numerical viscosity
in the incompressible limit. We show a relevant MHD test problem in the low Mach number regime where
the new semi-implicit algorithm is a factor of 50 faster than a traditional explicit finite volume
method, which is a very significant gain in terms of computational efficiency. However, our numerical
results confirm that our new method performs well also for classical MHD test cases with strong shocks.
In this sense our new scheme is a true all Mach number flow solver.
