Understanding the nature and behavior of vacancy-like defects in epitaxial GeSn metastable alloys
is crucial to elucidate the structural and optoelectronic properties of these emerging semiconductors.
The formation of vacancies and their complexes is expected to be promoted by the relatively low substrate
temperature required for the epitaxial growth of GeSn layers with Sn contents significantly above
the equilibrium solubility of 1 at.%. These defects can impact both the microstructure and charge
carrier lifetime. Herein, to identify the vacancy-related complexes and probe their evolution
as a function of Sn content, depth-profiled pulsed low-energy positron annihilation lifetime
spectroscopy and Doppler broadening spectroscopy were combined to investigate GeSn epitaxial
layers with Sn content in the 6.5-13.0 at.% range. The samples were grown by chemical vapor deposition
method at temperatures between 300 and 330 {\deg}C. Regardless of the Sn content, all GeSn samples
showed the same depth-dependent increase in the positron annihilation line broadening parameters,
which confirmed the presence of open volume defects. The measured average positron lifetimes were
the highest (380-395 ps) in the region near the surface and monotonically decrease across the analyzed
thickness, but remain above 350 ps. All GeSn layers exhibit lifetimes that are 85 to 110 ps higher
than the Ge reference layers. Surprisingly, these lifetimes were found to decrease as Sn content
increases in GeSn layers. These measurements indicate that divacancies are the dominant defect
in the as-grown GeSn layers. However, their corresponding lifetime was found to be shorter than
in epitaxial Ge thus suggesting that the presence of Sn may alter the structure of divacancies. Additionally,
GeSn layers were found to also contain a small fraction of vacancy clusters, which become less important
as Sn content increases.
