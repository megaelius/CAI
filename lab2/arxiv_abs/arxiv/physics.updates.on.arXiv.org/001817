In hydrodynamic topological transitions, one mass of fluid breaks into two or two merge into one.
For example, in the honey-drop formation when honey dripping from a spoon, honey is extended to separate
into two as the liquid neck bridging them thins down to micron scales. At the moment when topology
changes due to the breakup, physical observables such as surface curvature locally diverges. Such
singular dynamics have widely attracted physicists, revealing universality in their self-similar
dynamics, which share much in common with critical phenomena in thermodynamics. Many experimental
examples have been found, which include electric spout and vibration-induced jet eruption. However,
only a few cases have been physically understood on the basis of equations that govern the singular
dynamics and even in such a case the physical understanding is mathematically complicated inevitably
involving delicate numerical calculations. Here, we study breakup of air film entrained by a solid
disk into viscous liquid in a confined space, which leads to formation, thinning and breakup of the
neck of air. As a result, we unexpectedly find that equations governing the neck dynamics can be solved
analytically by virtue of two remarkable experimental features: only a single length scale linearly
dependent on time remains near the singularity and universal scaling functions describing singular
neck shape and velocity field are both analytic. The present solvable case would be essential for
our better understanding of the singular dynamics and will help unveil the physics of unresolved
examples intimately related to daily-life phenomena and diverse practical applications.
