A recent statistical analysis of the relationship between tides and seismic activity in Colombia
has suggested the existence of correlation anomalies for the case of intermediate depth events
in the Bucaramanga nest and the Cauca cluster (Moncayo et al., 2019). In this work, we explore in detail
the hypothesis that tides may be triggering seismic activity in these regions and extend the analysis
to two other seismic clusters in northern-central South America, specifically in the areas of El
Puyo (Ecuador) and Pucallpa (Peru). For this purpose, we use the available focal mechanism information
for seismic events at these locations, and calculate for each event the Tidal Coulomb Failure Stress
(TCFS) as obtained from estimations of the tidal strain tensor. Tidal strains are computed considering
the Earth body tides and the effect of the ocean tidal loading. Since our purpose is to elucidate the
role of tides in earthquake nucleation, calculations of the TCFS are conducted not only for the time
of earthquake, but also for the time of the closest maximum strain within a window of a few hours before
the events. Our results tend to support the hypothesis that tidal stresses are contributing to earthquake
generation in all the studied areas; this trend is especially stronger when TCFS are calculated
at pre-earthquake times. The physical explanation for the positive contribution of tides to earthquake
triggering in intermediate depth clusters may lie in the fact that a wide diversity of fault plane
orientations is possible within a relatively small volume of subducted lithosphere, so making
the tides more likely to help loosening up the blocks at the fault plane to promote slip.
