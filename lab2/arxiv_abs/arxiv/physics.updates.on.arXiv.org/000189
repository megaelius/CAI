A novel phase-space source implementation has been designed for GPU-based Monte Carlo dose calculation
engines. Due to the parallelized nature of GPU hardware, it is essential to simultaneously transport
particles of the same type and similar energies but separated spatially to yield a high efficiency.
We present three methods for phase-space implementation that have been integrated into the most
recent version of the GPU-based Monte Carlo radiotherapy dose calculation package gDPM v3.0. The
first method is to sequentially read particles from a patient-dependent phase-space and sort them
on-the-fly based on particle type and energy. The second method supplements this with a simple secondary
collimator model and fluence map implementation so that patient-independent phase-space sources
can be used. Finally, as the third method (called the phase-space-let, or PSL, method) we introduce
a novel strategy to pre-process patient-independent phase-spaces and bin particles by type, energy
and position. Position bins located outside a rectangular region of interest enclosing the treatment
field are ignored, substantially decreasing simulation time. The three methods were validated
in absolute dose against BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc and compared using gamma-index tests (2%/2mm above
the 10% isodose). It was found that the PSL method has the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency
and thus is used as the default method in gDPM v3.0. Using the PSL method, open fields of 4x4, 10x10
and 30x30 cm2 in water resulted in gamma passing rates of 99.96%, 99.92% and 98.66%, respectively.
Relative output factors agreed within 1%. An IMRT patient plan using the PSL method resulted in a
passing rate of 97%, and was calculated in 50 seconds using a single GPU compared to 8.4 hours (per
CPU) for BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc.
