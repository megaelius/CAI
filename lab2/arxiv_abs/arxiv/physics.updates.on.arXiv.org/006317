Michelson phase and Hanbury Brown--Twiss intensity stellar interferometry require expressions
for the first and second order correlation functions, respectively, of the fields radiated by stars
in terms of their diameters and measured quasi-monochromatic wavelengths. Although our sun and
most other stars are spherical in shape at optical wavelengths, previous determinations of speckle
and correlation functions have modeled stars as circular discs rather than spheres because of the
mathematical tools available for partially coherent fields on planar surfaces. However, with
the incentive that most stars are indeed shaped like spheres and not discs, the present paper models
a star as a spherical antenna composed of a random distribution of uncorrelated volume sources within
a thin surface layer (photosphere). Working directly with the time-domain fields, a self-contained,
straightforward, detailed derivation of speckle patterns and correlation functions is given
based on a novel, angularly symmetric, spherical mode expansion with coefficients determined
by the assumed Lambertian nature of the star's radiation and the uniform asymptotic behavior of
the spherical Hankel functions. First order spatially averaged and temporally averaged correlation
functions are proven to be identical and the normalized second order correlation function is shown
to equal one plus the square of the first order correlation function. The direct time-domain approach
reveals explicit expressions for the quasi-monochromatic wave-packet fields of stellar radiation
as well as new criteria for the validity of the far-field approximation for the fields of incoherent
sources that are much less restrictive than the Rayleigh-distance criterion for coherent sources.
