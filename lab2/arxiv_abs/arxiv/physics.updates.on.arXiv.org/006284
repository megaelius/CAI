[Objective] To develop a Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for plane frontal hip X-rays with
a deep learning model trained on a large dataset collected at multiple centers. [Materials and Methods].
We included 5295 cases with neck fracture or trochanteric fracture who were diagnosed and treated
by orthopedic surgeons using plane X-rays or computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) who visited each institution between April 2009 and March 2019 were enrolled. Cases in which
both hips were not included in the photographing range, femoral shaft fractures, and periprosthetic
fractures were excluded, and 5242 plane frontal pelvic X-rays obtained from 4,851 cases were used
for machine learning. These images were divided into 5242 images including the fracture side and
5242 images without the fracture side, and a total of 10484 images were used for machine learning.
A deep convolutional neural network approach was used for machine learning. Pytorch 1.3 and Fast.ai
1.0 were used as frameworks, and EfficientNet-B4, which is pre-trained ImageNet model, was used.
In the final evaluation, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-value and area under the curve
(AUC) were evaluated. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to conceptualize
the diagnostic basis of the CAD system. [Results] The diagnostic accuracy of the learning model
was accuracy of 96. 1 %, sensitivity of 95.2 %, specificity of 96.9 %, F-value of 0.961, and AUC of 0.99.
The cases who were correct for the diagnosis showed generally correct diagnostic basis using Grad-CAM.
[Conclusions] The CAD system using deep learning model which we developed was able to diagnose hip
fracture in the plane X-ray with the high accuracy, and it was possible to present the decision reason.
