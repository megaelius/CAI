Earthquake ruptures dynamically activate coseismic off-fault damage around fault cores. Systematic
field observation efforts have shown the distribution of off-fault damage around main faults,
while numerical modeling using elastic-plastic off-fault material models has demonstrated the
evolution of coseismic off-fault damage during earthquake ruptures. Laboratory scale micro-earthquake
experiments have pointed out the enhanced high-frequency radiation due to the coseismic off-fault
damage. However, the detailed off-fault fracturing mechanisms, subsequent radiation and its
contribution to the overall energy budget remain to be fully understood because of limitations
of current observational techniques and model formulations. Here, we constructed a new physics-based
dynamic earthquake rupture modeling framework, based on the combined finite-discrete element
method (FDEM), to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of coseismic off-fault damage, and its
effect on the rupture dynamics, the radiation and the overall energy budget. We conducted a 2-D systematic
case study with depth and showed the mechanisms of dynamic activation of the coseismic off-fault
damage. We found the decrease in rupture velocity and the enhanced high-frequency radiation in
near-field due to the coseismic off-fault damage. We then evaluated the overall energy budget,
which shows a significant contribution of the coseismic off-fault damage to the overall energy
budget even at depth, where the damage zone width becomes narrower. The present numerical framework
for the dynamic earthquake rupture modeling thus provides the insight into the earthquake rupture
dynamics with the coseismic off-fault damage.
