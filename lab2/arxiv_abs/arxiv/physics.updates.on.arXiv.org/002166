Global climate warming poses a significant challenge to humanity; it is associated with, e.g.,
rising sea level and declining Arctic sea ice. Increasing extreme events are also considered to
be a result of climate warming~\cite{pachauri2014climate,ogorman_contrasting_2014} and they
may have widespread and diverse effects on health, agriculture, economics and political conflicts
\cite{hsiang2011civil,helbing_globally_2013,schleussner_armed-conflict_2016,carleton_social_2016}.
Still, the detection and quantification of climate change, both in observations and climate models,
constitute a main focus of the scientific community. Here we develop a new approach based on network
and percolation frameworks \cite{cohen2010complex} to study the impacts of climate changes in
the past decades using historical models and reanalysis records, and we analyze the expected upcoming
impacts using various future global warming scenarios. More specifically, we classify the globe
area into evolving percolation clusters and find a discontinuous phase transition, which indicates
a consistent poleward expansion of the largest (tropical) cluster, as well as the weakening of the
link's strength. This is found both in the reanalysis data and in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) twenty-first century climate change simulations~\cite{taylor2012overview}.
The analysis is based on high resolution surface (2~m) air temperature field records. We discuss
the underlying mechanism for the observed expansion of the tropical cluster and associate it with
changes in atmospheric circulation represented by the weakening and expansion of the Hadley cell.
Our framework can also be useful for forecasting the extent of the tropical cluster in order to detect
its influence on different areas in response to global warming.
