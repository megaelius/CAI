Imaging of biological cells and tissues often relies on fluorescent labels, which offer high contrast
with molecular specificity. The use of exogenous labeling agents, however, may alter the normal
physiology of the bio-specimens. Complementary to the established fluorescence microscopy,
label-free quantitative phase imaging provides an objective morphological measurement tool
for bio-specimens and is free of variability introduced by contrast agents. Here we report a simple
and low-cost microscope add-on, termed Ptychographic Modulation Engine (PME), for super-resolution
quantitative phase imaging. In this microscope add-on module, we attach a diffuser to a 3D-printed
holder that can be mechanically moved to different x-y positions. We then use two vibrational motors
to introduce random positional shifts to the diffuser. The add-on module can be placed between the
objective lens and the specimen in most existing microscope platforms. Thanks to the diffuser modulation
process, the otherwise inaccessible high-resolution object information can now be encoded into
the captured images. In the ptychographic phase retrieval process, we jointly recover the complex
object wavefront, the complex diffuser profile, and the unknown positional shifts of the diffuser.
We demonstrate a 4-fold resolution gain over the diffraction limit of the employed 2X objective
lens. We also test our approach for in-vivo cell imaging, where we are able to adjust the focus after
the data has been captured. The reported microscope add-on provides a turnkey solution for super-resolution
quantitative phase imaging. It may find applications in label-free bio-imaging where both large
field-of-view and high resolution are needed.
