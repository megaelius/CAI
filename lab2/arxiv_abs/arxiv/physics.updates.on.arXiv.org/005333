A deterministic source of coherent single photons is an enabling device of quantum-information
processing for quantum simulators, and ultimately a full-fledged quantum internet. Quantum dots
(QDs) in nanophotonic structures have been employed as excellent sources of single photons, and
planar waveguides are well suited for scaling up to multiple photons and emitters exploring near-unity
photon-emitter coupling and advanced active on-chip functionalities. An ideal single-photon
source requires suppressing noise and decoherence, which notably has been demonstrated in electrically-contacted
heterostructures. It remains a challenge to implement deterministic resonant excitation of the
QD required for generating coherent single photons, since residual light from the excitation laser
should be suppressed without compromising source efficiency and scalability. Here, we present
the design and realization of a novel planar nanophotonic device that enables deterministic pulsed
resonant excitation of QDs through the waveguide. Through nanostructure engineering, the excitation
light and collected photons are guided in two orthogonal waveguide modes enabling deterministic
operation. We demonstrate a coherent single-photon source that simultaneously achieves high-purity
($g^{(2)}(0)$ = 0.020 $\pm$ 0.005), high-indistinguishability ($V$ = 96 $\pm$ 2 %), and $>$80 %
coupling efficiency into the waveguide. The novel `plug-and-play' coherent single-photon source
could be operated unmanned for several days and will find immediate applications, e.g., for constructing
heralded multi-photon entanglement sources for photonic quantum computing or sensing.
