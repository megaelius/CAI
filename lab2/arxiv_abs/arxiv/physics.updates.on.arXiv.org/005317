Two key metrics for imaging systems are their magnification and optical bandwidth. While high-quality
imaging systems today achieve bandwidths spanning the whole visible spectrum and large changes
in magnification via optical zoom, these often entail lens assemblies with bulky elements unfit
for size-constrained applications. Metalenses present a methodology for miniaturization but
their strong chromatic aberrations and the lack of a varifocal achromatic element limit their utility.
While exemplary broadband achromatic metalenses are realizable via dispersion engineering,
in practice, these designs are limited to small physical apertures as large area lenses would require
phase compensating scatterers with aspect ratios infeasible for fabrication. Many applications,
however, necessitate larger areas to collect more photons for better signal-to-noise ratio and
furthermore must also operate with unpolarized light. In this paper, we simultaneously achieve
achromatic operation at visible wavelengths and varifocal control using a polarization-insensitive,
hybrid optical-digital system with area unconstrained by dispersion-engineered scatterers.
We derive phase equations for a pair of conjugate metasurfaces that generate a focused accelerating
beam for chromatic focal shift control and a wide tunable focal length range of 4.8 mm (a 667-diopter
change). Utilizing this conjugate pair, we realize a near spectrally invariant point spread function
across the visible regime. We then combine the metasurfaces with a post-capture deconvolution
algorithm to image full-color patterns under incoherent white light, demonstrating an achromatic
5x zoom range. Simultaneously achromatic and varifocal metalenses could have applications in
various fields including augmented reality, implantable microscopes, and machine vision sensors.
