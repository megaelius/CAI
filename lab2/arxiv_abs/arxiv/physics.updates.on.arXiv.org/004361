The gravity-driven spreading of one fluid in contact with another fluid is of key importance to a
range of topics. To describe these phenomena, the two-layer shallow-water equations is commonly
employed. When one layer is significantly deeper than the other, it is common to approximate the
system with the much simpler one-layer shallow water equations. So far, it has been assumed that
this approximation is invalid near shocks, and one has applied additional front conditions for
the shock speed. In this paper, we prove mathematically that an effective one-layer model can be
derived from the two-layer equations that correctly captures the behaviour of shocks and contact
discontinuities without any additional closure relations. The proof yields a novel formulation
of an effective one-layer shallow water model. The result shows that simplification to an effective
one-layer model is well justified mathematically and can be made without additional knowledge
of the shock behaviour. The shock speed in the proposed model is consistent with empirical models
and identical to the front conditions that have been found theoretically by e.g. von K\'arm\'an
and by Benjamin. This suggests that the breakdown of the shallow-water equations in the vicinity
of shocks is less severe than previously thought. We further investigate the applicability of the
shallow water framework to shocks by studying shocks in one-dimensional lock-exchange/lock-release.
We derive expressions for the Froude number that are in good agreement with the widely employed expression
by Benjamin. We then solve the equations numerically to illustrate how quickly the proposed model
converges to solutions of the full two-layer shallow-water equations. We also compare numerical
results using our model with results from dam break experiments. Predictions from the one-layer
model are found to be in good agreement with experiments.
