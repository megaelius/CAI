Modern astrophysical simulations aim to accurately model an ever-growing array of physical processes,
including the interaction of fluids with magnetic fields, under increasingly stringent performance
and scalability requirements driven by present-day trends in computing architectures. Discontinuous
Galerkin methods have recently gained some traction in astrophysics, because of their arbitrarily
high order and controllable numerical diffusion, combined with attractive characteristics for
high performance computing. In this paper, we describe and test our implementation of a discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics in the AREPO-DG code. Our DG-MHD scheme relies
on a modal expansion of the solution on Legendre polynomials inside the cells of an Eulerian octree-based
AMR grid. The divergence-free constraint of the magnetic field is enforced using one out of two distinct
cell-centered schemes: either a Powell-type scheme based on nonconservative source terms, or
a hyperbolic divergence cleaning method. The Powell scheme relies on a basis of divergence-free
vector polynomials inside each cell to represent the magnetic field. Limiting prescriptions are
implemented to ensure non-oscillatory and positive solutions. We show that the resulting scheme
is accurate and robust: it can achieve high-order and low numerical diffusion, as well as accurately
capture strong MHD shocks. In addition, we show that our scheme exhibits a number of attractive properties
for astrophysical simulations, such as lower advection errors and better Galilean invariance
at reduced resolution, as well as more accurate capturing of barely resolved flow features. We discuss
the prospects of our implementation, and DG methods in general, for scalable astrophysical simulations.
