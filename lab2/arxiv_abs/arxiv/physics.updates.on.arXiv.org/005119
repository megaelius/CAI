Purpose: To develop a framework to reconstruct large-scale volumetric dynamic MRI from rapid continuous
and non-gated acquisitions, with applications to pulmonary and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)
imaging. Theory and Methods: The problem considered here requires recovering hundred-gigabytes
of dynamic volumetric image data from a few gigabytes of k-space data, acquired continuously over
several minutes. This reconstruction is vastly under-determined, heavily stressing computing
resources as well as memory management and storage. To overcome these challenges, we leverage intrinsic
three dimensional (3D) trajectories, such as 3D radial and 3D cones, with ordering that incoherently
cover time and k-space over the entire acquisition. We then propose two innovations: (1) A compressed
representation using multi-scale low rank matrix factorization that constrains the reconstruction
problem, and reduces its memory footprint. (2) Stochastic optimization to reduce computation,
improve memory locality, and minimize communications between threads and processors. We demonstrate
the feasibility of the proposed method on DCE imaging acquired with a golden-angle ordered 3D cones
trajectory and pulmonary imaging acquired with a bit-reversed ordered 3D radial trajectory. We
compare it with "soft-gated" dynamic reconstruction for DCE and respiratory resolved reconstruction
for pulmonary imaging. Results: The proposed technique shows transient dynamics that are not seen
in gating based methods. When applied to datasets with irregular, or non-repetitive motions, the
proposed method displays sharper image features. Conclusion: We demonstrated a method that can
reconstruct massive 3D dynamic image series in the extreme undersampling and extreme computation
setting.
