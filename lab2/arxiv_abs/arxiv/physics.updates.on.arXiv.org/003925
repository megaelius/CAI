Nonlinear THz-THz-Raman (TTR) liquid spectroscopy offers new possibilities for studying and
understanding condensed-phase chemical dynamics. Although TTR spectra carry rich information
about the systems under study, the response is encoded in a three-point correlation function comprising
of both dipole and polarizability elements. Theoretical methods are necessary for the interpretation
of the experimental results. In this work, we study the liquid-phase dynamics of bromoform, a polarizable
molecule with a strong TTR response. Previous work based on reduced density matrix (RDM) simulations
suggests that unusually large multi-quanta dipole matrix elements are needed to understand the
measured spectrum of bromoform. Here, we demonstrate that a self-consistent definition of the
time coordinates with respect to the reference pulse leads to a simplified experimental spectrum.
Furthermore, we analytically derive a parametrization for the RDM model by integrating the dipole
and polarizability elements to the 4th order in the normal modes, and we enforce inversion symmetry
in the calculations by numerically cancelling the components of the response that are even with
respect to the field. The resulting analysis eliminates the need to invoke large multi-quanta dipole
matrix elements to fit the experimental spectrum; instead, the experimental spectrum is recovered
using RDM simulations with dipole matrix parameters that are in agreement with independent ab initio
calculations. The fundamental interpretation of the TTR signatures in terms of coupled intramolecular
vibrational modes remains unchanged from the previous work.
