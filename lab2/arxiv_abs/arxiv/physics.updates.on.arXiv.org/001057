Molecular Dynamics - Green's Functions Reaction Dynamics (MD-GFRD) is a multiscale simulation
method for particle dynamics or particle-based reaction-diffusion dynamics that is suited for
systems involving low particle densities. Particles in a low-density region are just diffusing
and not interacting. In this case one can avoid the costly integration of microscopic equations
of motion, such as molecular dynamics (MD), and instead turn to an event-based scheme in which the
times to the next particle interaction and the new particle positions at that time can be sampled.
At high (local) concentrations, however, e.g. when particles are interacting in a nontrivial way,
particle positions must still be updated with small time steps of the microscopic dynamical equations.
The efficiency of a multi-scale simulation that uses these two schemes largely depends on the coupling
between them and the decisions when to switch between the two scales. Here we present an efficient
scheme for multi-scale MD-GFRD simulations. It has been shown that MD-GFRD schemes are more efficient
than brute-force molecular dynamics simulations up to a molar concentration of $10^{2}\mu M$.
In this paper, we show that the choice of the propagation domains has a relevant impact on the computational
performance. Domains are constructed using a local optimization of their sizes and a minimal domain
size is proposed. The algorithm is shown to be more efficient than brute-force Brownian dynamics
simulations up to a molar concentration of $10^{3}\mu M$ and is up to an order of magnitude more efficient
compared with previous MD-GFRD schemes.
