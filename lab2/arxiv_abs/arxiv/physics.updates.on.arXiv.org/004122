We investigate classical and quantum geometric information flow theories (respectively, GIFs
and QGIFs) when the geometric flow evolution and field equations for nonholonomic Einstein systems,
NES, are derived from Perelman--Lyapunov type entropic type functionals. There are defined canonical
(nonholonomic, i.e. with non-integrable distributions) geometric variables which allow a general
decoupling and integration of nonlinear systems of equations describing GIFs and QGIFs and (for
self-similar geometric flows) Ricci soliton type configurations. Our approach is more general
and different from the ideas and methods used for special classes of solutions with the area--hypersurface
entropy, and related holographic and dual gauge--gravity models, involving the concepts and generalizations
of the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy and black hole thermodynamics. Formulating the theory of QGIFs
and GIFs (in particular, encoding models with flow evolution of NES), a set of fundamental geometric,
probability and quantum mechanical, QM, concepts are developed for nonholonomic Lorentz spacetime
manifolds. There are analysed the most important properties (inequalities) for emergent NES,
their geometric flow evolution and QGIF versions of the von Neumann, relative and conditional entropy,
mutual information, (modified) entanglement and R\'{e}nyi entropy. This paper belongs to a series
of partner works on the theory and applications of GIFs and QGIFs, entanglement and geometry of relativistic
and quantum mechanical systems, emergent/entropic and modified gravity theories, MGTs, W-entropy
and associated thermodynamics for generalized stationary and cosmological solutions in MGTs
etc.
