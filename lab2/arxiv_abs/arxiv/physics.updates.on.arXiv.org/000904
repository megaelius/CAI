The use of CO2 as a natural refrigerant in data center cooling, oil recovery and in CO2 capture and
storage which is gaining traction in recent years involves heat transfer between CO2 and the base
fluid. A need arises to improve the thermal conductivity of CO2 to increase the process efficiency
and reduce cost. One way to improve the thermal conductivity is through nanoparticle addition in
the base fluid. The nanofluid in this study consists of copper (Cu) nanoparticle and CO2 as a base
fluid. No experimental data are available on the thermal conductivity of CO2 based nanofluid. In
this study, the effect of the formation of a nanolayer (or molecular layering) at the gas-solid interface
on thermal conductivity is investigated using equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations.
This study also investigates the diameter effect of nanoparticle on the nanolayer, thermal conductivity
and self-diffusion coefficient. In addition to this, diffusion coefficients are calculated for
base fluid and nanofluid. The thickness of the dense semi-solid layer formed at the nanoparticle-gas
interface is studied through radial distribution function (RDF) and density distribution around
the nanoparticle. This thickness is found to increase with nanoparticle diameter. Enhancement
in thermal conductivity and diffusion coefficient with nanoparticle diameter are strongly correlated,
indicating that the dominant modes of heat and mass transfer are the same. The output of the current
work demonstrates the enhancement in thermal conductivity due to nanoparticles addition which
may improve data center cooling efficiency and CO2 capture and storing.
