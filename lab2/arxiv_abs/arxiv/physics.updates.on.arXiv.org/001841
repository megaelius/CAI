Fano resonance in plasmonic oligomers originating from the interference of a spectrally broad
superradiant mode and a discrete subradiant mode is under intensive recent investigations due
to numerous potential applications. In this regard, development of experimental means to understand
and control the complex Fano interference process and to modulate the resulting asymmetric Fano
spectral line shape is highly sought after. Here we present a polarization Mueller matrix measurement
and inverse analysis approach for quantitative understanding and interpretation of the complex
interference process that lead to Fano resonance in symmetry broken plasmonic oligomers. The spectral
Mueller matrices of the plasmonic oligomers were recorded using a custom designed dark-field Mueller
matrix spectroscopy system. These were subsequently analyzed using differential Mueller matrix
decomposition technique to yield the quantitative sample polarimetry characteristics, namely,
polarization diattenuation (d) and linear retardance ({\delta}) parameters. The unique signature
of the interference of the superradiant dipolar plasmon mode and the subradiant quadrupolar mode
of the symmetry broken plasmonic oligomers manifested as rapid spectral variation of the diattenuation
and the linear retardance parameters across the Fano spectral dip. The polarization information
contained in the Mueller matrix was further utilized to desirably control the Fano spectral line
shape. The experimental Mueller matrix analysis was complemented with finite element based numerical
simulations, which enabled quantitative understanding of the interference of the superradiant
and the subradiant plasmon modes and its link with the polarization diattenuation and retardance
parameters.
