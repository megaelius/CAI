Performance of triple GEM prototypes has been evaluated by means of a muon beam at the H4 line of the
SPS test area at CERN. The data from two planar prototypes have been reconstructed and analyzed offline
with two clusterization methods: the enter of gravity of the charge distribution and the micro Time
Projection Chamber (\muTPC). Concerning the spatial resolution, the charge centroid cluster
reconstruction performs extremely well with no magnetic field: the resolution is well below 100
\mum . Increasing the magnetic field intensity, the resolution degrades almost linearly as effect
of the Lorentz force that displaces, broadens and asymmetrizes the electron avalanche. Tuning
the electric fields of the GEM prototype we could achieve the unprecedented spatial resolution
of 190 \mum at 1 Tesla. In order to boost the spatial resolution with strong magnetic field and inclined
tracks a \muTPC cluster reconstruction has been investigated. Such a readout mode exploits the
good time resolution of the GEM detector and electronics to reconstruct the trajectory of the particle
inside the conversion gap. Beside the improvement of the spatial resolution, information on the
track angle can be also extracted. The new clustering algorithm has been tested with diagonal tracks
with no magnetic field showing a resolution between 100 um and 150 um for the incident angle ranging
from 10{\deg} to 45{\deg} . Studies show similar performance with 1 Tesla magnetic field. This is
the first use of a \muTPC readout with a triple GEM detector in magnetic field. This study has shown
that a combined readout is capable to guarantee stable performance over a broad spectrum of particle
momenta and incident angles, up to a 1 Tesla magnetic field.
