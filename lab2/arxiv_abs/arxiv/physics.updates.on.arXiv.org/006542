The ongoing respiratory COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted the social and private lives of
the majority of the global population. This infection is primarily transmitted via virus-laden
fluid particles (i.e., droplets and aerosols) that are formed in the respiratory tract of infected
individuals and expelled from the mouth in the course of breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing.
To mitigate the risk of virus transmission, in many places of the world, the public has been asked
or even obliged to use face covers. It is plausible that in the years ahead we will see the use of face
masks, face shields and respirators become a normal practice in our life. However, wearing face
covers is uncomfortable in some situations, like, for example, in summer heat, while staying on
beaches or at hotel swimming pools, doing exercises in gyms, etc. Also, most types of face cover become
contaminated with time and need to be periodically replaced or disinfected. These nuisances are
caused by the fact that face covers are based on material barriers, which prevent inward and outward
propagation of aerosol and droplets containing the pathogen. Applying well established gas-particle
flow formalism, we study a non-material based protection barrier created by a flow of well directed
down stream of air across the front of the open face. The~protection is driven by dragging virus-laden
particles inside the width of the air flow and hence, as a consequence, displacing them away from
their primary trajectories. The study, shows that such, potentially portable, air curtains can
effectively provide both inward and outward protection and serve as an effective personal protective
equipment (PPE) mitigating human to human transmission of virus infection like COVID-19.
