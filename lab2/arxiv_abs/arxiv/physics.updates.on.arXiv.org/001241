We have performed direct numerical simulations (DNS) of compressible turbulent channel flow at
supercritical pressure with top and bottom isothermal walls kept respectively at a supercritical
(Ttop > Tpb) and subcritical temperature (Tbot < Tpb), where Tpb is the pseudoboiling temperature.
The DNS are conducted using a high-order discretization of the fully compressible Navier-Stokes
equations in conservative form closed with the Peng-Robinsion (PR) state equation. Bulk density
is adjusted to obtain a bulk pressure of approximately pb = 1.1pcr where pcr is the critical pressure
of the working fluid. Top-to-bottom temperature differences investigated are DT = 5 K, 10 K, and
20 K, where Ttop/bot = Tpb +- DT / 2; buoyancy effects are neglected. Varying DT modifies the average
location of pseudophase change from ypb/h = -0.23 (DT = 5 K) to 0.89 (DT = 20 K), where h is the channel
half-height and y = 0 the centerline position. Real-fluid effects cause visible deviations from
classical scaling laws in the mean velocity profile. Enstrophy generation due stretching and tilting
decreases with DT. The proximity to the pseudotransitioning layer inhibits the intensity of the
velocity fluctuations, while enhancing the density and temperature fluctuations. Conditional
probability analysis reveals that the sheet of fluid undergoing pseudophase change is characterized
by a dramatic reduction in the kurtosis of density fluctuations and becomes thinner as DT is increased.
Instantaneous visualizations show dense fluid ejections from the pseudoliquid viscous sublayer,
some reaching the channel core, causing positive values of density skewness in the respective buffer-layer
region (vice versa for the top wall).
