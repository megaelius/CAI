In order to prevent velocity, pressure, and temperature spikes at material discontinuities occurring
when the interface-capturing schemes inconsistently simulate compressible multi-material
flows(when the specific heats ratio is variable),various non-conservative or quasi-conservative
numerical models have been proposed. However, designing a consistent numerical algorithm, especially
using the high-order characteristic flux-split based finite-difference method (CFS-FDM) is
still an open question. In this study, a systematical analysis of previous algorithms of the consistent
implementing the high-order CFS-FDM for such flows is performed, and the reasons of special treatments
in these algorithms are revealed. Based on this analysis, a new general numerical methodology that
successfully avoids any special treatments as those required in previously reported algorithms,
is derived. In this new algorithm, we rewrite the non-conservative term as a conservative term with
a source term containing velocity divergence. By consistently treating the advection velocity
in the conservative term and velocity divergence in the source term by imposing a new additional
criterion, specifically, that a multi-fluid algorithm should have the ability of maintaining
a pure single-fluid, we finally derive a new general algorithm that does not need any special treatment,
and is very convenient to implement. The results of some benchmark tests show that the final algorithm
not only maintains the velocity, pressure, and temperature equlibria, but is also suitable for
problems regarding the interaction of interfaces and strong shock and rarefaction waves.
