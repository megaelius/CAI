We propose a new composite neural network (NN) that can be trained based on multi-fidelity data.
It is comprised of three NNs, with the first NN trained using the low-fidelity data and coupled to
two high-fidelity NNs, one with activation functions and another one without, in order to discover
and exploit nonlinear and linear correlations, respectively, between the low-fidelity and the
high-fidelity data. We first demonstrate the accuracy of the new multi-fidelity NN for approximating
some standard benchmark functions but also a 20-dimensional function. Subsequently, we extend
the recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to be trained with multi-fidelity
data sets (MPINNs). MPINNs contain four fully-connected neural networks, where the first one approximates
the low-fidelity data, while the second and third construct the correlation between the low- and
high-fidelity data and produce the multi-fidelity approximation, which is then used in the last
NN that encodes the partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, in the two high-fidelity
NNs a relaxation parameter is introduced, which can be optimized to combine the linear and nonlinear
sub-networks. By optimizing this parameter, the present model is capable of learning both the linear
and complex nonlinear correlations between the low- and high-fidelity data adaptively. By training
the MPINNs, we can:(1) obtain the correlation between the low- and high-fidelity data, (2) infer
the quantities of interest based on a few scattered data, and (3) identify the unknown parameters
in the PDEs. In particular, we employ the MPINNs to learn the hydraulic conductivity field for unsaturated
flows as well as the reactive models for reactive transport. The results demonstrate that MPINNs
can achieve relatively high accuracy based on a very small set of high-fidelity data.
