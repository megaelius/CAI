The idea of minimum curvilinearity (MC) is that the hidden geometry of complex networks, in particular
when they are sufficiently sparse, clustered, small-world and heterogeneous, can be efficiently
navigated using the minimum spanning tree (MST), which is a greedy navigator. The local topological
information drives the global geometrical navigation and the MST can be interpreted as a growing
path that greedily maximizes local similarity between the nodes attached at each step by globally
minimizing their overall distances in the network. This is also valid in absence of the network structure
and in presence of only the nodes geometrically located over the network generative manifold in
a high-dimensional space. We know that random geometric graphs in the hyperbolic space are an adequate
model for realistic complex networks: the explanation of this connection is that complex networks
exhibit hierarchical, tree-like organization, and in turn the hyperbolic geometry is the geometry
of trees. Here we show that, according to a mechanism that we define similarity attachment, the visited
node sequence of a network automaton can efficiently approximate the nodes' angular coordinates
in the hyperbolic disk, that actually represent an ordering of their similarities. This is a consequence
of the fact that the MST, during its greedy growing process, at each step sequentially attaches the
node most similar (less distant) to its own cohort. Minimum curvilinear automata (MCA) displays
embedding accuracy which seems superior to HyperMap-CN and inferior to coalescent embedding,
however its link prediction performance on real networks is without precedent for methods based
on the hyperbolic space. Finally, depending on the data structure used to build the MST, the MCA's
time complexity can also approach a linear dependence from the number of edges.
