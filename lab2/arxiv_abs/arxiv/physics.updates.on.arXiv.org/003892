Pedestrian's crossing from unsignalized locations at intersections or midblock locations is
a risky decision that could lead to fatal accidents. Despite making a decision to accept a safe gap
to cross the street is a personal choice, studying this phenomena and its affecting variables are
crucial for accident analysis and traffic safety investigations. In this paper we used video taped
data to study pedestrian gap acceptance behavior at an unsignalized intersection and a midblock
facility in Tehran, Iran. Multi way ANOVA test indicates simultaneous effect of gender and child
accompaniment have the highest effect on size of accepted gap and waiting time. In addition, number
of rejected gap is mostly affected by the child accompaniment status. Investigation about critical
gap shows in general, critical gap was bigger at unsignalized intersection and for women. We defined
a latent variable named caution behavior based on some observable indicators and using structural
equation modeling it was estimated and used as an input in a binary mixed logit model. This variable
identified important in gap acceptance decision. Despite both structural equation and logit models
are used in previous gap acceptance studies, but according to our best knowledge this is the first
use of the hybrid mixed logit modeling approach in this field and we developed a new methodology to
combine psychological and behavioral aspects of pedestrians' gap acceptance studies. Modeling
approach shows pedestrian decision regarding acceptance or rejection of a gap to be highly influenced
by the size of current gap, caution behavior and waiting time.
