Modeling human behavioral data is challenging due to its scale, sparseness (few observations per
individual), heterogeneity (differently behaving individuals), and class imbalance (few observations
of the outcome of interest). An additional challenge is learning an interpretable model that not
only accurately predicts outcomes, but also identifies important factors associated with a given
behavior. To address these challenges, we describe a statistical approach to modeling behavioral
data called the structured sum-of-squares decomposition (S3D). The algorithm, which is inspired
by decision trees, selects important features that collectively explain the variation of the outcome,
quantifies correlations between the features, and partitions the subspace of important features
into smaller, more homogeneous blocks that correspond to similarly-behaving subgroups within
the population. This partitioned subspace allows us to predict and analyze the behavior of the outcome
variable both statistically and visually, giving a medium to examine the effect of various features
and to create explainable predictions. We apply S3D to learn models of online activity from large-scale
data collected from diverse sites, such as Stack Exchange, Khan Academy, Twitter, Duolingo, and
Digg. We show that S3D creates parsimonious models that can predict outcomes in the held-out data
at levels comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, but in addition, produces interpretable
models that provide insights into behaviors. This is important for informing strategies aimed
at changing behavior, designing social systems, but also for explaining predictions, a critical
step towards minimizing algorithmic bias.
