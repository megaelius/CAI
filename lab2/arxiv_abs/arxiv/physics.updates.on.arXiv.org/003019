We study collisionless absorption of short laser pulses of various intensity, wavelength ($\lambda$)
and polarization in a deuterium cluster using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. For a given laser
energy and a pulse duration $\approx$ 5-fs (fwhm), it is found that maximum laser absorption does
not happen at the welknown static Mie-resonance or linear resonance (LR) wavelength of $\lambdaM\approx
263$~nm (for deuterium cluster) irrespective of linear polarization (LP) and circular polarization
(CP) state of laser. As the laser intensity increases, the absorption peak is gradually red-shifted
to a higher $\lambda$ in the marginally over-dense regime of $\lambda\!\! \approx \!\!(1\!\!-\!\!1.5)\lambdaM$
from the expected static~$\lambdaM$ owing to gradual outer ionization and cluster expansion;
and above an intensity the resonance absorption peak disappears (sometimes followed by {\em even}
a growth of absorption) when outer ionization saturates at 100\% for both LP and CP. This disappearance
of the resonance absorption peak should not be misinterpreted as the negligible (or no) role of Mie-resonance.
In fact, in this marginally over-dense band of $\lambda\!\! \approx \!\!(1\!\!-\!\!1.5)\lambdaM$,
some electrons undergo dynamic Mie-resonance (dynamic LR) and others anharmonic resonance when
they are freed. It is also found that before the absorption peak, laser absorption due to LP and CP
lasers are almost equally efficient (CP case being inappreciably higher than LP) for all intensities
and $\lambda$. However, after the absorption peak, at lower intensities, absorption due to LP inappreciably
dominates absorption due to CP with increasing~$\lambda$ which gradually reverses at higher intensities.
MD results are also supported by a naive rigid sphere model of cluster.
