The pathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) remains poorly understood and biomechanical
data are limited. A deeper insight into spinal loading could provide valuable information for the
improvement of current treatment strategies. This work therefore aimed at using subject-specific
musculoskeletal full-body models of patients with AIS to predict segmental compressive forces
around the curve apex and to investigate how these forces are affected by simulated load carrying.
Models were created based on spatially calibrated biplanar radiographic images from 24 patients
with mild to moderate AIS and validated by comparing predictions of paravertebral muscle activity
with reported values from in vivo studies. Spinal compressive forces were predicted during unloaded
upright standing as well as upright standing with external loads of 10%, 15% and 20% of body weight
(BW) applied to the scapulae to simulate carrying a backpack in the regular way, in front of the body
and over both shoulders. The validation studies showed higher convex muscle activity, which was
comparable to the literature. The implementation of spinal deformity resulted in a 10% increase
of compressive force at the curve apex during unloaded upright standing. Apical compressive forces
further increased by 50-62%, 77-94% and 103-128% for 10%, 15% and 20% BW loads, respectively. Moreover,
load-dependent compressive force increases were the lowest in the regular backpack and the highest
in the frontpack and convex conditions. The predictions indicated increased segmental compressive
forces during unloaded standing, which could be ascribed to the scoliotic deformation. When carrying
loads, compressive forces further increased depending on the carrying mode and the weight of the
load. These results can be used as a basis for further studies investigating segmental loading in
AIS patients during functional activities.
