Degradation of metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitors of gold/Parylene-C/Pentacene
under constant voltage stress (CVS) was investigated to explore the electrical stability and reliability
of Parylene C as a gate dielectric in flexible electronics. A stress voltage of fixed magnitude as
high as 20 V, both negative and positive in polarity, was applied to each MIS capacitor at room temperature
for a fixed duration as long as 10 s. The CVS effects on the capacitance-voltage curve-shift, the
time-dependent leakage current, and the time-dependent dielectric breakdown were measured and
analyzed. CVS is observed to induce charge in Parylene-C and its interfaces with gold and Pentacene.
The net induced charge is positive and negative for, respectively, negative and positive gate bias
polarity during CVS. The magnitude of the charge accumulated following positive gate CVS is significantly
higher than that following negative gate bias CVS in the range of 4 to 25 nC cm$^{-2}$. In contrast,
the leakage current during the negative gate stress is three orders of magnitude higher than that
during the positive gate stress for the same bias stress magnitude. The charge buildup and leakage
current are due to the trapping of electrons and holes near the Parylene-C/Pentacene interface
as well as in the Parylene-C layer. Before the application of the CVS, a dielectric breakdown occurs
at an electric field of 1.62 MV cm$^{-1}$. After the application of the CVS, the breakdown voltage
decreases and the density of the trapped charges increases as the stress voltage increases in magnitude,
with the polarity of the trapped charges opposite to that of the stress voltage. The magnitude and
direction of the capacitance-voltage curve-shift depend on the trapping and recombination of
electrons and holes in the Parylene-C layer and in the proximity of the Parylene-C/Pentacene interface
during CVS.
