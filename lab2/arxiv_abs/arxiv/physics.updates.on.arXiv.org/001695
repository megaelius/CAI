In the present study, the role of surfactants on the cross-stream migration of droplets is investigated
both experimentally and theoretically. For experimental analysis, sunflower oil is used as the
carrier phase and DI water as the dispersed phase which is intermixed with Triton X-100 that acts
as the surfactant. A T-junction is used in the microchannel for the purpose of droplet generation.
Presence of an imposed pressure driven flow induces droplet deformation and disturbs the equilibrium
that results in subsequent surfactant-redistribution along the interface. This further induces
a gradient in the surface tension, thus generating a Marangoni stress that significantly alters
the droplet dynamics. On subsequent experimental investigation, it is found that presence of surfactants
reduces the cross-stream migration velocity of the droplet. Further, it is shown that the effect
of surfactants in reducing the cross-stream migration is significantly enhanced for a larger droplet
as compared to a smaller one within the same time span, provided the channel height is kept constant.
In addition, a larger surfactant concentration is found to induce a greater retardation in cross-stream
migration of the droplet, the effect of which is reduced when the initial transverse position of
the droplet is shifted closer to the channel centerline. The present analysis can be applied to various
droplet based microfluidic as well as medical diagnostic devices where manipulation of droplet
trajectory is a major issue. For the theoretical counterpart, an asymptotic approach is adopted
in the presence of bulk-insoluble surfactants and under the assumption of negligible fluid inertia.
A good match between our theoretical prediction and the experimental results is obtained.
