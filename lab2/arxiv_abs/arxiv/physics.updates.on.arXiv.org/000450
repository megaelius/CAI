In resisting attempts to explain the unity of a whole in terms of a multiplicity of interacting parts,
quantum mechanics calls for an explanatory concept that proceeds in the opposite direction: from
unity to multiplicity. It concerns the process by which what Sellars called the Manifest Image of
the world comes into being. This process consists in the progressive differentiation of an intrinsically
undifferentiated entity. By entering into reflexive spatial relations, this gives rise to (i)
what looks like a multiplicity of relata if the reflexive quality of the relations is not taken into
account, and (ii) what looks like a substantial expanse if the spatial quality of the relations is
reified. If there is a distinctly quantum domain, it is a non-spatial and non-temporal dimension
across which the transition from the unity of this entity to the multiplicity of the world takes place.
Instead of being constituents of the physical world, subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules
are instrumental in its manifestation. These conclusions are based on the following interpretive
principle: whenever calculating probabilities calls for the addition of amplitudes, the distinctions
we make between the alternatives lack objective reality. Applied to alternatives involving distinctions
between regions of space, this principle implies that the spatiotemporal differentiation of the
physical world is incomplete: the existence of a real-valued spatiotemporal background is an unrealistic
idealization. This guarantees the existence of observables whose values are real *per se*, as against
"real by virtue of being indicated by the values of observables that are real *per se*." Applied to
alternatives involving distinctions between things, it implies that, intrinsically, all fundamental
particles are numerically identical and thus identifiable with the aforementioned undifferentiated
entity.
