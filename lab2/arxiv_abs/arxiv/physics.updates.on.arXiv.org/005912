Explicit structure-preserving geometric Particle-in-Cell (PIC) algorithm in curvilinear orthogonal
coordinate systems is developed. The work reported represents a crucial further development of
the structure-preserving geometric PIC algorithm, achieving the goal of practical applications
in magnetic fusion research. The algorithm is constructed by discretizing the field theory for
the system of charged particles and electromagnetic field using Whitney forms, discrete exterior
calculus, and explicit non-canonical symplectic integration. In addition to the truncated infinitely
dimensional symplectic structure, the algorithm preserves exactly many important physical symmetries
and conservation laws, such as local energy conservation, gauge symmetry and the corresponding
local charge conservation. As a result, the algorithm possesses the long-term accuracy and fidelity
required for first-principles-based simulations of the multiscale tokamak physics. The algorithm
has been implemented in the SymPIC code, which is designed for high-efficiency massively-parallel
PIC simulations in modern clusters. The code has been applied to carry out the first-ever whole-device
6D kinetic simulation study of tokamak physics. A self-consistent kinetic equilibrium for fusion
plasma in the tokamak geometry is numerically found with a predominately diagonal and anisotropic
pressure tensor. The kinetic equilibrium also admits a steady-state sub-sonic ion flow in the range
of 10 km/s, agreeing with experimental observations and analytical calculations. Kinetic ballooning
instability in the self-consistent kinetic equilibrium is simulated. It shows that high-n ballooning
modes have larger growth rates than low-n global modes, and in the nonlinear phase the modes saturate
approximately in 5 ion transit times at the 2% level by the E x B flow generated by the instability.
