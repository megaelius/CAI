Following our previous work focussing on compounds containing up to 3 non-hydrogen atoms [\emph{J.
Chem. Theory Comput.} {\bfseries 14} (2018) 4360--4379], we present here highly-accurate vertical
transition energies obtained for 27 molecules encompassing 4, 5, and 6 non-hydrogen atoms. To obtain
these energies, we use equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory up to the highest technically
possible excitation order for these systems (CC3, EOM-CCSDT, and EOM-CCSDTQ), selected configuration
interaction (SCI) calculations (with tens of millions of determinants in the reference space),
as well as the multiconfigurational $n$-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2)
method. All these approaches are applied in combination with diffuse-containing atomic basis
sets. For all transitions, we report at least CC3/\emph{aug}-cc-pVQZ vertical excitation energies
as well as CC3/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ oscillator strengths for each dipole-allowed transition.
We show that CC3 almost systematically delivers transition energies in agreement with higher-level
methods with a typical deviation of $\pm 0.04$ eV, except for transitions with a dominant double
excitation character where the error is much larger. The present contribution gathers a large,
diverse and accurate set of more than 200 highly-accurate transition energies for states of various
natures (valence, Rydberg, singlet, triplet, $n \rightarrow \pi^*$, $\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$,
\ldots). We use this series of theoretical best estimates to benchmark a series of popular methods
for excited state calculations: CIS(D), ADC(2), CC2, STEOM-CCSD, EOM-CCSD, CCSDR(3), CCSDT-3,
CC3, as well as NEVPT2. The results of these benchmarks are compared to the available literature
data.
