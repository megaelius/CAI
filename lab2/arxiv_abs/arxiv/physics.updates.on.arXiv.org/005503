Knowledge about deep-ocean turbulent mixing and flow circulation above abyssal hilly plains is
important to quantify processes for the modelling of resuspension and dispersal of sediments in
areas where turbulence sources are expected to be relatively weak. Turbulence may disperse sediments
from artificial deep-sea mining activities over large distances. To quantify turbulent mixing
above the deep-ocean floor around 4000 m depth, high-resolution moored temperature sensor observations
have been obtained from the near-equatorial southeast Pacific (7{\deg}S, 88{\deg}W). Models
demonstrate low activity of equatorial flow dynamics, internal tides and surface near-inertial
motions in the area. The present observations demonstrate a Conservative Temperature difference
of about 0.012{\deg}C between 7 and 406 meter above the bottom (hereafter, mab, for short), which
is a quarter of the adiabatic lapse rate. The very weakly stratified waters with buoyancy periods
between about six hours and one day allow for slowly varying mixing. The calculated turbulence dissipation
rate values are half to one order of magnitude larger than those from open-ocean turbulent exchange
well away from bottom topography and surface boundaries. In the deep, turbulent overturns extend
up to 100 m tall, in the ocean-interior, and also reach the lowest sensor. The overturns are governed
by internal-wave-shear and -convection. The turbulence inertial subrange is observed to extend
into the internal wave frequency band. The associated mixing is not related to bottom friction processes
but to internal wave breaking and near-inertial shear. The mixing facilitates long (hours to day)
and high (exceeding 100 mab) dispersal of suspended sediments.
