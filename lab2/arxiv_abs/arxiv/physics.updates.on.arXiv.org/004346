We investigate the interplay between large-scale patterns, so-called superstructures, in the
fluctuation fields of temperature $\theta$ and vertical velocity $w$ in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard
convection at large aspect ratios. Earlier studies suggested that velocity superstructures were
smaller than their thermal counterparts in the center of the domain. However, a scale-by-scale
analysis of the correlation between the two fields employing the linear coherence spectrum reveals
that superstructures of the same size exist in both fields, which are almost perfectly correlated.
The issue is further clarified by the observation that in contrast to the temperature, and unlike
assumed previously, superstructures in the vertical velocity field do not result in a peak in the
power spectrum of $w$. The origin of this difference is traced back to the production terms of the
$\theta$- and $w$-variance. These results are confirmed for a range of Rayleigh numbers $Ra = 10^5$--$10^9$,the
superstructure size is seen to increase monotonically with $Ra$. It is further observed that the
scale distribution of particularly the temperature fluctuations is pronouncedly bimodal. In
addition to the large-scale peak caused by the superstructures, there exists a strong small-scale
peak. This `inner peak' is most intense at a distance of $\delta_\theta$ off the wall and associated
with structures of size $\approx 10 \delta_\theta$, where $\delta_\theta$ is the thermal boundary
layer thickness. Finally, based on the vertical coherence with reference height of $\delta_\theta$,
a self-similar structure is identified in the velocity field (vertical and horizontal components)
but not in the temperature.
