In the present study, we investigate the cross-stream migration of a deformable droplet suspended
in a non-isothermal Poiseuille flow in the presence of bulk-insoluble surfactants. Owing to the
non-linearity present in the system of governing equations, an asymptotic approach is adopted,
in an effort to capture the intricate and non-trivial coupling between the various influencing
parameters. With the assumption of negligible inertia in fluid flow and convective transport of
thermal energy, we obtain the droplet migration velocity through small-deformation perturbation
analysis for two different limiting cases, namely, convection-driven-surfactant transport
and surface-diffusion-dominated surfactant transport. Under each of these limiting cases, the
cross-stream migration of droplet is studied for a constant temperature gradient applied in the
same direction as well as in a direction opposite to the imposed flow. For the former limiting case,
the droplet is always migrates towards the centerline of flow. For a highly viscous droplet, the
direction of its cross-stream migration reverses. When the temperature decreases in the direction
of the imposed flow, cross-stream migration velocity reduces with increase in the applied temperature
gradient till a critical point is reached at which there is no cross-stream migration. Beyond the
critical point, there is a gradual increase in the magnitude of the cross-stream velocity. The droplet,
below the critical temperature gradient, migrates towards the flow centerline; however, above
it the droplet moves away from the centerline. For the other limiting case of surfactant transport
dominated by surface convection, the magnitude of the cross-stream velocity is found to be significantly
larger and at the same time independent of the droplet-carrier phase viscosity ratio.
