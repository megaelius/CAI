The description of a conducting medium in thermal equilibrium, such as an electrolyte solution
or a plasma, involves nonlinear electrostatics, a subject rarely discussed in the standard electricity
and magnetism textbooks. We consider in detail the case of the electrostatic double layer formed
by an electrolyte solution near a uniformly charged wall, and we use mean-field or Poisson-Boltzmann
(PB) theory to calculate the mean electrostatic potential and the mean ion concentrations, as functions
of distance from the wall. PB theory is developed from the Gibbs variational principle for thermal
equilibrium of minimizing the system free energy. We clarify the key issue of which free energy (Helmholtz,
Gibbs, grand,...) should be used in the Gibbs principle; this turns out to depend not only on the specified
conditions in the bulk electrolyte solution (e.g., fixed volume or fixed pressure), but also on
the specified surface conditions, such as fixed surface charge or fixed surface potential. Despite
its nonlinearity the PB equation for the mean electrostatic potential can be solved analytically
for planar or wall geometry, and we present analytic solutions for both a full electrolyte, and for
an ionic solution which contains only counterions, i.e. ions of sign opposite to that of the wall
charge. This latter case has some novel features. We also use the free energy to discuss the inter-wall
forces which arise when the two parallel charged walls are sufficiently close to permit their double
layers to overlap. We consider situations where the two walls carry equal charges, and where they
carry equal and opposite charges.
