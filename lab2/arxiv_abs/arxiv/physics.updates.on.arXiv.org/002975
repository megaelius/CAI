In a forced three-dimensional turbulent flow the scales larger than the forcing scale have been
conjectured to reach a thermal equilibrium state forming a $k^2$ energy spectrum. In this work we
examine the properties of these large scales in turbulent flows with the use of numerical simulations.
We show that the choice of forcing can strongly affect the behavior of the large scales. A spectrally-dense
forcing (a forcing that acts on {\it all modes} inside a finite-width spherical shell) with long
correlation times may lead to strong deviations from the $k^2$ energy spectrum, while a spectrally-sparse
forcing (a forcing that acts only on a few modes) with short correlated time-scale can reproduce
the thermal spectrum. It is shown that the spectrally-dense forcing allows for numerous triadic
interactions that couple one large scale mode with two forced modes and this leads to an excess of
energy input in the large scales. This excess of energy is then moved back to the small-scales by self-interactions
of the large-scale modes and by interactions with the turbulent small-scales. The overall picture
that arises from the present analysis is that the large scales in a turbulent flow resemble a reservoir
that is in (non-local) contact with a second out-of equilibrium reservoir consisting of the smaller
(forced and turbulent) scales. If the injection of energy at the large scales from the forced modes
is relative weak then the large-scale spectrum remains close to a thermal equilibrium and the role
of long-range interactions is to set the global energy (temperature) of the equilibrium state.
If, on the other hand, the long-range interactions are dominant, the large-scale self-interactions
cannot respond fast enough to bring the system into equilibrium. Then the large scales deviate from
the equilibrium state with energy spectrum that may display exponents different from the $k^2$
spectrum.
