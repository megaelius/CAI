A millimetric bouncing droplet sustained on a vibrating bath becomes a moving wave source (particle)
through periodically interacting with the local wave field it generates during the droplet-bath
impact. By virtue of such particle-wave duality, the macroscopic hydrodynamic system imitates
enigmatic behaviors of the quantum realm. Here we show that it is possible to create an integrated
pilot-wave field to better prescribe the droplet trajectories, via amplified bath capillarity.
This is demonstrated with a liquid metal droplet-bath system in which the local wave field generated
by droplet bouncing is superposed by the global wave field induced by bath meniscus oscillation.
The resulted dual pilot-wave configuration enables a class of directional chasing motions of two
bound dissimilar droplets (heterodimers) in multilevel hydrodynamic traps (orbits), featuring
two quantized regime parameters, namely the inter-droplet binding level and the orbit level. We
investigate the dynamics of the vibrating liquid metal bath, with its level-split ring wave field
and its peculiar vortex field being highlighted. We also rationalize the exotic droplet motions
by considering the inter-droplet particle-wave interactions mediated by the integrated pilot-wave
field. It is revealed that a temporal bouncing phase shift between the two droplets in the heterodimers,
due to size mismatch, gives rise to their horizontal propulsion, while their spatial binding regime
exclusively determines the collective chasing direction. It is further evidenced that the horizontal
in-orbit chasing motion is directly related to vertical droplet bouncing. Our findings unveil
integrated pilot-wave field as a trail towards improved droplet guiding, thereby extending the
hydrodynamic particle-wave analogy to optical systems and beyond.
