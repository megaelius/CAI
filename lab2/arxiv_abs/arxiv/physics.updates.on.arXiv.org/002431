The brain is a complex organ characterized by heterogeneous patterns of structural connections
supporting unparalleled feats of cognition and a wide range of behaviors. New noninvasive imaging
techniques now allow these patterns to be carefully and comprehensively mapped in individual humans
and animals. Yet, it remains a fundamental challenge to understand how the brain's structural wiring
supports cognitive processes, with major implications for the personalized treatment of mental
health disorders. Here, we review recent efforts to meet this challenge that draw on intuitions,
models, and theories from physics, spanning the domains of statistical mechanics, information
theory, and dynamical systems and control. We begin by considering the organizing principles of
brain network architecture instantiated in structural wiring under constraints of symmetry,
spatial embedding, and energy minimization. We next consider models of brain network function
that stipulate how neural activity propagates along these structural connections, producing
the long-range interactions and collective dynamics that support a rich repertoire of system functions.
Finally, we consider perturbative experiments and models for brain network control, which leverage
the physics of signal transmission along structural wires to infer intrinsic control processes
that support goal-directed behavior and to inform stimulation-based therapies for neurological
disease and psychiatric disorders. Throughout, we highlight several open questions in the physics
of brain network structure, function, and control that will require creative efforts from physicists
willing to brave the complexities of living matter.
