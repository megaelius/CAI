The covalent functionalisation of type I atelocollagen with either 4-vinylbenzyl or methacrylamide
residues is presented as a simple synthetic strategy to achieve customisable, cell-friendly UV-cured
hydrogel networks with widespread clinical applicability. Molecular parameters, i.e. the type
of monomer, degree of atelocollagen functionalisation and UV curing solution, have been systematically
varied and their effect on gelation kinetics, swelling behaviour, elastic properties and enzymatic
degradability investigated. UV-cured hydrogel networks deriving from atelocollagen precursors
functionalised with equivalent molar content of 4-vinylbenzyl and methacrylamide adducts proved
to display remarkably-different swelling ratio, storage modulus and collagenase resistance,
similarly to the case of UV-cured hydrogel networks obtained with the same type of methacrylamide
adduct, but varied degree of functionalisation. UV-induced network formation of 4VBC functionalised
atelocollagen molecules yielded hydrogels with increased stiffness and enzymatic stability,
attributed to the molecular rigidity of resulting aromatised crosslinking segment, whilst no
toxic response was observed with osteosarcoma G292 cells. Although to a lesser extent, the pH of
the UV-curing solution also proved to affect macroscopic hydrogel properties, likely due to the
altered organisation of atelocollagen molecules during network formation. By leveraging the
knowledge gained with classic synthetic networks, this study highlights how the type of monomer
can be conveniently exploited to realise customisable atelocollagen hydrogels with controlled
structure-property relationships to meet the requirements of unmet clinical applications.
