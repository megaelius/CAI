Optical waveguides in the form of glass fibers are the backbone of global telecommunication networks.
The physical principle enabling the transmission of light over long distances is total internal
reflection which occurs at the interface between two media with different refractive indices.
Although this mechanism ensures that no light escapes from the waveguide, there is always an evanescent
field that penetrates into the optically thinner surrounding medium. While this field is protected
from interacting with the environment in standard optical fibers, it is routinely employed in order
to efficiently couple light fields to optical components or emitters using, e.g., prisms or tapered
optical fiber couplers. Remarkably, the strong confinement imposed by the latter can lead to significant
spin--orbit coupling. Taking advantage of this effect, we demonstrate the controlled directional
spontaneous emission of light by quantum emitters into a sub-wavelength-diameter waveguide.
The effect is investigated in a paradigmatic setting, comprising cesium atoms as the emitters which
are located in the vicinity of a vacuum-clad silica nanofiber. We experimentally observe an asymmetry
higher than 10:1 in the emission rates into the counterpropagating fundamental guided modes of
the nanofiber. Moreover, we demonstrate that this asymmetry can be tailored by state preparation
and suitable excitation of the quantum emitters. We expect our results to have important implications
for research in nanophotonics and quantum optics and for implementations of integrated optical
signal processing in the classical as well as in the quantum regime.
