Errors in applying regression models and wavelet filters used to analyze geophysical signals are
discussed: (1) multidecadal natural oscillations (e.g. the quasi 60-year Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)) need
to be taken into account for properly quantifying anomalous accelerations in tide gauge records
such as in New York City; (2) uncertainties and multicollinearity among climate forcing functions
prevent a proper evaluation of the solar contribution to the 20th century global surface temperature
warming using overloaded linear regression models during the 1900-2000 period alone; (3) when
periodic wavelet filters, which require that a record is pre-processed with a reflection methodology,
are improperly applied to decompose non-stationary solar and climatic time series, Gibbs boundary
artifacts emerge yielding misleading physical interpretations. By correcting these errors and
using optimized regression models that reduce multicollinearity artifacts, I found the following
results: (1) the sea level in New York City is not accelerating in an alarming way, and may increase
by about 350 mm from 2000 to 2100 instead of the previously projected values varying from 1130 mm to
1550 mm estimated using the methods proposed by Sallenger et al. (2012) and Boon (2012), respectively;
(2) the solar activity increase during the 20th century contributed about 50% of the 0.8 K global
warming observed during the 20th century instead of only 7-10% (IPCC, 2007; Benestad and Schmidt,
2009; Lean and Rind, 2009). These findings stress the importance of natural oscillations and of
the sun to properly interpret climatic changes.
