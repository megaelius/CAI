The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a TeV-scale high-luminosity linear e$^+$e$^-$ collider
under development by international collaborations hosted by CERN. This document provides an overview
of the design, technology, and implementation aspects of the CLIC accelerator and the detector.
For an optimal exploitation of its physics potential, CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in
stages, at centre-of-mass energies of 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV, for a site length ranging between
11 km and 50 km. CLIC uses a two-beam acceleration scheme, in which normal-conducting high-gradient
12 GHz accelerating structures are powered via a high-current drive beam. For the first stage, an
alternative with X-band klystron powering is also considered. CLIC accelerator optimisation,
technical developments, and system tests have resulted in significant progress in recent years.
Moreover, this has led to an increased energy efficiency and reduced power consumption of around
170 MW for the 380 GeV stage, together with a reduced cost estimate of approximately 6 billion CHF.
The detector concept, which matches the physics performance requirements and the CLIC experimental
conditions, has been refined using improved software tools for simulation and reconstruction.
Significant progress has been made on detector technology developments for the tracking and calorimetry
systems. The construction of the first CLIC energy stage could start as early as 2026 and first beams
would be available by 2035, marking the beginning of a physics programme spanning 25-30 years and
providing excellent sensitivity to Beyond Standard Model physics, through direct searches and
via a broad set of precision measurements of Standard Model processes, particularly in the Higgs
and top-quark sectors.
