For many applications of pulsed radiation, the time-history of the radiation intensity must be
optimized to induce a desired time-history of conditions. This optimization is normally performed
using multi-physics simulations of the system. The pulse shape is parametrized, and multiple simulations
are performed in which the parameters are adjusted until the desired response is induced. These
simulations are often computationally intensive, and the optimization by iteration of parameters
in forward simulations is then expensive and slow. In many cases, the desired response can be expressed
such that an instantaneous difference between the actual and desired response can be calculated.
In principle, a computer program used to perform the forward simulation could be modified to adjust
the instantaneous radiation drive automaticaly until the desired instantaneous response is achieved.
Unfortunately, such modifications may be impracticable in a complicated multi-physics program.
However, the computational time increment in such simulations is generally much shorter than the
time scale of changes in the desired response. It is much more practicable to adjust the radiation
source so that the response tends toward the desired value at later times. This relaxed in-situ optimization
method can give an adequate design for a pulse shape in a single forward simulation, giving a typical
gain in computational efficiency of tens to thousands. This approach was demonstrated for the design
of laser pulse shapes to induce ramp loading to high pressure in target assemblies incorporating
ablators of significantly different mechanical impedance than the sample, requiring complicated
pulse shaping.
