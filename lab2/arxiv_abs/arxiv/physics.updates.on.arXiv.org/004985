A wide and critical comparison of the capability of Method of Characteristics, Explicit Path-Conservative
Finite Volume Method and Semi-Implicit Staggered Finite Volume Method is presented and discussed,
in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The viscoelastic behaviour of the pipe wall, the effects of
the unsteadiness of the flow on the friction losses, cavitation and cross-sectional changes are
considered. The analyses are performed comparing numerical solutions obtained using the three
models against experimental data and analytical solutions. Water hammer studies in high density
polyethylene pipes, for which laboratory data have been provided, are used as test cases. Considering
the viscoelastic mechanical behaviour of plastic materials, a 3-parameter and a multi-parameter
linear viscoelastic rheological model are adopted and implemented in each numerical scheme. Original
extensions of existing techniques for the numerical treatment of such viscoelastic models are
introduced in this work for the first time. After a focused calibration of the viscoelastic parameters,
the different performance of the numerical models is investigated. A comparison of the results
is presented considering the unsteady wall-shear stress, with a new approach proposed for turbulent
flows, or simply considering a quasi-steady friction model. A predominance of the damping effect
due to viscoelasticity with respect to the damping effect related to the unsteady friction is confirmed
in these contexts. All the numerical methods show a good agreement with the experimental data and
a high efficiency of the Method of Characteristics in standard configuration is observed. Three
Riemann Problems are chosen and run to stress the numerical methods, considering cross-sectional
changes, more flexible materials and cavitation cases. In these demanding scenarios, the weak
spots of the Method of Characteristics are depicted.
