This article presents chemical analysis of jet fuel (Jet A-1) heteroatomic fuel components with
identification of an antioxidant lichen substance in methanol extracted fuel samples. Thermal
stressing of jet fuel produces soluble macromolecular oxidatively reactive species (SMORS) and
heteroatomic deposits. SMORS are deposit precursors and elementary heteroatomic units containing
unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons. Fuel additives such as antioxidants can inhibit SMORS
and deposit formation within limited heating residence time and temperature range. Jet A-1 was
thermally stressed in the autoxidation regime (150 to 300 0C) followed by spectroscopic analysis.
Thermally stressed jet fuel static tests electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) show higher
molecular weight compounds in the mass range 300-1000 Da compared with unstressed fuel samples
supporting deposition. Jet A-1 samples were analyzed by electrospray ion source mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
FTIR bands for oxygen containing species reveal the presence of alcohol, phenol and ether groups.
13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) standard and distorsionless enhancement polarization transfer
(DEPT 135) spectra recorded heteroatomic alkoxy species in both unstressed and thermally stressed
fuel samples. Natural products polyphenols and lichen derived oxygenated compounds are excellent
antioxidants. A new perspective of using lichen substances as fuel additives emerged in this study.
Exploring further, natural products extraction methods optimization remains a key challenge
and advantages of polyphenolic lichen acids as potential fuel and chemical additives are discussed.
