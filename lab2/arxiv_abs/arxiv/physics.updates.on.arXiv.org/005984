Reduced titanium dioxide has recently attracted large attention, particularly for its unique
co-catalyst-free H$_2$ heterogeneous photocatalytic application. The enhanced photocatalytic
activity of the reduced TiO$_2$ was previously ascribed to the introduction of point crystal defects
(mainly Ti$_3^+$ centers), which result in the formation of intrinsic co-catalytic centers and
enhanced visible light absorption. In this work, we systematically investigate the effect of different
defects in the TiO$_{2-x}$ lattice on photocatalytic H$_2$ evolution. To introduce different
types of defects, thermal annealing in air (oxidative), Ar (inert), Ar/H$_2$ (reducing), and H$_2$
(reducing) atmospheres were performed on commercially available anatase nanopowder. Then, the
powders were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) to clarify the effect of treatment
on material properties. Furthermore, the defect types were characterized by electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We show that thermal annealing in different atmospheres can form
different amounts of different defect types in the TiO$_2$ structure. The highest photocatalytic
activation is achieved by annealing the anatase powder in a reducing atmosphere for an appropriate
temperature/annealing time. By combining the results from H$_2$ generation and EPR analysis we
show that the simultaneous presence of two types of defects, i.e. surface exposed Ti$_3^+$ and lattice
embedded Ti$_3^+$ centers, in an optimum low concentration, is the determining factor for an optimized
photocatalytic H$_2$ evolution rate. In fact, annealing anatase powder under the so-reported
optimized conditions in reducing atmosphere leads to the generation of a considerable amount of
H$_2$, with rates as high as 338 $\mu$molh-1g-1.
