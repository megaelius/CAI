Fully resolved simulation of flows with bubbles or buoyant particles is a challenging problem due
to the fact that bubbles or buoyant particles are lighter than the surrounding fluid and as a result,
two phases are strongly coupled together which means using weak coupling methods (explicit coupling
schemes) are numerically unstable. Schwarz et al. [Schwarz, S., Kempe, T., & Fr\"ohlich, J. (2015).
A temporal discretization scheme to compute the motion of light particles in viscous flows by an
immersed boundary method. J. Comput. Phys., 281, 591-613] introduced the virtual force technique
to stabilize the immersed boundary method for fully-resolved direct numerical simulation of buoyant
particles. They designed a numerical scheme based on this technique to obtain accurate results
for the simulation of a single rising sphere with the particle-fluid density ratio of $0.001$. In
this work, the virtual force stabilization technique is generalized and extended to simulate bubbly
flows in contaminated liquid with high volume fractions (up to $40 \%$). Through a detailed analysis,
it is shown that the dimensionless numerical model constant $C_v$ in the virtual force method has
a lower limit which depends on density ratio, added mass coefficient and the numerical method. Since
the added mass coefficient increases with an increase in volume fraction, it is concluded that $C_v$
should also increase with volume fraction. The extended virtual force method is validated for a
single bubble and for two in-line rising bubbles by comparing the numerical results with experimental
results from the literature. Finally, the drag coefficient is extracted from simulations of bubble
swarms at different volume fractions and compared with drag correlations available in the literature.
