Purpose: Phosphorus saturation-transfer experiments can quantify metabolic fluxes non-invasively.
Typically, the forward flux through the creatine-kinase reaction is investigated by observing
the decrease in phosphocreatine (PCr) after saturation of $\gamma$-ATP. The quantification of
total ATP utilisation is currently under-explored, as it requires simultaneous saturation of
inorganic phosphate (Pi) and PCr. This is challenging, as currently available saturation pulses
reduce the already-low $\gamma$-ATP signal present. Methods: Using a hybrid optimal-control
and Shinnar-Le-Roux method, a quasi-adiabatic RF pulse was designed for the dual-saturation of
PCr and Pi to enable determination of total ATP utilisation. The pulses were evaluated in Bloch equation
simulations, compared with a conventional hard-cosine DANTE saturation sequence, before application
to perfused rat hearts at 11.7 Tesla. Results: The quasi-adiabatic pulse was insensitive to a $>2.5$-fold
variation in $B_1$, producing equivalent saturation with a 53% reduction in delivered pulse power
and a 33-fold reduction in spillover at the minimum effective $B_1$. This enabled the complete quantification
of the synthesis and degradation fluxes for ATP in 30-45 minutes in the perfused rat heart. While
the net synthesis flux ($3.3\pm0.4$ mM/s, SEM) was not significantly different from degradation
flux ($8\pm2$ mM/s) and both measures are consistent with prior work, nonlinear error analysis
highlights uncertainties in the Pi-to-ATP measurement that may explain the possible imbalance.
Conclusion: This work demonstrates a novel quasi-adiabatic dual-saturation RF pulse with significantly
improved performance that can be used to measure ATP turnover in the heart in vivo.
