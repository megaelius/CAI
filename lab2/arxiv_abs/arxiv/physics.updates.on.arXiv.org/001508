A combination of first principle molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a rate equation model
(MD-RE approach) is presented to study the trapping and the scattering of rare gas atoms from metal
surfaces. The temporal evolution of the atom fractions that are either adsorbed or scattered into
the continuum is investigated in detail. We demonstrate that for this description one has to consider
trapped, quasi-trapped and scattering states, and present an energetic definition of these states.
The rate equations contain the transition probabilities between the states. We demonstrate how
these rate equations can be derived from kinetic theory. Moreover, we present a rigorous way to determine
the transition probabilities from a microscopic analysis of the particle trajectories generated
by MD simulations. Once the system reaches quasi-equilibrium, the rates converge to stationary
values, and the subsequent thermal adsorption/desorption dynamics is completely described by
the rate equations without the need to perform further time-consuming MD simulations. As a proof
of concept of our approach, MD simulations for argon atoms interacting with a platinum (111) surface
are presented. A detailed deterministic trajectory analysis is performed, and the transition
rates are constructed. The dependence of the rates on the incidence conditions and the lattice temperature
is analyzed. Based on this example, we analyze the time scale of the gas-surface system to approach
the quasi-stationary state. The MD-rate equation model has great relevance for the plasma-surface
modeling as it makes an extension of accurate simulations to long, experimentally relevant time
scales possible. Its application to the computation of atomic sticking probabilities is given
in the second part (paper II).
