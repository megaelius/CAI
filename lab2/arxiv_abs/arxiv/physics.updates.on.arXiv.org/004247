Recent advances in our understanding of thermal transport in nanocrystalline systems are responsible
for the integration of new technologies into advanced energy systems, including thermoelectric
refrigeration systems and renewable energy platforms. However, there is little understanding
of heat energy transport mechanisms that govern the thermal properties of disordered nanocomposites.
In this work, we explore thermal transport mechanisms in disordered packings of amorphous nanoparticles
with and without a polymer filling the interstices in order to quantify the impact of thermal boundary
scattering introduced at nanoparticle edges in an already amorphous system and within the context
of a minimum thermal conductivity approximation. By fitting a modified minimum thermal conductivity
model to temperature-dependent measurements of thermal conductivity from 80 K to 300 K, we find
that the interstitial polymer {\it eliminates} boundary scattering in the disordered nanoparticle
packing, which surprisingly leads to an {\it increase} in the overall thermal conductivity of the
disordered nanoparticle thin-film composite. This is contrary to our expectations relative to
effective medium theory and our understanding of a minimum thermal conductivity limit. Instead,
we find that a stiff interstitial material improves the transmission of heat through a nanoparticle
boundary, improving the thermal properties of disordered nanoparticle packing. We expect these
results to provide insight into the tunability of thermal properties in disordered solids that
exhibit already low thermal conductivities through the use of nanostructuring and vibrational
thermal bridging.
