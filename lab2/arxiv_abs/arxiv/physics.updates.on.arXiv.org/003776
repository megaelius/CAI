This work presents an overview of the spatial resolution criteria in classical optics, digital
optics and holography. Although the classical Abbe and Rayleigh resolution criteria have been
thoroughly discussed in the literature, there are still several issues which still need to be addressed,
for example the axial resolution criterion for coherent and incoherent radiation, which is a crucial
parameter of three-dimensional (3D) imaging, the resolution criteria in the Fresnel regime, and
the lateral and axial resolution criteria in digital optics and holography. This work discusses
these issues and provides a simple guide for which resolution criteria should be applied in each
particular imaging scheme: coherent/incoherent, far- and near-field, lateral and axial resolution.
Different resolution criteria such as two-point resolution and the resolution obtained from the
image spectrum (diffraction pattern) are compared and demonstrated with simulated examples.
Resolution criteria for spatial lateral and axial resolution are derived, and their application
in imaging with coherent and incoherent (noncoherent) waves is considered. It is shown that for
coherent light, the classical Abbe and Rayleigh resolution criteria do not provide an accurate
estimation of the lateral and axial resolution. Lateral and axial resolution criteria based on
an evaluation of the spectrum of the diffracted wave provide a more precise estimation of the resolution
for coherent and incoherent light. It is also shown that resolution criteria derived in approximation
of the far-field imaging regime can be applied for the near-field (Fresnel) regime.
