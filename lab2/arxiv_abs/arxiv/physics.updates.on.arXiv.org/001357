We examine the Backus average of a stack of isotropic layers overlying an isotropic halfspace to
examine its applicability for the quasi-Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion curves, both of which
apply to the same model. We compare these curves to values obtained for the stack of discrete layers
using the propagator matrix. The Backus average is applicable only for thin layers or low frequencies.
This is true for both weakly inhomogeneous layers resulting in a weakly anisotropic medium and strongly
inhomogeneous alternating layers resulting in a strongly anisotropic medium. We also compare
the strongly anisotropic and weakly anisotropic media, given by the Backus averages, to results
obtained by the isotropic Voigt averages of these media. As expected, we find only a small difference
between these results for weak anisotropy and a large difference for strong anisotropy. We perform
the Backus average for a stack of alternating transversely isotropic layers that is strongly inhomogeneous
to evaluate the dispersion curves for the resulting medium. We compare these curves to values obtained
using a propagator matrix for that stack of discrete layers. Again, there is a good match only for
thin layers or low frequencies. Finally, we perform the Backus average for a stack of nonalternating
transversely isotropic layers that is strongly inhomogeneous, and evaluate the quasi-Rayleigh
wave dispersion curves for the resulting transversely isotropic medium. We compare these curves
to values obtained using the propagator matrix for the stack of discrete layers. In this case, the
Backus average performs less well, but---for the fundamental mode---remains adequate for low
frequencies or thin layers.
