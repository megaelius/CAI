A Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation including the effect of Landau damping is derived to study the
propagation of weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive ion acoustic waves in a collisionless unmagnetized
plasma consisting of warm adiabatic ions and two different species of electrons at different temperatures.
The hotter energetic electron species follows the nonthermal velocity distribution of Cairns
et al. [Geophys. Res. Lett. 22, 2709 (1995)] whereas the cooler electron species obeys the Boltzmann
distribution. It is found that the coefficient of the nonlinear term of this KdV like evolution equation
vanishes along different family of curves in different parameter planes. In this context, a modified
KdV (MKdV) equation including the effect of Landau damping effectively describes the nonlinear
behaviour of ion acoustic waves. It has also been observed that the coefficients of the nonlinear
terms of the KdV and MKdV like evolution equations including the effect of Landau damping, are simultaneously
equal to zero along a family of curves in the parameter plane. In this situation, we have derived a
further modified KdV (FMKdV) equation including the effect of Landau damping to describe the nonlinear
behaviour of ion acoustic waves. In fact, different modified KdV like evolution equations including
the effect of Landau damping have been derived to describe the nonlinear behaviour of ion acoustic
waves in different region of parameter space. The method of Ott & Sudan [Phys. Fluids 12, 2388 (1969)]
has been applied to obtain the solitary wave solution of the evolution equation having the nonlinear
term $(\phi^{(1)})^{r}\frac{\partial \phi^{(1)}}{\partial \xi}$, where $\phi^{(1)}$ is the
first order perturbed electrostatic potential and $r =1,2,3$. We have found that the amplitude
of the solitary wave solution decreases with time for all $r =1,2,3$.
