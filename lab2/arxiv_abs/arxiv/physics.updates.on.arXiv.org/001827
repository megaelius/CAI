Natural organisms such as photosynthetic bacteria, algae, and plants employ complex molecular
machinery to convert solar energy into biochemical fuel. An important common feature shared by
most of these photosynthetic organisms is that they capture photons in the form of excitons typically
delocalized over a few to tens of pigment molecules embedded in protein environments of light harvesting
complexes (LHCs). Delocalized excitons created in such LHCs remain well protected despite being
swayed by environmental fluctuations, and are delivered successfully to their destinations over
hundred nanometer length scale distances in about hundred picosecond time scales. Decades of experimental
and theoretical investigation have produced a large body of information offering insights into
major structural, energetic, and dynamical features contributing to LHCs' extraordinary capability
to harness photons using delocalized excitons. The objective of this review is (i) to provide a comprehensive
account of major theoretical, computational, and spectroscopic advances that have contributed
to this body of knowledge, and (ii) to clarify the issues concerning the role of delocalized excitons
in achieving efficient energy transport mechanisms. The focus of this review is on three representative
systems, Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex of green sulfur bacteria, light harvesting 2 complex of
purple bacteria, and phycobiliproteins of cryptophyte algae. Although we offer more in-depth
and detailed description of theoretical and computational aspects, major experimental results
and their implications are also assessed in the context of achieving excellent light harvesting
functionality. Future theoretical and experimental challenges to be addressed in gaining better
understanding and utilization of delocalized excitons are also discussed.
