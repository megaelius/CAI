Directly tracking an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) by widely separated spacecrafts
is a great challenge. However, such an event could provide us a good opportunity to study the evolution
of embedded Alfv\'enic fluctuations (AFs) inside ICME and their contributions to local plasma
heating directly. In this study, an ICME observed by Wind at 1.0 au on March 4-6 1998 is tracked to the
location of Ulysess at 5.4 au. AFs are commonly found inside the ICME at 1.0 au, with an occurrence
rate of 21.7% and at broadband frequencies from 4$\times 10^{-4}$ to 5$\times 10^{-2}$ Hz. When
the ICME propagates to 5.4 au, the Aflv\'enicity decreases significantly, and AFs are rare and only
found at few localized frequencies with the occurrence rate decreasing to 3.0%. At the same time,
the magnetic field intensity at the AF-rich region has an extra magnetic dissipation except ICME
expansion effect. The energetics of the ICME at different radial distance is also investigated
here. Under similar magnetic field intensity situations at 1.0 au, the turbulence cascade rate
at the AF-rich region is much larger than the value at the AF-lack region. Moreover, it can maintain
as the decrease of magnetic field intensity if there is lack of AFs. However, when there exists many
AFs, it reduces significantly as the AFs disappear. The turbulence cascade dissipation rate within
the ICME is inferred to be 1622.3 $J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot s^{-1}$, which satisfies the requirement
of local ICME plasma heating rate, 1653.2 $J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot s^{-1}$. We suggest that AF dissipation
is responsible for extra magnetic dissipation and local plasma heating inside ICME.
