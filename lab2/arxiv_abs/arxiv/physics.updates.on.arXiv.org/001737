Although the third law of thermodynamics was established almost a century ago, it is not yet universally
considered to be a fundamental law of physics. A major problem is that there are many materials having
residual entropy. Amorphous materials and random alloy systems are well-known examples. A conventional
view is that amorphous materials are not in thermodynamic equilibrium and must be exempted from
the law. The recent development of material sciences has let to a variety of new materials. Some of
them have ambiguous structures which do not fit the qualitative description of metastability.
The definition of order states also becomes vague. The establishment of an unambiguous statement
which does not depend on the material properties is required. This paper provides a quantitative
expression for the third law to meet this requirement. The idea is to introduce the notion of class.
Every system belongs to a class. Different classes are thermodynamically separated by special
internal constraints which are quantified by the frozen coordinate, r. A frozen coordinate is a
state variable that is not commonly possessed between two classes. The third law is restated as all
materials within a given class have a common origin of entropy. For two systems belonging to different
classes, the entropy origins are shifted by the difference in entropy associated with the difference
r between the two systems. When the internal constraint is removed, the entropy origin must be reconstructed
in order to establish only one thermodynamic equilibrium. This process is irreversible and this
irreversibility is observed as the residual entropy. On the basis of this refinement, the residual
entropies of amorphous materials as well as the long-standing problem of mixed states can be treated
on an equal footing.
