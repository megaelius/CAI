We present numerical simulations, using two complementary setups, of rotating Boussinesq thermal
convection in a three-dimensional Cartesian geometry with misaligned gravity and rotation vectors.
This model represents a small region at a non-polar latitude in the convection zone of a star or planet.
We investigate the effects of rotation on the bulk properties of convection at different latitudes,
focusing on determining the relation between the heat flux and temperature gradient. We show that
our results may be interpreted using rotating mixing length theory (RMLT). The simplest version
of RMLT (due to Stevenson) considers the single mode that transports the most heat. This works reasonably
well in explaining our results, but there is a systematic departure from these predictions (up to
approximately $30\%$ in the temperature gradient) at mid-latitudes. We develop a more detailed
treatment of RMLT that includes the transport afforded by multiple modes, and we show that this accounts
for most of the systematic differences. We also show that convectively-generated zonal flows and
meridional circulations are produced in our simulations, and that their properties depend strongly
on the dimensions of the box. These flows also affect the heat transport, contributing to departures
from RMLT at some latitudes. However, we find the theoretical predictions of the multi-mode theory
for the mid-layer temperature gradient, the root-mean-square (RMS) vertical velocity, the RMS
temperature fluctuation, and the spatial spectrum of the heat transport at different latitudes,
are all in reasonably good agreement with our numerical results when zonal flows are small.
