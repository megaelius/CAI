Vlasiator is a new hybrid-Vlasov plasma simulation code aimed at simulating the entire magnetosphere
of the Earth. The code treats ions (protons) kinetically through Vlasov's equation in the six-dimensional
phase space while electrons are a massless charge-neutralizing fluid [M. Palmroth et al., Journal
of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 99, 41 (2013); A. Sandroos et al., Parallel Computing
39, 306 (2013)]. For first global simulations of the magnetosphere, it is critical to verify and
validate the model by established methods. Here, as part of the verification of Vlasiator, we characterize
the low-$\beta$ plasma wave modes described by this model and compare with the solution computed
by the Waves in Homogeneous, Anisotropic Multicomponent Plasmas (WHAMP) code [K. R\"onnmark,
Kiruna Geophysical Institute Reports 179 (1982)], using dispersion curves and surfaces produced
with both programs. The match between the two fundamentally different approaches is excellent
in the low-frequency, long wavelength range which is of interest in global magnetospheric simulations.
The left-hand and right-hand polarized wave modes as well as the Bernstein modes in the Vlasiator
simulations agree well with the WHAMP solutions. Vlasiator allows a direct investigation of the
importance of the Hall term by including it in or excluding it from Ohm's law in simulations. This
is illustrated showing examples of waves obtained using the ideal Ohm's law and Ohm's law including
the Hall term. Our analysis emphasizes the role of the Hall term in Ohm's law in obtaining wave modes
departing from ideal magnetohydrodynamics in the hybrid-Vlasov model.
