Here, we trap and control the position of droplets to study their dynamics using hydrodynamic forces
alone without an external field. The hydrodynamic trap is adapted from a previously implemented
Stokes trap by incorporating a drop-on-demand system to generate droplets at a T-junction geometry
on the same microfluidic chip. We then study confined droplet dynamics in response to perturbation
by applying a millisecond-pressure pulse to deform trapped droplets. Droplet shape relaxation
after cessation of the pressure pulse follows an exponential decay. The characteristic droplet
shape relaxation time is obtained from the shape decay curves for aqueous glycerol droplets of varying
viscosities in the dispersed phase with light and heavy mineral oils in the continuous phase. Systems
were chosen to provide similar equilibrium interfacial tensions (5-10 mN/m) with wide variations
of viscosity ratios. It is found that the droplet shape relaxation shows a strong dependence on droplet
radius, and a weak dependence on the ratio of dispersed to continuous phase viscosity. The relaxation
time is smaller for the highest viscosity ratios, potentially indicating that the dominant viscosity
controls the droplet shape relaxation time in addition to the interfacial tension and droplet size.
Droplet shape relaxation time can be used inform the response of droplets in an emulsion when subjected
to transient flows in various processing conditions. Finally, an application of this platform
for directly visualizing individual droplet coalescence in a planar extensional flow is presented.
The microfluidic four-channel hydrodynamic trap can thus be applied for studying fundamental
physics of droplet deformation and droplet-droplet interactions on the micro-scale to provide
an enhanced understanding of emulsion behavior on an individual droplet level.
