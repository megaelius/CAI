We consider the management of sloping, long and thin, coastal aquifers. We first develop a simple
mathematical model, based on Darcy flow for porous media, which gives the water table height, and
the flow velocity as a function of the underground seepage rate, the recharge rates and the extraction
rates, neglecting sea water intrusion. We then validate the model with recent data from the Germasogeia
aquifer which caters for most of the water demand in the area of Limassol, Cyprus. The data is provided
over a three year period by the Cyprus Water Development Department (WDD), the governmental department
managing the aquifer. Furthermore, based on our model, we subsequently develop an optimised recharge
strategy and identify the optimal recharge rates for a desired extracted water volume while the
water table height is maintained at the acceptable level. We study several scenarios of practical
interest and we find that we can achieve considerable water savings, compared to the current empirical
strategy followed by WDD. Additionally, we model the transport of pollutants in the aquifer in the
case of accidental leakage, using an advection-diffusion equation. We find that in the case of an
undetected and unhindered contamination (worst case scenario) the aquifer would get polluted
in about three years. Also, we find that double recharge rates flush the pollutant out of the aquifer
faster. Finally, to incorporate the possibility of sea water intrusion, which can render aquifers
unusable, we develop a new, transient two-dimensional model of groundwater flow based on the Darcy-Brinkman
equations, and determine the position of the water table and the seawater-freshwater interface
for conditions of drought, moderate rainfall and flooding. The validation of the new seawater intrusion
modelling approach has been carried out via comparison with a widely-accepted code.
