In systems accreting well below the Eddington rate, the plasma in the innermost regions of the disk
is collisionless and two-temperature, with the ions hotter than the electrons. Yet, whether a collisionless
faster-than-Coulomb energy transfer mechanism exists in two-temperature accretion flows is
still an open question. We study the physics of electron heating during the growth of ion velocity-space
instabilities, by means of multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. A large-scale
compression - embedded in a novel form of the PIC equations - continuously amplifies the field. This
constantly drives a pressure anisotropy P_perp > P_parallel, due to the adiabatic invariance
of the particle magnetic moments. We find that, for ion plasma beta values beta_i ~ 5-30 appropriate
for the midplane of low-luminosity accretion flows, mirror modes dominate if the electron-to-proton
temperature ratio is > 0.2, whereas if it is < 0.2 the ion cyclotron instability triggers the
growth of strong Alfven-like waves, that pitch-angle scatter the ions to maintain marginal stability.
We develop an analytical model of electron heating during the growth of the ion cyclotron instability,
which we validate with PIC simulations. We find that for cold electrons (beta_e < m_e/m_i), the
electron energy gain is controlled by the magnitude of the E-cross-B velocity induced by the ion
cyclotron waves. This term is independent of the initial electron temperature, so it provides a
solid energy floor even for electrons starting with extremely low temperatures. On the other hand,
the electron energy gain for beta_e > m_e/m_i - governed by the conservation of the magnetic moment
in the growing fields of the instability - is proportional to the initial electron temperature.
Our results have implications for two-temperature accretion flows as well as the solar wind and
intracluster plasmas. [abridged]
