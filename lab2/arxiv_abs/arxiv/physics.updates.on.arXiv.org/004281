The room temperature pump-probe X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) measurements used for serial
femtosecond crystallography provide remarkable information about the structures of the catalytic
(S-state) intermediates of the oxygen-evolution reaction of photosystem II. However, mixed populations
of these intermediates and moderate resolution limit the interpretation of the data from current
experiments. The S3 XFEL structures show extra density near the OEC that may correspond to a water/hydroxide
molecule. However, in the latest structure, this additional oxygen is 2.08 {\AA} from the Oe2 of
D1-E189, which is closer than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two oxygens. Here, we use Boltzmann
statistics and Monte Carlo sampling to provide a model for the S2-to-S3 state transition, allowing
structural changes and the insertion of an additional water/hydroxide. Based on our model, water/hydroxide
addition to the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) is not thermodynamically favorable in the S2 g = 2
state, but it is in the S2 g = 4.1 redox isomer. Thus, formation of the S3 state starts by a transition
from the S2 g = 2 to the S2 g = 4.1 structure. Then, electrostatic interactions support protonation
of D1-H190 and deprotonation of the Ca2+-ligated water (W3) with proton loss to the lumen. The W3
hydroxide moves toward Mn4, completing the coordination shell of Mn4 and moving with its oxidation
to Mn(IV) in the S3 state. In addition, binding additional hydroxide to Mn1 leads to a conformational
change of D1-E189 in the S2 g = 4.1 and S3 structures. In the S3 state in the population of protonated
D1-E189 increases.
