Default values for many model parameters in Numerical Weather Prediction models are typically
adopted based on theoretical or experimental investigations by scheme designers. Short-range
forecasts are substantially affected by the specification of parameters in the Weather Research
and Forecasting (WRF) model. The presence of a multitude of parameters and several output variables
in the WRF model renders appropriate parameter value identification quite challenging. The objective
of the current study is to reduce the uncertainty in the model outcomes through the recognition of
parameters that strongly influence the model performance using a Global Sensitivity Analysis
(GSA) method. Morris one-step-at-a-time (MOAT), GSA method, is used to identify the sensitivities
of 23 chosen tunable parameters corresponding to seven physical parameterization schemes of the
WRF model. The sensitivity measures (MOAT mean and standard deviation) are evaluated for eleven
output variables, out of which some are surface meteorological variables and the remaining are
atmospheric variables, which are simulated by the WRF model with different parameters. Twelve
high-intensity four day precipitation events during the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) for the years
2015, 2016, and 2017 over the monsoon core region in India are considered for the study. Six out of
23 parameters have high MOAT mean in the case of almost all the model output variables indicating
that these parameters have a considerable effect on the outcome of the simulations. MOAT mean values
of a few parameters are noticeably small for all the model output variables, and thus the uncertainty
associated with them has a negligible effect on the WRF model performance. The study also presents
the physical insights into the trends of the parameter sensitivity.
