In the early universe, following the nucleosynthesis, conditions were right for recombination
processes to take place yielding neutral atoms H, He and Li. The understanding so far in astrophysics
is that the first molecule to be formed was HeH+ by radiative association (He + H+ -> HeH+ + h(nu) and
He+ + H -> HeH+ + h(nu). The recent report by Guesten et al (Nature, 568, 357, 2019) of detection of HeH+
in planetary Nebula NGC 7027 confirms its presence, but it does not conclusively prove the origin
of this species. To create molecules from free moving quasi-ions surrounded by an electronic cloud,
the Born-Oppenheimer-Huang (BOH) theory furnishes two kinds of forces, namely, one that results
from the Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) and the other from Non-Adiabatic Coupling Terms (NACTs).
Whereas the PESs are known to manage slow moving quasi-ions the NACTs, with their, frequently, infinitely
large values at the vicinity of the singularities can control the fast moving quasi-ions. To achieve
that the BOH equation indicates that the NACTs are affecting the fast moving quasi-ions directly
and if they are attributed with dissipative features or in other words to behave as a Friction Force
they indeed could serve (like any other ordinary friction) as moderators for the fast atomic(ionic)
species. It is proposed in the present paper that the triatomic HeH2+ was the precursor to HeH+ and
it could have been formed by the (He, H, H)+ nuclei coming together under the electron cloud, facilitated
by the NACTs between different electronic states acting as an astronomical friction force. This
is possible because of the singularities in the NACTs for triatomic systems and NOT for diatomic
systems. Although the existence of HeH2+ was established in the laboratory in 1996, it has not been
detected in the interstellar media so far. But, there is no reason why it cannot be detected in near
future.
