We investigate the dynamical effects of non-Gaussian asymmetric stable L\'evy fluctuations on
the evolution of the transcription factor activator in a genetic regulation system. The noisy fluctuations
arise from the synthesis reaction rate. We compute two deterministic quantities, the mean first
exit time (MFET) and the first escape probability (FEP), in order to examine the likelihood for transcriptions:
The mean time scale for the system exits the low concentration state (the longer the exit time, the
less likely for transcription) and the switch probability from low concentration states to high
concentration states (corresponding to likelihood for transcription). By focusing on the impact
of skewness (i.e., non-symmetry) in the probability distributions of noise, we find that the fluctuations
in the synthesis reaction rate lead to peculiar transitions to high concentrations and thus to possible
transcriptions, such as realizing higher likelihood of transcription for larger positive skewness
(i.e., asymmetry) index $\beta$, causing a bifurcation for the likelihood of transcription at
the critical non-Gaussianity index value $\alpha=1$ (i.e., beyond which the likelihood for transcription
suddenly increases), and achieving a turning point at the threshold value $\beta \approx 0.55$
(i.e., beyond which the likelihood for transcription reversed for $\alpha$ values). The bifurcation
and turning point phenomena do not occur in the symmetric noise case ($\beta =0$). We conduct a series
of numerical experiments about `regulating' the likelihood of gene transcription by tuning asymmetric
stable L\'evy noise indexes. These offer insights for possible ways of achieving gene regulation
in experimental research.
