Scalable, high speed data transfer between cryogenic (0.1-4 K) and room temperature environments
is instrumental in a broad range of fields including quantum computing, superconducting electronics,
single photon imaging and space-based communications. A promising approach to overcome the limitations
of conventional wire-based readout is the use of optical fiber communication. Optical fiber presents
a 100-1,000x lower heat load than conventional electrical wiring, relaxing the requirements for
thermal anchoring, and is also immune to electromagnetic interference, which allows routing of
sensitive signals with improved robustness to noise and crosstalk. Most importantly, optical
fibers allow for very high bandwidth densities (in the Tbps/mm$^2$ range) by carrying multiple
signals through the same physical fiber (Wavelength Division Multiplexing, WDM). Here, we demonstrate
for the first time optical readout of a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD)
directly coupled to a CMOS photonic modulator, without the need for an interfacing device. By operating
the modulator in the forward bias regime at a temperature of 3.6 K, we achieve very high modulation
efficiency (1000-10,000 pm/V) and a low input impedance of 500 $\Omega$ with a low power dissipation
of 40 $\mu$W. This allows us to obtain optical modulation with the low, millivolt-level signal generated
by the SNSPD. Optical communication is becoming the preferred I/O solution in modern, room temperature
high performance systems, and this work demonstrates its suitability for scalable cryogenic readout,
which could help achieve the full potential of superconducting technologies.
