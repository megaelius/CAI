In this paper, we proposed the GLHUA double layer cloak; proved the properties of GLHUA double layer
cloak; Using GL no scattering inversion and the pre cloak condition 6.1 to 6.4 in paper [1], we create
GLHUA outer layer cloak radial relative parameter and angular relative parameter theoretically.
We proved theorem 4.1 to theorem 4.4 that the phase velocity of the electromagnetic wave in GLHUA
outer layer cloak is less than light speed and tends to zero at the boundary $r=R_1$, the EM wave tends
to zero at $r=R1$; When source $r_s > R_2$ in the outside of the cloak and observer $r_o < R_o$ in the
concealment, then $\vec E(\vec r_o)=0$ and $\vec H(\vec r_o)=0$ that is proved in theorem 5.1 and
5.3. We prove that the EM wave excited in outside of the cloak can not propagation penetrate into the
concealment. In theorem 5.4 to 5.6, we rigorously proved the EM wave excited in outside of the cloak
can not be disturbed by the cloak. In theorem 6.1 to theorem 6.6, we prove that the EM wave excited in
the concealment can not propagate to outside of GLHUA inner cloak. we prove that the EM wave excited
in the concealment can not be disturbed by the cloak. We theoretically prove that the GLHUA double
cloak is invisible cloak with concealment and with relative parameter not less than 1; the GLHUA
double layer cloak is practicable. In December of 2016, we submitted 3 papers to arXiv for GLHUA double
layer cloak with relative parameters not less than 1. This is the third paper. The task and content
of the three paper are different from each other. The second paper [1] and this Paper are theoretical
base and proof of the subjects in paper arXiv:1612.02857. We find an exact analytical EM wave field
of Maxwell EM equation in GLHUA cloak and mirage bridge wave. Patent of the GLHUA EM cloaks,GLHUA
sphere and GL modeling and inversion methods are reserved by authors in GL Geophysical Laboratory.
