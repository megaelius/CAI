$ $From June--September, the summer monsoon current (SMC) flows eastward south of Sri Lanka and
bends northeastward to form a swift jet that enters the Bay of Bengal (BoB). As such, it is a crucial
part of the water exchange between the Arabian Sea (AS) and BoB. The processes that determine the
evolution, intensification and meandering of the SMC are only partly understood. They involve
both local and remote forcing by the wind, as well as interactions with westward-propagating Rossby
waves and eddies. In this study, we investigate these processes using an Indian-Ocean general circulation
model (MOM4p1) that is capable of simulating the SMC realistcally. Because eddies and meanders
are smoothed out in the climatology, our analyses focus on a single year of 2009, a period when a strong
anticyclonic bend in the SMC was observed. An eddy-kinetic-energy budget analysis shows the region
to be a zone of significant eddy activity, where both barotropic and baroclinic instabilities are
active. Based on the analysis, we classify the evolution of SMC into stages of onset, intensification,
anticyclonic bend, anticyclonic vortex formation, meandering and termination. In addition,
analysis of eddy-potential-vorticity flux and eddy-enstrophy decay reveal when, where, and how
the eddies tend to drive the mean flow. Rossby waves and westward-propagating eddies arriving from
the east energize the SMC in June and accelerate the mean flow through an up-gradient eddy-potential-vorticity
flux. At the same time, local winds also strengthen the flow, by increasing its mean, near-surface,
kinetic energy and raising isopycnals, the latter building up available potential energy (APE).
The baroclinic instability that takes place in late--July and early--August releases APE, thereby
generating the SMC meanders.
