We develop an axiomatic geometric approach and provide an unconventional review of modified gravity
theories, MGTs, with modified dispersion relations, MDRs, encoding Lorentz invariance violations,
LIVs, classical and quantum random effects, anisotropies etc. There are studied Lorentz-Finsler
like theories elaborated as extensions of general relativity, GR, and quantum gravity, QG, models
and constructed on (co) tangent Lorentz bundles, i.e. (curved) phase spaces or locally anisotropic
spacetimes. An indicator of MDRs is considered as a functional on various type functions depending
on phase space coordinates and physical constants. It determines respective generating functions
and fundamental physical objects (generalized metrics, connections and nonholonomic frame structures)
for relativistic models of Finsler, Lagrange and/or Hamilton spaces. We show that there are canonical
almost symplectic differential forms and adapted (non) linear connections which allow us to formulate
equivalent almost K\"{a}hler-Lagrange / - Hamilton geometries. This way, it is possible to unify
geometrically various classes of (non) commutative MGTs with locally anisotropic gravitational,
scalar, non-Abelian gauge field, and Higgs interactions. We elaborate on theories with Lagrangian
densities containing massive graviton terms and bi-connection and bi-metric modifications which
can be modelled as Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometries. An appendix contains historical remarks
on elaborating Finsler MGTs and a summary of author's results in twenty directions of research on
(non) commutative/ supersymmetric Finsler geometry and gravity; nonholonomic geometric flows,
locally anisotropic superstrings and cosmology, etc.
