Upgrading the productivity of nanoparticles (NPs), generated by pulsed laser ablation in liquid
(PLAL), still remains challenging. Here a novel variant of PLAL was developed, where a doubled frequency
Nd:YAG laser beam (532 nm, ~ 5 ns, 10 Hz) at different fluences and for different times was directed
into a sealed vessel, toward the interface of the meniscus of ethanol with a tilted bulk metal target.
Palladium, copper and silver NPs, synthesized in the performed proof of concept experiments, were
mass quantified, by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and characterized
by ultraviolet-visible extinction spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray
diffraction. The NPs consist of crystalline metals of a few nm size and their ablation rates and agglomeration
levels depend on the employed laser fluences. The ensuing laser power-specific productivity curves
for each metal, peaked at specific laser fluences, were fitted to the results of a simple model accounting
for plasma absorption and heat transfer. The resulting peaked yields and concentrations were more
than an order of magnitude higher than those obtained for totally immersed targets. Besides, the
measured productivities showed nearly linear dependencies during time intervals up to 30 min of
ablation, but became saturated at 1 h, due to accumulation of a significant number of NPs along the
laser beam path, reducing the laser intensity reaching the target. This suggested approach could
inspire future studies that will contribute to further developments of efficient generation of
NPs with controlled characteristics.
