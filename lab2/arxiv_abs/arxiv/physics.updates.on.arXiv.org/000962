Brownian Dynamics simulations are an important tool for modeling the dynamics of soft matter. However,
accurate and rapid computations of the hydrodynamic interactions between suspended, microscopic
components in a soft material is a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a new method
for Brownian Dynamics simulations of suspended colloidal scale particles subject to an important
class of hydrodynamic constraints with practically linear scaling of the computational cost with
the number of particles modeled. Specifically, we consider the "stresslet" constraint for which
suspended particles resist local deformation. The presented method is an extension of the recently
reported positively-split formulation for Ewald summation of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY)
mobility tensor to higher order (dipole) terms in the hydrodynamic scattering series [Andrew M.
Fiore et al. The Journal of Chemical Physics, 146(12):124116, 2017]. The hydrodynamic mobility
tensor, which is proportional to the covariance of particle Brownian displacements, is constructed
as an Ewald sum in a novel way that guarantees the real-space and wave-space sums are independently
positive-definite for all possible particle configurations. This property is leveraged to rapidly
sample the Brownian displacements from a superposition of statistically independent processes
with the wave-space and real-space contributions as respective covariances. The cost of computing
the Brownian displacements in this way is comparable to the cost of computing the deterministic
displacements. Addition of a stresslet constraint to the over-damped particle equations of motion
leads to a stochastic differential algebraic equation (SDAE) of index 1, which is integrated in
time using a mid-point integration scheme that implicitly produces displacements consistent
with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the constrained system.
