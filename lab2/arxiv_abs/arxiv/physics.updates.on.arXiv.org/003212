In this work we explore the potential of a new data-driven approach to the design of exchange-correlation
(XC) functionals. The approach, inspired by convolutional filters in computer vision and surrogate
functions from optimization, utilizes convolutions of the electron density to form a feature space
to represent local electronic environments and neural networks to map the features to the exchange-correlation
energy density. These features are orbital free, and provide a systematic route to including information
at various length scales. This work shows that convolutional descriptors are theoretically capable
of an exact representation of the electron density, and proposes Maxwell-Cartesian spherical
harmonic kernels as a class of rotationally invariant descriptors for the construction of machine-learned
functionals. The approach is demonstrated using data from the B3LYP functional on a number of small-molecules
containing C, H, O, and N along with a neural network regression model. The machine-learned functionals
are compared to standard physical approximations and the accuracy is assessed for the absolute
energy of each molecular system as well as formation energies. The results indicate that it is possible
to reproduce B3LYP formation energies to within chemical accuracy using orbital-free descriptors
with a spatial extent of 0.2 A. The findings provide empirical insight into the spatial range of electron
exchange, and suggest that the combination of convolutional descriptors and machine-learning
regression models is a promising new framework for XC functional design, although challenges remain
in obtaining training data and generating models consistent with pseudopotentials.
