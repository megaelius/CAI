Detailed analysis of efficiency and pollutant emission characteristics of practical turbulent
combustion devices using complex combustion kinetics often depend on the interactions between
the combustion chemistry involving both gasses species and soot, and turbulent flow characteristics.
Modeling of such combustion system often requires the use of chemical kinetic mechanisms with hundreds
of species and thousands of reactions. Perfectly stirred reactors (PSR) are idealized reactor
environments, where the reacting species have high rate of stirring, and the combustion products
are uniformly distributed inside the reactor. PSRs have been found very useful in the study of flame
stabilization, prediction of pollutants such as NOx formation, development and testing chemical
reaction mechanisms, and investigation of soot formation and growth. The fundamental equations
describing a PSR constitute systems of highly nonlinear algebraic equations, due to the complex
relationship between the net production rate of the species and the species concentration, which
ultimately makes the equations stiff, and the solution of such equations become highly compute-intensive
leading to the need for a efficient and robust solution algorithms. Graphics processing units (GPUs)
have widely been used in the past as a cost-effective alternate to central processing units (CPUs),
and highly parallel threads of GPUs can be used in a efficient manner to improve the performance of
such algorithms for speeding up the calculations. A highly parallelized GPU implementation is
presented for a batched calculation of PSR model, using a robust and efficient non-linear solver
for gas phase chemical reactions and is further coupled to one of the widely used moment
