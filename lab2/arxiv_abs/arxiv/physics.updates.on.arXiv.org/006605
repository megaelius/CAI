Purpose: To describe a concept of a compact electron accelerator for external radiation therapy
with variable energy in the range of 6 - 20 MeV, based on linotron principle. Methods: Beam dynamics
simulation using the CST and MAD-X code. Various optimization methods of multi-parameter problem.
Results: Our accelerator differs from the Reflexotron in a number of essential details: a much more
compact and more efficient C-band accelerating structure, optimized for the high capture efficiency,
narrow energy and phase spectra, and low transverse emittance; magnetic mirror with fixed field
based on rare-earth permanent magnets; three-electrode electron gun with off-axis placement
of the cathode with a current regulated in the range of two orders of magnitude. These improvements
allow the possibility to: adjust the accelerated beam current in a wide range in accordance with
the required energy; reduce parasitic losses of the beam current and the associated parasitic radiation;
eliminate the risk of setting an erroneous energy value; significantly reduce the dimensions of
the accelerator and simplify its operation. Conclusions: We presented the results of calculation
of the electron accelerator for external radiation therapy in the energy range of 6 - 20 MeV. The accelerator
is based on the principle of double beam acceleration in the same accelerating structure, which
allows to control the beam energy in a wide range, reduce RF power consumption and the dimensions
of the accelerator, and, therefore, reduce its cost. The results can be used to develop the design
of the accelerator on the platform of the KLT-6 complex created by ROSATOM.
