Knowledge of ocean surface dynamics is crucial for oceanographic and climate research. The satellite-tracked
movements of hundreds of drifters deployed by research and voluntary observing vessels provide
high-frequency and high-resolution information on near-surface currents around the globe. Consequently,
they constitute a major component of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). However, maintaining
this array is costly and in some oceanic regions such as the tropics, spatio-temporal coverage is
limited. Here, we demonstrate that the GPS-buoy equipped fish aggregating devices (FADs) used
in tropical tuna fisheries to increase fish catchability are also capable of providing comparable
near-surface current information. We analyzed millions of position data collected between 2008
and 2014 from more than 15,000 FADs and 2,000 drifters, and combined this information with remotely-sensed
near-surface current data to demonstrate that the surface velocity components of FADs and drifters
are highly correlated in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. While it was noted that the subsurface structures
of FADs (typically made of recycled fishing nets) did slow them down relative to the drifters, particularly
in the Atlantic Ocean, this bias was measurable and could be accounted for in future studies. Our
findings show that the physical meteorological and oceanographic data collected by fishermen
could provide an invaluable source of information to the GOOS. Furthermore, by forging closer collaborations
with the fishing industry and ensuring their contributions to global ocean databases are properly
acknowledged, there is significant scope to capture this data more effectively.
