Fluid deformable surfaces are ubiquitous in cell and tissue biology, including lipid bilayers,
the actomyosin cortex, or epithelial cell sheets. These interfaces exhibit a complex interplay
between elasticity, low Reynolds number interfacial hydrodynamics, chemistry, and geometry,
and govern important biological processes such as cellular traffic, division, migration, or tissue
morphogenesis. To address the modelling challenges posed by this class of problems, in which interfacial
phenomena tightly interact with the shape and dynamics of the surface, we develop a general continuum
mechanics and computational framework for fluid deformable surfaces. The dual solid-fluid nature
of fluid deformable surfaces challenges classical Lagrangian or Eulerian descriptions of deforming
bodies. Here, we extend the notion of Arbitrarily Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulations, well-established
for bulk media, to deforming surfaces. To systematically develop models for fluid deformable surfaces,
which consistently treat all couplings between fields and geometry, we follow a nonlinear Onsager
formalism according to which the dynamics minimize a Rayleighian functional where dissipation,
power input and energy release rate compete. Finally, we propose new computational methods, which
build on Onsager's formalism and our ALE formulation, to deal with the resulting stiff system of
higher-order of partial differential equations. We apply our theoretical and computational methodology
to classical models for lipid bilayers and the cell cortex. The methods developed here allow us to
formulate/simulate these models for the first time in their full three-dimensional generality,
accounting for finite curvatures and finite shape changes.
