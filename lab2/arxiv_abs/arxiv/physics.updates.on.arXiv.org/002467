Motivated by the recent growing demand in dynamically-controlled flat optics, we take advantage
of a hybrid phase-change plasmonic metasurface (MS) to effectively tailor the amplitude, phase,
and polarization responses of the incident beam within a unique structure. Such a periodic architecture
exhibits two fundamental modes; pronounced counter-propagating short-range surface plasmon
polariton (SR-SPP) coupled to the Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) alloy as the feed gap, and the propagative surface
plasmon polariton (PR-SPP) resonant modes tunneling to the GST nanostripes. By leveraging the
multistate phase transition of alloy from amorphous to the crystalline, which induces significant
complex permittivity change, the interplay between such enhanced modes can be drastically modified.
Accordingly, in the intermediate phases, the proposed system experiences a coupled condition
of operational over-coupling and under-coupling regimes leading to an inherently broadband response.
We wisely addressing each gate-tunable meta-atom to achieve robust control over the reflection
characteristics, wide phase agility up to 315? or considerable reflectance modulation up to 60%,
which facilitate a myriad of on-demand optical functionalities in the telecommunication band.
Based on the revealed underlying physics and electro-thermal effects in the GST alloy, a simple
systematic approach for realization of an electro-optically tunable multifunctional metadevice
governing anomalous reflection angle control (e.g., phased array antenna), near-perfect absorption
(e.g., modulator), and polarization conversion (e.g., wave plate) is presented. As a promising
alternative to their passive counterparts, such high-speed, non-volatile MSs offer an smart paradigm
for reversible, energy-efficient, and programmable optoelectronic devices such as holograms,
switches, and polarimeters.
