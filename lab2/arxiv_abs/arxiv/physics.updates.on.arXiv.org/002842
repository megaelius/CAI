Originally complied for 1868-1967 and subsequently continued so that it now covers 150 years, the
$aa$ index has become a vital resource for studying space climate change. However, there have been
debates about the inter-calibration of data from the different stations. In addition, the effects
of secular change in the geomagnetic field have not previously been allowed for. As a result, the
components of the 'classical' $aa$ index for the southern and northern hemispheres ($aa_S$ and
$aa_N$) have drifted apart. We here separately correct both $aa_S$ and $aa_N$ for both these effects
using the same method as used to generate the classic $aa$ values but allowing ${\delta}$, the minimum
angular separation of each station from a nominal auroral oval, to vary as calculated using the IGRF-12
and gufm1 models of the intrinsic geomagnetic field. Our approach is to correct the quantized aK-values
for each station, originally scaled on the assumption that ${\delta}$ values are constant, with
time-dependent scale factors that allow for the drift in ${\delta}$. This requires revisiting
the intercalibration of successive stations used in making the $aa_S$ and $aa_N$ composites. These
intercalibrations are defined using independent data and daily averages from 11 years before and
after each station change and it is shown that they depend on the time of year. This procedure produces
new homogenized hemispheric aa indices, $aa_{HS}$ and $aa_{HN}$, which show centennial-scale
changes that are in very close agreement. Calibration problems with the classic $aa$ index are shown
to have arisen from drifts in ${\delta}$ combined with simpler corrections which gave an incorrect
temporal variation and underestimate the rise in $aa$ during the 20th century by about 15%.
