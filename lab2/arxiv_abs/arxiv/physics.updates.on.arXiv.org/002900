It is widely accepted that astrophysical magnetic fields are generated by dynamo action. In many
cases these fields exhibit organisation on a scale larger than that of the underlying turbulent
flow (e.g., the eleven-year solar cycle). The mechanism for the generation of so-called large scale
fields remains an open problem. In cases where the magnetic Reynolds number ($Rm$) is small, dynamo-generated
fields are coherent but at (the astrophysically relevant) high $Rm$, the fields are overwhelmed
by small scale fluctuating field. Recently Tobias and Cattaneo (2013) have shown that an imposed
large scale shear flow can suppress the small scale fluctuations and allow the large scale temporal
behaviour to emerge. Shear is also believed to modify the electromotive force by introducing correlations
between the flow and the field. However in previous models at high $Rm$ the shear is often artificially
imposed or driven by an arbitrary body force. Here we consider a simple kinematic model of a convective
dynamo in which shear is self consistently driven by the presence of a horizontal temperature gradient
(resulting in a thermal wind) and a rotation vector that is oblique to gravity. By considering a $2.5$-dimensional
system, we are able to reach high $Rm$ so that the dynamo approaches the asymptotic regime where the
growth rate becomes approximately independent of $Rm$. We find the flows studied here to be excellent
small-scale dynamos, but with very little systematic behaviour evident at large $Rm$. We attribute
this to being unable to self-consistently generate flows with both large (net) helicity and strong
shear in this setup.
