Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a non-invasive, non-contact and label-free
technique for biological and chemical sensing as THz-spectra is less energetic and lies in the characteristic
vibration frequency regime of proteins and DNA molecules. However, THz-TDS is less sensitive for
detection of micro-organisms of size equal to or less than $ \lambda/100 $ (where, $ \lambda $ is wavelength
of incident THz wave) and, molecules in extremely low concentrated solutions (like, a few femtomolar).
After successful high-throughput fabrication of nanostructures, nanoantennas and metamaterials
were found to be indispensable in enhancing the sensitivity of conventional THz-TDS. These nanostructures
lead to strong THz field enhancement which when in resonance with absorption spectrum of absorptive
molecules, causing significant changes in the magnitude of the transmission spectrum, therefore,
enhancing the sensitivity and allowing detection of molecules and biomaterials in extremely low
concentrated solutions. Hereby, we review the recent developments in ultra-sensitive and selective
nanogap biosensors. We have also provided an in-depth review of various high-throughput nanofabrication
techniques. We also discussed the physics behind the field enhancements in sub-skin depth as well
as sub-nanometer sized nanogaps. We introduce finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations tools to study THz biomolecular interactions. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive account of nanoantenna enhanced sensing of viruses (like, H1N1) and biomolecules
such as artificial sweeteners which are addictive and carcinogenic.
