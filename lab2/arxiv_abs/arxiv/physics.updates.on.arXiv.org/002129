We use finite element simulations in both the frequency and the time-domain to study the terahertz
resonance characteristics of a metamaterial (MM) comprising a spiral connected to a straight arm.
The MM acts as a RLC circuit whose resonance frequency can be precisely tuned by varying the characteristic
geometrical parameters of the spiral: inner and outer radius, width and number of turns. We provide
a simple analytical model that uses these geometrical parameters as input to give accurate estimates
of the resonance frequency. Finite element simulations show that linearly polarized terahertz
radiation efficiently couples to the MM thanks to the straight arm, inducing a current in the spiral,
which in turn induces a resonant magnetic field enhancement at the center of the spiral. We observe
a large (approximately 20 times) and uniform (over an area of $\sim 10~\mu m^{2}$) enhancement of
the magnetic field for narrowband terahertz radiation with frequency matching the resonance frequency
of the MM. When a broadband, single-cycle terahertz pulse propagates towards the metamaterial,
the peak magnetic field of the resulting band-passed waveform still maintains a 6-fold enhancement
compared to the peak impinging field. Using existing laser-based terahertz sources, our metamaterial
design allows to generate magnetic fields of the order of 2 T over a time scale of several picoseconds,
enabling the investigation of non-linear ultrafast spin dynamics in table-top experiments. Furthermore,
our MM can be implemented to generate intense near-field narrowband, multi-cycle electromagnetic
fields to study generic ultrafast resonant terahertz dynamics in condensed matter.
