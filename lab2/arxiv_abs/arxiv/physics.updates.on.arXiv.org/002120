In this investigation we use a simple model of the dynamics of an inviscid vortex sheet given by the
Birkhoff-Rott equation to obtain fundamental insights about the potential for stabilization
of shear layers using feedback control. As actuation we consider two arrays of point sinks/sources
located a certain distance above and below the vortex sheet and subject to the constraint that their
mass fluxes separately add up to zero. First, we demonstrate using analytical computations that
the Birkhoff-Rott equation linearized around the flat-sheet configuration is in fact controllable
when the number of actuator pairs is sufficiently large relative to the number of discrete degrees
of freedom present in the system, a result valid for generic actuator locations. Next we design a
state-based LQR stabilization strategy where the key difficulty is the numerical solution of the
Riccati equation in the presence of severe ill-conditioning resulting from the properties of the
Birkhoff-Rott equation and the chosen form of actuation, an issue which is overcome by performing
computations with a suitably increased arithmetic precision. Analysis of the linear closed-loop
system reveals exponential decay of the perturbation energy and of the corresponding actuation
energy in all cases. Computations performed for the nonlinear closed-loop system demonstrate
that initial perturbations of nonnegligible amplitude can be effectively stabilized when a sufficient
number of actuators is used. We also thoroughly analyze the sensitivity of the closed-loop stabilization
strategies to the variation of a number of key parameters. Subject to the known limitations of inviscid
vortex models, our findings indicate that, in principle, it may be possible to stabilize shear layers
for relatively large initial perturbations, provided the actuation has sufficiently many degrees
of freedom.
