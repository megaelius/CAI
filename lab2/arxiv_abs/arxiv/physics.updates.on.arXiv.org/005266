Currently available musculoskeletal inverse-dynamics thoracolumbar spine models are entirely
based on data from adults and might therefore not be applicable for simulations in children and adolescents.
In addition, these models lack lower extremities, which are required for comprehensive evaluations
of functional activities or therapeutic exercises. We therefore created OpenSim-based musculoskeletal
full-body models including a detailed thoracolumbar spine for children and adolescents aged 6-18
years and validated by comparing model predictions to in vivo data. After combining our recently
developed adult thoracolumbar spine model with a lower extremity model, children and adolescent
models were created for each year of age by adjusting segmental length and mass distribution, center
of mass positions and moments of inertia of the major body segments as well as sagittal pelvis and
spine alignment based on literature data. Similarly, muscle strength properties were adjusted
based on CT-derived cross-sectional area measurements. Simulations were conducted from in vivo
studies reported in the literature involving children and adolescents evaluating maximum trunk
muscle strength (MTMS), lumbar disc compressibility (LDC), intradiscal pressure (IDP) and trunk
muscle activity (MA). Model predictions correlated highly with in vivo data (MTMS: r>=0.82, p<=0.03;
LDC: r=0.77, p<0.001; IDP: r>=0.78, p<0.001; MA: r>=0.90, p<0.001), indicating suitability for
the reasonably accurate prediction of maximal trunk muscle strength, segmental loading and trunk
muscle activity in children and adolescents. When aiming at investigating children or adolescents
with pathologies such as idiopathic scoliosis, our models can serve as a basis for the creation of
deformed spine models and for comparative purposes.
