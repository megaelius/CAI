The Constitutionally mandated task of assigning Congressional seats to the various U.S. States
proportional to their represented populations ("according to their numbers") has engendered
much contention, but rather less consensus. Using the same principles of entropic inference that
underlie the foundations of information theory and statistical thermodynamics, and also enjoy
fruitful application in image processing, spectral analysis, machine learning, econometrics,
bioinformatics, and a growing number of other fields, we motivate and explore a method for Congressional
apportionment based on minimizing relative entropy (also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence),
or, equivalently, maximizing Shannon entropy. In terms of communication theory, we might say that
the entropic apportionment gives each constituent as equal a voice as possible. If we view representational
weight as a finite resource to be distributed amongst the represented population, the entropic
measure is identical with the Theil index long employed in economics to measure inequality in the
distribution of wealth or income, or in ecology to measure the distribution of biomass or reproductive
fitness. Besides Congressional apportionment, the method is also directly applicable to other
multi-regional or multi-constituency legislatures, to party-list proportional voting systems
used in various parliamentary elections, and similar settings, where the task is to allocate a discrete
number of seats or other resources, and the primary goal is one of maximal proportionality or equity.
In addition, the same entropic figure-of-merit can be used in parallel to compare different choices
for the total number of representatives, and then subsequently to assess different Congressional
district sizes, after seats are assigned and proposed district boundaries drawn.
