It is well-known that the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation admits both of the peaked and cusped solitary
waves in shallow water. However, it was an open question whether or not the exact wave equations can
admit them in finite water depth. Besides, it was traditionally believed that cusped solitary waves,
whose 1st-derivative tends to infinity at crest, are essentially different from peaked solitary
ones with finite 1st-derivative. Currently, based on the symmetry and the exact water wave equations,
Liao [1] proposed a unified wave model (UWM) for progressive gravity waves in finite water depth.
The UWM admits not only all traditional smooth progressive waves but also the peaked solitary waves
in finite water depth: in other words, the peaked solitary progressive waves are consistent with
the traditional smooth ones. In this paper, in the frame of the linearized UWM, we further give, for
the first time, the cusped solitary waves in finite water depth, and besides reveal a close relationship
between the cusped and peaked solitary waves: a cusped solitary wave is consist of an infinite number
of peaked solitary ones with the same phase speed, so that it can be regarded as a special peaked solitary
wave. This also well explains why and how a cuspon has an infinite 1st-derivative at crest. It is found
that, like peaked solitary waves, the vertical velocity of a cusped solitary wave in finite water
depth is also discontinuous at crest (x=0), and especially its phase speed has nothing to do with
wave height, too. In addition, it is unnecessary to consider whether the peaked/cusped solitary
waves given by the UWM are weak solution or not, since the governing equation is not necessary to be
satisfied at crest. All of these would deepen and enrich our understandings about the cusped solitary
waves.
