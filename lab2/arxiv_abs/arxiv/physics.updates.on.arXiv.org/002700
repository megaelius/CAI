Flocking refers to collective behavior of a large number of interacting entities, where the interactions
between discrete individuals produce collective motion on the large scale. We employ an agent-based
model to describe the microscopic dynamics of each individual in a flock, and use a fractional PDE
to model the evolution of macroscopic quantities of interest. The macroscopic models with phenomenological
interaction functions are derived by applying the continuum hypothesis to the microscopic model.
Instead of specifying the fPDEs with an ad hoc fractional order for nonlocal flocking dynamics,
we learn the effective nonlocal influence function in fPDEs directly from particle trajectories
generated by the agent-based simulations. We demonstrate how the learning framework is used to
connect the discrete agent-based model to the continuum fPDEs in 1D and 2D nonlocal flocking dynamics.
In particular, a Cucker-Smale particle model is employed to describe the microscale dynamics of
each individual, while Euler equations with nonlocal interaction terms are used to compute the
evolution of macroscale quantities. The trajectories generated by the particle simulations mimic
the field data of tracking logs that can be obtained experimentally. They can be used to learn the
fractional order of the influence function using a Gaussian process regression model implemented
with the Bayesian optimization. We show that the numerical solution of the learned Euler equations
solved by the finite volume scheme can yield correct density distributions consistent with the
collective behavior of the agent-based system. The proposed method offers new insights on how to
scale the discrete agent-based models to the continuum-based PDE models, and could serve as a paradigm
on extracting effective governing equations for nonlocal flocking dynamics directly from particle
trajectories.
