Chiroptical responses of helical superstructures are determined by collective behaviors of the
individual building blocks. In this paper, we present a full theoretical description of the collective
resonance in superstructures. We use the gold nanorods as individual building blocks and arrange
them helically along an axis in an end-to-end fashion. Numerical simulations on single-unit cells
reveal that the plasmonic coupling between the nanorods produces hybridized resonances, whose
intensity is strongly dependent on the excitation light with left- or right-handed circular polarizations
(LCP or RCP). A node-mode criterion is proposed on the basis of the microscopic mechanism, which
successfully explains the difference between LCP and RCP. We further demonstrate, by repeating
the unit cell from 1 to infinity along the helical axis, the multiple hybridized resonances gradually
evolve and merge into a single collective resonance, whose energy is also dependent on LCP and RCP.
An analytical description is provided for the collective resonance of the helical superstructure
on the basis of the coupled dipole approximation method. Our theory shows that n collective resonance
modes are present in the helical superstructure with the unit cell consisting of $n$ nanorods. Strikingly,
only one resonance can be excited by the incident light with certain circular polarization. We propose
a universal selection rule for such selective excitation of the collective resonances by analyzing
the symmetry of the helical superstructures. The new insights provided in this work may shed light
on future designs and fabrications of helical superstructures using plasmonic building blocks.
