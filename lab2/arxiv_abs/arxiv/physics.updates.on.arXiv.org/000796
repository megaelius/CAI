The ab initio description of the spectral interior of the absorption spectrum poses both a theoretical
and computational challenge for modern electronic structure theory. Due to the often spectrally
dense character of this domain in the quantum propagator's eigenspectrum for medium-to-large
sized systems, traditional approaches based on the partial diagonalization of the propagator
often encounter oscillatory and stagnating convergence. Electronic structure methods which
solve the molecular response problem through the solution of spectrally shifted linear systems,
such as the complex polarization propagator, offer an alternative approach which is agnostic to
the underlying spectral density or domain location. This generality comes at a seemingly high computational
cost associated with solving a large linear system for each spectral shift in some discretization
of the spectral domain of interest. We present a novel, adaptive solution based on model order reduction
techniques via interpolation. Model order reduction reduces the computational complexity of
mathematical models and is ubiquitous in the simulation of dynamical systems. The efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the ab initio prediction of X-Ray absorption spectra
is demonstrated using a test set of challenging water clusters which are spectrally dense in the
neighborhood of the oxygen K-edge. Based on a single, user defined tolerance we automatically determine
the order of the reduced models and approximate the absorption spectrum up to the given tolerance.
We also illustrate that the automatically determined model order increases logarithmically with
the problem dimension, compared to a linear increase of the number of eigenvalues within the energy
window. Furthermore, we observed that the computational cost of the proposed algorithm only scales
quadratically with respect to the problem dimension.
