It was once purported that biological systems were far too warm and wet to support quantum phenomena
mainly due to thermal effects disrupting quantum coherence. However recent experimental results
and theoretical analyses have shown that thermal energy may assist, rather than disrupt, quantum
coherence, especially in the dry hydrophobic interiors of biomolecules. Specifically, evidence
has been accumulating for the necessary involvement of quantum coherence and entanglement between
uniquely arranged chromophores in light harvesting photosynthetic complexes. Amazingly, the
tubulin subunit proteins, which comprise microtubules, also possess a distinct architecture
of chromophores, namely aromatic amino acids including tryptophan. The geometry and dipolar properties
of these aromatics are similar to those found in photosynthetic units indicating that tubulin may
support coherent energy transfer. Tubulin aggregated into microtubule geometric lattices may
support such energy transfer, which could be of import for biological signaling and communication
essential to living processes. Here we perform a computational investigation of energy transfer
between chromophoric amino acids in tubulin via dipole excitations coupled to the surrounding
thermal environment. We present the spatial structure and energetic properties of the tryptophan
residues in the microtubule constituent protein tubulin. Plausibility arguments for the conditions
favoring a quantum mechanism of signal propagation along a microtubule are provided. Overall we
find that coherent energy transfer in tubulin and microtubules is biologically feasible.
