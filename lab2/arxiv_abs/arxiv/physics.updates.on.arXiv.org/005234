The neutron lifetime is determined for now most accurately by two methods - - the so-called "beam
method" and the method of neutron storage in a trap. The first of them measured the counting rate of
protons from the neutron decay in 2013 and yielded the result $\tau_n=887.7\pm2.2$ s. The storage
method in 2018 yielded the neutron lifetime equal to $\tau_n=881.5\pm0.9$ s. The goal of this research
is to obtain the neutron lifetime with a higher precision by eliminating the traditional systematic
errors. New features are a step-wise variation of the initial neutron number and extracting the
neutron lifetime only from the set of electron counting rates with their errors. Newly received
neutron lifetime value is $$ \tau_{NT}=883.31\pm0.02(stat.)\pm0.02(sys.) \quad \mbox{s.}
$$ The obtained neutron lifetime is the weighted average of two lifetimes, defined for different
subsets of neutrons providing the well-known effect of the asymmetry in the neutron $\beta$-decay.
Simple calculation predict the values of these lifetimes and show their correspondence to the known
asymmetry parameters of neutron decay. The arithmetic mean (central) value for the two newly introduced
neutron lifetimes was determined as equal to $899.98 \pm 0.02(stat.) \pm 0.02(sys.)$ s. The resulting
weighted value $\tau_{NT}$ is in a good agreement with the lifetimes in the first and second methods
in limits of their double errors, but exceeds them significantly in precision. In addition, estimates
of the new lifetimes, which are called here as $L$-neutron lifetime and $R$-neutron lifetime, are
fulfilled. The estimation results correspond to the known parameters of the neutron decay asymmetry.
