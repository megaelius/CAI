Topographic complexity on continental shelves is the catalyst that transforms the barotropic
tide into the secondary and residual circulations that dominate vertical and cross-shelf mixing
processes. Island wakes are one such example that are observed to significantly influence the transport
and distribution of biological and physical scalars. Despite the importance of island wakes, to
date, no sufficient, mechanistic description of the physical processes governing their development
exists for the general case of unsteady tidal forcing. Controlled laboratory experiments are necessary
for the understanding of this complex flow phenomena. Three-dimensional velocity field measurements
of cylinder wakes in shallow-water, oscillatory flow are conducted across a parameter space that
is typical of tidal flow around shallow islands. Previous studies investigated the wake form dependance
on $KC=U_0T/D$, where $KC$ is the Keulegan-Carpenter number, $D$ is the island diameter, $U_0$
the tidal velocity amplitude and $T$ the tidal period, and the stability parameter $S=c_fD/h$ where
$h$ is the water depth and $c_f$ is the bottom boundary friction coefficient. In this study we demonstrate
that when the influence of bottom friction is confined to a Stokes boundary layer the parameter $S=\delta^+/KC$
where $\delta^+=\delta/h$ and $\delta=2\pi\sqrt{2\nu/\omega}$ is the wavelength of the Stokes
bottom boundary layer. Three classes of wake form are observed for decreasing wake stability: \emph{(1)
Steady Bubble} for $S\gtrsim 0.1$; \emph{(2) Unsteady Bubble} for $0.06\lesssim S \lesssim 0.1$;
and \emph{(3) Vortex Shedding} for $S\lesssim 0.06$. Transitions in wake form and wake stability
are shown to depend on the magnitude and temporal evolution of the wake return flow. Scaling laws
are developed to allow upscaling of the laboratory results to island wakes. Vertical and lateral
transport depend on th...
