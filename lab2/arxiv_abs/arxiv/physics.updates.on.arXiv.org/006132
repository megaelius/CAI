A subcritical load on a disordered material can induce creep damage. The creep rate in this case exhibits
three temporal regimes viz. an initial decelerating regime followed by a steady-state regime and
a stage of accelerating creep that ultimately leads to catastrophic breakdown. Due to the statistical
regularities in the creep rate, the time evolution of creep rate has often been used to predict residual
lifetime until catastrophic breakdown. However, in disordered samples, these efforts met with
limited success. Nevertheless, it is clear that as the failure is approached, the damage become
increasingly spatially correlated, and the spatio-temporal patterns of acoustic emission, which
serve as a proxy for damage accumulation activity, are likely to mirror such correlations. However,
due to the high dimensionality of the data and the complex nature of the correlations it is not straightforward
to identify the said correlations and thereby the precursory signals of failure. Here we use supervised
machine learning to estimate the remaining time to failure of samples of disordered materials.
The machine learning algorithm uses as input the temporal signal provided by a mesoscale elastoplastic
model for the evolution of creep damage in disordered solids. Machine learning algorithms are well-suited
for assessing the proximity to failure from the time series of the acoustic emissions of sheared
samples. We show that materials are relatively more predictable for higher disorder while are relatively
less predictable for larger system sizes. We find that machine learning predictions, in the vast
majority of cases, perform substantially better than other prediction approaches proposed in
the literature.
