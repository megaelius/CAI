Turbulence in classical fluids is a ubiquitous non-equilibrium phenomenon, yet a complete theoretical
description for turbulent flow remains a challenging problem. A useful simplification for ideal
two-dimensional (2D) fluids is to describe the turbulent flow with long-range-interacting point
vortices, each possessing quantised circulation. In 1949, Onsager applied statistical mechanics
to determine the equilibria of this model. He showed that at sufficiently high energies, like-circulation
vortices preferentially aggregate into large-scale clusters, and are characterised by a negative
absolute temperature. Onsager's theory has been highly influential, providing understanding
of diverse quasi-2D systems such as turbulent soap films, guiding-centre plasmas, and self-gravitating
systems. It also predicts the striking tendency of 2D turbulence to spontaneously form large-scale,
long-lived vortices -- Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a well-known example. However, Onsager's theory
doesn't quantitatively apply to classical fluids where vorticity is continuous, and experimental
systems demonstrating Onsager's point-vortex statistical mechanics have remained elusive.
Here we realise high energy, negative-temperature vortex clusters in a uniform superfluid Bose-Einstein
condensate. Our results confirm Onsager's prediction of negative temperature clustered phases
of quantum vortices, and demonstrate the utility of point-vortex statistical mechanics in 2D quantum
fluids. This work opens future directions for the study of turbulent dynamics and we anticipate
exploring the entire phase diagram of 2D quantum vortices, including the formation of clusters
from 2D quantum turbulence.
