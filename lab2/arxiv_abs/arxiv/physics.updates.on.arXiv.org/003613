Suspension flows are ubiquitous in nature (hemodynamics, subsurface fluid mechanics, etc.) and
industrial applications (hydraulic fracturing, CO$_2$ storage, etc.). However, such flows are
notoriously difficult to model due to the variety of fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions
that can occur. In this work, we focus on non-Brownian shear-dominated suspensions, where kinetic
collisions are negligible and frictional effects play a dominant role. Under these circumstances,
irreversible phenomena such as particle diffusion and migration arise, requiring anisotropic
stress models to describe the suspension rheology. On a continuum level, reduced-order models
such as the suspension balance model (SBM) or the diffusive flux model are commonly used to predict
particle migration phenomena. We propose a new method based on the two-fluid model (TFM), where
both the phases are considered as interpenetrating continua with their own conservation of mass
and momentum equations. Specifically, we show that when an anisotropic stress analogous to that
used in the SBM is added to the equilibrium equations for the particle phase, the TFM is able to accurately
predict particle migration. Unlike the SBM, the TFM does not require the assumptions of a steady
suspension velocity and a Stokesian (inertialess) fluid. Thus, the TFM can be easily extended to
include buoyancy and even kinetic collisional models. We present several benchmark simulations
of our TFM implementation in OpenFOAM{\textsuperscript\textregistered}, including in curvilinear
coordinates and three-dimensional flow. Good agreement between the TFM solutions and previous
experimental and numerical results is found.
