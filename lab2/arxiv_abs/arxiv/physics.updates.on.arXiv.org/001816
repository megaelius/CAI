Simulating direct current resistivity, frequency domain electromagnetics and time domain electromagnetics
in settings where steel cased boreholes are present is of interest across a range of applications
including well-logging, monitoring subsurface injections such as hydraulic fracturing or carbon
capture and storage. In some surveys, well-casings have been used as "extended electrodes" for
near surface environmental or geotechnical applications. Wells are often cased with steel, which
has both a high conductivity and a significant magnetic permeability. The large physical property
contrasts as well as the large disparity in length-scales, which are introduced when a steel-cased
well is in a modelling domain, makes performing an electromagnetic forward simulation challenging.
Using this setting as motivation, we present a finite volume approach for modelling electromagnetic
problems on cylindrically symmetric and 3D cylindrical meshes which include an azimuthal discretization.
The associated software implementation includes modelling capabilities for direct current resistivity,
time domain electromagnetics, and frequency domain electromagnetics for models that include
variable electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability. Electric and magnetic fields, fluxes
and charges are readily accessible in any simulation so that they can be visualized and interrogated.
We demonstrate the value of being able to explore the behaviour of electromagnetic fields and fluxes
through examples which revisit a number of foundational papers on DC and electromagnetics in steel-cased
wells. The software implementation is open source and included as a part of the SimPEG software ecosystem
for simulation and parameter estimation in geophysics.
