The residual multiparticle entropy (RMPE) of a fluid is defined as the difference, $\Delta s$, between
the excess entropy per particle (relative to an ideal gas with the same temperature and density),
$s_\text{ex}$, and the pair-correlation contribution, $s_2$. Thus, the RMPE represents the net
contribution to $s_\text{ex}$ due to spatial correlations involving three, four, or more particles.
A heuristic `ordering' criterion identifies the vanishing of the RMPE as an underlying signature
of an impending structural or thermodynamic transition of the system from a less ordered to a more
spatially organized condition (freezing is a typical example). Regardless of this, the knowledge
of the RMPE is important to assess the impact of non-pair multiparticle correlations on the entropy
of the fluid. Recently, an accurate and simple proposal for the thermodynamic and structural properties
of a hard-sphere fluid in fractional dimension $1<d<3$ has been proposed [Santos, A.; L\'opez de
Haro, M. \emph{Phys. Rev. E} \textbf{2016}, \emph{93}, 062126]. The aim of this work is to use this
approach to evaluate the RMPE as a function of both $d$ and the packing fraction $\phi$. It is observed
that, for any given dimensionality $d$, the RMPE takes negative values for small densities, reaches
a negative minimum $\Delta s_{\text{min}}$ at a packing fraction $\phi_{\text{min}}$, and then
rapidly increases, becoming positive beyond a certain packing fraction $\phi_0$. Interestingly,
while both $\phi_{\text{min}}$ and $\phi_0$ monotonically decrease as dimensionality increases,
the value of $\Delta s_{\text{min}}$ exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior, reaching an absolute minimum
at a fractional dimensionality $d\simeq 2.38$. A plot of the scaled RMPE $\Delta s/|\Delta s_{\text{min}}|$
shows a quasiuniversal behavior in the region $-0.14\lesssim\phi-\phi_0\lesssim 0.02$.
