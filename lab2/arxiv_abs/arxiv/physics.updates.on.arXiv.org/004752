Targeted ultra-high resolution Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
(LA-ICP-MS) analysis of an ice core drilled in the Pamir Mountains of Central Asia (CA) records changes
in seasonal patterns of atmospheric circulation and moisture delivery to CA over the past 1600 years.
Fe, Ca, and Mg signals in the LNC3 Pamir ice core reflect variable delivery of these elements during
the pre-Medieval Warm Period (pre-MWP), Medieval Warm Period (MWP), and during the onset of the
Little Ice Age (LIA) in CA. During the pre-MWP, hiatuses between dust seasons are observed due to
a lengthened accumulation season, and dust delivery limited to a short period at the end of the accumulation
season when modern summer-style northerly airflow occurred. During the MWP, dust delivery to CA
decreased, though Fe-intensity in the core indicates episodic northerly air incursion. By the
onset of the LIA, dust availability increased due to regional drying and strengthening winds, and
strong westerlies blocked meridional flow reducing Fe-rich dust input from the north. CA has experienced
recent warming, desiccation, weakening winds, and glacier loss. Major climate circulation drivers
(Westerlies, Icelandic Low, Siberian High) continue to display LIA-style patterns, and annual
temperatures are approaching those of the MWP. While none of the preceding climate periods in CA
history can serve as an absolute wholesale proxy for conditions that are likely to prevail in the
near future continued Northern Hemisphere westerlies weakening in a changing climate may enhance
meridional flow and bring more moisture into the Aral Sea catchment from the Arctic.
