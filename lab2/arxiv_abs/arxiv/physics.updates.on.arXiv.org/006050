Management of vestibular schwannoma (VS) is based on tumour size as observed on T1 MRI scans with
contrast agent injection. Current clinical practice is to measure the diameter of the tumour in
its largest dimension. It has been shown that volumetric measurement is more accurate and more reliable
as a measure of VS size. The reference approach to achieve such volumetry is to manually segment the
tumour, which is a time intensive task. We suggest that semi-automated segmentation may be a clinically
applicable solution to this problem and that it could replace linear measurements as the clinical
standard. Using high-quality software available for academic purposes, we ran a comparative study
of manual versus semi-automated segmentation of VS on MRI with 5 clinicians and scientists. We gathered
both quantitative and qualitative data to compare the two approaches; including segmentation
time, segmentation effort and segmentation accuracy. We found that the selected semi-automated
segmentation approach is significantly faster (167s versus 479s, p<0.001), less temporally and
physically demanding and has approximately equal performance when compared with manual segmentation,
with some improvements in accuracy. There were some limitations, including algorithmic unpredictability
and error, which produced more frustration and increased mental effort in comparison to manual
segmentation. We suggest that semi-automated segmentation could be applied clinically for volumetric
measurement of VS on MRI. In future, the generic software could be refined for use specifically for
VS segmentation, thereby improving accuracy.
