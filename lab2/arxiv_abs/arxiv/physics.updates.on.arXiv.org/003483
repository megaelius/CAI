The evaporation of vapor bubbles inside a microchannel is important to realize a device with high
cooling performance. The liquid film formed on the solid surface is essential for evaporative heat
transfer from solid to fluid; its formation process and heat transfer characteristics need to be
investigated. The expansion process of a single vapor bubble via evaporative heat transfer in microchannels
was evaluated via a numerical simulation in this study. In the calculation model, the working fluid
used was saturated FC-72 at 0.1013 MPa and the channel diameter was 200 $\mu$m. The superheat of the
initial temperature field and wall were considered as parameters. To evaluate the heat transfer
characteristics, the time variation of liquid film thickness was evaluated. The averaged liquid
film thickness had a correlation with the capillary number. Additionally, the dominant heat transfer
mode was estimated by decomposing the heat transfer rate into the heat-transfer rate through the
liquid film, rear edge, and wake. When the superheat was low, the heat transfer mostly occurred via
liquid film evaporation; the heat flux through the liquid film could be predicted using the liquid
film thickness. On the other hand, in cases of higher superheat, owing to rapid expansion of the vapor
bubble, no evaporative heat transfer occurred through the liquid film around the bubble head. It
could be inferred from this study that the relationship between the thickness of the thermal boundary
layer of the bubble and liquid film thickness is important for predicting the cooling effect of this
phenomena. When the vapor bubble grows in the high superheat liquid, the rapid growth makes the liquid
film thick, and the thick liquid film prevents the heat transfer between the liquid-vapor interface
and heated wall.
