Density-functional tight binding (DFTB) has become a popular form of approximate density-functional
theory (DFT) based upon a minimal valence basis set and neglect of all but two center integrals. We
report the results of our tests of a recent long-range correction (lc) for time-dependent (TD) lc-DFTB
by carrying out TD-lc-DFTB fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) calculations of energy and charge
transfer times using the relatively new DFTBaby program. An advantage of this method is the ability
to run enough trajectories to get meaningful ensemble averages. Our interest in the present work
is less in determining exact energy and charge transfer rates than in understanding how the results
of these calculations vary with the value of the range-separation parameter (Rlc = 1/{\mu}) for
a model organic solar cell heterojunction consisting of a van der Waals complex P/F made up of single
pentacene (P) molecule together with a single buckminsterfullerene (F) molecule. The default
value of Rlc = 3.03 a0 is found to be much too small as neither energy nor charge transfer is observed
until Rlc ~ 10 a0. Tests at a single geometry show that best agreement with high-quality ab-initio
spectra is obtained in the limit of no lc (i.e., very large Rlc.) A plot of energy and charge transfer
rates as a function of Rlc is provided which suggests that a value of Rlc ~ 15 a0 yields the typical literature
charge transfer time of about 100 fs. However, energy and charge transfer times become as high as
~ 300 fs for Rlc ~ 25 a0. A closer examination of the charge transfer process P*/F to P+/F- shows that
the initial electron transfer is accompanied by a partial delocalization of the P hole onto F which
then relocalizes back onto P, consistent with a polaron-like picture in which the nuclei relax to
stabilize the resultant redistribution of charges.
