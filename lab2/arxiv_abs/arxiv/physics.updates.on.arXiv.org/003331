The solution of the nuclear A-body problem encounters severe limitations from the size of many-body
operators. These limitations are typically related to both the (iterative) storing of the associated
tensors and to the computational time related to their multiple contractions in the calculation
of various quantities of interest. However, not all the degrees of freedom encapsulated into these
tensors equally contribute to the description of many-body observables. Identifying systematic
and dominating patterns, a relevant objective is to achieve an \emph{a priori} reduction to the
most relevant degrees of freedom via a pre-processing of the A-body problem. The present paper is
dedicated to the analysis of two different paradigms to do so. The factorization of tensors in terms
of lower-rank ones, whose know-how has been recently transferred to the realm of nuclear structure,
is compared to a reduction of the tensors' index size based on an importance truncation. While the
objective is to eventually utilize these pre-processing tools in the context of non-perturbative
many-body methods, benchmark calculations are presently performed within the frame of perturbation
theory. More specifically, we employ the recently introduced Bogoliubov many-body perturbation
theory that is systematically applicable to open-shell nuclei displaying strong correlations.
This extended perturbation theory serves as a jumpstart for non-perturbative Bogoliubov coupled
cluster and Gorkov self-consistent Green's function theories. Results obtained in "small" model
spaces are equally encouraging for tensor factorization and importance truncation techniques.
While the former requires significant numerical developments to be applied in large model spaces,
the latter is presently applied in this context and demonstrates great potential to enable high-accuracy
calculations at a much reduced computational cost.
