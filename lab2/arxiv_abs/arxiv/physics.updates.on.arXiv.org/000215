The Cryogenic Apparatus for Precision Tests of Argon Interactions with Neutrino (CAP- TAIN) program
is designed to make measurements of scientific importance to long-baseline neutrino physics and
physics topics that will be explored by large underground detectors. The CAPTAIN detector is a liquid
argon TPC deployed in a portable and evacuable cryostat. Five tons of liquid argon are instrumented
with a 2,000 channel liquid argon TPC and a photon detection system. Subsequent to the commissioning
phase, the detector will collect data in a high-energy neutron beamline that is part of the Los Alamos
Neutron Science Center to measure cross-sections of spallation products that are backgrounds
to measurements of neutrinos from a supernova burst, cross-sections of events that mimic the electron
neutrino appearance signal in long-baseline neutrino physics and neutron signatures to constrain
neutrino energy reconstruction in LBNE's long-baseline program. Subsequent to the neutron running,
the CAPTAIN detector will be moved to a neutrino source. Two possibilities are an on-axis run in the
NuMI beamline at FNAL and a run in the neutrino source produced by the SNS. An on-axis run at NuMI produces
more than one million events of interest in a two or three year run at neutrino energies between 1 and
10 GeV - complementary to the MicroBooNE experiment, which will measure similar interactions at
a lower energy range - 0.5 to 2 GeV. At the SNS the neutrinos result from the decays stopped positively
charged pions and muons yielding a broad spectrum up to 50 MeV. If located close to the spallation
target, CAPTAIN can detect several thousand events per year in the same neutrino energy regime where
neutrinos from a supernova burst are. Measurements at the SNS yield a first measurement of the cross-
section of neutrinos on argon in this important energy regime.
