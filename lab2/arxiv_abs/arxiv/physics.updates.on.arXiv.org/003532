Egyptian faience is a non-clay ceramic semi-transparent material, formed of a quartz core and alkali
lime glaze with some cases exhibiting an interaction layer between them. Several possible glazing
methods have been identified. Previous investigations have tried to identify the glazing technique
by using the microstructure images obtained from polished sections using scanning electron microscope(SEM).
Such techniques require sampling which is not feasible on museum collections. Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive 3D imaging technique, that produces virtual cross sections
of transparent and semi-transparent materials. Liang et al. (2012a) investigated the feasibility
of using OCT to non-invasively investigate microstructures of Egyptian faience, but the limited
probing depth of the 930nm OCT prevented viewing down to the core of the objects, where the presence
of glass was thought to be a distinguishing feature between some of the manufacturing techniques,
and where the particle size of the quartz may indicate the difference in the raw material. In this
paper, a unique longer wavelength OCT at 2um is used to scan a number of ancient Egyptian faience objects
including ring and shabti fragments. It was found that the core of the faience could be imaged at this
longer wavelength, allowing comparisons in all the layers within the microstructure, and leading
to discussions about the possible glazing methods. The 2um OCT offers the possibilities of rapid,
non invasive imaging of faience microstructure down to the core, allowing comprehensive studies
of intact objects and large museum collections.
