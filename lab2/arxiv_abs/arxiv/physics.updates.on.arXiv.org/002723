Multi-braneworld universe is at the heart of many scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model
and the cosmological model $\Lambda CDM$. It is thus an important concern to constrain these scenarios
which also allow for experiments below the GeV scale. MURMUR is a new neutron-passing-through-walls
experiment designed to constrain neutron-hidden neutron transitions in the context of braneworlds
scenarios. As our visible universe could be a 3-brane embedded in a multidimensional bulk, adjacent
hidden 3-branes are often expected. Their existence can be constrained as matter exchange between
braneworlds must occur with a swapping probability $p$. A neutron $n$ can convert into a hidden neutron
$n'$ when scattered by a nucleus with cross section $\sigma (n \to n')$ $\propto$ $\sigma_E (n \to
n)\ p$, where $\sigma_E$ is the usual elastic cross-section. Hidden neutrons could therefore be
generated in the moderator medium of a nuclear reactor, where high-flux neutrons undergo many elastic
collisions. Being located in another braneworld, these hidden neutrons would interact very weakly
with matter and freely escape the reactor out of the biological shielding. However, the reverse
swapping process could make possible to detect them close to the reactor, with efficiency also proportional
to $p$, thanks to a material able to regenerate hidden neutrons into visible ones. A low-noise neutron
detector allows for the detection of the reappearing neutrons to constrain $p$ and the physics behind.
All the theoretical and technological keys of this experiment soon to be installed at the nuclear
research reactor BR2 (SCK.CEN, Mol, Belgium) are introduced.
