The diffusive exchange of 30 trace elements during the interaction of natural mafic and silicic
alkaline melts was experimentally studied at conditions relevant to shallow magmatic systems.
In detail, a set of 12 diffusion couple experiments have been performed between natural shoshonitic
and rhyolitic melts from the Vulcano Island (Aeolian archipelago, Italy) at a temperature of 1200
{\deg}C, pressures from 50 to 500 MPa, and water contents ranging from nominally dry to ca. 2 wt. %.
Concentration-distance profiles, measured by Laser Ablation ICP-MS, highlight different behaviours,
and trace elements were divided into two groups: (1) elements with normal diffusion profiles (13
elements, mainly low field strength and transition elements), and (2) elements showing uphill
diffusion (17 elements including Y, Zr, Nb, Pb and rare earth elements, except Eu). For the elements
showing normal diffusion profiles, chemical diffusion coefficients were estimated using a concentration-dependent
evaluation method, and values are given at four intermediate compositions (SiO2 equal to 58, 62,
66 and 70 wt. %, respectively). A general coupling of diffusion coefficients to silica diffusivity
is observed, and variations in systematics are observed between mafic and silicic compositions.
Results show that water plays a decisive role on diffusive rates in the studied conditions, producing
an enhancement between 0.4 and 0.7 log units per 1 wt.% of added H2O. Particularly notable is the behaviour
of the trivalent-only REEs (La to Nd and Gd to Lu), with strong uphill diffusion minima, diminishing
from light to heavy REEs. Modelling of REE profiles by a modified effective binary diffusion model
indicates that activity gradients induced by the SiO2 concentration contrast are responsible
for their development, inducing a transient partitioning of REEs towards the shoshonitic melt.
