A robust and efficient field-only nonsingular surface integral method to solve Maxwell's equations
for the components of the electric field on the surface of a dielectric scatterer is introduced.
In this method, both the vector Helmholtz equation and the divergence-free constraint are satisfied
inside and outside the scatterer. The divergence-free condition is replaced by an equivalent boundary
condition that relates the normal derivatives of the electric field across the surface of the scatterer.
Also, the continuity and jump conditions on the electric and magnetic fields are expressed in terms
of the electric field across the surface of the scatterer. Together with these boundary conditions,
the scalar Helmholtz equation for the components of the electric field inside and outside the scatterer
is solved by a fully desingularized surface integral method. Comparing with the most popular surface
integral methods based on the Stratton-Chu formulation or the PMCHWT formulation, our method is
conceptually simpler and numerically straightforward because there is no need to introduce intermediate
quantities such as surface currents and the use of complicated vector basis functions can be avoided
altogether. Also, our method is not affected by numerical issues such as the zero frequency catastrophe
and does not contain integrals with (strong) singularities. To illustrate the robustness and versatility
of our method, we show examples in the Rayleigh, Mie, and geometrical optics scattering regimes.
Given the symmetry between the electric field and the magnetic field, our theoretical framework
can also be used to solve for the magnetic field.
