Human mobility is a key component of large-scale spatial-transmission models of infectious diseases.
Correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for improving epidemic control
policies, but may be hindered by incomplete data in some regions of the world. Here we explore the
opportunity of using proxy data or models for individual mobility to describe commuting movements
and predict the diffusion of infectious disease. We consider three European countries and the corresponding
commuting networks at different resolution scales obtained from official census surveys, from
proxy data for human mobility extracted from mobile phone call records, and from the radiation model
calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on the three countries and integrating
the different mobility layers are compared in terms of epidemic observables. We show that commuting
networks from mobile phone data well capture the empirical commuting patterns, accounting for
more than 87% of the total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from both sources
of data - mobile phones and census - are similar and highly correlated, however a systematic overestimation
of commuting traffic in the mobile phone data is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster
than on census commuting networks, however preserving the order of infection of newly infected
locations. Match in the epidemic invasion pattern is sensitive to initial conditions: the radiation
model shows higher accuracy with respect to mobile phone data when the seed is central in the network,
while the mobile phone proxy performs better for epidemics seeded in peripheral locations. Results
suggest that different proxies can be used to approximate commuting patterns across different
resolution scales in spatial epidemic simulations, in light of the desired accuracy in the epidemic
outcome under study.
