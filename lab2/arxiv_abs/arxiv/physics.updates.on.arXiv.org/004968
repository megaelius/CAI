We investigate the scattering of strahl electrons by microinstabilities as a mechanism for creating
the electron halo in the solar wind. We develop a mathematical framework for the description of electron-driven
microinstabilities and discuss the associated physical mechanisms. We find that an instability
of the oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) mode is the best candidate for a microinstability
that scatters strahl electrons into the halo. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the
FM/W instability threshold in two different $\beta_{\mathrm c}$ regimes, where $\beta_{\mathrm
c}$ is the ratio of the core electrons' thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure, and confirm the
accuracy of these thresholds through comparison with numerical solutions to the hot-plasma dispersion
relation. We find that the strahl-driven oblique FM/W instability creates copious FM/W waves under
low-$\beta_{\mathrm c}$ conditions when $U_{0\mathrm s}\gtrsim 3w_{\mathrm c}$, where $U_{0\mathrm
s}$ is the strahl speed and $w_{\mathrm c}$ is the thermal speed of the core electrons. These waves
have a frequency of about half the local electron gyrofrequency. We also derive an analytic expression
for the oblique FM/W instability for $\beta_{\mathrm c}\sim 1$. The comparison of our theoretical
results with data from the \emph{Wind} spacecraft confirms the relevance of the oblique FM/W instability
for the solar wind. The whistler heat-flux, ion-acoustic heat-flux, kinetic-Alfv\'en-wave heat-flux,
and electrostatic electron-beam instabilities cannot fulfill the requirements for self-induced
scattering of strahl electrons into the halo. We make predictions for the electron strahl close
to the Sun, which will be tested by measurements from \emph{Parker Solar Probe} and \emph{Solar
Orbiter}.
