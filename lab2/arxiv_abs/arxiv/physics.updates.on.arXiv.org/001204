Measuring the eye's mechanical properties in vivo and with minimally invasive techniques can be
the key for individualized solutions to a number of eye pathologies. The development of such techniques
largely relies on a computational modelling of the eyeball and, it optimally requires the synergic
interplay between experimentation and numerical simulation. In Astrophysics and Geophysics
the remote measurement of structural properties of the systems of their realm is performed on the
basis of (helio-)seismic techniques. As a biomechanical system, the eyeball possesses normal
vibrational modes encompassing rich information about its structure and mechanical properties.
However, the integral analysis of the eyeball vibrational modes has not been performed yet. Here
we develop a new finite difference method to compute both the spheroidal and, specially, the toroidal
eigenfrequencies of the human eye. Using this numerical model, we show that the vibrational eigenfrequencies
of the human eye fall in the interval 100 Hz - 10 MHz. We find that compressible vibrational modes may
release a trace on high frequency changes of the intraocular pressure, while incompressible normal
modes could be registered analyzing the scattering pattern that the motions of the vitreous humour
leave on the retina. Existing contact lenses with embebed devices operating at high sampling frequency
could be used to register the microfluctuations of the eyeball shape we obtain. We advance that an
inverse problem to obtain the mechanical properties of a given eye (e.g., Young's modulus, Poisson
ratio) measuring its normal frequencies is doable. These measurements can be done using non-invasive
techniques, opening very interesting perspectives to estimate the mechanical properties of eyes
in vivo. Future research might relate various ocular pathologies with anomalies in measured vibrational
frequencies of the eye.
