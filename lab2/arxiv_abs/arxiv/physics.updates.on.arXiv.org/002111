In this work, we present an exploratory study of stability of an open pit mine in the north of Chile
with the use of data mining. It is important to note that the study of slope stability is a subject of
great interest to mining companies, this is due to the importance in the safety of workers and the
protection of infrastructures, whether private or public, in those places susceptible to this
kind of phenomena, as well as, for road slopes and close to communities or infrastructures, among
others. It is also important to highlight that these phenomena can compromise important economic
resources and can even cause human losses. In our case, this study seeks to increase the knowledge
of these phenomena and thus, try to predict their occurrence, by means of risk indicators, potentially
allowing the mining company supervision to consider predictive measures. It should be considered
that there is no online test that ensures timely prediction. In previous studies conducted in other
mines, it has been corroborated that the phenomena and factors associated with the movement of slopes
and landslides are extremely complex and highly nonlinear, which is why the methods associated
with the called "data mining", were found to be ideal for discovering new information in the data,
which is recorded periodically in the continuous monitoring that mining companies have of their
deposits, which allowed to find important correlations for the search of predictors of these phenomena.
Some results, with data coming from different sources, are presented at the end of this work. We note
that according to the information provided by the mining company, the results were favorable in
the indicators of up to six months, giving as risk areas the correct sectors and predicting the April
2017 event.
