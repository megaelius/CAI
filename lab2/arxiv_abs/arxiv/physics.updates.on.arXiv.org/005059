We investigate numerically the influence of currents on wind-generated surface deformations
for wind velocity below the onset of regular waves. In that regime, the liquid surface is populated
by small disorganised deformations elongated in the streamwise direction, referred to as \textit{wrinkles}.
These wrinkles are the superposition of incoherent wakes generated by the pressure fluctuations
traveling in the turbulent boundary layer. In this work, we account for the effect of a current in
the liquid, either longitudinal or transverse, by including a modified Doppler-shifted dispersion
relation in the spectral theory previously derived by Perrard~{\it et al.} [J. Fluid Mech. {\bf
873}, 1020-1054 (2019)]. We use the pressure data from direct numerical simulation of the turbulent
air flow to compute the surface deformation, and determine the wrinkle properties (size and amplitude)
as a function of the liquid viscosity and current properties (surface velocity, thickness and orientation).
We find significant modifications of the wrinkle geometry by the currents: the wrinkles are tilted
for a transverse current, and show finer scales for a longitudinal current. However, their characteristic
size is weakly affected, and their amplitude remains independent of the current. We discuss the
implications of these results regarding the onset of regular waves at larger wind velocity. In this
work, we introduce a new spectral interpolation method to evaluate the surface deformation fields,
based on a refined meshing close to the resonance. This method, which can be extended to any dispersive
system excited by a random forcing, strongly reduces the discretization effects at a low computational
cost.
