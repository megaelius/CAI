Characterization of self-consistent laser-plasma evolutions serves as a fundamental issue in
the field of relativistic laser-plasma interactions. In this paper, we present an analysis framework
for description of these evolutions during propagation of a short intense laser pulse in a sub-critical
high-density plasma (the pulse length exceeds the plasma wavelength). In this context, the pulse
evolutions are attributed to the wakefield induced self-modulation and destabilization via parametric
exponentiation of the initial noise content. The self-consistent plasma evolutions are formulated
in terms of quantities which used to be motion constants in the absence of pulse evolutions. This
proves very useful both in understanding plasma evolutions during self-modulation and also in
facilitating the instability studies in the strongly nonlinear regime, via refinement of unstable
plasma perturbations. General analytical solutions, at arbitrary pulse conditions, are derived
for self-modulation, indicating that the envelop evolutions are driven by the induced spatial
frequency-chirp. Also, these results state that the envelope attains fine modulations which produce
long wavelength low-frequency modes via beating the carrier mode. The plasma wave variations are
found to convect and amplify away from the pulse front. Regarding parametric instability, we assess
different scattering regimes at different pulse shapes and peak intensities, manifesting anomalous
behaviors ranging from wild positioning of the Stokes wave in dispersion plane to broadening in
the scattered spectrum and halting the instability. Our analyses are assisted and verified by numerous
fluid and particle-in-cell simulations. Based on our results, we discuss phenomena like the pulse
breakup and its different regimes, and assisted particle acceleration in presence of pulse evolutions.
