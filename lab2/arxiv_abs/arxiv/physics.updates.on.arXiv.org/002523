The interaction of ion beams with matter includes the investigation of the basic principles of ion
stopping in heated materials. An unsolved question is the effect of different, especially higher,
ion beam fluences on ion stopping in solid targets. This is relevant in applications such as in fusion
sciences. To address this question, a Thomson parabola was built for the Neutralized Drift Compression
eXperiment (NDCX-II) for ion energy-loss measurements at different ion beam fluences. The linear
induction accelerator NDCX-II delivers 2 ns short, intense ion pulses, up to several tens of nC/pulse,
or 10$^{10}$-10$^{11}$ ions, with a peak kinetic energy of ~1.1 MeV and a minimal spot size of 2 mm
FWHM. For this particular accelerator the energy determination with conventional beam diagnostics,
for example, time of flight measurements, is imprecise due to the non-trivial longitudinal phase
space of the beam. In contrast, a Thomson parabola is well suited to reliably determine the beam energy
distribution. The Thomson parabola differentiates charged particles by energy and charge-to-mass
ratio, through deflection of charged particles by electric and magnetic fields. During first proof-of-principle
experiments, we achieved to reproduce the average initial helium beam energy as predicted by computer
simulations with a deviation of only 1.4 %. Successful energy-loss measurements with 1 {\mu}m thick
Silicon Nitride foils show the suitability of the accelerator for such experiments. The initial
ion energy was determined during a primary measurement without a target, while a second measurement,
incorporating the target, was used to determine the transmitted energy. The energy-loss was then
determined as the difference between the two energies.
