Global rice production systems face two opposing challenges: the need to increase production to
accommodate the world's growing population while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Adaptations to drainage regimes are one of the most promising options for methane mitigation
in rice production. Whereas several studies have focused on mid-season drainage (MD) to mitigate
GHG emissions, early-season drainage (ED) varying in timing and duration has not been extensively
studied. However, such ED periods could potentially be very effective since initial available
Carbon levels (and thereby the potential for methanogenesis) can be very high in paddy systems with
rice straw incorporation. This study tested the effectiveness of seven drainage regimes varying
in their timing and duration (combinations of ED and MD) to mitigate methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide
(N2O) emissions in a 101-day growth chamber experiment. Emissions were considerably reduced by
early-season drainage compared to both conventional continuous flooding (CF) and the MD drainage
regime. The results suggest that ED + MD drainage may have the potential to reduce methane emissions
and yield-scaled global warming potential by 85 to 90% compared to CF and by 75 to 77% compared to MD
only. A combination of (short or long) ED drainage and one MD drainage episode was found to be the most
effective in mitigating methane emissions without negatively affecting yield. In particular,
compared with CF, the long early-season drainage treatments LE + SM and LE + LM significantly decreased
yield scaled global warming potential by 85% and 87% respectively. This was associated with carbon
being stabilised early in the season, thereby reducing available carbon for methanogenesis. Overall
nitrous oxide emissions were small and not significantly affected by ED.
