Wall modelling in large-eddy simulation (LES) is necessary to overcome the prohibitive near-wall
resolution requirements in high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows. Most existing wall models
rely on assumptions about the state of the boundary layer and require a priori prescription of tunable
coefficients. They also impose the predicted wall stress by replacing the no-slip boundary condition
at the wall with a Neumann boundary condition in the wall-parallel directions while maintaining
the no-transpiration condition in the wall-normal direction. In the present study, we first motivate
and analyse the Robin (slip) boundary condition with transpiration (nonzero wall-normal velocity)
in the context of wall-modelled LES. The effect of the slip boundary condition on the one-point statistics
of the flow is investigated in LES of turbulent channel flow and flat-plate turbulent boundary layer.
It is shown that the slip condition provides a framework to compensate for the deficit or excess of
mean momentum at the wall. Moreover, the resulting nonzero stress at the wall alleviates the well-known
problem of the wall-stress under-estimation by current subgrid-scale (SGS) models. Secondly,
we discuss the requirements for the slip condition to be used in conjunction with wall models and
derive the equation that connects the slip boundary condition with the stress at the wall. Finally,
a dynamic procedure for the slip coefficients is formulated, providing a dynamic slip wall model
free of a priori specified coefficients. The performance of the proposed dynamic wall model is tested
in a series of LES of turbulent channel flow, non-equilibrium three-dimensional channel flow,
and flat-plate turbulent boundary layer. The results show that the dynamic wall model is able to
accurately predict one-point turbulence statistics for various flow configurations, Reynolds
numbers, and grid resolutions.
