We investigate the origin of the experimentally observed varying current-frequency nonlinearity
of the propagating spin wave mode in nano-contact spin torque oscillators. Nominally identical
devices with 100 nm diameter are characterized by electrical microwave measurements and show large
variation in the generated frequency as a function of drive current. This quantitative and qualitative
device-to-device variation is described in terms of continuous and discontinuous nonlinear transitions
between linear current intervals. The thin film grain microstructure in our samples is determined
using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy to be on the scale of 30 nm. Micromagnetic simulations
show that the reflection of spin waves against the grain boundaries results in standing wave resonance
configurations. For a simulated device with a single artificial grain, the frequency increases
linearly with the drive current until the decreased wavelength eventually forces another spin
wave anti-node to be formed. This transition results in a discontinuous step in the frequency versus
current relation. Simulations of complete, randomly generated grain microstructures additionally
shows continuous nonlinearity and a resulting device-to-device variation in frequency that is
similar to the experimental levels. The impact of temperature from 4 K to 300 K on the resonance mode-transition
nonlinearity and frequency noise is investigated using simulations and it is found that the peak
levels of the spectral linewidth as a function of drive current agrees quantitatively with typical
levels found in experiments at room temperature.
