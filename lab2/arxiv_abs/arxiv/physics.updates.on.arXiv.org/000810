In this paper we report results from a neutron irradiation campaign of Ultra-Fast Silicon Detectors
(UFSD) with fluences of 1e14, 3e14, 6e14, 1e15, 3e15, 6e15 n/cm2. The UFSD used in this study are circular
50 micro-meter thick Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD), with a 1.0 mm diameter active area. They
have been produced by Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK), Japan, with pre-radiation internal gain in the
range 10-100 depending on the bias voltage. The sensors were tested pre-irradiation and post-irradiation
with minimum ionizing particle (MIPs) from a 90Sr based \b{eta}-source. The leakage current, internal
gain and the timing resolution were measured as a function of bias voltage at -20C and -30C. The timing
resolution was extracted from the time difference with a second calibrated UFSD in coincidence,
using the constant fraction method for both. The dependence of the gain upon the irradiation fluence
is consistent with the concept of acceptor removal and the gain decreases from about 80 pre-irradiation
to 7 after a fluence of 6e15 n/cm2. Consequently, the timing resolution was found to deteriorate
from 20 ps to 50 ps. The results indicate that the most accurate time resolution is obtained at a value
of the constant fraction discriminator (CFD) threshold used to determine the time of arrival varying
with fluence, from 10% pre-radiation to 60% at the highest fluence. Key changes to the pulse shape
induced by irradiation, i.e. (i) a reduce sensitivity of the pulse shape on the initial non-uniform
charge deposition, (ii) the shortening of the rise time and (iii) the reduced pulse height, were
compared with the WF2 simulation program and found to be in agreement.
