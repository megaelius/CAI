In the present work, we investigate the ionization of molecules of biological interest by the impact
of multicharged ions in the intermediate to high energy range. We performed full non-perturbative
distorted-wave calculations (CDW) for thirty-six collisional systems composed by six atomic
targets: H, C, N, O, F and S -which are the constituents of most of the DNA and biological molecules-
and six charged projectiles (antiprotons, H, He, B, C, and O). On account of the radiation damage
caused by secondary electrons, we inspect the energy and angular distributions of the emitted electrons
from the atomic targets. We examine seventeen molecules: DNA and RNA bases, DNA backbone, pyrimidines,
tetrahydrofuran (THF), and C$_n$H$_n$ compounds. We show that the simple stoichiometric model
(SSM), which approximates the molecular ionization cross sections as a linear combination of the
atomic ones, gives reasonably good results for complex molecules. We also inspect the extensively
used Toburen scaling of the total ionization cross sections of molecules with the number of weakly
bound electrons. Based on the atomic CDW results, we propose new active electron numbers, which
improves significantly scaling for all the targets and ions studied here in the intermediate to
the high energy region. The new scaling describes well the available experimental data for proton
impact, including small molecules. We perform full molecular calculations for five nucleobases
and test a modified stoichiometric formula based on the Mulliken charge of the composite atoms.
The difference introduced by the new stoichiometric formula is less than 3%, which indicates the
reliability of the SSM to deal with this type of molecules. The results of the extensive ion-target
examination included in the present study allow us to assert that the SSM and the CDW-based scaling
will be useful tools in this area.
