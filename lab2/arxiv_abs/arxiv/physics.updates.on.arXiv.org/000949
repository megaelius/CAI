In various areas of science, technology, environment protection, construction, it is very important
to study processes of porous materials interaction with different substances in different aggregation
states. From the point of view of ecology and environmental protection it is particularly actual
to investigate processes of porous materials interaction with water in liquid and gaseous phases.
Since one mole of water contains $6,022140857\cdot 10^{23}$ molecules of $\mathtt{H_2O}$, macroscopic
approaches considering the water vapor as continuum media in the framework of classical aerodynamics
are mainly used to describe properties, for example properties of water vapor in the pore. In this
paper we construct and use for simulation the macroscopic two-dimensional diffusion model describing
the behavior of water vapor inside the isolated pore. Together with the macroscopic model it is proposed
microscopic model of the behavior of water vapor inside the isolated pores. This microscopic model
is built within the molecular dynamics approach. In the microscopic model a description of each
water molecule motion is based on Newton classical mechanics considering interactions with other
molecules and pore walls. Time evolution of water vapor - pore system is explored. Depending on the
external to the pore conditions the system evolves to various states of equilibrium, characterized
by different values of the macroscopic characteristics such as temperature, density, pressure.
Comparisons of results of molecular dynamic simulations with the results of calculations based
on the macroscopic diffusion model and experimental data allow to conclude that the combination
of macroscopic and microscopic approach could produce more adequate and more accurate description
of processes of water vapor interaction with porous materials.
