Sputter thin film deposition after photolithography often produces unwanted spikes along the
side edges. These spikes are a significant issue for the development of magnetic tunnel junction
(MTJ)-based memory and molecular spintronics devices, microelectronics, and micro-electro-mechanical
systems because they influence the properties of the other films deposited on the top. Our molecular
spintronics devices that utilize MTJ as the testbed are almost short-lived and encountered high
background current that masked the effect of molecular transport channels placed along the sides
of MTJs. Therefore, tapered thin film edges are critically needed in devices. Here, we report a very
cost-efficient and fast way of creating an optimum photoresist profile for the production of spike-free
patterned films. This approach is based on performing a soaking in the photoresist developer after
baking and before the UV exposure. However, the success of this method depends on multiple factors
accounted for during photolithography - photoresist thickness (spin speed), baking temperature,
soaking time and exposure time. Our recent experiments systematically studied the effect of these
factors by following the L9 experimental scheme of the Taguchi Design of the experiment (TDOE).
We discovered that baking temperature was the most influential parameter; presoak time and photoresist
thickness were two other influential factors; exposure time was the least effective factor. We
also found that 4000 rpm, 100 C soft baking, 60 s soaking, and 15 s UV exposure yielded the best results.
Finally, the paper also discusses the interdependence of selected factors, and the impact of the
individual levels of each factor. This study is expected to benefit MEMS and micro/nanoelectronics
device researchers because it attempts at finding a cheaper and faster alternative to creating
an optimum photoresist profile.
