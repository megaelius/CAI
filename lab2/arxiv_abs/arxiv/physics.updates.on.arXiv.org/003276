Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography (USWE) with conventional B-mode imaging demonstrates better
performance in lesion segmentation and classification problems. In this article, we propose SHEAR-net,
an end-to-end deep neural network, to reconstruct USWE images from tracked tissue displacement
data at different time instants induced by a single acoustic radiation force (ARF) with 100% or 50%
of the energy in conventional use. The SHEAR-net consists of a localizer called the S-net to first
localize the lesion location and then uses recurrent layers to extract temporal correlations from
wave patterns using different time frames, and finally, with an estimator, it reconstructs the
shear modulus image from the concatenated outputs of S-net and recurrent layers. The network is
trained with 800 simulation and a limited number of CIRS tissue mimicking phantom data and is optimized
using a multi-task learning loss function where the tasks are: inclusion localization and modulus
estimation. The efficacy of the proposed SHEAR-net is extensively evaluated both qualitatively
and quantitatively on 125 test set of motion data obtained from simulation and CIRS phantoms. We
show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art method
and achieves overall 4-5 dB improvement in PSNR and SNR. In addition, an average gain of 0.15 in DSC
and SSIM values indicate that the SHEAR-net has a better inclusion coverage area and structural
similarity of the two approaches. The proposed real-time deep learning based technique can accurately
estimate shear modulus for a minimum tissue displacement of 0.5$\mu$m and image multiple inclusions
with a single push ARF.
