Ladyman and Ross (LR) argue that quantum objects are not individuals (or are at most weakly discernible
individuals) and use this idea to ground their metaphysical view, ontic structural realism, according
to which relational structures are primary to things. LR acknowledge that there is a version of quantum
theory, namely the Bohm theory (BT), according to which particles do have definite trajectories
at all times. However, LR interpret the research by Brown {\em et al.} as implying that "raw stuff"
or {\em haecceities} are needed for the individuality of particles of BT, and LR dismiss this as idle
metaphysics. In this paper we note that Brown {\em et al.}'s research does not imply that {\em haecceities}
are needed. Thus BT remains as a genuine option for those who seek to understand quantum particles
as individuals. However, we go on to discuss some problems with BT which led Bohm and Hiley to modify
it. This modified version underlines that, due to features such as context-dependence and non-locality,
Bohmian particles have a very limited autonomy in situations where quantum effects are non-negligible.
So while BT restores the possibility of quantum individuals, it also underlines the primacy of the
whole over the autonomy of the parts. The later sections of the paper also examine the Bohm theory
in the general mathematical context of symplectic geometry. This provides yet another way of understanding
the subtle, holistic and dynamic nature of Bohmian individuals. We finally briefly consider Bohm's
other main line of research, the "implicate order", which is in some ways similar to LR's structural
realism.
