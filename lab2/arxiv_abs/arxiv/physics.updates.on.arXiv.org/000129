The integration of empirical data in computational frameworks to model the spread of infectious
diseases poses challenges that are becoming pressing with the increasing availability of high-resolution
information on human mobility and contacts. This deluge of data has the potential to revolutionize
the computational efforts aimed at simulating scenarios and designing containment strategies.
However, the integration of detailed data sources yields models that are less transparent and general.
Hence, given a specific disease model, it is crucial to assess which representations of the raw data
strike the best balance between simplicity and detail. We consider high-resolution data on the
face-to-face interactions of individuals in a hospital ward, obtained by using wearable proximity
sensors. We simulate the spread of a disease in this community by using an SEIR model on top of different
mathematical representations of the contact patterns. We show that a contact matrix that only contains
average contact durations fails to reproduce the size of the epidemic obtained with the high-resolution
contact data and also to identify the most at-risk classes. We introduce a contact matrix of probability
distributions that takes into account the heterogeneity of contact durations between (and within)
classes of individuals, and we show that this representation yields a good approximation of the
epidemic spreading properties obtained by using the high-resolution data. Our results mark a step
towards the definition of synopses of high-resolution dynamic contact networks, providing a compact
representation of contact patterns that can correctly inform computational models designed to
discover risk groups and evaluate containment policies. We show that this novel kind of representation
can preserve in simulation quantitative features of the epidemics that are crucial for their study
and management.
