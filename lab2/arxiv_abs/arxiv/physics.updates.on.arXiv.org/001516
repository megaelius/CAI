Models of social diffusion reflect processes of how new products, ideas or behaviors are adopted
in a population. These models typically lead to a continuous or a discontinuous phase transition
of the number of adopters as a function of a control parameter. We explore a simple model of social
adoption where the agents can be in two states, either adopters or non-adopters, and can switch between
these two states interacting with other agents through a network. The probability of an agent to
switch from non-adopter to adopter depends on the number of adopters in her network neighborhood,
the adoption threshold $T$ and the adoption coefficient $a$, two parameters defining a Hill function.
In contrast, the transition from adopter to non-adopter is spontaneous at a certain rate $\mu$.
In a mean-field approach, we derive the governing ordinary differential equations and show that
the nature of the transition between the global non-adoption and global adoption regimes depends
mostly on the balance between the probability to adopt with one and two adopters. The transition
changes from continuous, via a transcritical bifurcation, to discontinuous, via a combination
of a saddle-node and a transcritical bifurcation, through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation.
We characterize the full parameter space. Finally, we compare our analytical results with Montecarlo
simulations on annealed and quenched degree regular networks, showing a better agreement for the
annealed case. Our results show how a simple model is able to capture two seemingly very different
types of transitions, i.e., continuous and discontinuous and thus unifies underlying dynamics
for different systems. Furthermore the form of the adoption probability used here is based on empirical
measurements.
