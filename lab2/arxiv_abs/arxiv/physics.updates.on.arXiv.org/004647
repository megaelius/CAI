Growth of the single-fluid single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) is revisited in 2D and
3D using fully compressible high-resolution simulations. We conduct a systematic analysis of
the effects of perturbation Reynolds number ($Re_p$) and Atwood number ($A$) on RTI's late-time
growth. Contrary to the common belief that single-mode RTI reaches a terminal bubble velocity,
we show that the bubble re-accelerates when $Re_p$ is sufficiently large, consistent with [Ramaparabhu
et al. 2006, Wei and Livescu 2012]. However, unlike in [Ramaparabhu et al. 2006], we find that for
a sufficiently high $Re_p$, the bubble's late-time acceleration is persistent and does not vanish.
Analysis of vorticity dynamics shows a clear correlation between vortices inside the bubble and
re-acceleration. Due to symmetry around the bubble and spike (vertical) axes, the self-propagation
velocity of vortices points in the vertical direction. If viscosity is sufficiently small, the
vortices persist long enough to enter the bubble tip and accelerate the bubble [Wei and Livescu 2012].
A similar effect has also been observed in ablative RTI [Betti and Sanz 2006]. As the spike growth
increases relative to that of the bubble at higher $A$, vorticity production shifts downward, away
from the centerline and toward the spike tip. We modify the Betti-Sanz model for bubble velocity
by introducing a vorticity efficiency factor $\eta=0.45$ to accurately account for re-acceleration
caused by vorticity in the bubble tip. It had been previously suggested that vorticity generation
and the associated bubble re-acceleration are suppressed at high $A$. However, we present evidence
that if the large $Re_p$ limit is taken first, bubble re-acceleration is still possible. Our results
also show that re-acceleration is much easier to occur in 3D than 2D, requiring smaller $Re_p$ thresholds.
