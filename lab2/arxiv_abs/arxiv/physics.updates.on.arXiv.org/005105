This paper presents a physics-based data-driven method to learn predictive reduced-order models
(ROMs) from high-fidelity simulations, and illustrates it in the challenging context of a single-injector
combustion process. The method combines the perspectives of model reduction and machine learning.
Model reduction brings in the physics of the problem, constraining the ROM predictions to lie on
a subspace defined by the governing equations. This is achieved by defining the ROM in proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) coordinates, which embed the rich physics information contained in solution
snapshots of a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The machine learning perspective
brings the flexibility to use transformed physical variables to define the POD basis. This is in
contrast to traditional model reduction approaches that are constrained to use the physical variables
of the high-fidelity code. Combining the two perspectives, the approach identifies a set of transformed
physical variables that expose quadratic structure in the combustion governing equations and
learns a quadratic ROM from transformed snapshot data. This learning does not require access to
the high-fidelity model implementation. Numerical experiments show that the ROM accurately predicts
temperature, pressure, velocity, species concentrations, and the limit-cycle amplitude, with
speedups of more than five orders of magnitude over high-fidelity models. Our ROM simulation is
shown to be predictive 200% past the training interval. Moreover, ROM-predicted pressure traces
accurately match the phase of the pressure signal and yield good approximations of the limit-cycle
amplitude.
