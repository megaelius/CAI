We use interface-resolved numerical simulations to study finite-size effects in turbulent channel
flow of neutrally-buoyant spheres. Two cases with particle sizes differing by a factor of 2, and
same solid volume fraction of 20% and bulk Reynolds number are considered. These are complemented
with two reference single-phase flows: the unladen case, and the flow of a Newtonian fluid with the
effective suspension viscosity of the same mixture in laminar regime. As recently highlighted
in Costa et al. PRL 117, 134501, a particle-wall layer is responsible for deviations of mesoscale-averaged
statistics from what is observed in the continuum limit where the suspension is modeled as a Newtonian
fluid with an effective viscosity. Here we investigate in detail the fluid and particle dynamics
inside this layer and in the bulk. In the particle-wall layer, the near wall inhomogeneity has an
influence on the suspension micro-structure over a distance proportional to the particle size.
In this layer, particles have a significant slip velocity that is reflected in the distribution
of wall shear stresses. This is characterized by extreme events (both much higher and much lower
than the mean). Based on these observations we provide a scaling for the particle slip velocity as
a function of the flow governing parameters. We also extend the scaling laws in Costa et al. to second-order
Eulerian statistics in the homogeneous suspension region away from the wall. The results show that
finite- size effects in the bulk of the channel become important for larger particles, while negligible
for lower-order statistics. Finally, we study the particle dynamics along the wall-normal direction.
Our results suggest that single-point dispersion is dominated by particle-turbulence interactions,
while differences in two-point dispersion and collisional dynamics are consistent with a picture
of shear-driven interactions.
