Modified gravity theories, MGTs, with modified (nonlinear) dispersion relations, MDRs, encode
via indicator functionals possible modifications and effects of quantum gravity; in string/brane,
noncommutative and/or nonassociative gravity theories etc. MDRs can be with global and/or local
Lorentz invariance violations, LIVs, determined by quantum fluctuations, random, kinetic, statistical
and/or thermodynamical processes etc. Such MGTs with MDRs and corresponding models of locally
anisotropic spacetime and curved phase spaces can be geometrized in an axiomatic form for theories
constructed on (co) tangent bundles with base spacetime Lorentz manifolds. In certain canonical
nonholonomic variables, the geometric/physical objects are defined equivalently as in generalized
Einstein-Finsler and/or Lagrange-Hamilton spaces. In such Finsler like MGTs, the coefficients
of metrics and connections depend both on local Lorentz spacetime coordinates and, additionally,
on (co) fiber velocity and/or momentum type variables. The main goal of this work is to elaborate
on a nonholonomic diadic "shell by shell" formulation of MGTs with MDRs, with a conventional (2+2)+(2+2)
splitting of total phase space dimensions, when the (dual) modified Einstein-Hamilton equations
can be decoupled in general forms. We show how this geometric formalism allows us to construct various
classes of exact and parametric solutions determined by generating and integration functions
and effective sources depending, in principle, on all phase space coordinates. This work provides
a self-consistent geometric and analytic method for constructing in our further partner papers
different types of black hole solutions for theories with MDRs and LIVs and elaborating various
applications in modern cosmology and astrophysics.
