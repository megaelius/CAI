The contemporary scientific and technological progress has been given fully by the results of classical
mechanics from the 19th century when the so called European values were accepted practically by
the whole educated world. The given results and conclusions were gained on the basis of causal ontological
approach proposed in principle by Socrates and developed further by Aristotle. This approach has
been, however, fully extruded by phenomenological approach (causality not required) in the 20th
century, which has disallowed practically any further actual scientific progress. Three very
different theories have been applied to physical reality: classical mechanics in standard macroscopic
region, Copenhagen quantum mechanics in microscopic region, and special theory of reality (STR)
in both the regions in the case of systems consisting of objects having high velocity values. Any
explanation or description of transitions between different regions and between different theories
have not been provided until now. The situation has been complicated when the existence of inertial
mass increase with rising velocity (predicted by STR) was affirmed in the first half of the past century,
while any more detailed comparison with experiment data has not been presented. In this paper this
knowledge evolution in the modern period will be described. It will be shown, too, that some mistaking
assumptions and statements contradicting to the earlier successful causal ontological approach
have existed in the contemporary scientific system. It will be then demonstrated that practically
all known knowledge pieces may be described by one common theory based on slightly generalized Hamilton
equations for all regions of reality. All known observed characteristics of physical reality may
be described in such a case on the basis of the causal ontological approach.
