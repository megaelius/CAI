Proton radiography combined with X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been proposed to obtain a patient-specific
calibration curve and reduce range uncertainties in cancer treatment with charged particles.
The main aim of this study was to identify the optimal charged particle for the generation of the radiographies
and to determine the optimal number of projections necessary to obtain minimal range errors. Three
charged particles were considered to generate the radiographies: proton (p-rad), helium ions
({\alpha}-rad) and carbon ions (c-rad). The problem formulation was viewed as a least square optimization,
argmin_x (||Ax -b||_2^2 ), where the projection matrix A represents the cumulative path crossed
by each particle in each material, b is the charged particle list-mode radiography expressed as
the crossed water equivalent thickness (WET) and x is the relative stopping power (RSP) map to be
optimized. The charged particle radiographies were simulated using the Geant4 Monte Carlo (MC)
toolkit and an anthropomorphic adult head phantom. A was determined by calculating the particles
trajectory through the X-ray CT employing a convex hull detection combined with a cubic spline path.
For all particle types, the impact of using multiple projections was assessed (from 1 to 6 projections).
In this study, tissue segmentation methods were also investigated in terms of achievable accuracy.
The best results (mean RSP error below 0.7% and range errors below 1 mm) were obtained for a-rad when
3 projections were used. The dose delivered to the phantom by a single {\alpha}-rad was 8 \muGy, lower
than the dose of X-ray radiography.
