Ultracold hybrid ion-atom traps offer the possibility of microscopic manipulation of quantum
coherences in the gas using the ion as a probe. However, inelastic processes, particularly charge
transfer can be a significant process of ion loss and has been measured experimentally for the Yb$^{+}$
ion immersed in a Rb vapour. We use first-principles quantum chemistry codes to obtain the potential
energy curves and dipole moments for the lowest-lying energy states of this complex. Calculations
for the radiative decay processes cross sections and rate coefficients are presented for the total
decay processes. Comparing the semi-classical Langevin approximation with the quantum approach,
we find it provides a very good estimate of the background at higher energies. The results demonstrate
that radiative decay mechanisms are important over the energy and temperature region considered.
In fact, the Langevin process of ion-atom collisions dominates cold ion-atom collisions. For spin
dependent processes \cite{kohl13} the anisotropic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction and the
second-order spin-orbit coupling can play important roles, inducing couplingbetween the spin
and the orbital motion. They measured the spin-relaxing collision rate to be approximately 5 orders
of magnitude higher than the charge-exchange collision rate \cite{kohl13}. Regarding the measured
radiative charge transfer collision rate, we find that our calculation is in very good agreement
with experiment and with previous calculations. Nonetheless, we find no broad resonances features
that might underly a strong isotope effect. In conclusion, we find, in agreement with previous theory
that the isotope anomaly observed in experiment remains an open question.
