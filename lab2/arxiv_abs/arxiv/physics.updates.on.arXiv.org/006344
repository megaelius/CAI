Background: Without proven effect treatments and vaccines, Social Distancing is the key protection
factor against COVID-19. Social distancing alone should have been enough to protect again the virus,
yet things have gone very differently, with a big mismatch between theory and practice. What are
the reasons? A big problem is that there is no actual social distancing data, and the corresponding
people behavior in a pandemic is unknown. We collect the world-first dataset on social distancing
during the COVID-19 outbreak, so to see for the first time how people really implement social distancing,
identify dangers of the current situation, and find solutions against this and future pandemics.
Methods: Using a sensor-based social distancing belt we collected social distance data from people
in Italy for over two months during the most critical COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, we investigated
if and how wearing various Personal Protection Equipment, like masks, influences social distancing.
Results: Without masks, people adopt a counter-intuitively dangerous strategy, a paradox that
could explain the relative lack of effectiveness of social distancing. Using masks radically changes
the situation, breaking the paradoxical behavior and leading to a safe social distance behavior.
In shortage of masks, DIY (Do It Yourself) masks can also be used: even without filtering protection,
they provide social distancing protection. Goggles should be recommended for general use, as they
give an extra powerful safety boost. Generic Public Health policies and media campaigns do not work
well on social distancing: explicit focus on the behavioral problems of necessary mobility are
needed.
