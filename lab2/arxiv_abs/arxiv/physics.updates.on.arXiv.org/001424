The main objective of this article is to study the nonlinear stability and dynamic transitions of
the basic (zonal) shear flows for the three-dimensional continuously stratified rotating Boussinesq
model. The model equations are fundamental equations in geophysical fluid dynamics, and dynamics
associated with their basic zonal shear flows play a crucial role in understanding many important
geophysical fluid dynamical processes, such as the meridional overturning oceanic circulation
and the geophysical baroclinic instability. In this paper, first we derive a threshold for the energy
stability of the basic shear flow, and obtain a criteria for nonlinear stability in terms of the critical
horizontal wavenumbers and the system parameters such as the Froude number, the Rossby number,
the Prandtl number and the strength of the shear flow. Next we demonstrate that the system always
undergoes a dynamic transition from the basic shear flow to either a spatiotemporal oscillatory
pattern or circle of steady states, as the shear strength $\Lambda$ of the basic flow crosses a critical
threshold $\Lambda_c$. Also we show that the dynamic transition can be either continuous or catastrophic,
and is dictated by the sign of a transition parameter $A$, fully characterizing the nonlinear interactions
of different modes. A systematic numerical method is carried out to explore transition in different
flow parameter regimes. We find that the system admits only critical eigenmodes with horizontal
wave indices $(0,m_y)$. Such modes, horizontally have the pattern consisting of $m_y$-rolls aligned
with the x-axis. Furthermore, numerically we encountered continuous transitions to multiple
steady states, continuous and catastrophic transitions to spatiotemporal oscillations.
