The inertialess fluid-structure interaction of active and passive inextensible filaments and
slender-rods are central in many processes in nature, from the dynamics of semi-flexible polymers
to cytoskeletal filaments, flagella and artificial swimmers, covering a wide range of scales.
The nonlinear coupling between the geometry of deformation and the physical effects invariably
result on intricate governing equations that negotiate elastohydrodynamical interactions with
non-holonomic constraints, as a direct consequence of the filament inextensibility. This triggers
numerical instabilities and require penalization methods and high-order spatiotemporal propagators.
Here, we exploit the the momentum balance in the asymptotic limit of small rod-like elements which
are integrated semi-analytically. This bypasses the nonlinearities arising via the inextensibilty
constraint, avoiding in this way the need of Langrange multipliers. The equivalence between the
continuous and asymptotic model allows a direct comparison between the two formalisms. The nature
of the asymptotic approximation entails that coarse discretisation is possible while having a
higher precision when compared with the continuous approach. We show that the asymptotic model
is also numerically stable in situations in which the continuous formalism has a very poor performance,
while the coarse structure guarantees faster computations, over than a hundred times faster than
previous schemes. The asymptotic model is simple and intuitive to implement, and generalisations
for complex interaction of multiple rods, Brownian polymer dynamics, active filaments and non-local
hydrodynamics are straightforward. We demonstrate these via four exemplars: transient dynamics,
force-displacement buckling instability, magnetic artificial swimmer and cross-linked filament-bundle
dynamics, and we additionally provide the Matlab codes.
