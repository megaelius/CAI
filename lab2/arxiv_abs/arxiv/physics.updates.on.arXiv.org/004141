The Comment of M. Partanen and J. Tulkki [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 100}, 017801 (2019)] claims that my criticism
expressed in Phys. Rev. A {\bf 98}, 043847 (2018) of the earlier paper of Partanen {\it et al.} [Phys.
Rev. A {\bf 95}, 063850 (2017)] was incorrect. There are essentially three points involved here:
(1) the first one regards the physical interpretation of the radiation pressure experiment of A.
Kundu {\it et al.} [Sci. Rep. {\bf 7}, 42538 (2017)]. My mathematical analysis of this situation,
although simple, was able to illustrate the main property of the experiment, namely that it showed
the action from the radiation forces on the dielectric boundaries, and from the Lorentz force in
the interior, but it had not any relationship to the Abraham-Minkowski momentum problem as was originally
stated by the investigators. (2) The second point was my emphasis on the fact that in an electromagnetic
pulse in a medium there cannot be an accompanying mechanical energy density of the same order of magnitude
as the electromagnetic energy density itself. The electromagnetic wave carries with it a mechanical
{\it momentum}, but not a mechanical {\it energy}. Here I illustrate this point by a simple numerical
analysis. (3) When going to a relativistic formulation of the electromagnetic theory in matter,
care must be taken to secure that fundamental conditions from field theory are satisfied. In particular,
one cannot in general take the electromagnetic total energy and momentum of a radiation pulse to
constitute a four-vector; such a property holds only if the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor
is divergence-free. For the Minkowski tensor this condition is satisfied, whereas for the Abraham
tensor it is not.
