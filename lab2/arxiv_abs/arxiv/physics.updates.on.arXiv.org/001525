The topology of an object describes global properties that are insensitive to local perturbations.
Classic examples include string knots and the genus (number of handles) of a surface: no manipulation
of a closed string short of cutting it changes its "knottedness"; and no deformation of a closed surface,
short of puncturing it, changes how many handles it has. Topology has recently become an intense
focus of condensed matter physics, where it arises in the context of the quantum Hall effect [1] and
topological insulators [2]. In each case, topology is defined through invariants of the material's
bulk [3-5], but experimentally measured through chiral/helical properties of the material's
edges. In this work we measure topological invariants of a quantum Hall material through local response
of the bulk: treating the material as a many-port circulator enables direct measurement of the Chern
number as the spatial winding of the circulator phase; excess density accumulation near spatial
curvature quantifies the curvature-analog of charge known as mean orbital spin, while the moment
of inertia of this excess density reflects the chiral central charge. We observe that the topological
invariants converge to their global values when probed over a few magnetic lengths lB, consistent
with intuition that the bulk/edge distinction exists only for samples larger than a few lB. By performing
these experiments in photonic Landau levels of a twisted resonator [6], we apply quantum-optics
tools to topological matter. Combined with developments in Rydberg-mediated interactions between
resonator photons [7], this work augurs an era of precision characterization of topological matter
in strongly correlated fluids of light.
