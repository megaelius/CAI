Proton radiotherapy promises accurate dose delivery to a tumor and minimal dose deposition to all
other tissues. However, in practice the planned dose distribution may not conform to the actual
one due to noisy data and different types of errors. One such error comes in a form of potentially inaccurate
conversion of the Hounsfield units (HU) to stopping powers (SP) of protons. We propose a method of
improving the CC based on a planning CT and proton range measurements acquired during treatment.
The range data were simulated using a virtual CC and a planning CT. The range data were given two types
of noise: range shift due to patient setup errors; and range noise due to measurement imprecision,
including a misalignment of the range measuring device. The method consists of two parts. The first
part involves a Taylor expansion of the water equivalent path length (WEPL) map in terms of the range
shift caused by the difference between the planning and the virtual CC. The range shift is then solved
for explicitly, leading to a polynomial function of the difference between the two CCs. The second
part consists in minimizing a score function relating the range due to the virtual CC and the range
due to the optimized CC. Tested on ten different CCs, our results show that, with range data collected
over a few fractions (less than 10), the optimized CC leads to an overall reduction of the range difference.
More precisely, on average, the uncertainty of the CC was reduced from 2.67% to 1.62%, while the average
reduction of the WEPL bias was reduced from 2.14% to 0.74%. The advantage of our method over others
is 1) its speed, and 2) the fact that the range data it necessitates are acquired during the treatment
itself, and as such it does not burden the patient with additional dose.
