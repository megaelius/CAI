The sources of wall-pressure fluctuation in turbulent channel flow are studied using a novel framework.
The wall-pressure power spectral density (PSD) $(\phi_{pp}(\omega))$ is expressed as an integrated
contribution from all wall-parallel plane pairs, $\phi_{pp}(\omega)=\int_{-1}^{+1}\int_{-1}^{+1}\Gamma(r,s,\omega)\,\mathrm{dr}\,\mathrm{ds}$,
using the Green's function. $\Gamma(r,s,\omega)$ is termed the net source cross spectral density
(CSD) between two wall-parallel planes, $y=r$ and $y=s$. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data
at friction Reynolds number of $180$ and $400$ are used to compute $\Gamma(r,s,\omega)$. Analysis
of the net source CSD, $\Gamma(r,s,\omega)$ reveals that i) the location of dominant sources responsible
for the premultiplied peak in the power spectra at $\omega^+\approx 0.35$ and the wavenumber spectra
at $\lambda^+\approx 200$ is in the buffer layer at $y^+\approx 16.5$ and $18.4$ for $Re_{\tau}=180$
and $400$, respectively. ii) The contribution from a wall-parallel plane (located at distance
$y^+$ from the wall) to wall-pressure PSD is log-normal in $y^+$ for $\omega^+>0.35$. iii) A dominant
inner-overlap region interaction of the sources is observed at low frequencies. Further, the decorrelated
features of the wall-pressure fluctuation sources are analyzed using spectral Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD). Spectral POD reveals that i) the phase of a spectral POD mode plays a large role
in determining its contribution to wall-pressure PSD through constructive/destructive interference.
ii) Near-wall wavepackets that contain sources travelling away from the wall are the dominant contributors
to wall-pressure PSD at high frequencies. iii) At low frequencies, such wall-normal wavepacket
structure of the dominant wall-pressure source is not observed. The wall-parallel waves that constructively
interfere contribute the most to wall-pressure PSD.
