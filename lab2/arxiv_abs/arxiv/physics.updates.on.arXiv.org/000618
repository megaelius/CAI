In the recent past observational and modelling studies have shown that the vertical displacement
of water parcels, and therefore, phytoplankton particles in regions of deep-reaching convection
plays a key role in late winter/early spring primary production. The underlying mechanism describes
how convection cells capture living phytoplankton cells and recurrently expose them to sunlight.
This study presents a parameterisation called `phytoconvection' which focuses on the influence
of convection on primary production. This parameterisation was implemented into a three-dimensional
physical-biogeochemical model and applied to the Northwestern European Continental Shelf and
areas of the adjacent Northeast Atlantic. The simulation was compared to a `conventional' parameterisation
with respect to its influence on phytoplankton concentrations during the annual cycle and its effect
on the carbon cycle. The simulation using the new parameterisation showed good agreement with observation
data recorded during winter, whereas the reference simulation did not capture the observed phytoplankton
concentrations. The new parameterisation had a strong influence on the carbon export through the
sinking of particulate organic carbon. The carbon export during late winter/early spring significantly
exceeded the export of the reference run. Furthermore, a non-hydrostatic convection model was
used to evaluate the major assumption of the presented parameterisation which implies the matching
of the mixed layer depth with the convective mixing depth. The applied mixed layer depth criterion
principally overestimates the actual convective mixing depth. However, the results showed that
this assumption is reasonable during late winter, while indicating a mismatch during spring.
