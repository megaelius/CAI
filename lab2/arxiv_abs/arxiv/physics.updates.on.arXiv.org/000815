Markov state models (MSMs) have been widely used to analyze computer simulations of various biomolecular
systems. They can capture conformational transitions much slower than an average or maximal length
of a single molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory from the set of trajectories used to build the MSM.
A rule of thumb claiming that the slowest implicit timescale captured by an MSM should be comparable
by the order of magnitude to the aggregate duration of all MD trajectories used to build this MSM has
been known in the field. However, this rule have never been formally proved. In this work, we present
analytical results for the slowest timescale in several types of MSMs, supporting the above rule.
We conclude that the slowest implicit timescale equals the product of the aggregate sampling and
four factors that quantify: (1) how much statistics on the conformational transitions corresponding
to the longest implicit timescale is available, (2) how good the sampling of the destination Markov
state is, (3) the gain in statistics from using a sliding window for counting transitions between
Markov states, and (4) a bias in the estimate of the implicit timescale arising from finite sampling
of the conformational transitions. We demonstrate that in many practically important cases all
these four factors are on the order of unity, and we analyze possible scenarios that could lead to
their significant deviation from unity. Overall, we provide for the first time analytical results
on the slowest timescales captured by MSMs. These results can guide further practical applications
of MSMs to biomolecular dynamics and allow for higher computational efficiency of simulations.
