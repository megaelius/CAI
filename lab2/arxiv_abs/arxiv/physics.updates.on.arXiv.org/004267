We establish a classical electrodynamic theory for the non-radiative transfer of field helicity
(RHELT) and energy (RET) between a donor and an acceptor, both being dipolar, magnetoelectric and
bi-isotropic, chiral in particular, with rotating excited dipoles. We introduce orientational
factors that control this process. Also, a RHELT and RET interaction radius is put forward. The detection
of RHELT adds a wealth of information contained in the helicity of the transferred fields, never
used or established to date. The nature of these dipolar magnetoelectric bi-isotropic particles
and/or molecules with induced dipoles possessing angular momentum, enriches the number of variables
and associated effects. Hence the landscape involved in this transfer phenomenon, never explored
before, is significantly broader than in conventional FRET. In this way, chiral interacting objects
convey terms in the equations of transfer rate of helicity and energy that are discriminatory, so
that one can extract information on their structural chirality handedness and polarization rotation.
As such, not only the rate of electromagnetic helicity transfer, but also that of energy transfer
may be negative, which for the latter means an enhanced emission from the donor in pressence of acceptor,
a phenomenon which does not exist in conventional FRET. Importantly, both the RHELT and RET rates,
as well as the RHELT interaction radius, are very sensitive to changes in the helicity, or state of
polarization, of the illumination, as well as to the polarization of the excited electric and magnetic
dipole moments of donor and acceptor. Finally, we introduce the observable quanties in terms of
which one can obtain the transfer rates and interaction radii.
