Can three-dimensional, microvasculature networks still ensure blood supply if individual links
fail? We address this question in the sinusoidal network, a plexus-like microvasculature network,
which transports nutrient-rich blood to every hepatocyte in liver tissue, by building on recent
advances in high-resolution imaging and digital reconstruction of adult mice liver tissue. We
find that the topology of the three-dimensional sinusoidal network reflects its two design requirements
of a space-filling network that connects all hepatocytes, while using shortest transport routes:
sinusoidal networks are sub-graphs of the Delaunay graph of their set of branching points, and also
contain the corresponding minimum spanning tree, both to good approximation. To overcome the spatial
limitations of experimental samples and generate arbitrarily-sized networks, we developed a
network generation algorithm that reproduces the statistical features of 0.3-mm-sized samples
of sinusoidal networks, using multi-objective optimization for node degree and edge length distribution.
Nematic order in these simulated networks implies anisotropic transport properties, characterized
by an empirical linear relation between a nematic order parameter and the anisotropy of the permeability
tensor. Under the assumption that all sinusoid tubes have a constant and equal flow resistance,
we predict that the distribution of currents in the network is very inhomogeneous, with a small number
of edges carrying a substantial part of the flow. We quantify network resilience in terms of a permeability-at-risk,
i.e.\ permeability as function of the fraction of removed edges. We find that sinusoidal networks
are resilient to random removal of edges, but vulnerable to the removal of high-current edges. Our
findings suggest the existence of a mechanism counteracting flow inhomogeneity to balance metabolic
load on the liver.
