Understanding the mechanisms of explosions is important for minimizing devastating hazards.
Due to the complexity of real chemistry, a single-step reaction mechanism is usually used for theoretical
and numerical studies. The purpose of this study is to look more deeply into the influence of chemistry
on detonation initiated by a spontaneous wave. Results of high resolution simulations performed
for one-step models are compared with simulations for detailed chemical models for highly reactive
and low reactive mixtures. The calculated induction times for H2/air and for CH4/air are validated
against experimental measurements for a wide range of temperatures and pressures. It is found that
the requirements in terms of temperature and size of the hot spots, which produce a spontaneous wave
capable to initiate detonation, are quantitatively and qualitatively different for one-step
models compared to the detailed chemical models. The impact of detailed chemical model is particularly
pronounced for the methane-air mixture. In this case, not only the hot spot size is much greater than
that predicted by a one-step model, but even at elevated pressure the initiation of detonation by
a temperature gradient is possible only if the temperature outside the gradient is so high, that
can ignite thermal explosion. The obtained results suggest that the one-step models do not reproduce
correctly the transient and ignition processes, so that interpretation of the simulations performed
using a one-step model for understanding mechanisms of flame acceleration, DDT and the origin of
explosions must be considered with great caution.
