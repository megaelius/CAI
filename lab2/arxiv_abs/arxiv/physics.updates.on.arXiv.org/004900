Shock related unsteadiness over axisymmetric spiked body configurations is experimentally investigated
at a freestream supersonic Mach number of 2.0 at zero degree angle of attack. Three different forebody
configurations mounted with a sharp spike-tip ranging from blunt to streamlined (flat-face, hemispherical,
and elliptical) are considered. Steady and unsteady pressure measurements, short exposure shadowgraphy,
shock footprint analysis from $x-t$ plots, and identification of dominant spatiotemporal modes
through modal analysis are carried out to explain the unsteady flow physics. The present investigation
tools are validated against the well-known events of `pulsation' associated with the flat-face
case. The hemispherical case is characterized by the formation of a separated free shear layer and
associated localized shock oscillations. The cycle of charging and ejection of fluid mass from
the recirculation zone, confined between the separated shear layer and the spiked body, is identified
to drive flow unsteadiness. Such an event triggers the out-of-phase motion between the separated
and reattachment shocks. In the elliptical case, the overall flow field resembles that of the hemispherical
case, except with dampened unsteadiness. The cone angle ($\lambda$) of the recirculation region
is found to be responsible for the intensity of charging and ejection of fluid mass, thereby the intensity
of out-of-phase shocks motion. In the latter case, $\lambda$ is observed to be smaller and exhibits
a reduction in shock unsteadiness. Based on the gather results and understanding, a modified spike-tip
geometry is proposed to almost completely eliminate the out-of-phase shock motion, and it is indeed
shown to exhibit the least level of shock-related unsteadiness.
