Structurally well-defined TIPS-acetylene substituted tetracene (TIPS BT1') and pentacene (TIPS
BP1') dimers utilizing a [2.2.1] bicyclic norbornyl bridge have been studied -primarily using
time-resolved spectroscopic methods - to uncover mechanistic details about primary steps in singlet
fission leading to formation of the biexcitonic 1TT state as well as decay pathways to the ground
state. For TIPS BP1' in room temperature toluene, 1TT formation is rapid and complete, occurring
in 4.4 ps. Decay to the ground state in 100 ns is the primary loss pathway for 1TT in this system. For
TIPS BT1', the 1TT is also observed to form rapidly (with a time constant of 5 ps) but in this case it
occurs in concert with establishment of an excited state equilibrium (K~1) with the singlet exciton
state S1 at an energy of 2.3 eV above the ground state. The equilibrated states survive for 36 ns and
are lost to ground state through both radiative and non-radiative pathways via the S1 and non-radiative
pathways via the 1TT. The rapidity of 1TT formation in TIPS BT1' is at first glance surprising. However,
our analysis suggests that the few-parameter rate constant expression of Marcus theory explains
both individual and comparative findings in the set of systems, thus establishing benchmarks for
diabatic coupling and reorganization energy needed for efficient 1TT formation. Finally, a comparison
of TIPS BT1' with previous results obtained for a close constitutional isomer (TIPS-BT1) differing
in the placement of TIPS-acetylene side groups suggests that the magnitude of exchange interaction
in the correlated triplet manifold plays a critical role dictating 1TT yield in the tetracenic systems.
