Roe scheme is known for its good performance in moderate-Mach-number flows. However, this scheme
and its extended versions suffers from many disastrous problems, such as non-physical behavior,
global cut-off, and checkerboard problems, for incompressible flows; and shock instability,
expansion shock, and positively non-conservative problems for hypersonic flows. In this paper,
non-physical behavior problem, checkerboard problem, and main reason of shock instability problem
are due to that the Roe scheme cannot identify multi-dimensional incompressible and compressible
flows when normal Mach number on the cell face tends to zero, and then leads to incorrect cross modifications.
Positively non-conservative problem is also identified as another important reason for shock
instability. Therefore, Mach number and an assistant pressure-density-varying detector are
introduced into the Roe scheme to judge compressibility, positivity condition is satisfied by
a simple modification with minimal numerical dissipation increases and even with possible decreases
in numerical dissipation, the mechanism of the preconditioned Roe scheme is introduced to suppress
checkerboard problem, and modified entropy fix and the rotated Riemann solver is combined with
complementary advantages as an assistant improvement for better robust. Based on above improvements
and previous developments for global cut-off and expansion shock problems, an improvement Roe
scheme for all Mach-number flow (Roe-AM) is proposed to simultaneously overcome nearly all well-known
drawbacks of the classical Roe scheme. The Roe-AM scheme is simple, easy to implement, computationally
low-cost, robust, good extensibility, and free of empirical parameters essentially, with increasing
minimal numerical dissipation.
