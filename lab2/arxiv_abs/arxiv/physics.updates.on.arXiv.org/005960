Significant progress has been made to experimentally determine a complete set of the parity-violating
(PV) weak-interaction amplitudes between nucleons. In this paper we describe the design, construction
and operation of the n$^3$He experiment that was used to measure the PV asymmetry $A_{\mathrm{PV}}$
in the direction of proton emission in the reaction $\vec{\mathrm{n}} + {^3}\mathrm{He} \rightarrow
{^3}\mathrm{H} + \mathrm{p}$, using the capture of polarized cold neutrons in an unpolarized gaseous
$^3\mathrm{He}$ target. This asymmetry has was recently calculated \cite{Viviani,Viviani2},
both in the traditional style meson exchange picture, and in effective field theory (EFT), including
two-pion exchange. The high precision result (published separately) obtained with the experiment
described herein forms an important benchmark for hadronic PV (HPV) theory in few-body systems,
where precise calculations are possible. To this day, HPV is still one of the most poorly understood
aspects of the electro-weak theory. The calculations estimate the size of the asymmetry to be in
the range of $(-9.4 \rightarrow 3.5)\times 10^{-8}$, depending on the framework or model. The small
size of the asymmetry and the small overall goal uncertainty of the experiment of $\delta A_{\mathrm{PV}}
\simeq 1\times10^{-8}$ places strict requirements on the experiment, especially on the design
of the target-detector chamber. In this paper we describe the experimental setup and the measurement
methodology as well as the detailed design of the chamber, including results of Garfield++ and Geant4
simulations that form the basis of the chamber design and analysis. We also show data from commissioning
and production and define the systematic errors that the chamber contributes to the measured $A_{\mathrm{PV}}$.
We give the final uncertainty on the measurement.
