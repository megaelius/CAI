We present a robust numerical scheme for simulating high density and high shear multiphase flows
on staggered Cartesian grids. The Cartesian grids are dynamically refined to adapt to the evolving
interfaces and high vorticity regions. The algorithm combines the interface capturing level set
method with a novel velocity-pressure coupled, variable-coefficient incompressible Navier-Stokes
solver that is able to implicitly handle six orders of magnitude difference in the material properties.
The monolithic solver employs a hybrid preconditioner that ensures second-order pointwise accuracy
for both velocity and pressure with several physical boundary treatments, including velocity
and traction boundary conditions. We present several test cases to demonstrate the order of accuracy
and scalability of the flow solver. To ensure the stability of the numerical scheme in the presence
of high density and viscosity ratios, we employ a consistent treatment of mass and momentum transport
in the conservative form of discrete equations. This consistency is achieved by solving an additional
mass balance equation using the stable SSP-RK3 time integrator, and employing the same mass flux
(obtained from the mass equation) in the discrete momentum equation. Fluctuations in the density
field due its transport are avoided by employing higher-order total variation diminishing (TVD)
and convection-boundedness criterion (CBC) satisfying limiters. The high-order bounded convective
transport is done on a dimension by dimension basis, which makes our scheme simple to extend to two
and three spatial dimensions. We also demonstrate through several test cases that the lack of consistent
mass and momentum transport in the frequently used non-conservative multiphase flow solvers and/or
the use of non-CBC satisfying limiters can fail miserably for convection-dominant high density
ratio flows.
