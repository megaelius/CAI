We develop a novel multiscale model of interface motion for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI)
and Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) for two-dimensional, inviscid, compressible flows
with vorticity, which yields a fast-running numerical algorithm that produces both qualitatively
and quantitatively similar results to a resolved gas dynamics code, while running approximately
two orders of magnitude (in time) faster. Our multiscale model is founded upon a new compressible-incompressible
decomposition of the velocity field $u=v+w$. The incompressible component $w$ of the velocity
is also irrotational and is solved using a new asymptotic model of the Birkhoff-Rott singular integral
formulation of the incompressible Euler equations, which reduces the problem to one spatial dimension.
This asymptotic model, called the higher-order $z$-model, is derived using small nonlocality
as the asymptotic parameter, allows for interface turn-over and roll-up, and yields a significant
simplification for the equation describing the evolution of the amplitude of vorticity. This incompressible
component $w$ of the velocity controls the small scale structures of the interface and can be solved
efficiently on fine grids. Meanwhile, the compressible component of the velocity $v$ remains continuous
near contact discontinuities and can be computed on relatively coarse grids, while receiving subgrid
scale information from $w$. We first validate the incompressible higher-order $z$-model by comparison
with classical RTI experiments as well as full point vortex simulations. We then consider both the
RTI and the RMI problems for our multiscale model of compressible flow with vorticity, and show excellent
agreement of our high-resolution gas dynamics solutions.
