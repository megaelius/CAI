We experimentally investigate the evaporation dynamics of sessile droplets of a fixed volume consisting
of different compositions of ethanol-water binary mixture at different substrate temperatures
(T_s). At T_s=25oC, we observe pinned-stage linear evaporation for pure droplets, but a binary
droplet undergoes two distinct evaporation stages: an early pinned stage and a later receding stage.
In the binary droplet, the more volatile ethanol, evaporates faster leading to a nonlinear trend
in the evaporation process at the early stage. The phenomenon observed in the present study at T_s=25oC
is similar to that presented by previous researchers at room temperature. More interesting dynamics
is observed in the evaporation process of a binary droplet at an elevated substrate temperature.
We found that the lifetime of the droplet exhibits a non-monotonic trend with the increase in ethanol
concentration in the binary mixture, which {can be attributed to} the non-ideal behaviour of water-ethanol
binary mixtures. Increasing T_s decreases the lifetime of the (50\% ethanol + 50 \% water) binary
droplet in a logarithmic scale. For this composition, at T_s=60oC, we observed an early spreading
stage, an intermediate pinned stage and a late receding stage of evaporation. Unlike T_s=25oC,
at the early times of the evaporation process, the contact angle of the droplet of pure water at T_s=60oC
is greater than 90. Late stage interfacial instability and even droplet break-up are observed for
some (though not all) binary mixture compositions. The evaporation dynamics for different compositions
at T_s=60oC exhibit a self-similar trend. Finally, the evaporation rates of pure and binary droplets
at different substrate temperatures are compared against a theoretical model developed for pure
and binary mixture droplets.
