We formulate a class of stochastic partial differential equations based on Kelvin's circulation
theorem for ideal fluids. In these models, the velocity field is randomly transported by white-noise
vector fields, as well as by its own average over realizations of this noise. We call these systems
the Lagrangian averaged stochastic advection by Lie transport (LA SALT) equations. These equations
are nonlinear and non-local, in both physical and probability space. Before taking this average,
the equations recover the Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport (SALT) fluid equations introduced
by Holm (2015). Remarkably, the introduction of the non-locality in probability space in the form
of momentum transported by its own mean velocity gives rise to a closed equation for the expectation
field which comprises Navier--Stokes equations with Lie--Laplacian "dissipation". As such,
this form of non-locality provides a regularization mechanism. The formalism we develop is closely
connected to the stochastic Weber velocity framework of Constantin and Iyer (2008) in the case when
the noise correlates are taken to be the constant basis vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and, thus, the
Lie--Laplacian reduces to the usual Laplacian. We extend this class of equations to allow for advected
quantities to be present and affect the flow through exchange of kinetic and potential energies.
The statistics of the solutions for the LA SALT fluid equations are found to be changing dynamically
due to an array of intricate correlations among the physical variables. The statistical properties
of the LA SALT physical variables propagate as local evolutionary equations which when spatially
integrated become dynamical equations for the variances of the fluctuations. Essentially, the
LA SALT theory is a non-equilibrium stochastic linear response theory for fluctuations in SALT
fluids with advected quantities.
