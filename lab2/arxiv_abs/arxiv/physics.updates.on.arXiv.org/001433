Statistical image reconstruction (SIR) methods for X-ray CT produce high-quality and accurate
images, while greatly reducing patient exposure to radiation. When further reducing X-ray dose
to an ultra-low level by lowering the tube current, photon starvation happens and electronic noise
starts to dominate, which introduces negative or zero values into the raw measurements. These non-positive
values pose challenges to post-log SIR methods that require taking the logarithm of the raw data,
and causes artifacts in the reconstructed images if simple correction methods are used to process
these non-positive raw measurements. The raw data at ultra-low dose deviates significantly from
Poisson or shifted Poisson statistics for pre-log data and from Gaussian statistics for post-log
data. This paper proposes a novel SIR method called MPG (mixed Poisson-Gaussian). MPG models the
raw noisy measurements using a mixed Poisson-Gaussian distribution that accounts for both the
quantum noise and electronic noise. MPG is able to directly use the negative and zero values in raw
data without any pre-processing. MPG cost function contains a reweighted least square data-fit
term, an edge preserving regularization term and a non-negativity constraint term. We use Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to separate the MPG optimization problem into several sub-problems
that are easier to solve. Our results on 3D simulated cone-beam data set and synthetic helical data
set generated from clinical data indicate that the proposed MPG method reduces noise and decreases
bias in the reconstructed images, comparing with the conventional filtered back projection (FBP),
penalized weighted least-square (PWLS) and shift Poisson (SP) method for ultra-low dose CT (ULDCT)
imaging.
