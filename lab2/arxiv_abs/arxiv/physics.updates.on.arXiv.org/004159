H-abstraction reactions occurring on electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) are a long-standing
and crucial topic in MS research. Yet some critical relevant mechanisms are controversial and ambiguous,
and information about the EI-induced H-abstraction reactions of halogenated organic compounds
(HOCs) is completely in the dark. This study provides a systematic investigation of H-abstraction
reactions of HOCs taking place on EI source using 13C6-hexachlorobenzene (13C6-HCB) and 13C6-hexabromobenzene
(13C6-HBB) as exemplary compounds by gas chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS).
The H-abstraction efficiencies were evaluated with the MS signal intensity ratios of ions with
H-abstraction relative to the corresponding original ions (without H-abstraction). Ion source
temperatures, EI energies and numbers of heavy isotope atoms (37Cl or 81Br) of isotopologues were
investigated in terms of their effects on the H-abstraction efficiencies. The H-abstraction efficiencies
of individual isotopologues generally decreased from the first to the last isotopologues of respective
ions, and those of individual ions were different from each other, with the highest values of 0.017
and 0.444 for 13C6-HCB and 13C6-HBB, respectively. The overall H-abstraction efficiencies involving
all measured ions of 13C6-HCB and 13C6-HBB were 0.004 and 0.128, respectively. EI energies and emission
currents could impact the H-abstraction efficiencies. The H-abstraction reactions were inferred
to belong to ion-molecule reactions. Some strategies were proposed for eliminating or alleviating
the interference triggered by the H-abstraction reactions on EI-MS in identification of halogenated
organic pollutants (HOPs). Our findings provide a better understanding for the EI-induced H-abstraction
reactions of HOCs, and may benefit identification of HOPs in environmental analysis, especially
for novel HOPs.
