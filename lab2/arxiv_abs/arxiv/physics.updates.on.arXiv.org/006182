The present article highlights the role of non-Newtonian (elastic) effects on the droplet impact
phenomenology at temperatures considerably higher than the boiling point, especially at or above
the Leidenfrost regime. The Leidenfrost point (LFP) was found to decrease with increase in the impact
Weber number (based on velocity just before the impact) for fixed polymer (Polyacrylamide, PAAM)
concentrations. Water droplets fragmented at very low Weber numbers (~22), whereas the polymer
droplets resisted fragmentation at much higher Weber numbers (~155). We also varied the polymer
concentration and observed that till 1000 ppm, the LFP was higher compared to water. This signifies
that the effect can be delayed by the use of elastic fluids. We have showed the possible role of elastic
effects (manifested by the formation of long lasting filaments) during retraction in the improvement
of the LFP. However for 1500 ppm, LFP was lower than water, but with similar residence time during
initial impact. In addition, we studied the role of Weber number and viscoelastic effects on the
rebound behaviour at 405o C. We observed that the critical Weber number till which the droplet resisted
fragmentation at 405o C increased with the polymer concentration. In addition, for a fixed Weber
number, the droplet rebound height and the hovering time period increased up to 500 ppm, and then
decreased. Similarly, for fixed polymer concentrations like 1000 and 1500 ppm, the rebound height
showed an increasing trend up to certain a certain Weber number and then decreased. This non-monotonic
behaviour of rebound heights was attributed to the observed diversion of rebound kinetic energy
to rotational energy during the hovering phase.
