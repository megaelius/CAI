We perform direct numerical simulations of the settling of an ice sphere in an ambient fluid accounting
for heat and mass transfer with the aim of studying in a meteorological context the case of falling
graupel in humid air. The study is motivated by the fact that falling graupels in clouds are heated
by the latent heat released during the accretion of liquid water droplets. They may therefore be
considerably warmer than their surrounding and evaporate water vapor, which mixes with the surrounding
air in the wake of the graupel, thereby creating transient zones of supersaturation there. The problem
of a falling graupel is modeled as that of a heated sphere falling in a quiescent ambient fluid under
the action of gravity. The coupling between the temperature and velocity fields is accounted for
by the Boussinesq approximation. This problem can be parameterized by four parameters: the particle/fluid
density ratio, the Galileo number, the Prandtl number, and the Richardson number. A separate scalar
transport equation accounts for the vapor transport. Typical cloud conditions involve small temperature
differences between the sphere and the surrounding, yielding relatively small Richardson numbers
for both heat and mass transport. We give a special emphasis to the Galileo numbers 150, 170, 200 and
300 in order to analyze the specificities of each settling regime. The questions addressed in this
study are mainly methodological and concern the influence of the settling regime and the mobility
of the sphere on the structure of the scalar fields, the possible influence of modest Richardson
numbers on the structure of the wake, and the possible application of this simulation framework
to the investigation of the saturation in the wake of a falling graupel.
