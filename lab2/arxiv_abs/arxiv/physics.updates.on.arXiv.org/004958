The lack of radiotherapy linear accelerators (LINACs) in Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMICs)
has been recognised as a major barrier to providing quality cancer care in these regions, along with
a shortfall in the number of highly qualified personnel. It is expected that additional challenges
will be faced in operating precise, high tech radiotherapy equipment in these environments, and
anecdotal evidence suggests that LINACs have greater downtime and higher failure rates of components
than their counterparts in High-Income Countries. To guide future developments such as the design
of a LINAC tailored for use in LMIC environments, it is important to take a data-driven approach to
any re-engineering of the technology. However, no detailed statistical data on LINAC downtime
and failure modes has been previously collected or presented in the literature. This work presents
the first known comparative analysis of failure modes and downtime of current generation LINACs
in radiotherapy centres, with the aim of determining any correlations between LINAC environment
and performance. Logbooks kept by radiotherapy personnel on the operation of their LINAC were obtained
and analysed from centres in Oxford (UK), Abuja, Benin, Enugu, Lagos, Sokoto (Nigeria) and Gaborone
(Botswana). By deconstructing the LINAC into 12 different subsystems, it is found that the vacuum
subsystem only fails in the LMIC centres and the failure rate in an LMIC environment is more than twice
as large in 6 of the 12 subsystems compared to the High Income Country (HIC). Additionally, it is shown
that despite accounting for only 3.4% of total number of faults, the LINAC faults which take more
than an hour to repair account for 74.6% of the total downtime. The results of this study inform future
attempts to mitigate the problems affecting LINACs in LMIC environments.
