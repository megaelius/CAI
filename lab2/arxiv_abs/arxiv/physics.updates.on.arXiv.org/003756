We present numerical and theoretical results concerning the properties of turbulent flows with
strong multi-scale helical injection. We perform direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes
equations under a random helical stirring with power-law spectrum and with different intensities
of energy and helicity injections. We show that there exists three different regimes where the forward
energy and helicity inertial transfers are: (i) both leading with respect to the external injections,
(ii) energy transfer is leading and helicity transfer is sub-leading and (iii) both are sub-leading
and helicity is maximal at all scales. As a result, the cases (ii-iii) give flows with Kolmogorov-like
inertial energy cascade and tuneable helicity transfers/contents. We further explore regime
(iii) by studying its effect on the kinetics of point-like isotropic helicoids, particles whose
dynamics is isotropic but breaks parity invariance. We investigate small-scale fractal clustering
and preferential sampling of intense helical flow structures. Depending on their structural parameters,
the isotropic helicoids either preferentially sample co-chiral or anti-chiral flow structures.
We explain these findings in limiting cases in terms of what is known for spherical particles of different
densities and degrees of inertia. Furthermore, we present theoretical and numerical results for
a stochastic model where dynamical properties can be calculated using analytical perturbation
theory. Our study shows that a suitable tuning of the stirring mechanism can strongly modify the
small-scale turbulent helical properties and demonstrates that isotropic helicoids are the simplest
particles able to preferentially sense helical properties in turbulence.
