One of the biggest perceived challenges in building megastructures, such as the space elevator,
is the unavailability of materials with sufficient tensile strength. The presumed necessity of
very strong materials stems from a design paradigm which requires structures to operate at a small
fraction of their maximum tensile strength (usually, 50% or less). This criterion limits the probability
of failure by giving structures sufficient leeway in handling stochastic components, such as variability
in material strength and/or external forces. While reasonable for typical engineering structures,
low working stress ratios --- defined as operating stress as a fraction of ultimate tensile strength
--- in the case of megastructures are both too stringent and unable to adequately control the failure
probability. We draw inspiration from natural biological structures, such as bones, tendons and
ligaments, which are made up of smaller substructures and exhibit self-repair, and suggest a design
that requires structures to operate at significantly higher stress ratios, while maintaining
reliability through a continuous repair mechanism. We outline a mathematical framework for analysing
the reliability of structures with components exhibiting probabilistic rupture and repair that
depend on their time-in-use (age). Further, we predict time-to-failure distributions for the
overall structure. We then apply this framework to the space elevator and find that a high degree
of reliability is achievable using currently existing materials, provided it operates at sufficiently
high working stress ratios, sustained through an autonomous repair mechanism, implemented via,
e.g., robots.
