Dripping, jetting and tip streaming have been studied up to a certain point separately by both fluid
mechanics and microfluidics communities, the former focusing on fundamental aspects while the
latter on applications. Here, we intend to review this field from a global perspective by considering
and linking the two sides of the problem. In the first part, we present the theoretical model used
to study interfacial flows arising in droplet-based microfluidics, paying attention to three
elements commonly present in applications: viscoelasticity, electric fields and surfactants.
We review both classical and current results about the stability of jets affected by these elements.
Mechanisms leading to the breakup of jets to produce drops are reviewed as well, including some recent
advances in this field. We also consider the relatively scarce theoretical studies on the emergence
and stability of tip streaming flows. In the second part of this review, we focus on axisymmetric
microfluidic configurations which can operate on the dripping and jetting modes either in a direct
(standard) way or via tip streaming. We present the dimensionless parameters characterizing these
configurations, the scaling laws which allow predicting the size of the resulting droplets and
bubbles, as well as those delimiting the parameter windows where tip streaming can be found. Special
attention is paid to electrospray and flow focusing, two of the techniques more frequently used
in continuous drop production microfluidics. We aim to connect experimental observations described
in this section of topics with fundamental and general aspects described in the first part of the
review. This work closes with some prospects at both fundamental and practical levels.
