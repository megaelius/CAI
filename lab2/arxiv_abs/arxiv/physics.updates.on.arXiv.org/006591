High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising therapy for thermal ablation and hyperthermia,
characterised by it noninvasiveness, high penetration depth. Effective HIFU thermo-therapy
requires the ability to accurately predict temperature elevation and corresponding thermal dose
distribution in target tissues. We report a parametric numerical study of the thermal response
and corresponding of thermal dose in a bio-tissue in response to ultrasound. We compared the predictions
of tissue models with two, three and seven layers, to ultrasound induced heating at duty cycles ranging
from 0.6 and 0.9. Further, two tumor sizes and transducer powers (10 W and 15 W) were considered. Inhomogeneous
Helmholtz equation was coupled with Penne's bioheat equation to predict heating in response to
pulsed ultrasound. Necrotic lesion size was calculated using the cumulative equivalent minute
(CEM) thermal dose function. In-vitro experiments were performed with agar-based tissue phantoms
as a preliminary validation of the numerical results. The simulations conducted with the seven
layered model predicted up to 33.5% lower peak pressure amplitude than the three-layered model.
As the ultrasound pulse width decreased with the equivalent sonication time fixed, the corresponding
magnitude of the peak temperature and the rate of temperature rise decreased. Pulsed ultrasound
resulted in increased the volume of necrotic lesions for equivalent time of sonication. The findings
of this study highlight the dependence of HIFU-induced heating on target geometry and acoustic
properties, and could help guide the choice of suitable ultrasound exposure parameters for further
studies.
