This survey explores the literature on game-theoretic models of network formation under the hypothesis
of mutual consent in link formation. The introduction of consent in link formation imposes a coordination
problem in the network formation process. This survey explores the conclusions from this theory
and the various methodologies to avoid the main pitfalls. The main insight originates from Myerson's
work on mutual consent in link formation and his main conclusion that the empty network (the network
without any links) always emerges as a strong Nash equilibrium in any game-theoretic model of network
formation under mutual consent and positive link formation costs. Jackson and Wolinsky introduced
a cooperative framework to avoid this main pitfall. They devised the notion of a pairwise stable
network to arrive at equilibrium networks that are mainly non-trivial. Unfortunately, this notion
of pairwise stability requires coordinated action by pairs of decision makers in link formation.
I survey the possible solutions in a purely non-cooperative framework of network formation under
mutual consent by exploring potential refinements of the standard Nash equilibrium concept to
explain the emergence of non-trivial networks. This includes the notions of unilateral and monadic
stability. The first one is founded on advanced rational reasoning of individuals about how others
would respond to one's efforts to modify the network. The latter incorporates trusting, boundedly
rational behaviour into the network formation process. The survey is concluded with an initial
exploration of external correlation devices as an alternative framework to address mutual consent
in network formation.
