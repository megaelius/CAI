A proof-of-concept framework for identifying molecules of unknown elemental composition and
structure using experimental rotational data and probabilistic deep learning is presented. Using
a minimal set of input data determined experimentally, we describe four neural network architectures
that yield information to assist in the identification of an unknown molecule. The first architecture
translates spectroscopic parameters into Coulomb matrix eigenspectra, as a method of recovering
chemical and structural information encoded in the rotational spectrum. The eigenspectrum is
subsequently used by three deep learning networks to constrain the range of stoichiometries, generate
SMILES strings, and predict the most likely functional groups present in the molecule. In each model,
we utilize dropout layers as an approximation to Bayesian sampling, which subsequently generates
probabilistic predictions from otherwise deterministic models. These models are trained on a
modestly sized theoretical dataset comprising ${\sim}$83,000 unique organic molecules (between
18 and 180 amu) optimized at the $\omega$B97X-D/6-31+G(d) level of theory where the theoretical
uncertainty of the spectroscopic constants are well understood and used to further augment training.
Since chemical and structural properties depend highly on molecular composition, we divided the
dataset into four groups corresponding to pure hydrocarbons, oxygen-bearing, nitrogen-bearing,
and both oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing species, training each type of network with one of these categories
thus creating "experts" within each domain of molecules. We demonstrate how these models can then
be used for practical inference on four molecules, and discuss both the strengths and shortcomings
of our approach, and the future directions these architectures can take.
