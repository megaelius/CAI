Owing to its conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency, the pseudopotential multiphase
lattice Boltzmann (LB) model has attracted significant attention since its emergence. In this
work, we aim to extend the pseudopotential LB model to simulate multiphase flows at large density
ratio and relatively high Reynolds number. First, based on our recent work [Li et al., Phys. Rev.
E. 86, 016709 (2012)], an improved forcing scheme is proposed for the multiple-relaxation-time
pseudopotential LB model in order to achieve thermodynamic consistency and large density ratio
in the model. Next, through investigating the effects of the parameter a in the Carnahan-Starling
equation of state, we find that the interface thickness is approximately proportional to 1/sqrt(a).
Using a smaller a will lead to a wider interface thickness, which can reduce the spurious currents
and enhance the numerical stability of the pseudopotential model at large density ratio. Furthermore,
it is found that a lower liquid viscosity can be gained in the pseudopotential model by increasing
the kinematic viscosity ratio between the vapor and liquid phases. The improved pseudopotential
LB model is numerically validated via the simulations of stationary droplet and droplet oscillation.
Using the improved model as well as the above treatments, numerical simulations of droplet splashing
on a thin liquid film are conducted at a density ratio in excess of 500 with Reynolds numbers ranging
from 40 to 1000. The dynamics of droplet splashing is correctly reproduced and the predicted spread
radius is found to obey the power law reported in the literature.
