The deep inspiration breath hold technique (DIBH) is widely used for left- sided breast radiotherapy
(RT), in order to reduce the dose to the heart and decrease the risk of cardiotoxicity. The volumetric
arc therapy (VMAT) technique increases the dose conformity to the planning target volume (PTV).
We hereby describe the advantages and pitfalls of combining VMAT and DIBH without a costly equipment.
Methods:Thirty patients for whom adjuvant irradiation for cancer of the left breast was prescribed,
were selected for a DIBH-VMAT treatment, depending on their ability to hold their breath for 25 seconds.
Ten of them received local (whole breast) RT (L-RT) with a simultaneously integrated boost (SIB)
of 2.4 Gy/fraction, 10 had locoregional (LR-RT) (supraclavicular, axillary, internal mammary
chain regions) of the chestwall (2Gy/fraction), and 10 received a LR-RT of the whole breast with
SIB. DIBH-VMAT treatment plans were compared to free breathing (FB)VMAT plans,and dose characteristics
of PTV and organs at risk (OAR) were evaluated. Results: The PTV coverage was identical in DIBH compared
to FB: 95% of the volume covered by 95% of the prescribed dose. The mean heart dose was reduced from
2.8+/-0.9Gy in FB to 1.8+/-0.6Gy in DIBH (p<0.006) for local RT, and reduced from 3.4 +/-1.3Gy in
FB to 2.2 0.5Gy in DIBH (p<0.004) for locoregional RT. The ipsilateral mean lung dose in DIBH-VMAT
was 6.2Gy+/-1.8Gy and 10.1Gy+/-1.5Gy for L-RT and LR-RT, respectively. No significant differences
were observed for the mean dose at the contra-lateral organs by using DIBH or FB VMAT techniques.
Conclusion: The VMAT-DIBH technique performed without dedicated breath hold equipment, showed
important dose reductions especially at the heart, while preserving lungs and contralateral structures.
It provides a non-costly method to improve radiotherapy delivery for cancer of the left breast.
