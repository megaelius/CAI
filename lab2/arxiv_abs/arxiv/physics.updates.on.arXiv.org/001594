Contrast microbubbles (contrast agents) were initially developed to increase the contrast of
the image in ultrasound imaging. These microbubbles consist of a gas core encapsulated by a layer
of protein or lipid to stabilize them against early dissolution in the bloodstream. Contrast agents,
in the presence of ultrasound, can also help facilitate the uptake of drugs and genes in to desired
cells through the process called sonoporation. Sonoporation is the temporarily rupture of cell
membranes in the presence of ultrasound. In this work, we have studied the contrast agent near a rigid
wall (assumed as a cell membrane with high elastic modulus) in the presence of ultrasound using boundary
element method. The contrast agent forms non-symmetrical high velocity microjet at the last stage
of the collapse phase. The microjet and the adjacent surrounding fluid move toward the rigid wall
with a very high velocity. This high velocity fluid impinges the wall and spreads radially along
it. This will generate high velocity gradient on the wall which gives rise to shear stress resulting
in the perforation of cell membrane. The encapsulation of the microbubble can be assumed as an interface
with an infinitesimal thickness. There are several models to simulate the interface. In this study,
the encapsulation is simulated with two models; viscoelastic model with exponentially varying
elasticity (EEM) and Marmottant model. In this research, we have studied the effect of different
parameters on the dynamics of the contrast microbubble, the induced shear stress on the wall due
to its collapse, and the velocity and pressure fields surrounding the contrast microbubble, to
better understand sonoporation.
