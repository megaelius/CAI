The role of instability in the growth of a 2D, temporally evolving, `turbulent' free shear layer
is analyzed using vortex-gas simulations that condense all dynamics into the kinematics of the
Biot-Savart relation. The initial evolution of perturbations in a constant-vorticity layer is
found to be in accurate agreement with the linear stability theory of Rayleigh. There is then a stage
of non-universal evolution of coherent structures that is closely approximated not by Rayleigh
stability theory, but by the Karman-Rubach-Lamb linear instability of monopoles, until the neighboring
coherent structures merge. After several mergers, the layer evolves eventually to a self-preserving
reverse cascade, characterized by a universal spread rate found by Suryanarayanan et al. (Phys.Rev.E
89, 013009, 2014) and a universal value of the ratio of dominant spacing of structures ($\Lambda_f$)
to the layer thickness ($\delta_\omega$). In this universal, self-preserving state, the local
amplification of perturbation amplitudes is accurately predicted by Rayleigh theory for the locally
existing `base' flow. The model of Morris et al. (Proc.Roy.Soc. A 431, 219-243, 1990.), which computes
the growth of the layer by balancing the energy lost by the mean flow with the energy gain of the perturbation
modes (computed from an application of Rayleigh theory), is shown, however, to provide a non-universal
asymptotic state with initial condition dependent spread-rate and spectra. The reason is that
the predictions of the Rayleigh instability, for a flow regime with coherent structures, are valid
only at the special value of $\Lambda_f/\delta_\omega$ achieved in the universal self-preserving
state.
