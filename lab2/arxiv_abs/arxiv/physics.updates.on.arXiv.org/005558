Lies can have a negating impact on governments, companies, and the society as a whole. Understanding
the dynamics of lying is therefore of crucial importance across different fields of research. While
lying has been studied before in well-mixed populations, it is a fact that real interactions are
rarely well-mixed. Indeed, they are usually structured and thus best described by networks. Here
we therefore use the Monte Carlo method to study the evolution of lying in the sender-receiver game
in a one-parameter family of networks, systematically covering complete networks, small-world
networks, and one-dimensional rings. We show that lies which benefit the sender at a cost to the receiver,
the so-called black lies, are less likely to proliferate on networks than they do in well-mixed populations.
Honesty is thus more likely to evolve, but only when the benefit for the sender is smaller than the
cost for the receiver. Moreover, this effect is particularly strong in small-world networks, but
less so in the one-dimensional ring. For lies that favor the receiver at a cost to the sender, the so-called
altruistic white lies, we show that honesty is also more likely to evolve than it is in well-mixed
populations. But contrary to black lies, this effect is more expressed in the one-dimensional ring,
whereas in small-world networks it is present only when the cost to the sender is greater than the
benefit for the receiver. Lastly, for lies that benefit both the sender and the receiver, the so-called
Pareto white lies, we show that the network structure actually favors the evolution of lying, but
this only when the benefit for the sender is slightly greater than the benefit for the receiver. In
this case again the small-world topology acts as an amplifier of the effect, while other network
topologies fail to do the same.
