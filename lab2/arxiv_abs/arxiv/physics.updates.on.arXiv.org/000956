Viscoelasticity and related phenomena are of great importance in the study of mechanical properties
of material especially, biological materials. Certain materials show some complex effects in
mechanical tests, which cannot be described by standard linear equation (SLE) mostly owing to shape
memory effect during deformation. Recently, researchers have been applying fractional calculus
in order for probing viscoelasticity of such materials with a high precision. Fractional calculus
is a powerful tool for modeling complex phenomenon. In this tutorial based paper, we try present
clear descriptions of the fractional calculus, its techniques and its implementation. The intention
is to keep the details to a minimum while still conveying a good idea of what and how can be done with
this powerful tool. We try to expose the reader to the basic techniques that are used to solve the fractional
equations analytically and/or numerically. More specifically, modeling the shape memory phenomena
with this powerful tool are studied from different perspectives, as well as presented some physical
interpretation in this case. Moreover, in order to show the relationship between fractional models
and standard linear equations, a fractal system comprising spring and damper elements is considered,
and the constitutive equation is approximated with a fractional element. Finally, after a brief
literature review, two fractional models are utilized to investigate the viscoelasticity of the
cell, and the comparison is made among them, experimental data, and previous models. Verification
results indicate that not only does the fractional model match the experimental data well, but it
also can be a good substitute for previously used models.
