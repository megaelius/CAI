The elastic network (EN) is a prime model that describes the long-time dynamics of biomolecules.
However, the use of harmonic potentials renders this model insufficient for studying large conformational
changes of proteins (e.g. stretching of proteins, folding and thermal unfolding). Here, we extend
the capabilities of the EN model by using a harmonic approximation described by Lennard-Jones (LJ)
interactions for far contacts and native contacts obtained from the standard overlap criterion
as in the case of Go-like models. While our model is validated against the EN model by reproducing
the equilibrium properties for a number of proteins, we also show that the model is suitable for the
study of large conformation changes by providing various examples. In particular, this is illustrated
on the basis of pulling simulations that predict with high accuracy the experimental data on the
rupture force of the studied proteins. Furthermore, in the case of DDFLN4 protein, our pulling simulations
highlight the advantages of our model with respect to Go-like approaches, where the latter fail
to reproduce previous results obtained by all-atom simulations that predict an additional characteristic
peak for this protein. In addition, folding simulations of small peptides yield different folding
times for alpha-helix and beta-hairpin, in agreement with experiment, in this way providing further
opportunities for the application of our model in studying large conformational changes of proteins.
In contrast to the EN model, our model is suitable for both normal mode analysis and molecular dynamics
simulation. We anticipate that the proposed model will find applications in a broad range of problems
in biology, including, among others, protein folding and thermal unfolding.
