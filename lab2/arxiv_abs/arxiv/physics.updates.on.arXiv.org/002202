In solar flares and other astrophysical systems, a major challenge for solving particle acceleration
problem associated with magnetic reconnection is the enormous scale separation between kinetic
scales and observed reconnection scale. Because of this, it has been difficult to draw any definite
conclusions by just using kinetic simulations. Particle acceleration model that solves energetic
particle transport equation can capture the main acceleration physics found in kinetic simulations,
and thus provide a practical way to make observable predictions and directly compare model results
with observations. Here we study compression particle acceleration in magnetic reconnection
by solving Parker (diffusion-advection) transport equation using velocity and magnetic fields
from two-dimensional high-Lundquist-number magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of a low-$\beta$
reconnection layer. We show that the compressible reconnection layer can give significant particle
acceleration, leading to the formation of power-law particle energy distributions. We analyze
the acceleration rate and find that the acceleration in the reconnection layer is a mixture of first
order and second order Fermi processes. When including a guide field, we find the spectrum becomes
steeper and both the power-law cutoff energy and maximum particle energy decrease as plasma becomes
less compressible. This model produces 2D particle distribution that one can use to generate radiation
map and directly compare with solar flare observations. This provides a framework to explain particle
acceleration at large-scale astrophysical reconnection sites, such as solar flares.
