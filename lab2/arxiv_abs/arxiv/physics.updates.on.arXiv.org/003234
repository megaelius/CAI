We present a new method for identifying the source regions of lightning generated whistlers observed
at a fixed location. In addition to the spatial distribution of causative lightning discharges,
we calculate the transmission ratio of lightning discharges into ground detectable whistlers
as a function of location. Our method relies on the time of the whistlers and the time and source location
of spherics from a global lightning database. We apply this method to whistlers recorded at fifteen
ground based stations in the AWDANet (Automatic Whistler Detector and Analyzer Network) operating
between 2007-2018 and to located lightning strokes from the WWLLN (World Wide Lightning Location
Network) database. We present the obtained maps of causative lightning and transmission ratios.
Our results show that the source region of whistlers corresponding to each ground station is around
the magnetic conjugate point of the respective station. The size of the source region is typically
less than 2000 km in radius with a small fraction of sources extending to up to 3500 km. The transmission
ratio is maximal at the conjugate point and decreases with increasing distance from it. This conforms
to the theory that whistlers detected on the ground propagated in a ducted mode through the plasmasphere
and thus the lightning strokes of their causative spherics must cluster around the footprint of
the ducts in the other hemisphere. Our method applied resolves the whistler excitation region mystery
that resulted from correlation-based analysis methods, concerning the source region of whistlers
detected in Dunedin, New Zealand.
