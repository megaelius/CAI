Biochar pore space consists of porosity of multiple length scales. In direct water holding applications
like water storage for plant water uptake, the main interest is in micrometre-range porosity since
these pores are able to store water that is easily available for plants. Gas adsorption measurements
which are commonly used to characterize the physical pore structure of biochars are not able to quantify
this pore-size range. While pyrogenetic porosity (i.e. pores formed during pyrolysis process)
tends to increase with elevated process temperature, it is uncertain whether this change affects
the pore space capable to store plant available water. In this study, we characterized biochar porosity
with x-ray tomography which provides quantitative information on the micrometer-range porosity.
We imaged willow dried at 60 $^\circ$C and biochar samples pyrolysed in three different temperatures
(peak temperatures 308, 384, 489 $^\circ$C, heating rate 2 $^\circ$C min$^{-1}$). Samples were
carefully prepared and traced through the experiments, which allowed investigation of porosity
development in micrometre size range. Pore space was quantified with image analysis of x-ray tomography
images and, in addition, nanoscale porosity was examined with helium ion microscopy. The image
analysis results show that initial pore structure of the raw material determines the properties
of micrometre-range porosity in the studied temperature range. Thus, considering the pore-size
regime relevant to the storage of plant available water, pyrolysis temperature in the studied range
does not provide means to optimize the biochar structure. However, these findings do not rule out
that process temperature may affect the water retention properties of biochars by modifying the
chemical properties of the pore surfaces.
