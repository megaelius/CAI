The decline of Mars' global magnetic field some 3.8-4.1 billion years ago is thought to reflect the
demise of the dynamo that operated in its liquid core. The dynamo was probably powered by planetary
cooling and so its termination is intimately tied to the thermochemical evolution and present-day
physical state of the Martian core. Bottom-up growth of a solid inner core, the crystallization
regime for Earth's core, has been found to produce a long-lived dynamo leading to the suggestion
that the Martian core remains entirely liquid to this day. Motivated by the experimentally-determined
increase in the Fe-S liquidus temperature with decreasing pressure at Martian core conditions,
we investigate whether Mars' core could crystallize from the top down. We focus on the "iron snow"
regime, where newly-formed solid consists of pure Fe and is therefore heavier than the liquid. We
derive global energy and entropy equations that describe the long-timescale thermal and magnetic
history of the core from a general theory for two-phase, two-component liquid mixtures, assuming
that the snow zone is in phase equilibrium and that all solid falls out of the layer and remelts at each
timestep. Formation of snow zones occurs for a wide range of interior and thermal properties and
depends critically on the initial sulfur concentration, x0. Release of gravitational energy and
latent heat during growth of the snow zone do not generate sufficient entropy to restart the dynamo
unless the snow zone occupies at least 400 km of the core. Snow zones can be 1.5-2 Gyrs old, though thermal
stratification of the uppermost core, not included in our model, likely delays onset. Models that
match the available magnetic and geodetic constraints have x0~10% and snow zones that occupy approximately
the top 100 km of the present-day Martian core.
