Viscous streaming has emerged as an effective method to transport, trap, and cluster inertial particles
in a fluid. Previous work has shown that this transport is well described by the Maxey-Riley equation
augmented with a term representing Saffman lift. However, in its straightforward application
to viscous streaming flows, the equation suffers from severe numerical stiffness due to the wide
disparity between the time scales of viscous response, oscillation period, and slow mean transport,
posing a severe challenge for drawing physical insight on mean particle trajectories. In this work,
we develop equations that directly govern the mean transport of particles in oscillatory viscous
flows. The derivation of these equations relies on a combination of three key techniques. In the
first, we develop an inertial particle velocity field via a small Stokes number expansion of the
particle's deviation from that of the fluid. This expansion clearly reveals the primary importance
of Fax\'en correction and Saffman lift in effecting the trapping of particles in streaming cells.
Then, we apply Generalized Lagrangian Mean theory to unambiguously decompose the transport into
fast and slow scales, and ultimately, develop the Lagrangian mean velocity field to govern mean
transport. Finally, we carry out an expansion in small oscillation amplitude to simplify the governing
equations and to clarify the hierarchy of first- and second-order influences, and particularly,
the crucial role of Stokes drift in the mean transport. We demonstrate the final set of equations
on the transport of both fluid and inertial particles in configurations involving one and two weakly
oscillating cylinders. Notably, the new equations allow numerical time steps that are $O(10^3)$
larger than the existing approach with little sacrifice in accuracy, allowing more efficient predictions
of transport.
