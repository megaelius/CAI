An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy, with a strong contagion
rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this
epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where
the epidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view
of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, mainly the variation of
the degree of home isolation and lockdown with time, the number of initially exposed individuals
and infected people, and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model,
by varying the parameters and initial conditions. Regarding the specific example, the results
evolve as more data is available. We calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date
(April 7, 2020). The peak occurs at day 40 (April 4), when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction
ratio R0 = 2.6 initially, 2.08 at day 22 and 0.7 after day 35, indicating different degrees of home
isolation and lockdown. The number of fatalities amounts to approximately 12000 at the end of the
epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 5.16 days and the
infection period is 3.53 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00057/day [values based on the reported
(official) number of casualties]. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this
work shows that the use of isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion
conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify
the process to verify the effectiveness of the isolation.
