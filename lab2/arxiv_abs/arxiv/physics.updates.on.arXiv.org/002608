We establish a general linear response relation for spiking neuronal networks, based on chains
with unbounded memory. This relation allows quantifying the influence of a weak amplitude external
stimuli on spatio-temporal spike correlations, in a general context where the memory in spike dynamics
can go arbitrarily far in the past. With this approach, we show how linear response is explicitly
related to neuron dynamics with an example, the gIF model, introduced by M. Rudolph and A. Destexhe.
This illustrates the effect of the stimuli, intrinsic neuronal dynamics, and network connectivity
on spike statistics.The activity of a neuronal network, characterized by action potentials (spikes),
is constrained by the intrinsic properties of neurons and their interactions. When a neuronal network
is submitted to external stimuli, the statistics of spikes changes, and it is difficult to disentangle
the influence of the stimuli from the intrinsic dynamics. Using the formalism of Gibbs distributions,
which are a generalization of Maximum Entropy distributions to non-stationary distributions,
and generalization of Markov chains to infinite memory, we analyze this problem in a specific model
(Conductance-based Integrate-and-Fire), where the neuronal dynamics depends on the history
of spikes of the network. We derive a linear response formula allowing to quantify the influence
of a weak amplitude external stimuli on the average value of arbitrary observables. This formula
clearly disentangles the effect of the stimuli, intrinsic neuronal dynamics, and network connectivity.
Upon some approximations, it reduces to a convolution, allowing to recover a standard formulation
in computational neuroscience.
