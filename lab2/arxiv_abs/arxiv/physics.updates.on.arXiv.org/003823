To understand the mobility patterns of scientists, we combine two large-scale bibliographic data
sets to reveal the geographical "career trajectories" of scientists and their temporal properties.
Each trajectory contains, on the individual level, information about the institutions, cities
and countries and the time spent there by scientists. By aggregating the individual career trajectories,
we reconstruct the world network of movements of scientists, where the nodes represent cities and
the links in- and outflows. We characterize the topological properties of this network by means
of degree, local clustering coefficient, path length and neighbor connectivity. Then, by using
multi-order graphical models, we analyze the temporal correlations of scientists' career trajectories
at the country, city and institution level. We find that scientist movements at the city and country
level can be correctly modeled from a static network perspective, because there are no statistically
significant temporal correlations at these aggregation levels. In contrast, at the affiliation
level we find that temporal correlations in scientists' career trajectories are important. That
means, a memory effect in scientists' careers impacts their next affiliation. We demonstrate that
these correlations can be correctly captured using a second-order network, in which nodes represent
moves between two different affiliations. The finding that memory effects are only detectable
at the lowest level of aggregation, i.e. the institution, implies that this is the most appropriate
level to analyze the determinants of relocation decisions.
