The sparse-views x-ray computed tomography (CT) is essential for medical diagnosis and industrial
nondestructive testing. However, in particular, the reconstructed image usually suffers from
complex artifacts and noise, when the sampling is insufficient. In order to deal such issue, a full-automatic
reconstruction (FAR) net is proposed for sparse-views CT reconstruction via deep learning technique.
Different with the usual network in deep learning reconstruction, the proposed neural network
is an End-to-End network by which the image is predicted directly from projection data. The main
challenge for such a FAR net is the space complexity of the CT reconstruction in full-connected (FC)
network. For a CT image with the size $N \times N$ , a typical requirement of memory space for the image
reconstruction is $O(N^{4})$, for which is unacceptable by conventional calculation device,
e.g. GPU workstation. In this paper, we utilize a series of smaller FC layers to replace the huge based
on the sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) theory. By applying such an approach, the
FAR net is able to reconstruct sparse-views CT images with the size $512\times 512$ on only one workstation.
Furthermore, a Res-Unet structure is composed in the FAR net for suppressing the artifacts and noise
caused by under-sampling data. The results of numerical experiments show that the projection matrix
and the FAR net is able to reconstruct the CT image from sparse-views projection data with a superior
quality than conventional method such as FBP and optimization based approach. Meanwhile, the factorization
for the inverse projection matrix is validated in numerical.
