In this paper we propose a new Eulerian modeling and related accurate and robust numerical methods,
describing polydisperse evaporating sprays, based on high order moment methods in size. The main
novelty of this model is its capacity to describe some geometrical variables of the droplet-gas
interface, by analogy with the liquid-gas interface in interfacial flows. For this purpose, we
use fractional size-moments, where the size variable is taken as the droplet surface. In order to
evaluate the evaporation of the polydisperse spray, we use a smooth reconstruction which maximizes
the Shannon entropy. However, the use of fractional moments introduces some theoretical and numerical
difficulties, which need to be tackled. First, relying on a study of the moment space, we extend the
Maximum Entropy (ME) reconstruction of the size distribution to the case of fractional moments.
Then, we propose a new accurate and realizable algorithm to solve the moment evolution due to evaporation,
which preserves the structure of the moment space. This algorithm is based on a mathematical analysis
of the kinetic evolution due to evaporation, where it shown that the evolution of some negative order
fractional moments have to be properly predicted, a peculiarity related to the use of fractional
moments. The present model and numerical schemes yield an accurate and stable evaluationof the
moment dynamics with minimal number of variables, as well as a minimal computational cost as with
the EMSM model, but with the very interesting additional capacity of coupling with diffuse interface
model and transport equation of averaged geometrical interface variables, which are essential
in oder to describe atomization.
