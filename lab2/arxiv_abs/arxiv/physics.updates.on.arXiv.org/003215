Conventional cameras, such as in smartphones, capture wideband red, green and blue (RGB) spectral
components, replicating human vision. Multispectral imaging (MSI) captures spatial and spectral
information beyond our vision but typically requires bulky optical components and is expensive.
Snapshot multispectral image sensors have been proposed as a key enabler for a plethora of MSI applications,
from diagnostic medical imaging to remote sensing. To achieve low-cost and compact designs, spatially
variant multispectral filter arrays (MSFAs) based on thin-film optical components are deposited
atop image sensors. Conventional MSFAs achieve spectral filtering through either multi-layer
stacks or pigment, requiring: complex mixtures of materials; additional lithographic steps for
each additional wavelength; and large thicknesses to achieve high transmission efficiency. By
contrast, we show here for the first time a single-step grayscale lithographic process that enables
fabrication of bespoke MSFAs based on the Fabry-Perot resonances of spatially variant metal-insulator-metal
(MIM) cavities, where the exposure dose controls insulator (cavity) thickness. We demonstrate
customizable MSFAs scalable up to N-wavelength bands spanning the visible and near-infrared with
high transmission efficiency (~75%) and narrow linewidths (~50 nm). Using this technique, we achieve
multispectral imaging of several spectrally distinct target using our bespoke MIM-MSFAs fitted
to a monochrome CMOS image sensor. Our unique framework provides an attractive alternative to conventional
MSFA manufacture, by reducing both fabrication complexity and cost of these intricate optical
devices, while increasing customizability.
