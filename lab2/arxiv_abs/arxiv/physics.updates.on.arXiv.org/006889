The most pronounced climate anomaly of the Holocene was the 8.2 ka cooling event. We present new 230Th/U-ages
as well as high-resolution stable isotope and trace element data from three stalagmitesfrom two
different cave systems in Germany, which provide important information about the structure and
climate variability of the 8.2 ka event in central Europe. In all three speleothems, the 8.2 ka event
is clearly recorded as a pronounced negative excursion of the {\delta}18O values and can be divided
into a 'whole event' and a 'central event'. All stalagmites show a similar structure of the event
with a short negative excursion prior to the 'central event', which marks the beginning of the 'whole
event'. The timing and duration of the 8.2.ka event are different for the individual records, which
may, however, be related to dating uncertainties. Whereas stalagmite Bu4 from Bunker Cave also
shows a negative anomaly in the {\delta}13C values and Mg content during the event, the two speleothems
from the Herbstlabyrinth cave system do not show distinct peaks in the other proxies. This may suggest
that the speleothem {\delta}18O values recorded in the three stalagmites do not primarily reflect
climate change at the cave site, but rather large-scale changes in the North Atlantic. This is supported
by comparison with climate modelling data, which suggest that the negative peak in the speleothem
{\delta}18O values is mainly due to lower {\delta}18O values of precipitation above the cave and
that temperature only played a minor role. Alternatively, the other proxies may not be as sensitive
as {\delta}18O values to record this centennial-scale cooling event. This may particularly be
the case for speleothem {\delta}13C values as suggested by comparison with a climate modelling
study simulating vegetation changes in Europe during the 8.2 ka event. ...
