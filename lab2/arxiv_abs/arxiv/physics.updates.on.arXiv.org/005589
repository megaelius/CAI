Density functional theory (DFT) is used in thousands of papers each year, yet lack of universality
reduces DFT's predictive capacity, and functionals may produce energy-density imbalances. The
absolute electronegativity (\chi) and hardness (\eta) directly reflect the energy-density relationship
via the chemical potential dE/dN and we thus hypothesized that they probe universality. We studied
\chi and \eta for atoms Z = 1-36 using 50 diverse functionals covering all major classes. Very few
functionals describe both \chi and \eta well. \eta benefits from error cancelation whereas \chi
is marred by error propagation from IP and EA; thus almost all standard GGA and hybrid functionals
display a plateau in the MAE at 0.2-0.3 eV for \eta. In contrast, variable performance for \chi indicates
problems in describing the chemical potential by DFT. The accuracy and precision of a functional
is far from linearly related, yet for a universal functional we expect linearity. Popular functionals
such as B3LYP, PBE, and revPBE, perform poorly for both properties. Density sensitivity calculations
indicate large density-derived errors as occupation of degenerate p- and d-orbitals causes "non-universality"
and large dependency on exact exchange. Thus, we argue that performance for \chi for the same systems
is a hallmark of universality by probing dE/dN. With this metric, B98, B97-1, PW6B95D3, APFD are
the most "universal" tested functionals. B98 and B97-1 are accurate for very diverse metal-ligand
bonds, supporting that a balanced description of dE/dN and dE2/dN2, via \chi and \eta, is probably
a first simple probe of universality.
