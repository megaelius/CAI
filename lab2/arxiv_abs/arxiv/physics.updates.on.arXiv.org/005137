Recent challenges in monitoring subsurface geological repositories call for new, innovative
concepts that are facility independent, cost-effective, passive, and reliable. Inspection and
verification of future disposal facilities will exert significant pressure on the limited safeguards
resources. Compared to aboveground facilities, subsurface geological repositories cannot be
directly monitored. Once nuclear material is in place in these facilities, reverifying the inventory
may no longer be feasible if continuity of knowledge is lost or updated safeguards information on
the contents (or lack thereof) becomes available to inspectors. Using cosmic ray muons presents
several potential advantages over conventional photon/neutron signatures, and their use in safeguards
applications has only recently received attention. However, there have been limited efforts to
explore the integration of cosmic ray muons into repository safeguards and study potential gains,
risks, and costs. This paper presents a Monte Carlo-based methodology to characterize the cosmic
ray muon flux, including muon angular and energy differential distributions at depths representative
of geological repositories. This work discusses the feasibility of muon monitoring for detecting
spent nuclear fuel disposal cask movement or for unauthorized excavation and rock removal. The
objective is to develop useful parametrizations to provide a convenient tool for detector-specific
and safeguards applications at any geological repository site. It is expected these results will
provide a better understanding of how muons can be integrated into an existing geological repository
safeguards framework.
