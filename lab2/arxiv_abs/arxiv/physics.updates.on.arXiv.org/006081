We analyse a novel mathematical model of malignant invasion which takes the form of a two-phase moving
boundary problem describing the invasion of a population of malignant cells into a population of
background tissue, such as skin. Cells in both populations undergo diffusive migration and logistic
proliferation. The interface between the two populations moves according to a two-phase Stefan
condition. Unlike many reaction-diffusion models of malignant invasion, the moving boundary
model explicitly describes the motion of the sharp front between the cancer and surrounding tissues
without needing to introduce degenerate nonlinear diffusion. Numerical simulations suggest
the model gives rise to very interesting travelling wave solutions that move with speed $c$, and
the model supports both malignant invasion and malignant retreat, where the travelling wave can
move in either the positive or negative $x$-directions. Unlike the well-studied Fisher-Kolmogorov
and Porous-Fisher models where travelling waves move with a minimum wave speed $c \ge c_{\textrm{min}}$,
the moving boundary model leads to travelling wave solutions with $-\infty < c < c_{\textrm{max}}$.
We interpret these travelling wave solutions in the phase plane and show that they are associated
with several features of the classical Fisher-Kolmogorov phase plane that are often disregarded
as being nonphysical. We show, numerically, that the phase plane analysis compares well with long
time solutions from the full partial differential equation model as well as providing accurate
perturbation approximations for the shape of the travelling waves.
