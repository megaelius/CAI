Colloidal nanocrystals are a promising fluorescent class of materials, whose spontaneous emission
features can be tuned over a broad spectral range via their composition, geometry and size. However,
towards embedding nanocrystals films in elaborated device geometries, one significant drawback
is the sensitivity of their emission properties on further fabrication processes like lithography,
metal or oxide deposition, etc. In this work, we demonstrate how bright emitting and robust thin
films can be obtained by combining nanocrystal deposition from solutions via spin2 coating with
subsequent atomic layer deposition of alumina. For the resulting composite films, the layer thickness
can be controlled on the nanoscale, and their refractive index can be finely tuned by the amount of
deposited alumina. Ellipsometry is used to measure the real and imaginary part of the dielectric
permittivity, which gives direct access to the wavelength dependent refractive index absorbance
of the film. Detailed analysis of the photophysics of thin films of core-shell nanocrystal with
different shape and different shell thickness allow to correlate the behavior of the photoluminescence
and of the decay life time to the changes in the non-radiative rate that are induced by the alumina
deposition. We show that the photoemission properties of such composite films are stable in wavelength
and intensity over several months, and that the photoluminescence completely recovers from heating
processes up to 240$^\circ$C. The latter is particularly interesting, since it demonstrates robustness
to the typical heat treatment that is needed in several process steps like resist-based lithography
and deposition by thermal or electron beam evaporation of metals or oxides.
