In this contribution it is shown that various aspects of the concept of residual migration can be
utilized for the case that a prestack time or depth migration has been performed for a seismic survey
and a new depth is available: The concept of residual migration is introduced by determining travel
times of reflected events for individual traces from aplanatic curves. These events are migrated
in suitable configurations for the new velocity model for which a raytracing set as required for
a Kirchhoff prestack depth migration is available. The resulting transformations can be utilized
in various ways to estimate important parameters such as the positional bias of migrated events
with respect to the corresponding zero offset position and the residual moveout for the new depth
model ; finally a new approach is suggested to estimate the aperture width over the Fresnel zone for
the first prestack migration. Various mapped prestack migrations can be estimated, including
a prestack time migration with eliminated positional bias. The necessity of a new prestack depth
migration can be assessed from the aperture width over the first order Fresnel zone and from the positional
bias at a particular offset. Additional kinematic parameters can be acquired for a residual prestack
migration, in particular the curves over which the residual summation has to be performed. The approach
is applicable to isotropic and anisotropic PSTM and PSDM. Computational costs of the implementation
are low when compared to a full PSDM. In the appendix a formula is derived for the migration velocities
for a prestack time migration for small to intermediate source receiver offsets. The velocities
can be determined either from an inhomogeneous anisotropic depth model or from residual moveout
analyses of a previous migration.
