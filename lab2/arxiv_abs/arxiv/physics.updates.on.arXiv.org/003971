The paper aims at developing low-storage implicit Runge-Kutta methods which are easy to implement
and achieve higher-order of convergence for both the velocity and pressure in the finite volume
formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a static collocated grid. To this
end, the effect of the momentum interpolation, a procedure required by the finite volume method
for collocated grids, on the differential-algebraic nature of the spatially-discretized Navier-Stokes
equations should be examined first. A new framework for the momentum interpolation is established,
based on which the semi-discrete Navier-Stokes equations can be strictly viewed as a system of differential-algebraic
equations of index 2. The accuracy and convergence of the proposed momentum interpolation framework
is examined. We then propose a new method of applying implicit Runge-Kutta schemes to the time-marching
of the index 2 system of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Compared to the standard method,
the proposed one significantly reduces the numerical difficulties in momentum interpolations
and delivers higher-order pressures without requiring additional computational effort. Applying
stiff-accurate diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) schemes with the proposed method allows
the schemes to attain the classical order of convergence for both the velocity and pressure. We also
develop two families of low-storage stiff-accurate DIRK schemes to reduce the storage required
by their implementations. Examining the two dimensional Taylor-Green vortex as an example, the
spatial and temporal accuracy of the proposed methods in simulating incompressible flow is demonstrated.
