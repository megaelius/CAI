Bikesharing has gradually become one adopted sustainable transportation mode recent years to
bring us many social, environmental, economic, and health-related benefits and rewards. There
is increased research toward better understanding of bikesharing systems (BSS) in urban environments.
However, our comprehension remains incomplete on the patterns and characteristics of BSS. In this
paper, aiming to help improving sustainability in multimodal transportation through BSS, we perform
a systematic data analysis to examine underlying patterns and characteristics of the system dynamics
in a bikeshare network and to acquire implications of the patterns and characteristics for decision
making. As a case study, we use trip history data from the Capital Bikeshare system in the Washington
DC area and some additional data sources. The study covers seven important aspects of bikeshare
transportation systems, which are respectively trip demand and flow, operating activities, use
and idle times, trip purpose, origin-destination flows, mobility, and safety. For these aspects,
by using appropriate statistical methods and geographic techniques, we investigate travel patterns
and characteristics of BSS from data to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative impacts of the
inputs from key stakeholders on main measures of effectiveness such as trip costs, mobility, safety,
quality of service, and operational efficiency, where key stakeholders include road users, system
operators, and city. We also disclose some new patterns and characteristics of BSS to advance the
knowledge on travel behaviors. Finally, we briefly summarize our findings and discuss the implications
of the patterns and characteristics for data-driven decision supports from the relations between
BSS and key stakeholders for promoting bikeshare utilization and transforming urban transportation
to be more sustainable.
