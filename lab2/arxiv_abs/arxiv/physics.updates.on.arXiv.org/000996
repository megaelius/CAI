Argon Gas Cluster-Ion Beam sources have become widely-used on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) instruments in recent years, but there is little
reference data on sputter yields in the literature as yet. Total sputter yield reference data is
needed in order to plan, and later calibrate the depth scale, of XPS or SIMS depth profiles. We previously
published a semi-empirical Threshold equation for estimating cluster total sputter yield from
the energy-per-atom of the cluster and the effective monatomic sputter threshold of the material.
This has already been shown to agree extremely well with sputter yield measurements on a range of
organic and inorganic materials for clusters of around a thousand atoms. Here we use the molecular
dynamics (MD) approach to explore a wider range of energy and cluster size than is easy to do experimentally
to high precision. We have performed MD simulations using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively
Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) parallel MD code on high-performance computer (HPC) systems at Cincinnati
and Newcastle. We performed 1,150 simulations of individual collisions with a silicon (100) surface
as an archetypal inorganic substrate, for cluster sizes between 30 and 3,000 argon atoms and energies
in the range 5 to 40eV per atom. This corresponds to the most important regime for experimental cluster
depth-profiling in SIMS and XPS. Our MD results show a dependence on cluster size as well as energy-per-atom.
Using the exponent previously suggested by Paruch et al, we modified the Threshold model equation
published previously to take this into account. The modified Threshold equation fits all our MD
results extremely well, building on its success in fitting experimental sputter yield measurements.
