Dynamical systems with high intrinsic dimensionality are often characterized by extreme events
having the form of rare transitions several standard deviations away from the mean. For such systems,
order-reduction methods through projection of the governing equations have limited applicability
due to the large intrinsic dimensionality of the underlying attractor but also the complexity of
the transient events. An alternative approach is data-driven techniques that aim to quantify the
dynamics of specific modes utilizing data-streams. Several of these approaches have improved
performance by expanding the state representation using delayed coordinates. However, such strategies
are limited in regions of the phase space where there is a small amount of data available, as is the
case for extreme events. In this work, we develop a blended framework that integrates an imperfect
model, obtained from projecting equations into a subspace that still contains crucial dynamical
information, with data-streams through a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. In particular,
we employ the long-short-term memory (LSTM), to model portions of the dynamics which cannot be accounted
by the equations. The RNN is trained by analyzing the mismatch between the imperfect model and the
data-streams, projected in the reduced-order space. In this way, the data-driven model improves
the imperfect model in regions where data is available, while for locations where data is sparse
the imperfect model still provides a baseline for the prediction of the system dynamics. We assess
the developed framework on two challenging prototype systems exhibiting extreme events and show
that the blended approach has improved performance compared with methods that use either data streams
or the imperfect model alone. The improvement is more significant in regions associated with extreme
events, where data is sparse.
