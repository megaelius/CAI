From optics to hydrodynamics, shock and rogue waves are widespread. Although they appear as distinct
phenomena, new theories state that transitions between extreme waves are allowed. However, these
have never been experimentally observed because of the lack of control strategies. We introduce
a new concept of nonlinear wave topological control, based on the one-to-one correspondence between
the number of wave packet oscillating phases and the genus of toroidal surfaces associated with
the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation solutions by the Riemann theta function. We prove it experimentally
by reporting the first observation of supervised transitions between extreme waves with different
genera, like the continuous transition from dispersive shock to rogue waves. Specifically, we
use a parametric time-dependent nonlinearity to shape the asymptotic wave genus. We consider the
box problem in a focusing Kerr-like photorefractive medium and tailor time-dependent propagation
coefficients, as nonlinearity and dispersion, to explore each region in the state-diagram and
include all the dynamic phases in the nonlinear wave propagation. Our result is the first example
of the topological control of integrable nonlinear waves. This new technique casts light on dispersive
shock waves and rogue wave generation, and can be extended to other nonlinear phenomena, from classical
to quantum ones. The outcome is not only important for fundamental studies and control of extreme
nonlinear waves, but can be also applied to spatial beam shaping for microscopy, medicine and spectroscopy,
and to the broadband coherent light generation.
