Developing a comprehensive understanding of the modification of material properties by neutron
irradiation is important for the design of future fission and fusion power reactors. Self-ion implantation
is commonly used to mimic neutron irradiation damage, however an interesting question concerns
the effect of ion energy on the resulting damage structures. The reduction in the thickness of the
implanted layer as the implantation energy is reduced results in the significant quandary: Does
one attempt to match the primary knock-on atom energy produced during neutron irradiation or implant
at a much higher energy, such that a thicker damage layer is produced? Here we address this question
by measuring the full strain tensor for two ion implantation energies, 2 MeV and 20 MeV in self-ion
implanted tungsten, a critical material for the first wall and divertor of fusion reactors. A comparison
of 2 MeV and 20 MeV implanted samples is shown to result in similar lattice swelling. Multi-reflection
Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (MBCDI) shows that implantation induced strain is in fact heterogeneous
at the nanoscale, suggesting that there is a non-uniform distribution of defects, an observation
that is not fully captured by micro-beam Laue diffraction. At the surface, MBCDI and high-resolution
electron back-scattered diffraction (HR-EBSD) strain measurements agree quite well in terms
of this clustering/non-uniformity of the strain distribution. However, MBCDI reveals that the
heterogeneity at greater depths in the sample is much larger than at the surface. This combination
of techniques provides a powerful method for detailed investigation of the microstructural damage
caused by ion bombardment, and more generally of strain related phenomena in microvolumes that
are inaccessible via any other technique.
