Many clinical applications depend critically on the accurate differentiation and classification
of different types of materials in patient anatomy. This work introduces a unified framework for
accurate nonlinear material decomposition and applies it, for the first time, in the concept of
triple-energy CT (TECT) for enhanced material differentiation and classification as well as dual-energy
CT. The triple-energy data acquisition is implemented at the scales of micro-CT and clinical CT
imaging with commercial "TwinBeam" dual-source DECT configuration and a fast kV switching DECT
configuration. Material decomposition and quantitative comparison with a photon counting detector
and with the presence of a bow-tie filter are also performed. The proposed method provides quantitative
material- and energy-selective images examining realistic configurations for both dual- and
triple-energy CT measurements. Compared to the polychromatic kV CT images, virtual monochromatic
images show superior image quality. For the mouse phantom, quantitative measurements show that
the differences between gadodiamide and iodine concentrations obtained using TECT and idealized
photon counting CT (PCCT) are smaller than 8 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, respectively. TECT outperforms DECT
for multi-contrast CT imaging and is robust with respect to spectrum estimation. For the thorax
phantom, the differences between the concentrations of the contrast map and the corresponding
true reference values are smaller than 7 mg/mL for all of the realistic configurations. A unified
framework for both dual- and triple-energy CT imaging has been established for the accurate extraction
of material compositions; considering currently available commercial DECT configurations.
The novel technique is promising to provide an urgently needed solution for several CT-based diagnosis
and therapy applications.
