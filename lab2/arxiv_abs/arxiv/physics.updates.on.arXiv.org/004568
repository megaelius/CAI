Supershear earthquakes are rare but powerful ruptures with devastating consequences. How quickly
an earthquake rupture attains this speed, or for that matter decelerates from it, strongly affects
high-frequency ground motion and the spatial extent of coseismic off-fault damage. Traditionally,
studies of supershear earthquakes have focused on determining which fault segments sustained
fully-grown supershear ruptures. The rarity of confirmed supershear ruptures, combined with
the fact that conditions for supershear transition are still debated, complicates the investigation
of supershear transition in real earthquakes. Here, we find a unique signature of the location of
a supershear transition: we show that, when a rupture accelerates towards supershear speed, the
stress concentration abruptly shrinks, limiting the off-fault damage and aftershock productivity.
First, we use theoretical fracture mechanics and numerical methods to demonstrate that, before
transitioning to supershear, the stress concentration around the rupture tip shrinks, confining
the region where the damage & aftershocks are expected. We contrast these numerical and theoretical
results with high-resolution aftershock catalogs for three natural supershear earthquakes,
where we identify a small region with lower aftershock density near the supershear transition.
Finally, using satellite optical image correlation techniques, we show that, for a fourth event,
the transition zone is characterized by a diminution in the width of the damage zone. Our results
demonstrate that the transition from subshear to supershear rupture can be clearly identified
by a localized absence of aftershocks, and a decrease in off-fault damage, due to a transient reduction
of the stress intensity at the rupture tip.
