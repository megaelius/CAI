Purpose: In dynamic MRI, sufficient time resolution can often only be obtained using imaging protocols
which produce undersampled data for each image in the time series. This has led to the popularity
of compressed sensing (CS) based image reconstruction approaches. One of the main problems in the
CS approaches is determining the regularization parameters, which control the balance between
the data fidelity term and the spatial and temporal regularization terms. Methods: A data-driven
approach is proposed for the regularization parameter selection such that the reconstructions
yield expected sparsity levels in the regularization domains. The expected sparsity levels are
obtained from the measurement data for the temporal regularization and from a reference image for
the spatial regularization. Two formulations are proposed. The first is a 2D search for a parameter
pair which produces expected sparsity in both the temporal and spatial regularization domains.
In the second approach, the sparsity-based parameter selection is split to two 1D searches using
the S-curve method. The approaches are evaluated using simulated and experimental DCE-MRI data.
Results: In the simulated test case, both methods produce a parameter pair that is close to the optimal
pair, and the reconstruction error is also close to minimum. In the experimental test case, the methods
produce almost similar parameter selection, and the reconstructions are of high perceived quality.
Conclusion: Both approaches lead to a highly feasible selection of the temporal and spatial regularization
parameters in both the simulated and experimental test cases while the second method is computationally
more efficient.
