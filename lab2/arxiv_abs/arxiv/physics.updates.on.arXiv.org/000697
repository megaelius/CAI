A feasibility study of fusion reactors based on accelerators is carried out. We consider a novel
scheme where a beam from the accelerator hits the target plasma on the resonance of the fusion reaction
and establish characteristic criteria for a workable reactor. We consider the reactions $ d + t \rightarrow
n + \alpha, d + {}^3H_e \rightarrow p + \alpha$, and $p + {}^{11}B \rightarrow 3 \alpha$ in this study.
The critical temperature of the plasma is determined from overcoming the stopping power of the beam
with the fusion energy gain. The needed plasma lifetime is determined from the width of the resonance,
the beam velocity and the plasma density. We estimate the critical beam flux by balancing the energy
of fusion production against the plasma thermo-energy and the loss due to stopping power for the
case of an inert plasma. The product of critical flux and plasma lifetime is independent of plasma
density and has a weak dependence on temperature. Even though the critical temperatures for these
reactions are lower than those for the thermonuclear reactors, the critical flux is in the range
of $10^{22} - 10^{24}/\rm{cm^2/s}$ for the plasma density $\rho_t = 10^{15}/{\rm cm^3}$ in the
case of an inert plasma. Several approaches to control the growth of the two-stream instability
are discussed. We have also considered several scenarios for practical implementation which will
require further studies. Finally, we consider the case where the injected beam at the resonance
energy maintains the plasma temperature and prolongs its lifetime to reach a steady state. The equations
for power balance and particle number conservation are given for this case.
