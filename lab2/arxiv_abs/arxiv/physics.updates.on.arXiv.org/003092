Forced magnetic reconnection, a reconnection event triggered by external perturbation, should
be ubiquitous in the solar corona. Energy released during such cases can be much greater than that
which was introduced by the perturbation. It is unclear how the properties of the external perturbation
and the initial current sheet affect the reconnection region properties, and thereby the reconnection
dynamics and energy release profile. We investigate the effect of the form of the external perturbation
and initial current sheet on the evolution of the reconnection region and the energy release process.
Chiefly we explore the non-linear interactions between multiple, simultaneous perturbations,
which represent more realistic scenarios. Future work will use these results in test particle simulations
to investigate particle acceleration over multiple reconnection events. Simulations are performed
using Lare2d, a 2.5D Lagrangian-remap solver for the visco-resistive MHD equations. The model
of forced reconnection is extended to include superpositions of sinusoidal driving disturbances,
including localised Gaussian perturbations. A transient perturbation is applied to the boundaries
of a region containing a force-free current sheet. The simulation domain is sufficiently wide to
allow multiple magnetic islands to form and coalesce. Island coalescence contributes significantly
to energy release and involves rapid reconnection. Long wavelength modes in perturbations dominate
the evolution, without the presence of which reconnection is either slow, as in the case of short
wavelength modes, or the initial current sheet remains stable, as in the case of noise perturbations.
Multiple perturbations combine in a highly non-linear manner: reconnection is typically faster
than when either disturbance is applied individually, with multiple low-energy events contributing
to the same total energy release.
