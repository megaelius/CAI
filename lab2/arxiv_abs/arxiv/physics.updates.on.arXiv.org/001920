A novel technique based on the Full Orthogonalization Arnoldi (FOA) is proposed to perform Dynamic
Mode Decomposition (DMD) for a sequence of snapshots. Two modifications to Full Orthogonalization
Arnoldi are discussed for situations where the matrix $A$ whose FOA is to be performed is unknown,
but the vectors $A^{i-1}v_1$ are known. Finite precision error analysis is performed on both variants,
and the one with better numerical properties is used as a kernel in the proposed Full Orthogonalization
Arnoldi Dynamic Mode Decomposition (FOADMD) algorithm. The proposed method i) does not require
SVD if the snapshot matrix has a reasonable condition number, ii) results in projected matrices
whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be reliably computed in floating point arithmetic, iii)
lends itself to easy parallelism as the main computational kernel involves only vector additions
and dot products and iv) requires only one snapshot at a time, rather than all snapshots at once. Hence,
the new technique is well-suited for DMD of large datasets on parallel computing platforms. It is
shown that for FOADMD and SVD-based DMD method without rank truncation, the finite precision error
in the computed projection of $A$ is $O(\epsilon_m\kappa_2(X))$. Based on finite precision error
analysis, rank truncated FOADMD is proposed to accurately compute the projected linear mapping
$A$ when the condition number of snapshot matrix is $O(1/\epsilon_m)$. Error indicators that indicate
the quality of the obtained DMD eigenvector and DMD eigenvalues to devise stopping criterions for
DMD are also presented and validated. The DMD eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained from the implementation
of FOADMD are compared to SVD-based DMD methods for a variety of problems of increasing dimensionality
and varying condition number of snapshot matrix.
