The present study deals with the numerical as well as asymptotic analysis of the electrohydrodynamic
interaction between two deformable droplets in a confined shear flow. Considering both the phases
as leaky dielectric, we have performed numerical simulations to study the effect of channel confinement
on the drop trajectories in the presence of a uniform electric field. Two important varieties of
motion are identified in the present analysis, namely (i) the reversing motion and (ii) the passing
over motion. The study suggests that conversion of the passing over motion to the reversing motion
or vice versa is possible via modulating the strength of the imposed electric field. Such a conversion
of the pattern of droplet migration is also possible in a confined domain due to change in different
electrical properties of the system. The present numerical model is also able to predict the pattern
of the trajectory of individual droplets depending on the initial distance separating the two.
For example, a smaller initial distance results in a reversing motion whereas a passing over motion
is predicted when the distance between the droplets is significantly large. However, the final
positions of the droplets are found to be independent of their initial positions. Interestingly,
presence of electric field is found to prevent droplet coalescence to a certain extent depending
on its strength, thus rendering the emulsion stable. A small deformation asymptotic model is also
developed under the assumption of negligible fluid inertia to support the numerical results for
the limiting case of an unbounded flow. The current investigation successfully presents a novel
technique to predict the precise positions of a system of droplets in a micro-channel and how electric
field can be used as a tool to modulate droplet trajectories in an emulsion.
