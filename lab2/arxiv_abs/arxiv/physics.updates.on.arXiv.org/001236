An expression for the dimensionless dissipation rate was derived from the Karman-Howarth equation
by asymptotic expansion of the second- and third- order structure functions in powers of the inverse
Reynolds number. The implications of the time-derivative term for the assumption of local stationarity
(or local equilibrium) which underpins the derivation of the Kolmogorov `4/5' law for the third-order
structure function were studied. It was concluded that neglect of the time-derivative cannot be
justified by reason of restriction to certain scales (the inertial range) nor to large Reynolds
numbers. In principle, therefore, the hypothesis cannot be correct, although it may be a good approximation.
It follows, at least in principle, that the quantitative aspects of the hypothesis of local stationarity
could be tested by a comparison of the asymptotic dimensionless dissipation rate for free decay
with that for the stationary case. But in practice this is complicated by the absence of an agreed
evolution time for making the measurements during the decay. However, we can assess the quantitative
error involved in using the hypothesis by comparing the exact asymptotic value of the dimensionless
dissipation in free decay calculated on the assumption of local stationarity to the experimentally
determined value (e.g. by means of direct numerical simulation), as this relationship holds for
all measuring times. Should the assumption of local stationarity lead to significant error, then
the `4/5' law needs to be corrected. Despite this, scale invariance in wavenumber space appears
to hold in the formal limit of infinite Reynolds numbers, which implies that the `-5/3' energy spectrum
does not require correction in this limit.
