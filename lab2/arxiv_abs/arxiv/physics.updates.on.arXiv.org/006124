We present vec2pix, a deep neural network designed to predict categorical or continuous 2D subsurface
property fields from one-dimensional measurement data (e.g., time series), thereby, offering
a new way to solve inverse problems. The performance of the method is investigated through two types
of synthetic inverse problems: (a) a crosshole ground penetrating radar (GPR) tomography experiment
with GPR travel times being used to infer a 2D velocity field, and (2) a multi-well pumping experiment
within an unconfined aquifer with time series of transient hydraulic heads being used to retrieve
a 2D hydraulic conductivity field. For each type of problem, both a multi-Gaussian and a binary channelized
subsurface domain with long-range connectivity are considered. Using a training set of 20,000
examples, the method is found to recover a 2D model that is in much closer agreement with the true model
than the closest training model in the forward-simulated data space. Further testing with smaller
training sample sizes shows that despite a moderate reduction in performance, this remains the
case when using 5000 training examples only. Even if the recovered models obtained by vec2pix are
visually close to the true ones, the data misfits associated with their forward responses are generally
larger than the noise level used to contaminate the true data. If finding a model that fits the data
noise level is required, then vec2pix-based inversion models can be used as initial inputs for more
traditional multiple-point statistics inversion. Uncertainty of the inverse solution is partially
assessed using deep ensembles, in which the network is trained repeatedly with random initialization.
Overall, this study opens up a promising research avenue on how to use deep learning to infer subsurface
models from indirect measurement data.
