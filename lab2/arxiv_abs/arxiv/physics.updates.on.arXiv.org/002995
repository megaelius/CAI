Funneling acoustic waves through largely mismatched channels is of fundamental importance to
tailor and transmit sound for a variety of applications. In electromagnetics, zero-permittivity
metamaterials have been used to enhance the coupling of energy in and out of ultranarrow channels,
based on a phenomenon known as supercoupling. These metamaterial channels can support total transmission
and complete phase uniformity, independent of the channel length, despite being geometrically
mismatched to their input and output ports. In the field of acoustics, this phenomenon is challenging
to achieve, since it requires zero-density metamaterials, typically realized with waveguides
periodically loaded with membranes or resonators. Compared to electromagnetics, the additional
challenge is due to the fact that conventional acoustic waveguides do not support a cut-off for the
dominant mode of propagation, and therefore zero-index can be achieved only based on a collective
resonance of the loading elements. Here we propose and experimentally realize acoustic supercoupling
in a dual regime, using a compressibility-near-zero acoustic channel. Rather than engineering
the channel with subwavelength inclusions, we operate at the cut-off of a higher-order acoustic
mode, demonstrating the realization and efficient excitation of a zero-compressibility waveguide
with effective soft boundaries. We experimentally verify strong transmission through a largely
mismatched channel and uniform phase distribution, independent of the channel length. Our results
open interesting pathways towards the realization of extreme acoustic parameters, and their implementation
in relevant applications, such as ultrasound imaging, sonar technology, and sound transmission.
