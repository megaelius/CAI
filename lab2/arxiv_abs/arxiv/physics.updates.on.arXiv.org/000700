After it was proposed that life on Earth might descend from seeding by an earlier civilization, some
authors noted that this alternative offers a testable aspect: the seeds could be supplied with a
signature that might be found in extant organisms. In particular, it was suggested that the optimal
location for such an artifact is the genetic code, as the least evolving part of cells. However, as
the mainstream view goes, this scenario is too speculative and cannot be meaningfully tested because
encoding/decoding a signature within the genetic code is ill-defined, so any retrieval attempt
is doomed to guesswork. Here we refresh the seeded-Earth hypothesis and discuss the motivation
for inserting a signature. We then show that "biological SETI" involves even weaker assumptions
than traditional SETI and admits a well-defined methodological framework. After assessing the
possibility in terms of molecular and evolutionary biology, we formalize the approach and, adopting
the guideline of SETI that encoding/decoding should follow from first principles and be convention-free,
develop a retrieval strategy. Applied to the canonical code, it reveals a nontrivial precision
structure of interlocked systematic attributes. To assess this result in view of the initial assumption,
we perform statistical, comparison, interdependence, and semiotic analyses. Statistical analysis
reveals no causal connection to evolutionary models of the code, interdependence analysis precludes
overinterpretation, and comparison analysis shows that known code variations lack any precision-logic
structures, in agreement with these variations being post-seeding deviations from the canonical
code. Finally, semiotic analysis shows that not only the found attributes are consistent with the
initial assumption, but that they make perfect sense from SETI perspective, as they maintain some
of the most universal codes of culture.
