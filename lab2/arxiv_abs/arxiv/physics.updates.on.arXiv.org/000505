For modeling complex synaptic connectivity, we consider the Watts-Strogatz small-world network
which interpolates between regular lattice and random network via rewiring, and investigate the
effect of small-world connectivity on emergence of noise-induced population synchronization
in an inhibitory population of subthreshold bursting Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. Thus, noise-induced
slow burst synchronization and fasg spike synchronization are found to appear in a synchronized
region of the $J-D$ plane. As the rewiring probability $p$ is decreased from 1 (random network) to
0 (regular lattice), the region of spike synchronization shrinks rapidly in the $J-D$ plane, while
the region of the burst synchronization decreases slowly. Population synchronization may be well
visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes which can be obtained in experiments. Instantaneous
population firing rate, $R(t)$, which is directly obtained from the raster plot of spikes, is a realistic
population quantity exhibiting collective behaviors with both the slow bursting and the fast spiking
timescales. Through frequency filtering, we separate $R(t)$ into $R_b(t)$ (describing the slow
bursting behavior) and $R_s(t)$ (describing the fast intraburst spiking behavior). Then, we develop
thermodynamic order parameters and statistical-mechanical measures, based on $R_b (t)$ and $R_s
(t)$, for characterization of the burst and spike synchronizations of the bursting neurons and
show their usefulness in explicit examples. With increase in $p$, both the degrees of the burst and
spike synchronizations are found to increase because more long-range connections appear. However,
they become saturated for some maximal values of $p$ because long-range short-cuts which appear
up to the maximal values of $p$ play sufficient role to get maximal degrees of the burst and spike synchronizations.
