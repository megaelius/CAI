Beyond the scope of space-coding metasurfaces, space-time digital metasurfaces can substantially
expand the application scope of digital metamaterials in which simultaneous manipulation of electromagnetic
waves in both space and frequency domains would be feasible. In this paper, by adopting a superposition
operation of terms with unequal coefficient, Huygens principle, and a proper time-varying biasing
mechanism, some useful closed-form formulas in the class of large digital metasurfaces were presented
for predicting the absolute directivity of scatted beams. Moreover, in the harmonic beam steering
scheme, by applying several suitable assumptions, we have derived two separate expressions for
calculating the exact total radiated power at harmonic frequencies and total radiated power for
scattered beams located at the end-fire direction. Despite the simplifying assumptions we have
applied, we have proved that the provided formulas can still be a good and fast estimate for developing
a large digital metasurface with a predetermined power intensity pattern. The effect of quantization
level and metasurface dimensions on the performance of power manipulating as well as the limitation
on the maximum scan angle in harmonic beam steering have been addressed. Several demonstrative
examples numerically demonstrated through MATLAB software and the good agreement between simulations
and theoretical predictions have been observed. By considering the introduced restrictions in
the manuscript, this method can be implemented in any desired frequency just by employing phase-only
meta-particles as physical coding elements. The author believes that the proposed straightforward
approach discloses a new opportunity for various applications such as multiple-target radar systems
and THz communication.
