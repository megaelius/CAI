Many biological systems, such as bacterial suspensions and actomyosin networks, form polar liquid
crystals. These systems are `active' or far-from-equilibrium, due to local forcing of the solvent
by the constituent particles. In many cases the source of activity is chiral; since forcing is internally
generated, some sort of `torque dipole' is then present locally. But it is not obvious how `torque
dipoles' should be encoded in the hydrodynamic equations that describe the system at continuum
level: different authors have arrived at contradictory conclusions on this issue. In this work,
we resolve the paradox by presenting a careful derivation, from linear irreversible thermodynamics,
of the general equations of motion of a single-component chiral active fluid with spin degrees of
freedom. We find that there is no unique hydrodynamic description for such a fluid in the presence
of torque dipoles of a given strength. Instead, at least three different hydrodynamic descriptions
emerge, depending on whether we decompose each torque dipole as two point torques, two force pairs,
or one point torque and one force pair -- where point torques create internal angular momenta of the
chiral bodies (spin), whereas force pairs impart centre of mass motion that contributes to fluid
velocity. By considering a general expansion of the Onsager coefficients, we also derive a new shear-elongation
parameter and cross-coupling viscosity, which can lead to unpredicted phenomena even in passive
polar liquid crystals. Finally, elimination of the angular variables gives an effective polar
hydrodynamics with renormalized active stresses, viscosities and kinetic coefficients. Remarkably,
this can include a direct contribution of chiral activity to the equation of motion for the polar
order parameter, which survives even in `dry' active systems where the fluid velocity is set to zero.
