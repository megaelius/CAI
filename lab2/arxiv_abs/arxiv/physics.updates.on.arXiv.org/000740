We calculate the disruption scale $\lambda_{\rm D}$ at which sheet-like structures in dynamically
aligned Alfv\'enic turbulence are destroyed by the onset of magnetic reconnection in a low-$\beta$
collisionless plasma. The scaling of $\lambda_{\rm D}$ depends on the order of the statistics being
considered, with more intense structures being disrupted at larger scales. The disruption scale
for the structures that dominate the energy spectrum is $\lambda_{\rm D}\sim L_\perp^{1/9}(d_e\rho_s)^{4/9}$,
where $d_e$ is the electron inertial scale, $\rho_s$ is the ion sound scale, and $L_\perp$ is the
outer scale of the turbulence. When $\beta_e$ and $\rho_s/L_\perp$ are sufficiently small, the
scale $\lambda_{\rm D}$ is larger than $\rho_s$ and there is a break in the energy spectrum at $\lambda_{\rm
D}$, rather than at $\rho_s$. We propose that the fluctuations produced by the disruption are circularised
flux ropes, which may have already been observed in the solar wind. We predict the relationship between
the amplitude and radius of these structures and quantify the importance of the disruption process
to the cascade in terms of the filling fraction of undisrupted structures and the fractional reduction
of the energy contained in them at the ion sound scale $\rho_s$. Both of these fractions depend strongly
on $\beta_e$, with the disrupted structures becoming more important at lower $\beta_e$. Finally,
we predict that the energy spectrum between $\lambda_{\rm D}$ and $\rho_s$ is steeper than $k_\perp^{-3}$,
when this range exists. Such a steep "transition range" is sometimes observed in short intervals
of solar-wind turbulence. The onset of collisionless magnetic reconnection may therefore significantly
affect the nature of plasma turbulence around the ion gyroscale.
