Super-resolution ultrasound imaging relies on the sub-wavelength localization of microbubble
contrast agents. By tracking individual microbubbles, the velocity and flow within microvessels
can be estimated. However, a 2D super-resolution image can only localize bubbles with sub-wavelength
resolution in the imaging plane whereas the resolution in the elevation plane is limited by conventional
beamwidth physics. Since ultrasound imaging integrates echoes over the elevation dimension,
velocity estimates at a single location in the imaging plane include information throughout the
imaging slice thickness. This slice thickness is typically a few orders or magnitude larger than
the super-resolution limit. It is shown here that in order to estimate the velocity, a spatial integration
over the elevation direction must be considered. This operation yields a multiplicative correction
factor that compensates for the elevation integration. A correlation-based velocity estimation
technique is then presented. Calibrated microtube phantom experiments are used to validate the
proposed velocity estimation method and the proposed elevation integration correction factor.
It is shown that velocity measurements are in agreement with theoretical predictions within the
considered range of flow rates (10 to 90 $\mu$L/min). Then, the proposed technique is applied to
two in-vivo mouse tail experiments imaged with a low frequency human clinical transducer with human
clinical concentrations of microbubbles. In the first experiment, a vein was visible with a diameter
of 140 $\mu$m and a peak flow velocity of 0.8 mm/s. In the second experiment, a vein was observed in
the super-resolved image with a diameter of 120~$\mu$m and with maximum local velocity of $\approx$~4.4~mm/s.
It is shown that the parabolic flow profiles within these micro-vessels are resolvable.
