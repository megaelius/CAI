The complexity of the metabolic processes at the heart of energy conversion in living organisms
is a great obstacle to the development of tractable thermodynamic models of metabolism, which would
be based on the definition of a small set of physical parameters. Here, we construct such a thermodynamic
model and show how it can apply in biomechanics by considering the case of muscle load. We assume that
living organisms are dynamical systems experiencing a feedback loop, in the sense that they can
be considered as thermodynamic systems subjected to mixed (coupled potentials and fluxes) boundary
conditions. These feedback effects give rise to homeostatic mechanisms keeping key physiological
parameters such as, e.g., body temperature and osmotic pressure, within specific and narrow ranges.
The complex nature of such a kind of systems may be dealt with at the cost of raising the abstract analysis
to a higher level, but with the advantage of offering a compact approach that relies on a few generic
parameters only. To this purpose, we consider a conversion zone as an equivalent thermodynamic
working fluid under mixed boundary conditions. The energy conversion process becomes a combination
of "one-to-many" (entropy generating) and "many-to-one" (work producing) processes. We introduce
and derive the generalized thermoelastic coefficients of the working fluid equivalent, as well
as the metabolic transport coefficients from which we define the metabolic figure of merit. Intrinsic
muscle friction dissipates the converted energy during muscle mechanical activity, but the chemical-mechanical
coupling also causes a dissipative mechanism, which we call the feedback resistance. We discuss
the impact of the feedback resistance on the metabolic energy conversion under muscle load. Finally,
our approach allows to give a thermodynamic ground to Hill's widely used muscular operational response
theory.
