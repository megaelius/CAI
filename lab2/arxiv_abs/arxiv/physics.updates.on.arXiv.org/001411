We present the Time of Flight Fixed by Energy Estimation (TOFFEE) as a measure of the fission chain
dynamics in subcritical assemblies. TOFFEE is the time between correlated gamma rays and neutrons,
subtracted by the estimated travel time of the incident neutron from its proton recoil. The measured
subcritical assembly was the BeRP ball, a 4.482 kg sphere of alpha-phase weapons grade plutonium
metal, which came in five configurations: bare, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 in iron, and 1 in nickel closed fitting
shell reflectors. We extend the measurement with MCNPX-PoliMi simulations of shells ranging up
to 6 inches in thickness, and two new reflector materials: aluminum and tungsten. We also simulated
the BeRP ball with different masses ranging from 1 to 8 kg. A two-region and single-region point kinetics
models were used to model the behavior of the positive side of the TOFFEE distribution from 0 to 100
ns. The single region model of the bare cases gave positive linear correlations between estimated
and expected neutron decay constants and leakage multiplications. The two-region model provided
a way to estimate neutron multiplication for the reflected cases, which correlated positively
with expected multiplication, but the nature of the correlation (sub or super linear) changed between
material types. Finally, we found that the areal density of the reflector shells had a linear correlation
with the integral of the two-region model fit. Therefore, we expect that with knowledge of reflector
composition, one could determine the shell thickness, or vice versa. Furthermore, up to a certain
amount and thickness of the reflector, the two-region model provides a way of distinguishing bare
and reflected plutonium assemblies.
