Heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is a new technology which uses temporary near field laser
heating of the media during write to increase hard disk drive storage density. By using plasmonic
antenna embedded in the write head, extremely high thermal gradient are created in the recording
media (up to 10K/nm). State of the art HAMR media consists of grains of FePtX ordered alloys exhibiting
high perpendicular anisotropy separated by insulating grain boundaries. Nearby the plasmonic
antenna, the difference of temperature between two 8nm wide neighboring grains in the media can
reach 80K, representing a gigantic thermal gradient of ~40K/nm across the grain boundary. Such
situations with much weaker thermal gradient (~1K/nm, already considered as very large) have already
been studied in the field of spincaloritronics. There, it was shown that very large spin transfer
torques due to thermal gradients can arise in magnetic tunnel junctions which can even yield magnetization
switching. Considering that two neighboring grains separated by an insulating grain boundary
in a HAMR media can be viewed as a magnetic tunnel junction and that the thermal gradients in HAMR are
one to two orders of magnitude larger than those existing in conventional spincaloritronics, one
may expect a major impact from these thermal torques on magnetization switching dynamics and therefore
on HAMR recording performances. This paper combines theory, experiments aiming at determining
the polarization of tunneling electrons across the media grain boundaries, and micromagnetic
simulations of recording process. It is shown that the thermal in-plane torque can have a detrimental
impact on the recording performances by favoring antiparallel magnetic alignment between neighboring
grains during the media cooling. Implications on media design are discussed in order to limit the
impact of these thermal torques.
