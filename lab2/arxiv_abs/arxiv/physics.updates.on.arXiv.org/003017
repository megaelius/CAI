N-graphdiyne monolayers, a set of carbon-nitride nanosheets, have been synthesized recently
through the polymerization of triazine- and pyrazine-based monomers. Since the two-dimensional
nano-structures are mainly composed of light-weight nonmetallic elements including carbon and
nitrogen, they might be able to provide high storage capacities for rechargeable cells. In this
study, we used extensive first principle calculations such as electronic density of states, band
structure, adsorption energy, open-circuit voltage, nudged-elastic band and charge analyses
to investigate the application of the newly fabricated N-graphdiyne monolayers as the anode material
for Li/Na/Mg ion batteries. Our calculations suggest that while Mg foreign atoms poorly interact
with monolayers, Li and Na adatoms illustrate outstanding anodic characteristics for rechargeable
storage cells. Electronic density of states calculations indicate that the insertion of Li/Na
into the novel N-graphdiyne materials enhances the electrical conductivity of nanosheets. Adsorption
energy and open-circuit voltage calculations predict that the nanosheets can provide a high storage
capacity spectrum of 623-2180 mAh/g which is higher than that for most recently discovered 2D materials
(e.g. phosphorene, borophane, and germanene involve Li binding capacities of 433, 504, and 369
mAh/g, respectively) and it is also significantly greater than the capacity of commercial anode
materials (e.g. graphite contains a capacity of 372 mAh/g). This study provides valuable insights
about the electronic characteristics of newly fabricated N-graphdiyne nanomaterials, rendering
them as promising candidates to be used in the growing industry of rechargeable storage devices.
