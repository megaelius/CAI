The shape gradient is a local sensitivity function that provides the change in a figure of merit associated
with a perturbation to the shape of the object. The shape gradient can be used for gradient-based
optimization, sensitivity analysis, and tolerance calculations. However, it is generally expensive
to compute from finite-difference derivatives for shapes which are described by many parameters,
as is the case for stellarator geometry. In an accompanying work (Antonsen et al. 2019), generalized
self-adjointness relations are obtained for MHD equilibria. These describe the relation between
perturbed equilibria due to changes in the rotational transform or toroidal current profiles,
displacements of the plasma boundary, modifications of currents in the vacuum region, or the addition
of bulk forces. These are applied to efficiently compute the shape gradient of functions of magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) equilibria with an adjoint approach. In this way, the shape derivative with respect to any
perturbation applied to the plasma boundary or coil shapes can be computed with only one additional
MHD equilibrium solution. We demonstrate that this approach is applicable for several figures
of merit of interest for stellarator configuration optimization: the magnetic well, the magnetic
ripple on axis, the departure from quasisymmetry, the effective ripple in the low-collisionality
$1/\nu$ regime ($\epsilon_{\text{eff}}^{3/2})$ (Nemov et al. 1999), and several finite collisionality
neoclassical quantities. Numerical verification is demonstrated for the magnetic well figure
of merit with the VMEC code (Hirshman & Whitson 1983) and for the magnetic ripple with modification
of the ANIMEC code (Cooper et al. 1992). Comparisons with the direct approach demonstrate that to
obtain agreement within several percent, the adjoint approach provides a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$
in computational savings.
