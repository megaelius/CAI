Nonadiabatic effects in chemical reaction at metal surfaces, due to excitation of electron-hole
pairs, stand at the frontier of the studies of gas-surface reaction dynamics. However, the first
principles description of electronic excitation remains challenging. In an efficient molecular
dynamics with electronic friction (MDEF) method, the nonadiabatic couplings are effectively
included in a so-called electronic friction tensor (EFT), which can be computed from first-order
time-dependent perturbation theory (TDPT) in terms of density functional theory (DFT) orbitals.
This second-rank tensor depends on adsorbate position and features a complicated transformation
with regard to the intrinsic symmetry operations of the system. In this work, we develop a new symmetry-adapted
neural network representation of EFT, based on our recently proposed embedded atom neural network
(EANN) framework. Inspired by the derivation of the nonadiabatic coupling matrix, we represent
the tensorial friction by the first and second derivatives of multiple outputs of NNs with respect
to atomic Cartesian coordinates. This rigorously preserves the positive semidefiniteness, directional
property, and correct symmetry-equivariance of EFT. Unlike previous methods, our new approach
can readily include both molecular and surface degrees of freedom, regardless of the type of surface.
Tests on the H2+Ag(111) system show that this approach yields an accurate, efficient, and continuous
representation of EFT, making it possible to perform large scale TDPT-based MDEF simulations to
study both adiabatic and nonadiabatic energy dissipation in a unified framework.
