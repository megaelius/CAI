Atomically-thin layers of two-dimensional materials can be assembled in vertical stacks held
together by relatively weak van der Waals forces, allowing for coupling between monolayer crystals
with incommensurate lattices and arbitrary mutual rotation. A profound consequence of using these
degrees of freedom is the emergence of an overarching periodicity in the local atomic registry of
the constituent crystal structures, known as a moir\'e superlattice. Its presence in graphene/hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) structures led to the observation of electronic minibands, whereas its effect
enhanced by interlayer resonant conditions in twisted graphene bilayers culminated in the observation
of the superconductor-insulator transition at magic twist angles. Here, we demonstrate that,
in semiconducting heterostructures built of incommensurate MoSe2 and WS2 monolayers, excitonic
bands can hybridise, resulting in the resonant enhancement of the moir\'e superlattice effects.
MoSe2 and WS2 are specifically chosen for the near degeneracy of their conduction band edges to promote
the hybridisation of intra- and interlayer excitons, which manifests itself through a pronounced
exciton energy shift as a periodic function of the interlayer rotation angle. This occurs as hybridised
excitons (hX) are formed by holes residing in MoSe2 bound to a twist-dependent superposition of
electron states in the adjacent monolayers. For heterostructures with almost aligned pairs of
monolayer crystals, resonant mixing of the electron states leads to pronounced effects of the heterostructure's
geometrical moir\'e pattern on the hX dispersion and optical spectrum. Our findings underpin novel
strategies for band-structure engineering in semiconductor devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.
