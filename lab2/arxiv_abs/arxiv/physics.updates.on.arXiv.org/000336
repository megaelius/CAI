This document gives some quantitative facts about the role of women in Italian astronomy. More than
26% of Italian IAU members are women: this is the largest fraction among the world leading countries
in astronomy. Most of this high fraction is due to their presence in INAF, where women make up 32% of
the research staff (289 out of 908) and 40% of the technical/administrative staff (173 out of 433);
the percentage is slightly lower among permanent research staff (180 out of 599, about 30%). The
presence of women is lower in the Universities (27 out of 161, about 17%, among staff). In spite of
these (mildly) positive facts, we notice that similarly to other countries (e.g. USA and Germany)
career prospects for Italian astronomers are clearly worse for women than for men. Within INAF,
the fraction of women is about 35-40% among non-permanent position, 36% for Investigators, 17%
for Associato/Primo Ricercatore, and only 13% among Ordinario/Dirigente di Ricerca. The situation
is even worse at University (only 6% of Professore Ordinario are women). We found that similar trends
are also present if researchers are ordered according to citation rather than position: for instance,
women make up only 15% among the 100 most cited astronomers working in Italy, a percentage which is
however twice that over all Europe. A similar fraction is found among first authors of most influential
papers, which cannot be explained as a residual of a lower female presence in the past. We conclude
that implicit sex discrimination factors probably dominate over explicit ones and are still strongly
at work. Finally, we discuss the possible connection between the typical career pattern and these
factors.
