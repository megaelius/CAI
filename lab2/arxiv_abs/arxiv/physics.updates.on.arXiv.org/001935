Ultra-compact, low-loss, fast, and reconfigurable optical components, enabling manipulation
of light by light, could open numerous opportunities for controlling light on the nanoscale. Nanostructured
all-dielectric metasurfaces have been shown to enable extensive control of amplitude and phase
of light in the linear optical regime. Among other functionalities, they offer unique opportunities
for shaping the wave front of light to introduce the orbital angular momentum (OAM) to a beam. Such
structured light beams bring a new degree of freedom for applications ranging from spectroscopy
and micromanipulation to classical and quantum optical communications. To date, reconfigurability
or tuning of the optical properties of all-dielectric metasurfaces have been achieved mechanically,
thermally, electrically or optically, using phase-change or nonlinear optical materials. However,
a majority of demonstrated tuning approaches are either slow or require high optical powers. Arsenic
trisulfide (As$_2$S$_3$) chalcogenide glass offering ultra-fast and large $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearity
as well as a low two-photon absorption coefficient in the near and mid-wave infrared spectral range,
could provide a new platform for the realization of fast and relatively low-intensity reconfigurable
metasurfaces. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate an As$_2$S$_3$ chalcogenide glass
based metasurface that enables reshaping of a conventional Hermite-Gaussian beam with no OAM into
an OAM beam at low-intensity levels, while preserves the original beam's amplitude and phase characteristics
at high-intensity levels. The proposed metasurface could find applications for a new generation
of optical communication systems and optical signal processing.
