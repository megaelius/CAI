We have been developing monolithic active pixel sensors, X-ray Astronomy SOI pixel sensors, XRPIXs,
based on a Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) CMOS technology as soft X-ray sensors for a future Japanese
mission, FORCE (Focusing On Relativistic universe and Cosmic Evolution). The mission is characterized
by broadband (1-80 keV) X-ray imaging spectroscopy with high angular resolution ($<15$~arcsec),
with which we can achieve about ten times higher sensitivity in comparison to the previous missions
above 10~keV. Immediate readout of only those pixels hit by an X-ray is available by an event trigger
output function implemented in each pixel with the time resolution higher than $10~{\rm \mu sec}$
(Event-Driven readout mode). It allows us to do fast timing observation and also reduces non-X-ray
background dominating at a high X-ray energy band above 5--10~keV by adopting an anti-coincidence
technique. In this paper, we introduce our latest results from the developments of the XRPIXs. (1)
We successfully developed a 3-side buttable back-side illumination device with an imaging area
size of 21.9~mm$\times$13.8~mm and an pixel size of $36~{\rm \mu m} \times 36~{\rm \mu m}$. The X-ray
throughput with the device reaches higher than 0.57~kHz in the Event-Driven readout mode. (2) We
developed a device using the double SOI structure and found that the structure improves the spectral
performance in the Event-Driven readout mode by suppressing the capacitive coupling interference
between the sensor and circuit layers. (3) We also developed a new device equipped with the Pinned
Depleted Diode structure and confirmed that the structure reduces the dark current generated at
the interface region between the sensor and the SiO$_2$ insulator layers. The device shows an energy
resolution of 216~eV in FWHM at 6.4~keV in the Event-Driven readout mode.
