We model the intracluster medium as a weakly collisional plasma that is a binary mixture of the hydrogen
and the helium ions, along with free electrons. When, owing to the helium sedimentation, the gradient
of the mean molecular weight (or equivalently, composition or helium ions' concentration) of the
plasma is not negligible, it can have appreciable influence on the stability criteria of the thermal
convective instabilities, e.g., the heat-flux-buoyancy instability and the magnetothermal
instability (MTI). These instabilities are consequences of the anisotropic heat conduction occurring
preferentially along the magnetic field lines. In this paper, without ignoring the magnetic tension,
we first present the mathematical criterion for the onset of composition gradient modified MTI.
Subsequently, we relax the commonly adopted equilibrium state in which the plasma is at rest, and
assume that the plasma is in a sheared state which may be due to differential rotation. We discuss
how the concentration gradient affects the coupling between the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability
and the MTI in rendering the plasma unstable or stable. We derive exact stability criterion by working
with the sharp boundary case in which the physical variables---temperature, mean molecular weight,
density, and magnetic field---change discontinuously from one constant value to another on crossing
the boundary. Finally, we perform the linear stability analysis for the case of the differentially
rotating plasma that is thermally and compositionally stratified as well. By assuming axisymmetric
perturbations, we find the corresponding dispersion relation and the explicit mathematical expression
determining the onset of the modified MTI.
