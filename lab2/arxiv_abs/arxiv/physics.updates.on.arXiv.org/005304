We explore the properties of steady-state Fano coherences generated in a three-level V-system
continuously pumped by polarized incoherent light in the absence of coherent driving. The ratio
of the stationary coherences to excited-state populations $\mathcal{C} = (1+\frac{\Delta^2}{\gamma(r+\gamma)}
)^{-1}$ is maximized when the excited-state splitting $\Delta$ is small compared to either the
spontaneous decay rate $\gamma$ or the incoherent pumping rate $r$. We demonstrate that an intriguing
regime exists where the $\mathcal{C}$ ratio displays a maximum as a function of the dephasing rate
$\gamma_d$. We attribute the surprising dephasing-induced enhancement of stationary Fano coherences
to the environmental suppression of destructive interference of individual incoherent excitations
generated at different times. We identify the imaginary Fano coherence with the non-equilibrium
flux across a pair of qubits coupled to two independent thermal baths, unraveling a direct connection
between the seemingly unrelated phenomena of incoherent driving of multilevel quantum systems
and non-equilibrium quantum transport in qubit networks. The real part of the steady-state Fano
coherence is found to be proportional to the deviation of excited-state populations from their
values in thermodynamic equilibrium, making it possible to observe signatures of steady-state
Fano coherences in excited-state populations. We put forward an experimental proposal for observing
steady-state Fano coherences by detecting the total fluorescence signal emitted by Calcium atoms
excited by polarized vs. isotropic incoherent light. Our analysis paves the way toward further
theoretical and experimental studies of non-equilibrium coherent steady states in thermally
driven atomic and molecular systems, and for the exploration of their potential role in biological
processes.
