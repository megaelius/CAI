Conventional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy relies on acquiring signal from a
macroscopic ensemble of molecules to gain information about molecular structure and dynamics.
Transferring this technique to nanoscale sample sizes would enable molecular analysis without
the effects of averaging over spatial and temporal inhomogeneities and without the need for macroscopic
volumes of analyte, both inherent to large ensemble measurements. Nanoscale NMR based on nitrogen
vacancy (NV) centers inside bulk diamond chips achieves single nuclear spin sensitivity and the
resolution required to determine chemical structure, but their detection volume is limited to
a few nanometers above the diamond surface for the most sensitive devices. This precludes them from
use for nuclear spin sensing with nanoscale resolution inside thicker structures, such as cells.
Here, we demonstrate the detection of NMR signals from multiple nuclear species in a (19 nm)3 volume
using versatile NV-NMR devices inside nanodiamonds that have a typical 30 nm diameter. The devices
detect a signal generated by a small number of analyte molecules on the order of 1000. To use these
devices in situ, the detected signal must be corrected for the unknown geometry of each nanodiamond
device. We show that such a calibration could be performed by exploiting the signal from a thin layer
of nuclei on the diamond surface. These results, combined with the low toxicity of nanodiamonds
and their amenability to surface functionalization, indicate that nanodiamond NV-NMR devices
could become a useful tool for nanoscale NMR-based sensing inside living cells.
