This work presents a feature-rich open-source library for wall-modelled large-eddy simulation
(WMLES), which is a turbulence modelling approach that reduces the computational cost of traditional
(wall-resolved) LES by introducing special treatment of the inner region of turbulent boundary
layers (TBLs). The library is based on OpenFOAM and enhances the general-purpose LES solvers provided
by this software with state-of-the-art wall modelling capability. In particular, the included
wall models belong to the class of wall-stress models that account for the under-resolved turbulent
structures by predicting and enforcing the correct local value of the wall shear stress. A review
of this approach is given, followed by a detailed description of the library, discussing its functionality
and extensible design. The included wall-stress models are presented, based on both algebraic
and ordinary differential equations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the library, it was used
for WMLES of turbulent channel flow and the flow over a backward-facing step (BFS). For each flow,
a systematic simulation campaign was performed, in order to find a combination of numerical schemes,
grid resolution and wall model type that would yield a good predictive accuracy for both the mean
velocity field in the outer layer of the TBLs and the mean wall shear stress. The best result was achieved
using a mildly dissipative second-order accurate scheme for the convective fluxes applied on an
isotropic grid with 27000 cells per $\delta^3$-cube, where $\delta$ is the thickness of the TBL
or the half-height of the channel. An algebraic model based on Spalding's law of the wall was found
to perform well for both flows. On the other hand, the tested more complicated models, which incorporate
the pressure gradient in the wall shear stress prediction, led to less accurate results.
