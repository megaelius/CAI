Recent experiments demonstrated strongly directional coupling of light into waveguide modes.
We identify here the mechanisms behind this effect. We consider emitters centered on the median
plane of the waveguide as well as emitters displaced from such plane. We show that, independently
of the displacement, the directionality is mostly due to a mirror symmetry breaking caused by the
axial character of the angular momentum of the emitted light. The sign of the angular momentum along
an axis transverse to the waveguide determines the preferential coupling direction. The degree
of directionality grows exponentially as the magnitude of such transverse angular momentum increases
linearly. We trace this exponential dependence back to a property of the evanescent angular spectrum
of the emissions. A binary and less pronounced directional coupling effect due to the chiral character
of the handedness of the emission is possible when the displacement of the emitter breaks another
of the mirror symmetries of the waveguide. We also show that the choice of a different angular momentum
quantization axis made in some experiments significantly changes the way in which directionality
depends on angular momentum. Our symmetry-based results apply to any emitted multipolar order,
clarify the spin-momentum locking concept, and generalize it to an exponentially-strong locking
between the transverse angular momentum and the preferential coupling direction. We also show
that, for centered emitters, the electric(magnetic) multipolar emissions can only couple to a
given waveguide mode if they obey a waveguide-mode-dependent selection rule.
