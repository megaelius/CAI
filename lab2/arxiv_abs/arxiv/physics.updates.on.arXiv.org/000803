Singularities, i.e. places of discontinuities of parameters are extremely general objects appearing
in electromagnetic waves and thus are the key to understanding of fundamental wave processes. These
structures commonly occur in purely coherent, highly directional waves, such as laser beams, determining
additional spatial or topological properties of the wave fields independently of their propagational
dynamics. For instance, topologies of wave fronts, called phase singularities, add orbital degrees
of freedom to electromagnetic waves. These singularities are common to all types of scalar waves
described only by their intensity and phase distributions. As the electromagnetic wave is a vector
wave, its topological properties generally depend on all field components leading to complex field
patterns in space and time. Some instantaneous field distributions may carry paradoxical vector
topology when the originally source-free wave exhibits spatial structure associated with the
"virtual" sources of electromagnetic fields localised in the vicinity of singular points. While
the Maxwell equations involve only electric charges, an electromagnetic wave in free space is highly
symmetrical with respect to the electric and magnetic fields as all real sources of the fields are
absent. This places the topology of electric and magnetic fields on equal footing in the wave and
gives rise to "virtual" sources of the both fields, named by us as wave monopoles. Here we present
systematic description of topological singularities in both electric and magnetic field of the
electromagnetic waves in a paraxial approximation. We also consider the important types of singular
electromagnetic waves with field structure akin to that originating from sources of electric and
magnetic fields.
