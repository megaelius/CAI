The NL-eEDM collaboration is building an experimental setup to search for the permanent electric
dipole moment of the electron in a slow beam of cold barium fluoride molecules [Eur. Phys. J. D, 72,
197 (2018)]. Knowledge of molecular properties of BaF is thus needed to plan the measurements and
in particular to determine an optimal laser-cooling scheme. Accurate and reliable theoretical
predictions of these properties require incorporation of both high-order correlation and relativistic
effects in the calculations. In this work theoretical investigations of the ground and the lowest
excited states of BaF and its lighter homologues, CaF and SrF, are carried out in the framework of
the relativistic Fock-space coupled cluster (FSCC) and multireference configuration interaction
(MRCI) methods. Using the calculated molecular properties, we determine the Franck-Condon factors
(FCFs) for the $A^2\Pi_{1/2} \rightarrow X^2\Sigma^{+}_{1/2}$ transition, which was successfully
used for cooling CaF and SrF and is now considered for BaF. For all three species, the FCFs are found
to be highly diagonal. Calculations are also performed for the $B^2\Sigma^{+}_{1/2} \rightarrow
X^2\Sigma^{+}_{1/2}$ transition recently exploited for laser-cooling of CaF; it is shown that
this transition is not suitable for laser-cooling of BaF, due to the non-diagonal nature of the FCFs
in this system. Special attention is given to the properties of the $A'^2\Delta$ state, which in
the case of BaF causes a leak channel, in contrast to CaF and SrF species where this state is energetically
above the excited states used in laser-cooling. We also present the dipole moments of the ground
and the excited states of the three molecules and the transition dipole moments (TDMs) between the
different states.
