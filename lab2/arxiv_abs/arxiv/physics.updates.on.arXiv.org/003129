Quantum bits based on individual trapped atomic ions constitute a promising technology for building
a quantum computer, with all the elementary operations having been achieved with the necessary
precision for some error-correction schemes. However, the essential two-qubit logic gate used
for generating quantum entanglement has hitherto always been performed in an adiabatic regime,
where the gate is slow compared with the characteristic motional frequencies of ions in the trap,
giving logic speeds of order 10kHz. There have been numerous proposals for performing gates faster
than this natural "speed limit" of the trap. We implement the method of Steane et al., which uses tailored
laser pulses: these are shaped on 10 ns timescales to drive the ions' motion along trajectories designed
such that the gate operation is insensitive to optical phase fluctuations. This permits fast (MHz-rate)
quantum logic which is robust to this important source of experimental error. We demonstrate entanglement
generation for gate times as short as 480ns; this is less than a single oscillation period of an ion
in the trap, and 8 orders of magnitude shorter than the memory coherence time measured in similar
calcium-43 hyperfine qubits. The method's power is most evident at intermediate timescales, where
it yields a gate error more than ten times lower than conventional techniques; for example, we achieve
a 1.6 us gate with fidelity 99.8%. Still faster gates are possible at the price of higher laser intensity.
The method requires only a single amplitude-shaped pulse and one pair of beams derived from a continuous-wave
laser, and offers the prospect of combining the unrivalled coherence properties, operation fidelities
and optical connectivity of trapped-ion qubits with the sub-microsecond logic speeds usually
associated with solid state devices.
