We present simulations of ignition and burn based on the Highfoot and High-Density Carbon indirect
drive designs of the National Ignition Facility for three regimes of alpha-heating - self-heating,
robust ignition and propagating burn - exploring hotspot power balance, perturbations and hydrodynamic
scaling. A Monte-Carlo Particle-in-Cell charged particle transport package for the radiation-magnetohydrodynamics
code Chimera was developed for this work. Hotspot power balance between alpha-heating, electron
thermal conduction and radiation was studied in 1D for each regime, and the impact of perturbations
on this power balance explored in 3D using a single Rayleigh-Taylor spike. Heat flow into the spike
from thermal conduction and alpha-heating increases by $\sim2-3\times$, due to sharper temperature
gradients and increased proximity of the cold, dense material to the main fusion regions respectively.
The radiative contribution remains largely unaffected in magnitude. Hydrodynamic scaling with
capsule size and laser energy of two perturbation scenarios (a short-wavelength multi-mode & a
low-mode radiation asymmetry) is explored in 3D, demonstrating the differing hydrodynamic evolution
of the three alpha-heating regimes. The multi-mode yield increases faster with scale factor due
to more synchronous $PdV$ compression producing higher temperatures and densities, and hence
stronger bootstrapping. Effects on the hydrodynamic evolution are clearer for stronger alpha-heating
regimes and include: reduced perturbation growth due to ablation from fire-polishing and stronger
thermal conduction; sharper temperature and density gradients; and increased hotspot pressures
which further compress the shell, increase hotspot size and induce faster re-expansion. Faster
expansion into regions of weak confinement is more prominent for stronger alpha-heating regimes,
and can result in loss of confinement.
