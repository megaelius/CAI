A framework for online robust adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is presented. This framework is
designed to (i) handle interfractional geometric variations following a probability distribution
different from the a priori hypothesis, (ii) address adaptation cost and (iii) address computational
tractability. The novelty of this framework is the use of Bayesian inference and scenario-reduction,
which is evaluated in a series of treatment on a one-dimensional phantom geometry. The initial robust
plan is generated from a robust optimization problem based on either expected-value- or worst-case-optimization
approach using the a priori hypothesis of the probability distribution governing the interfractional
geometric variations. The actual interfractional variations are evaluated in terms of their likelihood
with respect to the a priori hypothesis and violation of user-specified tolerance limits. During
an adaptation the a posteriori distribution is computed from the actual variations using Bayesian
inference. The adapted plan is optimized to better suit the actual interfractional variations
of the individual case, which is used until the next adaptation is. To address adaptation cost, the
proposed framework provides an option for increased adaptation frequency. Computational tractability
is addressed by scenario-reduction algorithms to reduce the size of the optimization problem.
According to the simulations, the proposed framework may improve target coverage compared to the
corresponding non-adaptive robust approach. Combining the worst-case-optimization approach
with Bayesian inference may perform best in terms of improving CTV coverage and organ-at-risk~(OAR)
protection. Bayesian inference may have a greater impact on handling adaptation cost than increased
adaptation frequency. The concept of scenario-reduction may be useful to address computational
tractability in ART and robust planning.
