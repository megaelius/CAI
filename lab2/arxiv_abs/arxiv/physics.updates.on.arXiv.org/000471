Our purpose is to measure the internal radiation dose (ID) using human blood sample. In the literature,
there is no process that allows the direct measurement of ID received by a person. This study has shown
that it is possible to determine ID in human blood exposed to internal or external ionizing radiation
treatment both directly and retrospectively. OSL technique was used to measure the total dose from
the blood sample. OSL counts from the waste blood of the patient injected with a radiopharmaceutical
for diagnostic or treatment purposes and from a blood sample having a laboratory-injected radiation
dose were both used for measurements. The decay and dose-response curves (DRC) were plotted for
different doses. The doses received by different blood aliquots have been determined by interpolating
the natural luminescence counts to DRC. In addition, OSL counts from a healthy blood sample exposed
to an external radiation source were measured. The blood aliquots were given different 0-200Gy
beta doses and their decay and dose-response curves were plotted. The internal dose received by
the blood aliquots injected with radioisotope was determined by interpolating the natural luminescence
counts to DRC. The internal dose values were found as 0.46Gy and 0.51Gy for different dose range.
The blood aliquots were exposed to different external laboratory doses. The internal dose values
corresponding to 10Gy laboratory dose from the aliquots exposed to external radiation were found
as 10.94Gy for Disc3 and ~10.79Gy for Disc1.This study shows that the dose received by a person can
be measured directly, simply and retrospectively by using only a very small amount of blood sample.
The results will have important ramifications for the medicine and healthcare fields in particular.
