In this work by using the assumptions that wavelength is much smaller than charge separation distance
of an electric dipole, which in turn is much smaller than a distance up to the point of observation,
new results for radiation of electric dipole were obtained. These results generalize and extend
the classical solution, and they indicate that under the above assumptions the classical electric
dipole emits both long-range longitudinal electric and transverse electromagnetic waves. For
a specific values of the dipole system parameters the longitudinal and transverse electric fields
are shown. Total power emitted by electric and electromagnetic waves are calculated and compared.
It was shown that under the standard assumption of charge separation distance being much smaller
than wavelength: a) classical solution correctly describes the transverse electromagnetic waves;
b) transverse electromagnetic waves are dominant and longitudinal electric waves are negligible;
c) total radiated power is proportional to fourth degree of frequency; d) according to classical
solution most of the power is emitted perpendicular to electric dipole axis; e) our solution reduces
to classical solution. In case wavelength is much smaller than charge separation distance: a) the
classical solution is not valid and it overestimates the total radiated power; b) longitudinal
electric waves are dominant and transverse electromagnetic waves are negligible; c) total radiated
power is proportional to second degree of frequency; d) most of the power is emitted in a narrow beam
along the dipole axis, thus emission of waves is focused as with lasers. In the region where wavelength
is equivalent to charge separation distance: a) power emitted by longitudinal and transverse waves
are equal; b) power of the transverse waves has a dip. It would be interesting to observe these results
in experiments.
