High accuracy and dynamic range have been some of the most prominent challenges when it comes to fine-scale
turbulence measurements. The current commercial LDA processors, which perform the signal processing
of Doppler bursts directly using hardware components, are essentially black boxes and in particular
are renown for suffering from practical limitations that reduce the measurement reliability and
accuracy. A transparently functioning novel LDA, utilizing advanced technologies and up-to-date
hardware and software has therefore been developed to enhance the measurement quality and the dynamic
range. In addition, the self-developed software comes with a highly flexible functionality for
the signal processing and data interpretation. The LDA setup and the combined forward/side scattering
optical alignment (to minimize the effective measuring volume) are described first, followed
by a description of the signal processing aspects. The round turbulent jet has been used as the test
bed since it presents a wide range of degree of difficulty for the LDA processor (accuracy, dynamic
range etc.) across the different radial distances and downstream development. The data are diagnosed
for dynamic range in residence and interarrival times, and compared to a typical hardware driven
processor. The radial profiles of measured mean streamwise velocity and variance agree well with
previous studies of the round jet. The spatial turbulent kinetic energy spectra in the fully developed
region perfectly match the expected (and in this region well established) -5/3 power law even for
the largest measured distances from the centerline (where shear and turbulence intensity are significant).
