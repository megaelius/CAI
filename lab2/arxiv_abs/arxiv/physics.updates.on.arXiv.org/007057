The interaction between various wavelike structures in screeching jets is considered via both
experimental measurements and linear stability theory. Velocity snapshots of screeching jets
are used to produce a reduced order model of the screech cycle via proper orthogonal decomposition.
Streamwise Fourier filtering is then applied to isolate the negative and positive wavenumber components,
which for the waves of interest in this jet correspond to upstream and downstream-travelling waves.
A global stability analysis on an experimentally derived base flow is conducted, demonstrating
a close match to the results obtained via experiment, indicating that the mechanisms considered
here are well represented in a linear framework. In both analyses, three distinct wavelike structures
are evident. These three waves are those first shown by Tam & Hu (1989) to be supported by a cylindrical
vortex sheet. One is the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode. Another is the upstream-travelling guided jet
mode that has been a topic of recent discussion. The third component, with positive phase velocity,
has not previously been identified in screeching jets. We provide evidence that this downstream-travelling
wave is a duct-like mode similar to that recently identified in high-subsonic jets by Towne et al.
(2017). We further demonstrate that both of the latter two waves are generated by the interaction
between the Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepacket and the shock cells in the flow, according to a theory first
proposed in Tam & Tanna (1982). Finally, we consider the periodic spatial modulation of the coherent
velocity fluctuation evident in screeching jets, and show that this modulation is the result of
the superposition of the three wavelike structures, with no evidence that the shocks in the flow
modulate the growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepacket.
