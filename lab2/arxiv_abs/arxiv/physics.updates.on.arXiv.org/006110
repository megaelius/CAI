Single atomic sites often determine the functionality and performance of materials, such as catalysts,
semi-conductors or enzymes. Computing and understanding the properties of such sites is therefore
a crucial component of the rational materials design process. Because of complex electronic effects
at the atomic level, atomic site properties are conventionally derived from computationally expensive
first-principle calculations, as this level of theory is required to achieve relevant accuracy.
In this study, we present a widely applicable machine learning (ML) approach to compute atomic site
properties with high accuracy in real time. The approach works well for complex non-crystalline
atomic structures and therefore opens up the possibility for high-throughput screenings of nano-materials,
amorphous systems and materials interfaces. Our approach includes a robust featurization scheme
to transform atomic structures into features which can be used by common machine learning models.
Performing a genetic algorithm (GA) based feature selection, we show how to establish an intuitive
physical interpretation of the structure-property relations implied by the ML models. With this
approach, we compute atomic site stabilities of metal nanoparticles ranging from 3-55 atoms with
mean absolute errors in the range of 0.11-0.14 eV in real time. We also establish the chemical identity
of the site as most important factor in determining atomic site stabilities, followed by structural
features like bond distances and angles. Both, the featurization and GA feature selection functionality
are published in open-source python modules. With this method, we enable the efficient rational
design of highly specialized real-world nano-catalysts through data-driven materials screening.
