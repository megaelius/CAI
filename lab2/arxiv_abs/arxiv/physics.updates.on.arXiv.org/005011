Further progress in the development of ECR ion sources (ECRIS) requires deeper understanding of
the underlying physics. One of the topics that remains obscure, though being crucial for the performance
of the ECRIS, is the electron energy distribution (EED). A well-developed technique of measuring
the EED of electrons escaping axially from the magnetically confined plasma of an ECRIS was used
for the study of EED in unstable mode of plasma confinement, i.e. in the presence of kinetic instabilities.
The experimental data were recorded for pulsed and CW discharges with a room-temperature 14 GHz
ECRIS at the JYFL accelerator laboratory. The measurements were focused on observing differences
between the EED escaping from a stable and unstable plasmas. It was found that nonlinear phenomena
alter the EED noticeably. The electron losses are enhanced in both unstable regime and with two-frequency
heating suppressing the instabilities. It has been shown earlier that two-frequency heating boosts
the ECRIS performance presumably owing to the suppression of instabilities. We report the observed
changes in EED introduced by the secondary frequency in different regimes, including an off-resonance
condition where the secondary frequency is lower than the minimum frequency satisfying the resonance
condition for cold electrons at the magnetic field minimum. Finally, we suggest an experimental
method of qualitative evaluation of the energy distribution of electrons confined in the magnetic
trap using a method of measuring energy distribution of lost electrons during the plasma decay in
pulsed operation of the ion source.
