The use of special quantum states to achieve sensitivities below the limits established by classically
behaving states has enjoyed immense success since its inception. In bosonic interferometers,
squeezed states, number states and cat states have been implemented on various platforms and have
demonstrated improved measurement precision over interferometers based on coherent states.
Another metrologically useful state is an equal superposition of two eigenstates with maximally
different energies; this state ideally reaches the full interferometric sensitivity allowed
by quantum mechanics. By leveraging improvements to our apparatus made primarily to reach higher
operation fidelities in quantum information processing, we extend a technique to create number
states up to $n=100$ and to generate superpositions of a harmonic oscillator ground state and a number
state of the form $\textstyle{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}(\lvert 0\rangle+\lvert n\rangle)$ with
$n$ up to 18 in the motion of a single trapped ion. While experimental imperfections prevent us from
reaching the ideal Heisenberg limit, we observe enhanced sensitivity to changes in the oscillator
frequency that initially increases linearly with $n$, with maximal value at $n=12$ where we observe
3.2(2) dB higher sensitivity compared to an ideal measurement on a coherent state with the same average
occupation number. The quantum advantage from using number-state superpositions can be leveraged
towards precision measurements on any harmonic oscillator system; here it enables us to track the
average fractional frequency of oscillation of a single trapped ion to approximately 2.6 $\times$
10$^{-6}$ in 5 s. Such measurements should provide improved characterization of imperfections
and noise on trapping potentials, which can lead to motional decoherence, a leading source of error
in quantum information processing with trapped ions.
