Recently the evaluation of the whole charge state distribution of the projectile ions colliding
with the solid target has been extended in the ETACHA4 code [Lamour et al. Phys. Rev. A, 92 (2015) 42703]
towards the low energy regime is less than 10 MeV/u emphasizing the nonperturbative processes in
many electron projectiles. We note that many experimental studies at the low beam energies have
been reported in the past [Shima et al. At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 34 (1986) 357] can be compared with
the predictions for the projectiles up to 20 electrons. For these ions, earlier version ETACHA23
[J.P. Rozet et al. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res., Sect. B107, (1996) 67 ] can also be utilized
and the predictions of both the codes can be compared with the experimental results. In this work
we present the merits and demerits of these calculations. The measured charge state distribution
curves as a function of the projectile charge states are reproduced by both the codes up to Zp equal
to 16. However, the models fail to replicate many-electron projectiles as well as a few electron
heavy projectiles Zp greater than or equal to 17 despite the systems lie within the perturbative
regime. The ETACHA23 over estimates the data, whereas ETACHA4 under estimates. The over estimations
are quite obvious as it does not consider the electron capture phenomenon at the exit surface leading
to non-radiative captures in the Rydberg states. Inclusion of non-radiative capture phenomenon
will bring ETACHA23 predictions close to the experimental results and on the other hand the same
will lower the ETACHA4 predictions further down wards.
