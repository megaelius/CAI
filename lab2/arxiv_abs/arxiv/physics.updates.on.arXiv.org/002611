This article demonstrates the realization of an extraordinary beam splitter based on nonreciprocal
and synchronized photonic transitions in obliquely illuminated space-time-modulated (STM)
slabs which impart the coherent temporal frequency and spatial frequency shifts. As a consequence
of such unusual photonic transitions, a one-way beam splitting and amplification is exhibited
by the STM slab. Beam splitting is a vital operation for various optical and photonic systems, ranging
from quantum computation to fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. Despite the beam splitting
is conceptually a simple operation, the performance characteristics of beam splitters significantly
influence the repeatability and accuracy of the entire optical system. As of today, there has been
no approach exhibiting a nonreciprocal beam splitting accompanied with transmission gain and
an arbitrary splitting angle. Here, we show that oblique illumination of a periodic and semi-coherent
dynamically-modulated slab results in coherent photonic transitions between the incident light
beam and its counterpart space-time harmonic (STH). Such photonic transitions introduce a unidirectional
synchronization and momentum exchange between two STHs with same temporal frequencies, but opposite
spatial frequencies. Such a beam splitting technique offers high isolation, transmission gain
and zero beam tilting, and is expected to drastically decrease the resource and isolation requirements
in optical and photonic systems. In addition to the analytical solution, we provide a closed-form
solution for the electromagnetic fields in STM structures, and accordingly, investigate the properties
of the wave isolation and amplification in subluminal, superluminal and luminal ST modulations.
