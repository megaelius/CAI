Experiments were performed to study electron acceleration by intense sub-picosecond laser pulses
propagating in sub-mm long plasmas of near critical electron density (NCD). Low density foam layers
of 300-500 um thickness were used as targets. The NCD-plasma was produced by a mechanism of a super-sonic
ionization when a well-defined separate ns-pulse was sent onto the foam-target forerunning the
relativistic main pulse. The effect of the relativistic laser pulse channeling and creation of
quasi-static azimuthal magnetic and radial electric fields that keeps electrons in the channel
ensured effective coupling of the laser energy into energetic electrons. Application of sub-mm
thick low density foam layers provided substantial increase of the electron acceleration path
in a NCD-plasma compared to the case of freely expanding plasmas created in the interaction of the
ns-laser pulse with solid foils. Performed experiments on the electron heating by a 100J, 750 fs
short laser pulse of (2-5)x1019 W/cm2 intensity demonstrated that the effective temperature of
supra-thermal electrons increased from 1.5-2 MeV, in the case of the relativistic laser interaction
with a metallic foil at high laser contrast, up to 13 MeV for the laser shots onto the pre-ionized foam.
The observed tendency towards the strong increase of the mean electron energy and the number of ultra-relativistic
laser-accelerated electrons is reinforced by the results of gamma-yield measurements that showed
a 1000-fold increase of the measured doses. The experiment was supported by the 3D-PIC and FLUKA
simulations made for used laser parameters and geometry of the experimental set-up. Both measurements
and simulations show high directionality of the acceleration process close to the direction of
the laser pulse propagation. The charge of super-ponderomotive electrons with E > 30 MeV reaches
a high value of 78nC.
