A longstanding mystery about Jupiter has been the straightness and steadiness of its weather-layer
jets, quite unlike terrestrial strong jets with their characteristic unsteadiness and long-wavelength
meandering. The problem is addressed in two steps. The first is to take seriously the classic Dowling-Ingersoll
$1 {-2pt}\frac{1}{2}$-layer scenario and its supporting observational evidence. The evidence
implies the existence of deep, massive, zonally-symmetric zonal jets in the underlying dry-convective
layer. There is then the possibility of straight, stable weather-layer jets with the deep jets acting
as guide-rails. Stability is possible even with nonmonotonic weather-layer potential-vorticity
gradients. The second step is to improve the realism of the small-scale stochastic forcing used
to represent Jupiter's moist convection, as far as possible within the $1 {-2pt}\frac{1}{2}$-layer
dynamics. The real, three-dimensional moist convection should be strongest in the belts where
the interface to the deep flow is highest and coldest. It is likely, moreover, to generate cyclones
as well as anticyclones but with the anticyclones systematically stronger. Such forcing can act
quasifrictionally on large scales, and thus produce statistically steady turbulent weather-layer
regimes without artificial large-scale friction. Forcing strengths sufficient to produce chaotic
vortex dynamics can also produce realistic belt-zone contrasts in the model's moist-convective
activity, through a tilting of the interface by eddy-induced sharpening and strengthening of the
weather-layer jets relative to the deep jets. Weaker forcing for which the only jet-sharpening
mechanism is the passive (Kelvin) shearing of vortices, the so-called "CE2" or "SSST" or "zonostrophic
instability" mechanism, produces unrealistic belt-zone structures.
