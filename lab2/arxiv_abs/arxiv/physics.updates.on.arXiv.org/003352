The method of regularized Stokeslets, based on the divergence-free exact solution to the equations
of highly viscous flow due to a spatially-smoothed concentrated force, is widely employed in biological
fluid mechanics. Many problems of interest are axisymmetric, motivating the study of the azimuthally-integrated
form of the Stokeslet which physically corresponds to a ring of smoothed forces. The regularized
fundamental solution for the velocity (single layer potential) and stress (double layer potential)
due to an axisymmetric ring of smoothed point forces, the `regularized ringlet', is derived in terms
of complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind. The relative errors in the total drag
and surrounding fluid velocity for the resistance problem on the translating, rotating unit sphere,
as well as the condition number of the underlying resistance matrix, are calculated; the regularized
method is also compared to 3D regularized Stokeslets, and the singular method of fundamental solutions.
The velocity of Purcell's toroidal swimmer is calculated; regularized ringlets enable accurate
evaluation of surface forces and propulsion speeds for non-slender tori. The benefits of regularization
are illustrated by a model of the internal cytosolic fluid velocity profile in the rapidly-growing
pollen tube. Actomyosin transport of vesicles in the tube is modelled using forces immersed in the
fluid, from which it is found that transport along the central actin bundle is essential for experimentally-observed
flow speeds to be attained. The effect of tube growth speed on the internal cytosolic velocity is
also considered. For axisymmetric problems, the regularized ringlet method exhibits a comparable
accuracy to the method of fundamental solutions whilst also allowing for the placement of forces
inside of the fluid domain and having more satisfactory convergence properties.
