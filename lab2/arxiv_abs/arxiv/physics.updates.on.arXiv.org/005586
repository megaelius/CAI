We propose Artificial Intelligence Prospective Randomized Observer Blinding Evaluation (AI-PROBE)
for quantitative clinical performance evaluation of radiology AI systems within prospective
randomized clinical trials. AI-PROBE encompasses a study design and a matching radiology IT infrastructure
that randomly blinds radiologists for results provided by AI-based image analysis. To demonstrate
the applicability of our evaluation framework, we present a first prospective randomized clinical
trial on the effect of Intra-Cranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection in emergent care head CT on radiology
study Turn-Around Time (TAT). Here, we acquired 620 non-contrast head CT scans from inpatient and
emergency room patients at a large academic hospital. Following acquisition, scans were automatically
analyzed for the presence of ICH using commercially available software (Aidoc, Tel Aviv, Israel).
Cases identified positive for ICH by AI (ICH-AI+) were flagged in radiologists' reading worklists,
where flagging was randomly switched off with probability 50%. TAT was measured as time difference
between study completion and first clinically communicated reporting, with time stamps automatically
retrieved from various IT systems. TATs for flagged cases (73+/-143 min) were significantly lower
than TATs for non-flagged (132+/-193 min) cases (p<0.05, one-sided t-test), where 105 of 122 ICH-AI+
cases were true positive. Total sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy over all analyzed cases
were 95.0%, 96.7%, and 96.4%, respectively. We conclude that automatic identification of ICH reduces
TAT for ICH in emergent care head CT, which carries the potential for improving timely clinical management
of ICH. Our results suggest that AI-PROBE can contribute to systematic quantitative evaluation
of AI systems in clinical practice using clinically meaningful quantities, such as TAT or diagnostic
accuracy.
