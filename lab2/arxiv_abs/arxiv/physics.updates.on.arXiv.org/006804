In the standard theory of the formation of planets in our Solar System, terrestrial planets and the
cores of gas giant planets are formed through accretion of km size objects (planetesimals) in the
protoplanetary disk. The gravitational $N$-body simulations of planetesimal systems is the most
direct way to study the accretion process of the planets. However, the use of $N$-body simulations
has been limited to idealized model (e.g., perfect accretion) and/or narrow radial range, due to
the limited number of particles available. We have developed a new N-body simulation code with particle-particle
particle-tree (P3T) scheme for planetary system formation, GPLUM. GPLUM uses a fourth-order Hermite
scheme to calculate gravitational interactions between particles within cut-off radii of individual
particles and the Barnes-Hut tree scheme for gravitational interactions with particles outside
the cut-off radii. In existing implementations of the P3T schemes, the same cut-off radius is used
for all particles. Thus, when the range of the mass of the planetesimals becomes large, the calculation
speed decreases. We have solved this problem by allowing each particle to determine its appropriate
cutoff radius depending on its mass, distance from the central star, and the local velocity dispersion,
and thus achieved a significant speedup when the range of the masses of particles is wide. We have
also improved the scalability of the code, and have achieved good strong-scaling performance for
up to 1,024 cores in the case of N=10^6. GPLUM is freely available from https://github.com/YotaIshigaki/GPLUM
