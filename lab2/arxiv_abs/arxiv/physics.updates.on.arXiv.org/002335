By investigating the benefits and shortcomings of the existing form of continuous defect theory
(CDT) and using recent advancements in size-dependent continuum mechanics, we develop a fully
coherent theoretical framework, denoted as Consistent Continuous Defect Theory (C-CDT). Among
several important potential applications, C-CDT may provide a proper foundation to study the continuum
theory of crystal plasticity. The development presented here includes an examination of the character
of the bend-twist tensor, Weingarten's theorem, Burgers and Frank vectors, continuous dislocation
and disclination density tensors, and the dualism between geometry and statics of CDT based on couple
stress theory (CST). Then, by using Consistent Couple Stress Theory (C-CST), the new C-CDT is derived
in a totally systematic manner. In this development, the geometry of C-CDT is dual to the statics
formulation in C-CST. Previously, the fundamental step in the creation of C-CST was recognizing
the skew-symmetric character of the couple-stress tensor, which requires the skew-symmetrical
part of the bend-twist tensor to be the additional measure of deformation in size-dependent continuum
mechanics. Via Weingarten's theorem and arguments from C-CST, we establish that in defect theory
the dislocation density tensor must be skew-symmetric and thus can be represented by an equivalent
dislocation density vector. In addition, we investigate the character of a classical version of
C-CDT with unexpected consequences. For full consistency, there can be no continuous dislocation
density tensor within classical continuum mechanics, and the continuous disclination density
tensor becomes symmetric. This clearly is analogous to the absence of couple-stresses and the symmetry
of force-stresses in classical continuum mechanics.
