Diverting, and controlling, elastic vibrations impacting upon infrastructure is a major challenge
for seismic hazard mitigation, and for the reduction of machine noise and vehicle vibration in the
urban environment. Seismic metamaterials (SMs), with their inherent ability to manipulate wave
propagation, provide a key route for overcoming the technological hurdles involved in this challenge.
Engineering the structure of the SM serves as a basis to tune and enhance its functionality, and inspired
by split rings, swiss-rolls, notch-shaped and labyrinthine designs of elementary cells in electromagnetic
and mechanical metamaterials, we investigate altering the structure geometries of SMs with the
aim of creating large bandgaps \textcolor{black}{in a subwavelength regime}. We show that square
stiff inclusions, perform better in comparison to circular ones, whilst keeping the same filling
fraction. En route to enhancing the bandgap, we have also studied the performance of SMs with different
constituent materials; we find that steel columns, as inclusions, show large bandgaps, however,
the columns are too large for steel to be a feasible material in practical or financial terms. Non-reinforced
concrete would be preferable for industry level scaling up of the technology because, concrete
is cost-effective, easy to cast directly at the construction site and easy to provide arbitrary
geometry of the structure. As a part of this study, we show that concrete columns can also be designed
to exhibit bandgaps if we cast them within a soft soil coating surrounding the protected area for
various civil structures like a bridge, building, oil pipelines etc.
