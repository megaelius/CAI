The central question of systems biology is to understand how individual components of a biological
system such as genes or proteins cooperate in emerging phenotypes resulting in the evolution of
diseases. As living cells are open systems in quasi-steady state type equilibrium in continuous
exchange with their environment, computational techniques that have been successfully applied
in statistical thermodynamics to describe phase transitions may provide new insights to emerging
behavior of biological systems. Here we will systematically evaluate the translation of computational
techniques from solid-state physics to network models that closely resemble biological networks
and develop specific translational rules to tackle problems unique to living systems. Hence we
will focus on logic models exhibiting only two states in each network node. Motivated by the apparent
asymmetry between biological states where an entity exhibits boolean states i.e. is active or inactive,
we present an adaptation of symmetric Ising model towards an asymmetric one fitting to living systems
here referred to as the modified Ising model with gene-type spins. We analyze phase transitions
by Monte Carlo simulations and propose mean-field solution of modified Ising model of a network
type that closely resembles real-world network, the Barab\'{a}si-Albert model of scale-free
networks. We show that asymmetric Ising models show similarities to symmetric Ising models with
external field and undergoes a discontinuous phase transition of the first-order and exhibits
hysteresis. The simulation setup presented here can be directly used for any biological network
connectivity dataset and is also applicable for other networks that exhibit similar states of activity.
This is a general statistical method to deal with non-linear large scale models arising in the context
of biological systems and is scalable to any network size.
