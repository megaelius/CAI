The experiment Neutrino-4 had started in 2014 with a detector model and then was continued with a
full-scale detector. All steps of preparatory work on this experiment are presented. Were obtained
the results of measurements of reactor antineutrino flux and spectrum dependence on the distance
in the range 6-12 meters from the center of the reactor core at SM-3 reactor. Using all collected data,
we performed the model independent analysis on the oscillation parameters $\Delta m_{14}^2$ and
$\sin^22\theta_{14}$. The method of coherent summation of results of measurements allows us to
directly observe the effect of oscillations. We observed an oscillation effect in vicinity of $\Delta
m_{14}^2=(7.25\pm0.13_{st}\pm1.08_{sys})\text{eV}^2$ and $\sin^22\theta_{14}= 0.26\pm0.08_{st}\pm0.05_{sys}$.
We provide a comparison of our results with results of other experiments on search for sterile neutrino.
Combining the result of the Neutrino-4 and the results of measurements of the gallium anomaly and
reactor anomaly we obtained value $\sin^22\theta_{14}\approx0.19 \pm 0.04 (4.6\sigma)$. Also
was performed comparison of Neutrino-4 results with results of other reactor experiments NEOS,
DANSS, STEREO, PROSPECT and MiniBooNE, LSND experiments and the IceCube experiment. Mass of sterile
neutrino obtained from data collected in the Neutrino-4 experiment (in assumption $m_4^2\approx
\Delta m_{14}^2$) is $m_4=2.68\pm0.13\text{eV}$. Using the estimations of mixing angles obtained
in other experiments and our results we can calculate, within 3+1 neutrino model, masses of electron,
muon, and tau neutrinos: $m_{\nu_e}^{\text{eff}}=(0.58\pm0.09)\text{eV}, m_{\nu_\mu}^{\text{eff}}=(0.42\pm0.24)\text{eV},
m_{\nu_\tau}^{\text{eff}}\leq 0.65\text{eV}$. Extended PMNS matrix for 3+1 model with one sterile
neutrino is provided, neutrino flavor mixing scheme with sterile neutrino and global fit of reactor
experiments.
