The paper performs simulation of a rectangular plate excited by turbulent channel flow at friction
Reynolds numbers of 180 and 400. The fluid-structure interaction is assumed to be one-way coupled,
i.e, the fluid affects the solid and not vice versa. We solve the incompressible Navier Stokes equations
using finite volume direct numerical simulation in the fluid domain. In the solid domain, we solve
the dynamic linear elasticity equations using a time-domain finite element method. The obtained
plate averaged displacement spectra collapse in the low frequency region in outer scaling. However,
the high frequency spectral levels do not collapse in inner units. This spectral behavior is reasoned
using theoretical arguments. We further study the sources of plate excitation using a novel formulation.
This formulation expresses the average displacement spectra of the plate as an integrated contribution
from the fluid sources within the channel. Analysis of the net displacement source reveals that
at the plate natural frequencies, the contribution of the fluid sources to the plate excitation
peaks in the buffer layer. The corresponding wall-normal width is found to be $\approx 0.75\delta$.
We analyze the decorrelated features of the sources using spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
(POD) of the net displacement source. We enforce the orthogonality of the modes in an inner product
with a symmetric positive definite kernel. The dominant spectral POD mode contributes to the entire
plate excitation. The contribution of the remaining modes from the different wall-normal regions
undergo destructive interference resulting in zero net contribution. The envelope of the dominant
mode further shows that the location and width of the contribution depend on inner and outer units,
respectively.
