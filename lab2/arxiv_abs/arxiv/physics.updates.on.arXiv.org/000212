Unlike most other laws of nature, the second law of thermodynamics is according to Boltzmann statistical
in nature, meaning that its reliability arises from the vast number of particles present in macroscopic
systems. This means that such systems will lead towards their most likely state, that is, the one
with the most homogeneous probability distribution. But Boltzmann states that entropy decreasing
processes can occur (without doing any work), it is just very improbable. It is therefore not impossible,
in principle, for all 6 x 10^23 atoms in a mole of a gas to spontaneously move to one half of a container;
it is only fantastically unlikely. A similar idea has been applied on a human cell. All somatic cells
seem to age and deteriorate in unfavorable conditions. If the aging process is defined as the accumulation
of dysfunctional polymers resulting from among other things chemical bond breakage, where polymers
aggregate into harmful arrangements, spreading randomly out in the cell, leading to an altered
function, then it also applies that there will be a difference in entropy between an individual of,
say, 20 years, and the same individual 80 years old. The goal of this article is to demonstrate that
the second law does not tell us that the cell necessarily must go toward a high entropy state and stay
that way, but that it is possible according to statistical mechanics for an old cell to experience
a return to a younger state. We find the probability of this spontaneous return to a more ordered state
to be expressed by P = 10^(-202)^(-889). In spite of this number, it does show that a reversal of the
aging process is not prohibited by nature. There is a theoretical possibility of rejuvenation.
Whether this will ever become a practical reality is another matter.
