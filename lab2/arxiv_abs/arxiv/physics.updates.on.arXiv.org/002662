Many real infrastructure networks, such as power grids and communication networks, are not only
depend on one another to function, but also embedded in space. A lot of works have been devoted to reveal
the vulnerability of interdependent spatially embedded networks considers random failures.
However, recently research show that they are susceptible to geographically localized attacks
or failures cased by natural disasters or terrorist attacks, which affect all nodes within a given
radius. In particular, small localized attacks may lead to catastrophic consequences. As a remedy
of the collapse instability, one research introduced a dynamic healing strategy and the possibility
of new connectivity link with a probability, called random healing, to bridge two remaining neighbors
of a failed node. The random strategy is straightforward. Here, unlike previous strategy, we propose
a simple but effective strategy, called healing strategy by prioritizing minimum degree(HPMD),
which establishing a new link between two functioning neighbors with minimum degree during the
cascading failures. In addition, we consider the distance between two nodes to avoid change the
network structures. Afterwards, a comparison is made between HPMD and three healing strategies:
random, degree centrality and local centrality to identify which a pair of neighbors have high priority.
Simulation experiments are presented for two square lattices with the same size as interdependent
spatially embedded networks under localized attacks. Results demonstrated that HPMD strategy
has an outstanding performance against localized attacks, even when ratio of healing is vary. Moreover,
HPMD is more timely, more applicability and costless. Our method is meaningful in practice as it
can greatly enhance the resilience and robustness of interdependent spatially embedded networks
against localized attacks.
