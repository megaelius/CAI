Neoclassical and turbulent heavy impurity transport in tokamak core plasmas are determined by
main ion temperature, density and toroidal rotation profiles. Thus, in order to understand and
prevent experimental behaviour of W accumulation, flux-driven integrated modelling of main ion
heat and particle transport over multiple confinement times is a vital prerequisite. For the first
time, the quasilinear gyrokinetic code QuaLiKiz has been applied for successful predictions of
core kinetic profiles in an ASDEX Upgrade H-mode discharge in the turbulence dominated region within
the integrated modelling suite JETTO. Neoclassical contributions are calculated by NCLASS; auxiliary
heat and particle deposition profiles due to NBI and ECRH prescribed from previous analysis with
TRANSP. Turbulent and neoclassical contributions are insufficient in explaining main ion heat
and particle transport inside the $q=1$ surface, necessitating the prescription of further transport
coefficients to mimic the impact of MHD activity on central transport. The ion to electron temperature
ratio at the simulation boundary at $\rho_\mathrm{tor} = 0.85$ stabilizes ion scale modes while
destabilizing ETG modes when significantly exceeding unity. Careful analysis of experimental
measurements using Gaussian process regression techniques is carried out to explore reasonable
uncertainties. In following trace W impurity transport simulations performed with additionally
NEO, neoclassical transport under consideration of poloidal asymmetries alone is found to be insufficient
to establish hollow central W density profiles. Reproduction of these conditions measured experimentally
is found possible only when assuming the direct impact of a saturated $(m,n)=(1,1)$ MHD mode on heavy
impurity transport.
