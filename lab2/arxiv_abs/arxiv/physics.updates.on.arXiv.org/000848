The Boulby Underground Germanium Suite (BUGS) comprises three low background, high-purity germanium
detectors operating in the Boulby Underground Laboratory, located 1.1 km underground in the north-east
of England, UK. BUGS utilises three types of detector to facilitate a high-sensitivity, high-throughput
radioassay programme to support the development of rare-event search experiments. A Broad Energy
Germanium (BEGe) detector delivers sensitivity to low-energy gamma-rays such as those emitted
by 210Pb and 234Th. A Small Anode Germanium (SAGe) well-type detector is employed for efficient
screening of small samples. Finally, a standard p-type coaxial detector provides fast screening
of standard samples. This paper presents the steps used to characterise the performance of these
detectors for a variety of sample geometries, including the corrections applied to account for
cascade summing effects. For low-density materials, BUGS is able to radio-assay to specific activities
down to 3.6 mBq/kg for 234Th and 6.6 mBq/kg for 210Pb both of which have uncovered some significant
equilibrium breaks in the 238U chain. In denser materials, where gamma-ray self-absorption increases,
sensitivity is demonstrated to specific activities of 0.9 mBq/kg for 226Ra, 1.1 mBq/kg for 228 Ra,
0.3 mBq/kg for 224Ra, and 8.6 mBq/kg for 40K with all upper limits at a 90% confidence level. These
meet the requirements of most screening campaigns presently under way for rare-event search experiments,
such as the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter experiment. We also highlight the ability of the BEGe detector
to probe the X-ray fluorescence region which can be important to identify the presence of radioisotopes
associated with neutron production; this is of particular relevance in experiments sensitive
to nuclear recoils.
