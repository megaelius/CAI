In this paper, we present a unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method on unstructured mesh
for multiscale simulation of continuum and rarefied flow. Inheriting from the multicale transport
in the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), the integral solution of kinetic model equation is employed
in the construction of UGKWP method to model the flow physics in the cell size and time step scales.
A novel wave-particle adaptive formulation is introduced in the UGKWP method to describe the flow
dynamics in each control volume. The local gas evolution is constructed through the dynamical interaction
of the deterministic hydrodynamic wave and the stochastic kinetic particle. Within the resolution
of cell size and time step, the decomposition, interaction, and evolution of the hydrodynamic wave
and the kinetic particle depend on the ratio of the time step to the local particle collision time.
In the rarefied flow regime, the flow physics is mainly recovered by the discrete particles and the
UGKWP method performs as a stochastic particle method. In the continuum flow regime, the flow behavior
is solely followed by macroscopic variable evolution and the UGKWP method becomes a gas-kinetic
hydrodynamic flow solver for the viscous and heat-conducting Navier--Stokes solutions. In different
flow regimes, many numerical test cases are computed to validate the UGKWP method on unstructured
mesh. The UGKWP method can get the same UGKS solutions in all Knudsen regimes without the requirement
of the time step and mesh size being less than than the particle collision time and mean free path.
With an automatic wave-particle decomposition, the UGKWP method becomes very efficient. For example,
at Mach number 30 and Knudsen number 0.1, in comparison with UGKS several-order-of-magnitude reductions
in computational cost and memory requirement have been achieved by UGKWP.
