Bursts of gamma ray showers have been observed in coincidence with downward propagating negative
leaders in lightning flashes by the Telescope Array Surface Detector (TASD). The TASD is a 700~square
kilometer cosmic ray observatory located in southwestern Utah, U.S.A. In data collected between
2014 and 2016, correlated observations showing the structure and temporal development of three
shower-producing flashes were obtained with a 3D lightning mapping array, and electric field change
measurements were obtained for an additional seven flashes, in both cases co-located with the TASD.
National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) information was also used throughout. The showers
arrived in a sequence of 2--5 short-duration ($\le$10~$\mu$s) bursts over time intervals of several
hundred microseconds, and originated at an altitude of $\simeq$3--5 kilometers above ground level
during the first 1--2 ms of downward negative leader breakdown at the beginning of cloud-to-ground
lightning flashes. The shower footprints, associated waveforms and the effect of atmospheric
propagation indicate that the showers consist primarily of downward-beamed gamma radiation.
This has been supported by GEANT simulation studies, which indicate primary source fluxes of $\simeq$$10^{12}$--$10^{14}$
photons for $16^{\circ}$ half-angle beams. We conclude that the showers are terrestrial gamma-ray
flashes (TGFs), similar to those observed by satellites, but that the ground-based observations
are more representative of the temporal source activity and are also more sensitive than satellite
observations, which detect only the most powerful TGFs.
