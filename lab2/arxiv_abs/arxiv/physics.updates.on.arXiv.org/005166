Simulation models are an absolute necessity in the human and social sciences, which can only very
exceptionally use experimental science methods to construct their knowledge. Models enable the
simulation of social processes by replacing the complex interplay of individual and collective
actions and reactions with simpler mathematical or computer mechanisms, making it easier to understand
the relationships between the causes and the consequences of these interactions and to make predictions.
As the formalism of mathematical models offering analytical solutions is often not suitable for
representing social complexity, more and more agent-based computer models are being used. For
a long time, the limited computing capacities of computers have hampered programming models that
would take into account the interactions between large numbers of geographically located entities
(persons or territories). In principle, these models should inform the conditions for the emergence
of certain patterns defined at a macro-geographic level from the interactions occurring at a micro-geographic
level, in systems whose behaviors are too complex to be understood directly by a human brain. Moreover,
it is also necessary to analyze the dynamic behavior of these models with nonlinear feedback effects
and verify that they produce plausible results at all stages of their simulation. This essential
work of exploring the dynamics of modeled systems remained in its infancy until the late 2010s. Since
then, algorithms combining more sophisticated methods, including genetic algorithms and the
use of distributed intensive computing, have made it possible to make a significant qualitative
leap forward in the exploration and validation of models. The result is an epistemological turn
for the human and social sciences, as indicated by the latest applications realized with the help
of the OpenMOLE platform presented here.
