We study the stability of two coexisting languages (Catalan and Spanish) in Catalonia (North-Eastern
Spain), a key European region in political and economic terms. Our analysis relies on recent, abundant
empirical data that is studied within an analytic model of population dynamics. This model contemplates
the possibilities of long-term language coexistence or extinction. We establish that the most
likely scenario is a sustained coexistence. The data needs to be interpreted under different circumstances,
some of them leading to the asymptotic extinction of one of the languages involved. We delimit the
cases in which this can happen. Asymptotic behavior is often unrealistic as a predictor for complex
social systems, hence we make an attempt at forecasting trends of speakers towards $2030$. These
also suggest sustained coexistence between both tongues, but some counterintuitive dynamics
are unveiled for extreme cases in which Catalan would be likely to lose an important fraction of speakers.
As an intermediate step, model parameters are obtained that convey relevant information about
the prestige and interlinguistic similarity of the tongues as perceived by the population. This
is the first time that these parameters are quantified rigorously for this couple of languages.
Remarkably, Spanish is found to have a larger prestige specially in areas which historically had
larger communities of Catalan monolingual speakers. Limited, spatially-segregated data allows
us to examine more fine grained dynamics, thus better addressing the likely coexistence or extinction.
Variation of the model parameters across regions are informative about how the two languages are
perceived in more urban or rural environments.
