The reduced speed of sound technique (RSST) has been used for efficient simulation of low Mach number
flows in solar and stellar convection zones. The basic RSST equations are hyperbolic, and are suitable
for parallel computation by domain decomposition. The application of RSST is limited to cases where
density perturbations are much smaller than the background density. In addition, non-conservative
variables are required to be evolved using this method, which is not suitable in cases where discontinuities
like shock waves co-exist in a single numerical domain. In this study, we suggest a new semi-conservative
formulation of the RSST that can be applied to low Mach number flows with large density variations.
We derive the wave speed of the original and newly suggested methods to clarify that these methods
can reduce the speed of sound without affecting the entropy wave. The equations are implemented
using the finite volume method. Several numerical tests are carried out to verify the suggested
methods. The analysis and numerical results show that the original RSST is not applicable when mass
density variations are large. In contrast, the newly suggested methods are found to be efficient
in such cases. We also suggest variants of the RSST that conserve momentum in the machine precision.
The newly suggested variants are formulated as semi-conservative equations, which reduce to the
conservative form of the Euler equations when the speed of sound is not reduced. This property is
advantageous when both high and low Mach number regions are included in the numerical domain. The
newly suggested forms of RSST can be applied to a wider range of low Mach number flows.
