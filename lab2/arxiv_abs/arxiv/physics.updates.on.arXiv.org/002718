The topology in different dimensions has attracted enormous interests, e.g. the Zak phase in 1D
systems, the Chern number in 2D systems and the Weyl points or nodal lines in the systems with higher
dimensions. It would be fantastic to find the connection of different topology in different dimensions
from one simple model and reveal the deep physical picture behind them. In this work, we propose a
new model which starts from a binary-layered 1D photonic crystal, and by introducing synthetic
dimensions the topology of higher dimension systems could appear. From this model, we find that
the topology of band gap and the Chern number of the 2D systems can be predicted by the parity-switching
types and the Zak phases of the 1D systems with spatial inversion symmetry(SIS), respectively.
The chiral edge state is confirmed by the winding number of the reflection phase in the topological
nontrivial gap. Different types of the topological transition in higher dimensions are found,
where two bands degenerated as Weyl point or nodal line. Surprisingly, we find that the topological
connection between different dimensions and the topological transition types in this model can
be explained by the evolving of two singularities which give rise to nonzero Zak phase of the 1D systems
with SIS. When transporting one singularity between adjacent bands, the Weyl point takes the role
as the instantaneous jumping channel of the singularity in the parameter space, and then both the
Zak phases of 1D systems with SIS and the Chern number of 2D systems are changed. While both singularities
moves to band-gap edges from two adjacent bands, they will merge into the nodal line. The theory for
such model is also constructed. We propose that such topology connection between different dimensions
could be quite universal for other systems.
