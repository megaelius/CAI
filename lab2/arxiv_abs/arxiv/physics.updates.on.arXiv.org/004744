The resolvent formulation of McKeon & Sharma (2010) is applied to supersonic turbulent boundary
layers to study the validity of Morkovin's hypothesis, which postulates that high-speed turbulence
structures in zero pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers remain largely the same as its
incompressible counterpart. Supersonic zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers
with adiabatic wall boundary conditions at Mach numbers ranging from 2 to 4 are considered. Resolvent
analysis highlights two distinct regions of the supersonic turbulent boundary layer in the wave
parameter space: the relatively supersonic region and the relatively subsonic region. In the relatively
supersonic region, where the flow is supersonic relative to the freestream, resolvent modes display
structures consistent with Mach wave radiation that are absent in the incompressible regime. In
the relatively subsonic region, we show that the low-rank approximation of the resolvent operator
is an effective approximation of the full system and that the response modes predicted by the model
exhibit universal and geometrically self-similar behaviour via a transformation given by the
semi-local scaling. Moreover, with the semi-local scaling, we show that the resolvent modes follow
the same scaling law as their incompressible counterparts in this region, which has implications
for modelling and the prediction of turbulent high-speed wall-bounded flows. We also show that
the thermodynamic variables exhibit similar mode shapes to the streamwise velocity modes, supporting
the strong Reynolds analogy. Finally, we demonstrate that the principal resolvent modes can be
used to capture the energy distribution between momentum and thermodynamic fluctuations.
