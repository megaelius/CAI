Adiabatic and inviscid axisymmetric perturbations to a stable reference vortex in gradient wind
balance have long been established to experience two kinds of restoring forces: one that is proportional
to both the perturbation density and the reference pressure gradient, and one that is purely radial
and proportional to the squared angular momentum perturbation. We show that the work required to
move a fluid parcel against such forces from its equilibrium to actual position is path-independent
and formally equivalent to the available energy accounting for momentum constraints previously
constructed by Andrews (2006) and Codoban and Shepherd (2006). Physically, this work represents
the energy of the unbalanced part of the vortex and hence a form of eddy energy. It can be partitioned
into available acoustic energy, slantwise available potential energy and centrifugal potential
energy; we show that the conditions required for these energies to be positive definite correspond
to the classical conditions for symmetric stability, valid for both small and finite amplitude
perturbations. The new available energy framework naturally defines thermodynamic and mechanical
efficiencies quantifying the fraction of the thermodynamic and mechanical sources/sinks of energy
affecting the balanced and unbalanced parts of the vortex, and clarifies how these are linked to
the forces driving the `adiabatic' secondary circulation; moreover, this framework has explicit
representations of most, if not all, physical ingredients underlying the various paradigms of
tropical cyclone (TC) intensification proposed so far, which should prove useful for unifying
theories of TC intensification in the future.
