The field of plasmonics exploits the interaction of light with nanoscale metallic structures to
confine, guide and manipulate light on scales below the diffraction limit, thereby greatly benefiting
applications such as quantum photonics, or short-distance optical communication. For example,
deep subwavelength plasmonic waveguides fabricated from closely spaced metal nanoparticles
have been proposed two decades ago, and were realized by electron beam lithography, a method which
is, however, non-scalable. Moreover, it is desirable to attain a more precise control over the metal
particle crystallinity, shape, size, positioning and interparticle spacing than that achievable
by lithography. Alternatively, plasmonic devices can be self-assembled, leveraging the programmability
and scalability of DNA nanotechnology, specifically the robust DNA origami method. Here, we demonstrate
energy propagation towards a fluorescent nanodiamond through a nanoparticle waveguide self-assembled
on a tubular DNA origami structure, and thus visually demonstrate the realization of nanometre-precise
light manipulation. High-resolution mapping by electron energy loss spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence
imaging spectroscopy reveal an efficient in-coupling, propagation and out-coupling of the energy
over a distance of 350 nm. Finite-difference time-domain simulations reveal that several plasmon
modes contribute to efficient waveguiding. In striking contrast to conventional lithographic
methods, the single crystalline and monodisperse plasmonic particles, as well as the precise interparticle
spacing are responsible for the performance of the plasmonic waveguide.
