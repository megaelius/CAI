Increasing vapor pressure deficit (VPD) increases atmospheric demand for water. While increased
evapotranspiration (ET) in response to increased atmospheric demand seems intuitive, plants
are capable of reducing ET in response to increased VPD by closing their stomata. We examine which
effect dominates the response to increasing VPD: atmospheric demand and increases in ET, or plant
response (stomata closure) and decreases in ET. We use Penman-Monteith, combined with semi-empirical
optimal stomatal regulation theory and underlying water use efficiency, to develop a theoretical
framework for assessing ET response to VPD. The theory suggests that depending on the environment
and plant characteristics, ET response to increasing VPD can vary from strongly decreasing to increasing,
highlighting the diversity of plant water regulation strategies. The ET response varies due to:
1) climate, with tropical and temperate climates more likely to exhibit a positive ET response to
increasing VPD than boreal and arctic climates; 2) photosynthesis strategy, with C3 plants more
likely to exhibit a positive ET response than C4 plants; and 3) plant type, with crops more likely
to exhibit a positive ET response, and shrubs and gymniosperm trees more likely to exhibit a negative
ET response. These results, derived from previous literature connecting plant parameters to plant
and climate characteristics, highlight the utility of our simplified framework for understanding
complex land atmosphere systems in terms of idealized scenarios in which ET responds to VPD only.
This response is otherwise challenging to assess in an environment where many processes co-evolve
together.
