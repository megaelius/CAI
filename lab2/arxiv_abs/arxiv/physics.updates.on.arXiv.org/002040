The Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) Safety Instrumented System (SIS) ensures personal safety and investment
protection. The development and implementation of the SIS are based on the international safety
standard for the process industry sector, IEC 61511. The SIS exhibits a distributed and hierarchical
organized architecture consisting of a central Safety System (cSS) on the top and many local Safety
Systems (lSS) at the bottom. Each technical component or diagnostic system potentially hazardous
for the staff or for the device is equipped with an lSS. The cSS is part of the central control system
of W7-X. Whereas the lSSs are responsible for the safety of each individual component, the cSS ensures
safety of the whole W7-X device. For every operation phase of the W7-X experiment hard- and software
updates for the SIS are mandatory. New components with additional lSS functionality and additional
safety signals have to be integrated. Already established safety functions must be adapted and
new safety functions have to be integrated into the cSS. Finally, the safety programs of the central
and local safety systems have to be verified for every development stage and validated against the
safety requirement specification. This contribution focuses on the application of a model based
simulation system for the whole SIS of W7-X. A brief introduction into the development process of
the SIS and its technical realization will be give followed by a description of the design and implementation
of the SIS simulation system using the framework SIMIT (Siemens). Finally, first application experiences
of this simulation system for the preparation of the SIS for the upcoming operation phase OP 1.2b
of W7-X will be discussed.
