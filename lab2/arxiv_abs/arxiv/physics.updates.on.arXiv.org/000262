Inflation supported by a real massless scalar inflaton field $\varphi$ whose potential is identically
equal to zero is described. Zero potential is concomitant with an initial condition for $\varphi$
that is exponentially more probable than an initial condition that assumes an initial inflaton
potential of order of the Planck mass. The Einstein gravitational field equations are formulated
on an eight-dimensional spacetime manifold of four space dimensions and four time dimensions.
The field equations are sourced by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the real massless scalar
inflaton field $\varphi$. Two solution classes for the coupled Einstein field equations are obtained
that exhibit temporal exponential \textbf{deflation of three of the four time dimensions} and
temporal exponential inflation of three of the four space dimensions. For brevity this phenomenon
is sometimes simply called "inflation". We show that \textbf{the extra time dimensions do not generally
induce exponentially rapid growth of fluctuations of the fields.} Comoving coordinates for the
two \textbf{unscaled} dimensions are chosen to be $(x^4, x^8)$ (unscaled means a constant scale
factor equal to one). The $x^4$ coordinate corresponds to our universe's observed physical time
dimension, while the $x^8$ coordinate corresponds to a new spatial dimension that may be compact.
$\partial_{x^8}$ terms of $\varphi$ and the metric are seen to play the role of an effective inflaton
potential in the dynamical field equations. In this model, after "inflation" the observable physical
macroscopic world appears to a classical observer to be a homogeneous, isotropic universe with
three space dimensions and one time dimension.
