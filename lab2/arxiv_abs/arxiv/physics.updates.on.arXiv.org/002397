We investigate the motion of heavy particles with a diameter of several multiples of the Kolmogorov
length scale in the presence of forced turbulence and gravity, resorting to interface-resolved
DNS based on an IBM. The values of the particles' relative density (1.5) and of the Galileo number
(180) are such that strong wake-induced particle clustering would occur in the absence of turbulence.
The forced turbulence in the two present cases (with Taylor-scale Reynolds number 95 and 140) would
lead to mild levels of clustering in the absence of gravity. Here we detect a tendency to cluster with
an intensity which is intermediate between these two limiting cases, meaning that forced background
turbulence decreases the level of clustering otherwise observed under ambient settling. However,
the clustering strength does not monotonously decay with the relative turbulence intensity. Various
mechanisms by which coherent structures can affect particle motion are discussed. It is argued
that the reduced interaction time due to particle settling through the surrounding eddy (crossing
trajectories) has the effect of shifting upwards the range of eddies with a time scale matching the
characteristic time scale of the particle. In the present cases this shift might bring the particles
into resonance with the energetic eddies of the turbulent spectrum. Concerning the average particle
settling velocity we find very small deviations from the value obtained for an isolated particle
in ambient fluid when defining the relative velocity as an apparent slip velocity (i.e. as the difference
between the averages computed separately for the velocities of each phase). This is consistent
with simple estimates of the non-linear drag effect. However, the relative velocity based upon
the fluid velocity seen by each particle has on average a smaller magnitude (by 5-7%) than the ambient
single-particle value.
