The LA Program at Oregon State University began in 2014 in one department as an effort to provide support
for the implementation of active learning in large enrollment Biology courses. Since its start,
the program has spread to include courses in five out of seven departments in the College of Science
and four out of six departments in the College of Engineering. At OSU, we identified specific course
logistics and educational goals in the College of Engineering and developed an adapted engineering
LA Program, which has a different recruiting procedure and pedagogy professional development
using a workshop model rather than requiring a pedagogy course. In this paper, we study characteristics
and rationale of the adapted Engineering LA Program and assessments of the desired learning outcomes
from this program. We collected survey data and qualitative data from a cohort of 50 engineering
LAs through an academic term, including program development documentation, observation notes
of 26 teaching sessions, weekly meetings, and training sessions, 15 in person interviews with LAs
and instructors, 52 responses of LA online weekly reflections, and 13 responses of LA online surveys.
Preliminary analysis shows that with LAs, the LA supported classes were better staffed and students
received more immediate and strategic feedback. LAs recognize that the experience helped them
solidify content knowledge, understand other perspectives, improve public speaking, better
communicate with people, develop teamwork skills, and learn to deal with complex social situations.
LAs also recognize how these skills transfer into professional engineering practice. Implications
for engineering educators are discussed.
