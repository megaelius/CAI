We analyse linear stability of interfacial waves in an idealised model of aluminium reduction cell
consisting of two stably stratified liquid layers which carry a vertical electric current in a collinear
external magnetic field. If the product of electric current and magnetic field exceeds a certain
critical threshold depending on the cell design, the electromagnetic coupling of gravity wave
modes can give rise to a self-amplifying rotating interfacial wave which is known as the metal pad
instability. Using the eigenvalue perturbation method, we show that, in the inviscid limit, rectangular
cells of horizontal aspect ratios $\alpha=\sqrt{m/n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are any two odd numbers,
can be destabilized by an infinitesimally weak electromagnetic interaction while cells of other
aspect ratios have finite instability thresholds. The unstable aspect ratios form an absolutely
discontinuous dense set of points which intersperse aspect ratios with finite stability thresholds.
This fractality of the instability threshold is confirmed by accurate numerical solution of the
linear stability problem. Although the instability threshold is gradually smoothed out by viscous
friction, the underlying structure, which is dominated by the major critical aspect ratios corresponding
to moderate values of $m$ and $n$, is well preserved up to relatively large dimensionless viscous
friction coefficients $\gamma$$\sim1$. With a small viscous friction, the most stable are cells
with $\alpha^{2}\approx2.13$ which have the highest stability threshold corresponding to the
electromagnetic interaction parameter $\beta\approx4.7$.
