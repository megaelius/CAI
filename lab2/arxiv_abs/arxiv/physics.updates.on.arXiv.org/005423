The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe, the dynamics of the supernovae
that produced the heavy elements necessary for life, and whether protons eventually decay -- these
mysteries at the forefront of particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early
evolution of our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. The Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE) is an international world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions
as it searches for leptonic charge-parity symmetry violation, stands ready to capture supernova
neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified theory underlying
the standard model. The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE physics
program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE liquid argon TPC far detector
modules. This TDR is intended to justify the technical choices for the far detector that flow down
from the high-level physics goals through requirements at all levels of the Project. Volume I contains
an executive summary that introduces the DUNE science program, the far detector and the strategy
for its modular designs, and the organization and management of the Project. The remainder of Volume
I provides more detail on the science program that drives the choice of detector technologies and
on the technologies themselves. It also introduces the designs for the DUNE near detector and the
DUNE computing model, for which DUNE is planning design reports. Volume II of this TDR describes
DUNE's physics program in detail. Volume III describes the technical coordination required for
the far detector design, construction, installation, and integration, and its organizational
structure. Volume IV describes the single-phase far detector technology. A planned Volume V will
describe the dual-phase technology.
