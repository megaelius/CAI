The second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) processes, such as the photogalvanic effect and second-order
harmonic generation (SHG), play crucial roles in probing and controlling light-matter interactions
for energy and device applications. To date, most studies of second-order NLO processes focus on
materials with broken spatial inversion symmetry, such as proper ferroelectrics and noncentrosymmetric
Weyl semimetals. Nevertheless, inversion symmetry of Shubnikov groups can be broken via spin-ordering
in centrosymmetric crystals. Unfortunately, these materials are less common, and their NLO responses
are usually weak. Combining quantum perturbation theory and first-principles simulations, we
predict a giant injection-current photogalvanic effect and SHG in a family of emerging axion insulators,
the even septuple layers of MnBi2Te4 (MBT) materials that exhibit the zero-plateau quantum anomalous
Hall (QAH) effect. Their amplitudes of injection current and SHG are about two orders of magnitude
larger than those of widely used ferroelectrics, such as BiFeO3 and LiNbO3. Moreover, unlike the
usual injection current observed under circularly-polarized light, the injection photocurrent
of MBTs only emerges under linearly polarized light, making it convenient for device applications.
These unique characters are from a combination effect of parity-time symmetry, three-fold rotation
symmetry, and significant spin-orbit coupling. These enhanced NLO effects are valuable for characterizing
subtle topological orders in QAH systems and also shed light on novel infrared photo-detector and
photovoltaic applications based on magnetic topological materials.
