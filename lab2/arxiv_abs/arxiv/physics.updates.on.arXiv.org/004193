Due to the fact that no study to date has shown the experimental validity of ACC-based measures of
body sway with respect to posturography for subjects with vestibular deficits, the aim of the present
study was: i) to develop and validate a practical tool that can allow clinicians to measure postural
sway derangements in an otoneurological setting by ACC, and ii) to provide reliable, sensitive
and accurate automatic analysis of sway that could help in discriminating unilateral vestibular
failure (UVF) patients. Thus, a group of 13 patients (seven females, 6 males; mean age 48.6 +/- 6.4
years) affected for at least 6 months by UVF and 13 matched healthy subjects were instructed to maintain
an upright position during a static forceplate-based posturography (FBP) acquisition while wearing
a Movit sensor (by Captiks) with 3-D accelerometers mounted on the posterior trunk near the body
centre of mass. Pearson product moment correlation demonstrated a high level of correspondence
of four time-domain and three frequency-domain measures extracted by ACC and FBP testing; in addition,
t-test demonstrated that two ACC-based time- and frequency-domain parameters were reliable measures
in discriminating UVF subjects. These aspects, overall, should further highlight the attention
of clinicians and researchers to this kind of sway recording technique in the field of otoneurological
disorders by considering the possibility to enrich the amount of quantitative and qualitative
information useful for discrimination, diagnosis and treatment of UVF. In conclusion, we believe
the present ACC-based measurement of sway offers a patient-friendly, reliable, inexpensive and
efficient alternative recording technique that is -- useful together with clinical balance and
mobility tests -- in various circumstances, as well as in outcome studies involving diagnosis,
follow-up and rehabilitation of UVF patients.
