The shear induced collective diffusivity in an emulsion of viscous drops, specifically as a function
of viscosity ratio, was numerically computed. An initially randomly packed layer of viscous drops
spreading due to drop-drop interactions in an imposed shear has been simulated. The shear induced
collective diffusivity coefficient was computed using a self-similar solution of the drop concentration
profile. We also obtained the collective diffusivity computing the dynamic structure factor from
the simulated drop positions--an analysis typically applied only to homogeneous systems. The
two quantities computed using different methods are in agreement including their predictions
of nonmonotonic variations with increasing capillary number and viscosity ratio. The computed
values were also found to match with past measurements. The gradient diffusivity coefficient computed
here was expectedly one order of magnitude larger than the self-diffusivity coefficient for a dilute
emulsion previously computed using pair-wise simulation of viscous drops. Although self-diffusivity
computed previously showed nonmonotonic variation with capillary number, its variation with
viscosity ratio is in contrast to nonmonotonic variation of gradient diffusivity found here. The
difference in variation could arise from drops not reaching equilibrium deformation between interactions--an
effect absent in the pair-wise simulation used for computation of self-diffusivity--or from an
intrinsic difference in physics underlying the two diffusivities. We offer a qualitative explanation
of the nonmonotonic variation by relating it to average nonmonotonic drop deformation. We also
provide empirical correlations of the collective diffusivity as a function of viscosity ratio
and capillary number.
