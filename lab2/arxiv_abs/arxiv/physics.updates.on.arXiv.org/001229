Taming the Terahertz waves (100 GHz-10 THz) is considered the next frontier in wireless communications.
While components for the ultra-high bandwidth Terahertz wireless communications were in rapid
development over the past several years, however, their commercial availability is still lacking.
Nevertheless, as we demonstrate in this paper, due to recent advances in the microwave and infrared
photonics hardware, it is now possible to assemble high performance hybrid THz communication systems
for real-life applications. As an example, in this work, we present design and performance evaluation
of the photonics-based Terahertz wireless communication system for the transmission of uncompressed
4K video feed that is built using all commercially available system components. In particular,
two independent tunable lasers operating in the infrared C-band are used as a source for generating
the Terahertz carrier wave using frequency difference generation in a photomixer. One of the IR
laser beams carries the data which is intensity modulated using the LiNbO3 electro-optic modulator.
A zero bias Schottky detector is used as the detector and demodulator of the data stream followed
by the high-gain and low-noise pre-amplifier. The Terahertz carrier frequency is fixed at 138 GHz
and the system is characterized by measuring the bit error rate for the pseudo random bit sequences
at 5.5 Gbps. By optimizing the link geometry and decision parameters, an error-free (BER<10-10)
transmission at a link distance of 1m is achieved. Finally, we detail integration of a professional
4K camera into the THz communication link, and demonstrate live streaming of the uncompressed HD
and 4K video followed by analysis of the link quality.
