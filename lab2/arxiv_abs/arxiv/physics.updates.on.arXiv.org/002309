A response theory was developed to describe a small-scale many-electron system within the neighborhood
of a nanostructure radiating longitudinal and transverse electric fields, essentially the full
degrees of freedom of the scalar and vector potentials (SP and VP). The coexistence of the SP and VP
incidents distinguishes such a near-field optical system from the ordinary optical system, and
is the motivation for equal treatment of both potentials as the cause of the response in the electron
system. Furthermore, the low symmetry of the system makes the electric and magnetic responses indistinguishable,
so it is essential to use a single susceptibility, instead of the ordinary two susceptibilities,
i.e., the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability. Therefore, the present theory
developed a single susceptibility relating the scalar and vector potentials (as the cause) to the
charge and current densities (as the result). The Heisenberg operators of both linear and nonlinear
single susceptibilities are systematically given in terms of functional derivatives of the action
integral with respect to the SP and VP, and proofs for charge conservation and gauge invariance are
given in a general manner; this theory is free from gauge-fixing. To make the ground state bounded
in the non-perturbed system, it is essential to consider the quantum many electron effect (exchange-correlation
effect), and this is done by employing the fundamental idea of density functional theory, instead
of the ordinary unequal treatment of the SP and VP, i.e., remaking the SP into a Coulomb interaction
between electron charges.
