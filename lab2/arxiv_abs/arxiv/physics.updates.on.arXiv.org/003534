Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. Their genome is segmented
into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently.
Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection
of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary
drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite
to multipartite viral forms has been described in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of
infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary
pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism
might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed
to explain its ecological persistence. To disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the
rise and fixation of multipartitism, we investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics
and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different
forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover
that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of
ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. We find
that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages.
Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite
form, facilitated by homogeneous contacts among hosts. We conjecture that these features might
have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly
with the expansion of agricultural practices.
