A compartmental epidemic model is proposed to predict the Covid-19 virus spread. It considers:
both detected and undetected infected populations, medical quarantine and social sequestration,
release from sequestration, plus possible reinfection. The coefficients in the model are evaluated
by fitting to empirical data for eight US states: Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana,
New Jersey, New York State, and Texas. Together these states make up 43% of the US population; some
of these states appear to have handled their initial outbreaks well, while others appear to be emerging
hotspots. The evolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact and
recovery rates remain below 5%; however, not surprisingly, variations are larger in death rate,
reinfection rate, stay-at-home effect, and release rate from sequestration. The results reveal
that outbreaks may have been well underway in several states before first detected and that California
might have seen more than one influx of the pandemic. Our projections based on the current situation
indicate that Covid-19 will become endemic, spreading for more than two years. Should states fully
relax stay-at-home orders, most states may experience a secondary peak in 2021. If lockdowns had
been kept in place, the number of Covid-19 deaths so far could have been significantly lower in most
states that opened up. Additionally, our model predicts that decreasing contact rate by 10%, or
increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown compliance (from the current $\sim$
15% to $\sim$ 30%) will eradicate infections in the state of Texas within a year. Extending our fits
for all of the US states, we predict about 11 million total infections (including undetected), 8
million cumulative confirmed cases, and 630,000 cumulative deaths by November 1, 2020.
