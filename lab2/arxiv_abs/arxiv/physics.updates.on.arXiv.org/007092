The negatively charged silicon monovacancy $V_{Si}^-$ in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) is a spin-active
point defect that has the potential to act as a qubit or quantum memory in solid-state quantum computation
applications. Photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) can augment the optical emission of the $V_{Si}^-$,
yet fine-tuning the defect-cavity interaction remains challenging. We report on two post-fabrication
processes that result in enhancement of the $V_1^{'}$ optical emission from our 1-dimensional
PCCs, indicating improved coupling between the ensemble of silicon vacancies and the PCC. One process
involves below bandgap illumination at 785 nm and 532 nm wavelengths and above bandgap illumination
at 325 nm, carried out at times ranging from a few minutes to several hours. The other process is thermal
annealing at $100^o C$, carried out over 20 minutes. Every process except above bandgap irradiation
improves the defect-cavity coupling, manifested in augmented Purcell factor enhancement of the
$V_1^{'}$ zero phonon line at 77K. The below bandgap laser process is attributed to a modification
of charge states, changing the relative ratio of $V_{Si}^0$ (dark state) to $V_{Si}^-$ (bright
state), while the thermal annealing process may be explained by diffusion of carbon interstitials,
$C_i$, that subsequently recombine with other defects to create additional $V_{Si}^-$s. Above
bandgap radiation is proposed to initially convert $V_{Si}^{0}$ to $V_{Si}^-$, but also may lead
to diffusion of $V_{Si}^-$ away from the probe area, resulting in an irreversible reduction of the
optical signal. Observations of the PCC spectra allow insights into defect modifications and interactions
within a controlled, designated volume and indicate pathways to improve defect-cavity interactions.
