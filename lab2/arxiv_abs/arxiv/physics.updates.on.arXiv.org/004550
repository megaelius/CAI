The numerical integration method has been routinely used to produce global standard gravitational
models from satellite tracking measurements of CHAMP/GRACE types. It is implemented by solving
the differential equations of the partial derivatives of a satellite orbit with respect to the unknown
harmonic coefficients under the conditions of zero initial values. From the mathematical point
of view, satellite gravimetry from satellite tracking is the problem of estimating unknown parameters
in the Newton's nonlinear differential equations from satellite tracking measurements. We prove
that zero initial values for the partial derivatives are incorrect mathematically and not permitted
physically. The numerical integration method, as currently implemented and used in satellite
gravimetry and statistics, is groundless. We use three different methods to derive new local solutions
to the Newton's nonlinear governing differential equations of motion with a nominal reference
orbit. Bearing in mind that satellite orbits can now be tracked almost continuously at unprecedented
high accuracy, we propose the measurement-based perturbation theory and derive global uniformly
convergent solutions to the Newton's nonlinear governing differential equations of motion. Since
the solutions are global uniformly convergent, they are able to extract smallest possible gravitational
signals from modern and future satellite tracking measurements for global high-precision, high-resolution
gravitational models. By directly turning the nonlinear differential equations of satellite
motion into the nonlinear integral equations, we reformulate the links between satellite tracking
measurements and the global uniformly convergent solutions to the Newton's governing differential
equations as a condition adjustment model with equality constraints.
