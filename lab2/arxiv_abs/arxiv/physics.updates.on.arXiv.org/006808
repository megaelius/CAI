In coastal area, raw wastewater can be directly discharged in the sea during extreme rain events
or failure of the sewage network. The highly urbanized and touristic area of Nice is directly exposed
to this risk. In order to protect the bathing population and to apply the European regulation (DCE,
2000), Nice municipality has decided to work on a forecasting tool of transport and fate of fecal
bacterial indicators such as Escherichia Coli. This paper deals with the first step of this approach
which consists in developing a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation coupled with water
quality parameters. The model used is based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes's equations for
the calculation of the velocities and water depth (TELEMAC3D), and wave energy balance equation
to account for the wave induced current (TOMAWAC). Two field measurements were conducted on a real
wastewater pollution coming from a sewage pipe located at-38m depth. The first campaign has validated
the vertical diffusion of the effluent through the water column by the means of variable depth samples
and has stressed the hourly variability of sewage bacterial quality. Due to the lack of data regarding
this last point, the model could not be fully validated. The second campaign has been designed to
overcome this issue and to gather all the data needed to proceed to the validation of our hydro-ecological
simulation. The comparison of the field measurements and the simulations has successfully demonstrated
the accuracy of the model. But the uncertainty associated with the laboratory analysis (MPN) are
high, making the calibration and validation processes a complex task. Nevertheless, further research
needs to be done regarding the variability of microbial quality in order to develop an operational
tool allowing the forecast of bacterial pollution. The next step of this study will be to establish
the hourly variation of microbial quality in the wastewater during dry and raining periods.
