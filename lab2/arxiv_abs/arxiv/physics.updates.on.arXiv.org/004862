Low efficiency is the main drawback of many MEMS thermal energy harvesters. Recently, energy harvesting
micro-devices that operate using the pyroelectric effect gained attention due to their potential
superior performance. Operation of these devices is based on the cyclic motion of a pyroelectric
capacitor that operates between a high temperature and a low temperature reservoirs. In this paper,
we investigate the dynamics of oscillations of a pyroelectric capacitor self sustained by thermally
actuated bimetal micro-cantilevers, a topic which is so far under investigated. In addition to
highlighting key thermodynamic aspects of the operation, we explore conditions for self-sustained
oscillations and discuss the viability of operation at the mechanical resonance frequency. The
analysis is presented for a new design inspired by the device proposed in Refs.\cite{2011,2012},
where in contrast, our proposed design boasts the following features: The pyroelectric capacitor
remains parallel to the heat reservoirs, by virtue of its symmetric support by two bimetallic cantilever
beams; In addition, the cyclic operation of the device does not require physical contact, thus lowering
the risk of mechanical failure; To adjust the damping force imparted by the surrounding gas, the
thermal reservoirs are equipped with trenches. To study the dynamic operation of the device, we
developed a physically based reduced order, yet accurate, model that accounts for the heat transfer
between and within the different components, and for the various forces including the gas damping
force. The model is embedded within an optimization algorithm to produce optimal designs over the
range 26-38 C of temperature difference between the two reservoirs. The corresponding range of
harvested power density is 0.4-0.65 mW/cm2.
