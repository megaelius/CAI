Breaking the diffraction limit is always an appealing topic owing to the urge for a better imaging
resolution in almost all the areas. As an efficient solution, the superlens based on the plasmonic
effects can resonantly amplify evanescent waves, the lost treasure, and reach the subwavelength
resolution. However, the natural plasmonic materials, within their limited choices, usually
have inherently high loss and are only available from the infrared to visible wavelengths. In this
work, we demonstrate that arbitrary materials, even air, can be applied to enhance the evanescent
waves and build the superlens with low loss at desired frequency. The working mechanisms reside
in the dispersion-induced effective plasmons in a bounded waveguide structure, where materials
with only positive permittivity is used. By using the air as an effective plasmonic material in a
parallel-plate waveguide, the broadband enhancement of evanescent waves and the ability to beat
the diffraction limit are well verified at microwave frequency. As a specified realization, we
further constructed and experimentally investigate the more practicable hyperbolic metamaterials
(HMM) by stack of air and dielectric layers. The validity of HMM is verified by the directional propagation
and imaging with a measured resolution of 0.087 wavelength is the working wavelength). The proposed
mechanisms can break the conventional barriers of plasmons-based lens and bring new possibilities
in the superreolution imaging area. It also should be noted that the functionality of the proposed
method is obviously not limited to this particular imaging demonstration. More applications based
on the enhancing evanescent waves, such as ultrasensitive optical, spontaneous, light beam steering
can also be expected.
