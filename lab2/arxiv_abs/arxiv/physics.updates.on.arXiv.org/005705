This is the first paper of a series of our works on the self-similar orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck
(OAFP) equation and shows its accurate pre-collapse solution. At the late stage of relaxation evolution
of dense star clusters, standard stellar dynamics predicts that the clusters may evolve in a self-similar
fashion forming a collapsing core. However, the corresponding mathematical model, the self-similar
OAFP equation for distribution function of stars in isotropic star clusters, has never been solved
on the whole energy domain $(-1< E < 0)$. The existing works based on kinds of finite difference methods
provide solutions only on the truncated domain $-1< E<-0.2$. To broaden the range of the truncated
domain, the present work resorts to a (highly accurate- and efficient-) Gauss-Chebyshev pseudo-spectral
method. We provide a Chebyshev spectral solution, whose number of significant figures is four,
on the whole domain. Also, The solution can reduce to a semi-analytical form whose degrees of polynomials
are only eighteen holding three significant figures. We also provide the new eigenvalues; $c_{1}=9.0925\times10^{-4}$,
$c_{2}=1.1118\times10^{-4}$, $c_{3}=7.1975\times10^{-2}$ and $c_{4}=3.303\times10^{-2}$,
corresponding to the core collapse rate $\xi=3.64\times10^{-3}$, scaled escape energy $\chi_\text{esc}=13.881$
and power-law exponent $\alpha=2.2305$. Since the solution on the whole domain is unstable against
change in degree of Chebyshev polynomials, we show spectral solutions on truncated domains ( $-1<
E<E_\text{max}$, where $-0.35<E_\text{max}<-0.03$) to explain how to handle the instability.
By reformulating the OAFP equation in several ways, we improve the accuracy of the spectral solution
and reproduce an existing self-similar solution; we consider existing solutions have only one
significant figure at most.
