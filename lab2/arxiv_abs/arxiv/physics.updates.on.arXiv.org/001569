Experimental studies of microdosimetry in therapeutic ion beams have been performed using several
detectors. The differences among them lie on the shapes, the site sizes, and the material. Coin-shaped
solid-state detectors made of silicon or diamond with thickness varying from 0.3 to 10 microns,
as well as proportional counters with spherical and cylindrical sensitive volumes filled with
tissue-equivalent gas are the microdosimeters used in therapeutic proton and carbon-ion beams.
One goal of microdosimetry in the clinical environment is providing repeatable specification
of the radiation quality of the radiation field. A methodology should be developed to provide, independently
from the heterogeneous information collected with the different detectors, a detector-independent
specification of the radiation quality. Historically the specification of the radiation quality
is provided either, in terms of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) or in terms of lineal energy, y. First
this study focuses on identifying the correlation between the distributions of LET and the lineal
energy spectra as well as the correspondence between their mean values calculated in frequency
and in dose. The evaluation is based on the method of LET analysis described by Kellerer making the
adaptation to the peculiarities of the therapeutic ion-beam where the pristine irradiation is
unidirectional and made of a single type of mono-energetic ions. The second objective of this study
is to interpret the spectrum collected by a slab and estimate what the spectrum would be if it was collected
by a detector different in shape, material, or size. An example confirms the method starting from
the simulated lineal energy spectrum obtained for carbon ions in a slab detector of graphite and
converting it to the spectruma that would be obtained in the same radiation field for spherical,
cylindrical, and slab detector made of water.
