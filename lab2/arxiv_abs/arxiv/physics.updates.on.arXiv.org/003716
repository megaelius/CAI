A new method allows accurate detection of bursting periods in single-point velocity field records
is presented. Discrimination between bursting and bursting-free periods is made by locating the
two-fold elevation increase in the normalized 'instantaneous' TKE dissipation rate levels, calculated
using moving window averaging. Use of the record rms and average values for normalization eliminate
the need for definition of a flow specific threshold. This, potentially, makes the method universally
applicable for use across various flow fields, especially as it does not rely on resolving the bursts
generation mechanism. The method performance is examined using a field obtained dataset of buoyancy
driven turbulent boundary layer flow. The sensitivity of the method is examined and a recommendation
for an optimal set of parameters is provided. Spectral shapes of non-bursting periods show distinguished
similarity to those expected in canonical turbulence, while the bursting period spectral shapes
vary significantly. The statistical behavior of temperature fluctuations during bursting periods
was examined and revealed a significant fluctuations intensity decrease during bursts. Based
on this observation and additional processing, the bursting generation mechanism was identified
and verified by comparison with a well-known model. The new method presents the ability to examine
the bursting period generation mechanism based on statistical findings in the duration of bursts.
Examination of scalar variations, i.e. particulate matter and/or gaseous pollutant concentrations,
in connection with turbulent bursting periods can assist in further understanding of bursting
generation and scalar transfer processes.
