In solar energetic particle (SEP) events, the physical processes of both shock acceleration and
scattering during transport can cause energy-spectral indices to be correlated with enhancement
or suppression of element abundances versus mass-to-charge ratios A/Q. We observe correlations
for those "gradual" SEP events where shock waves accelerate ions from the ambient coronal plasma,
but there are no such correlations for "impulsive" SEP events produced by magnetic re-connection
in solar jets, where abundance enhancement in different events vary from (A/Q) powers of +2 to +8,
nor are there correlations when shock waves re-accelerate these residual impulsive ions. In these
latter events the abundances are determined separately, prior to the accelerated spectra. Events
with correlated spectra and abundances show a wide variety of interesting behavior that has not
been described previously. Small and moderate gradual SEP events, with relative abundances typically
depending approximately upon (A/Q)to the -1 and the spectra upon energy E to the -2.5, vary little
with time. Large SEP events show huge temporal variations skirting the correlation line; in one
case O spectra vary with time from E to the -1 to E to the -5 while abundances vary from (A/Q) to the +1
to (A/Q)to the -2 during the event. In very large events, streaming-limited transport through proton-generated
resonant Alfve'n waves flattens the spectra and enhances heavy ion abundances prior to local shock
passage, then steepens the spectra and reduces enhancements afterward, recapturing the typical
correlation. Systematic correlation of spectra and element abundances provide a new perspective
on the physics of SEP acceleration and transport.
