We present a novel partitioned iterative formulation for modeling of fluid-structure interaction
in two-phase flows. The variational formulation consists of a stable and robust integration of
three blocks of differential equations, viz., incompressible viscous fluid, a rigid or flexible
structure and two-phase indicator field. The fluid-fluid interface between the two phases, which
may have high density and viscosity ratios, is evolved by solving the conservative phase-field
Allen-Cahn equation in the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian coordinates. While the Navier-Stokes
equations are solved by a stabilized Petrov-Galerkin method, the conservative Allen-Chan phase-field
equation is discretized by the positivity preserving variational scheme. Fully decoupled implicit
solvers for the two-phase fluid and the structure are integrated by the nonlinear iterative force
correction in a staggered partitioned manner. We assess the accuracy and stability of the new phase-field/ALE
variational formulation for two- and three-dimensional problems involving the dynamical interaction
of rigid bodies with free-surface. We consider the decay test problems of increasing complexity,
namely free translational heave decay of a circular cylinder and free rotation of a rectangular
barge. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed formulation is stable and robust
for high density ratios across fluid-fluid interface and for low structure-to-fluid mass ratio
with strong added-mass effects. Using three-dimensional unstructured meshes, we demonstrate
the second-order temporal accuracy of the coupled phase-field/ALE method. Finally, we demonstrate
the three-dimensional phase-field FSI formulation for a practical problem of internal two-phase
flow in a flexible circular pipe subjected to vortex-induced vibrations due to external fluid flow.
