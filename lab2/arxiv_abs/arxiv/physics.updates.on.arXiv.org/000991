The possibility of hybridizing collective electronic motion with mid-infrared (mid-IR) light
to form surface polaritons has made van der Waals layered materials a versatile platform for extreme
light confinement and tailored nanophotonics. Graphene and its heterostructures have attracted
particular attention because the absence of an energy gap allows for plasmon polaritons to be continuously
tuned. Here, we introduce black phosphorus (BP) as a promising new material in surface polaritonics
that features key advantages for ultrafast switching. Unlike graphene, BP is a van der Waals bonded
semiconductor, which enables high-contrast interband excitation of electron-hole pairs by ultrashort
near-infrared (near-IR) pulses. We design a SiO$_2$/BP/SiO$_2$ heterostructure in which the
surface phonon modes of the SiO$_2$ layers hybridize with surface plasmon modes in BP that can be
activated by photo-induced interband excitation. Within the Reststrahlen band of SiO$_2$, the
hybrid interface polariton assumes surface-phonon-like properties, with a well-defined frequency
and momentum and excellent coherence. During the lifetime of the photogenerated electron-hole
plasma, coherent polariton waves can be launched by a broadband mid-IR pulse coupled to the tip of
a scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) setup. The scattered radiation
allows us to trace the new hybrid mode in time, energy, and space. We find that the surface mode can
be activated within ~50 fs and disappears within 5 ps, as the electron-hole pairs in BP recombine.
The excellent switching contrast and switching speed, the coherence properties, and the constant
wavelength of this transient mode make it a promising candidate for ultrafast nanophotonic devices.
