It has been shown repeatedly over a period of 50 years that the use of relativistic classical physics
and the inclusion of classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation leads to the Planck blackbody
spectrum for classical radiation equilibrium. However, none of this work involves scattering
calculations. In contrast to this work, currently accepted physical theory connects classical
physics to only the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Indeed, in the past, it has been shown that a nonlinear
classical oscillator (which is necessarily a nonrelativistic scattering system) achieves equilibrium
only for the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum where the random radiation present at the frequency of the
second harmonic of the oscillator motion has the same energy per normal mode as the radiation present
at the fundamental frequency. Here we continue work emphasizing the importance of relativistic
versus nonrelativistic analysis. We consider the scattering of random classical radiation by
a charged harmonic oscillator of small but non-zero oscillatory amplitude (which can be considered
as a relativistic scattering system) and show that detailed radiation balance holds not only at
the fundamental frequency of the oscillator but through the first harmonic corresponding to quadrupole
scattering, provided that the radiation energy per normal mode at the first harmonic is double the
radiation energy per normal mode at the fundamental frequency. This condition corresponds exactly
to the zero-point radiation spectrum which is linear in frequency. It is suggested that for this
relativistic scattering system, the detailed balance for zero-point radiation holds not only
for the fundamental and first harmonic but extends to all harmonics. Here we have the first example
of the detailed balance of zero-point radiation under relativistic scattering.
