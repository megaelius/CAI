From the first implementation in its purely hydrodynamic configuration, to the last configuration
under the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) system, several specific
modelling applications of the Regional Ocean Modelling Systems (ROMS, www.myroms.org) have been
put forward within the Adriatic Sea (Italy) region. Covering now a wide range of spatial and temporal
scales, they developed in a growing number of fields supporting Integrated Coastal Zone Management
(ICZM) and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) activities in this semi-enclosed sea of paramount importance
including the Gulf of Venice. Presently, a ROMS operational implementation provides every day
hydrodynamic and sea level 3-days forecasts, while a second one models the most relevant biogeochemical
properties, and a third one (two-way coupled with the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model)
deals with extreme waves forecast. Such operational models provide support to civil and environmental
protection activities (e.g., driving sub-models for oil-spill dispersion, storm surge, coastal
morphodynamic changes during storms, saline wedge intrusion along Po River), in a growing context
of stake-holders at regional, national and international level. Besides, ROMS and COAWST research
based activities are also carried out, mostly aiming at investigating sediment transport, eggs
and larvae dispersion, hypoxic events in the basin; through successive nesting very high resolutions
nearshore the Italian coast can be reached, allowing to simulate river mouth environments and artificial
reefs. Resulting outputs, written in NetCDF CF compliant format, are delivered via THREDDS Data
Server to a growing number of users around the world.
