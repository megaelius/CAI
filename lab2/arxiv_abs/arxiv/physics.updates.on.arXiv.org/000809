Van der Waals heterostuctures, made from stacks of two-dimensional materials are promising for
novel optoelectronic devices. The performance of such devices is governed by near-field coupling
through, e.g., interlayer charge and/or energy transfer. New concepts and experimental methodologies
are needed to properly describe atomically thin heterointerfaces. Here, we report an original
study of interlayer charge and energy transfer in single-layer graphene/single-layer molybdenum
diselenide (MoSe$_2$) heterostructures using a combination of micro-photoluminescence and
Raman scattering spectroscopies. The photoluminescence intensity in Gr/MoSe$_2$ is massively
quenched and rises linearly with the photon flux, demonstrating a drastically shortened ($\sim
1$~ps) room temperature exciton lifetime in MoSe$_2$. Key complementary insights are provided
from a comprehensive analysis of the graphene and MoSe$_2$ Raman modes, which reveals a net photoinduced
electron transfer from MoSe$_2$ to graphene and hole accumulation in MoSe$_2$. Remarkably, as
the photon flux increases, the steady state Fermi energy of graphene saturates at $290\pm 15$~meV
above the Dirac point. This reproducible behavior is observed both in ambient air and in vacuum and
is discussed in terms of intrinsic factors (i.e., band offsets) and environmental effects. In this
regime, balanced photoinduced flows of electrons and holes transfer to graphene, a mechanism that
can be assimilated to an energy transfer process. The absence of correlation between exciton dynamics
and the presence of a net charge transfer strongly suggests that non-radiative interlayer energy
transfer, either in the form of exciton transfer or balanced electron and hole transfer is the dominant
coupling mechanism between atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene.
