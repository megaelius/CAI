This article studies the fundamental problem of separating two adhesive elastic fibers based on
numerical simulation employing a recently developed finite element model for molecular interactions
between curved slender fibers. Specifically, it covers the two-sided peeling and pull-off process
starting from fibers contacting along its entire length to fully separated fibers including all
intermediate configurations and the well-known physical instability of snapping into contact
and snapping free. We analyze the resulting force-displacement curve showing a rich and highly
nonlinear system behavior arising from the interplay of adhesion, mechanical contact interaction
and structural resistance against (axial, shear and bending) deformation. While similar to one-sided
peeling studies from the literature, a distinct initiation and peeling phase can be observed, the
two-sided peeling setup considered in the present work reveals the extended final pull-off stage
as third characteristic phase. Moreover, the influence of different material and interaction
parameters such as Young's modulus as well as type (electrostatic or van der Waals) and strength
of adhesion is critically studied. Most importantly, it is found that the maximum force occurs in
the pull-off phase for electrostatic attraction, but in the initiation phase for van der Waals adhesion.
In addition to the physical system behavior, the most important numerical aspects required to simulate
this challenging computational problem in a robust and accurate manner are discussed. Thus, besides
the insights gained into the considered two-fiber system, this study provides a proof of concept
facilitating the application of the employed model to larger and increasingly complex systems
of slender fibers.
