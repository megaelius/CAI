Prior mathematical work of Constantin and Iyer (2008, 2011) has shown that incompressible Navier-Stokes
solutions possess infinitely-many stochastic Lagrangian conservation laws for vorticity, backward
in time, which generalize the invariants of Cauchy (1815) for smooth Euler solutions. We simplify
this theory for the case of wall-bounded flows by appealing to the Kuz'min (1983)-Oseledets (1989)
representation of Navier-Stokes dynamics, in terms of the vortex-momentum density associated
to a continuous distribution of infinitesimal vortex rings. The Constantin-Iyer theory provides
an exact representation for vorticity at any interior point as an average over stochastic vorticity
contributions transported from the wall. We discuss relations of this Lagrangian formulation
with the Eulerian theory of Lighthill (1963)-Morton (1984) for vorticity generation at solid walls,
and also with a statistical result of Taylor (1932)-Huggins (1994), which connects dissipative
drag with organized cross-stream motion of vorticity and which is closely analogous to the "Josephson-Anderson
relation" for quantum superfluids. We elaborate a Monte Carlo numerical Lagrangian scheme to calculate
the stochastic Cauchy invariants and their statistics, given the Eulerian space-time velocity
field. The method is validated using an online database of a turbulent channel-flow simulation
(Graham et al. 2016), where conservation of the mean Cauchy invariant is verified for two selected
buffer-layer events corresponding to an "ejection" and a "sweep". The variances of the stochastic
Cauchy invariants grow exponentially backward in time, however, confirming earlier observations
of Lagrangian chaos in channel-flow turbulence.
