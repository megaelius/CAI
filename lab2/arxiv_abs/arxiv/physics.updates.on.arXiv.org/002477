High power earth and orbital-based directed energy (DE) systems pose a potential hazard to Earth
orbiting spacecraft. The use of very high power large aperture DE systems to propel spacecraft is
being pursued as the only known method to achieve relativistic flight in our NASA Starlight and Breakthrough
Starshot programs. In addition, other beamed power mission scenarios, such as orbital debris removal
and our NASA program using DE for powering high performance ion engine missions, pose similar concerns.
It is critical to quantify the probability and rates of interception of the DE beam with the approximately
2000 active Earth orbiting spacecraft. We have modeled the interception of the beam with satellites
by using their orbital parameters and computing the likelihood of interception for many of the scenarios
of the proposed systems we are working on. We are able to simulate both the absolute interception
as well as the distance and angle from the beam to the spacecraft, and have modeled a number of scenarios
to obtain general probabilities. We have found that the probability of any active satellite, including
its orbital position uncertainty, intercepting our beam during any of our many mission scenarios
is extremely low ($\approx10^{-4}$). The outcome of this work gives us the ability to predict when
to energize the beam without intercept, as well as the capability to turn off the DE as needed for extended
mission scenarios. As additional satellites are launched, our work can be readily extended to accommodate
them by adding their orbital parameters to our database. Our work can also be used to predict intercept
of astronomical adaptive optics guide-star lasers as well as any general laser use.
