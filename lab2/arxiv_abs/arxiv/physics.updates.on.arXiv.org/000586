Riboswitches, RNA elements found in the untranslated region, regulate gene expression by binding
to target metaboloites with exquisite specificity. Binding of metabolites to the conserved aptamer
domain allosterically alters the conformation in the downstream expression platform. The fate
of gene expression is determined by the changes in the downstream RNA sequence. As the metabolite-dependent
cotranscriptional folding and unfolding dynamics of riboswitches is the key determinant of gene
expression, it is important to investigate both the thermodynamics and kinetics of riboswitches
both in the presence and absence of metabolite. Single molecule force experiments that decipher
the free energy landscape of riboswitches from their mechanical responses, theoretical and computational
studies have recently shed light on the distinct mechanism of folding dynamics in different classes
of riboswitches. Here we first discuss the dynamics of water around riboswitch, highlighting that
water dynamics can enhance the fluctuation of nucleic acid structure. To go beyond native state
fluctuations we used the Self-Organized Polymer (SOP) model to predict the dynamics of add adenine
riboswitch under mechanical forces. In addition to quantitatively predicting the folding landscape
of add-riboswitch our simulations also explain the difference in the dynamics between pbuE adenine-
and add adenine-riboswitches. In order to probe the function {\it in vivo} we use the folding landscape
to propose a system level kinetic network model to quantitatively predict how gene expression is
regulated for riboswitches that are under kinetic control.
