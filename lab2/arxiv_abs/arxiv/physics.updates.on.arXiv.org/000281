In the linear theory of hydrodynamic stability up to now there exist examples of flows for which there
is full quantitative distinction, as for cylindrical Hagen-Poiseuille (HP) flow in a pipe with
round section, between theory conclusions and experimental data on the threshold Reynolds number
Reth. In the present work, we show that to get a conclusion of linear instability of the HP flow for
finite Reynolds numbers Re, it is necessary to abandon the use of traditional 'normal' form of disturbances
which assumes an opportunity of separation of variables describing disturbances variability
depending on radial and longitudinal (along the pipe axis) coordinates. In the result of the absence
of such variables separation, in the suggested linear theory, it is proposed to use Bubnov-Galerkin's
approximation method modification that gives an opportunity to account longitudinal variability
periods distinctions for different radial modes defined a priori in the result of standard Galerkin-Cantorovich's
method to the equation of evolution of extremely small axially symmetric velocity field tangential
component disturbances. We found that when considering even two linearly interacting radial modes
for the HP flow, linear instability is possible only when there exists mentioned above conditionally
periodic longitudinal along the pipe axis disturbance variability when Re_th(p) very sensitively
depends on the ratio p of two longitudinal periods each of which describes longitudinal variability
for its own radial mode only. Obtained for the HP flow linear instability realization minimal value
Re_th=448 (when p=1.527) quantitatively agrees with the Tolmin-Shlihting waves in the boundary
layer emergence, where also Re_th=420. We get quantitative agreeing of the phase velocity values
of the considered disturbances with experimental data on the fronts of the turbulent 'puffs' spreading
in the pipe.
