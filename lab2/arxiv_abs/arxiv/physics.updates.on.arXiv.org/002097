The problem of simulating the interaction of a spacecraft travelling at velocities necessary for
starflight with the interplanetary and interstellar medium is considered. Interaction of neutral
gas and ions at kinetic energies relative to the spacecraft (MeV per nucleon) is essentially a problem
of sputtering, for which a wealth of experimental data exists at the velocities of interest. More
problematic is the impact of dust grains, macroscopic objects on the order of 10 nm to 1 $\mu$m, the
effects of which are difficult to calculate from first principles, and thus experiments are needed.
The maximum velocity of dust grains that can be achieved at present using electrostatic methods
is 100 km/s, two orders of magnitude below starflight velocities. The attainment of greater velocities
has been previously considered for impact fusion and was concluded to be technologically very challenging.
The reasons for this are explained in terms of field emission, which limits the charge-to-mass ratio
on the macroscopic particle being accelerated as well as the voltage potential gradient of the accelerating
electrostatic field, resulting in the accelerator needing to be hundreds to thousands of kilometers
long for $\mu$m-size grains. Use of circular accelerators (e.g., cyclotrons) is not practical
due to limitations on magnetic field strength making the accelerator thousands of kilometers in
size for $\mu$m-sized grains. Electromagnetic launchers have not been able to produce velocities
greater than conventional gas guns (< 10 km/s). The nearest feasible technologies (tandem accelerators)
to reach the regime of projectile mass and velocity of interest are reviewed. Pulsed laser facilities
are found to be the only facilities able to accelerate condensed phase matter to velocities approaching
1000 km/s, but are unlikely to be able to reach greater speeds.
