This thesis develops the theory of whispering gallery modes, exploring under what conditions a
micro or nanoscale device can sustain these resonances, and for which physical criteria the resonance
conditions deteriorate. The study is then extended to consider the biological cell in which modes
are definitively sustained without artificial assistance. The properties of resonators and their
emitted energy spectra are studied within the general framework of the Finite Difference Time Domain
method, requiring supercomputing resources to probe the transient behaviour and interactions
among the electromagnetic fields. The formal theory of Mie scattering is also extended to develop
a cutting-edge, computationally efficient model for general, multilayer microspheres, which
represents a valuable achievement for the scientific community in its own right. The model unifies
the approaches in the field of mathematical modelling to express the energy spectrum in a single
encompassing equation, which is then applied in a range of contexts. The gulf between modelling
and biological resonators is bridged by an in-depth study of the physical characteristics of a range
of biological cells, and the selection criteria for viable resonator candidates are developed
through a number of detailed feasibility studies. The bovine embryo is consequently selected as
the optimal choice for this investigation. Evidence is established for the ability of a bovine embryo
to sustain whispering gallery modes. The ability of a cell to sustain modes on its own represents
a conceptually elegant paradigm for new technologies involving on-site cell interrogation and
reporting of the status and health of a biological cell in the future. The methodological and technological
developments contained herein thus become a vital asset for the future realisation of autonomous
biological cell sensors.
