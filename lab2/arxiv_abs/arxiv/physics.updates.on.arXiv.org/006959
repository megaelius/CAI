During pandemic events, strategies such as social distancing can be fundamental to curb viral spreading.
Such actions can reduce the number of simultaneous infections and mitigate the disease spreading,
which is relevant to the risk of a healthcare system collapse. Although these strategies can be suggested,
their actual implementation may depend on the population perception of the disease risk. The current
COVID-19 crisis, for instance, is showing that some individuals are much more prone than others
to remain isolated, avoiding unnecessary contacts. With this motivation, we propose an epidemiological
SIR model that uses evolutionary game theory to take into account dynamic individual quarantine
strategies, intending to combine in a single process social strategies, individual risk perception,
and viral spreading. The disease spreads in a population whose agents can choose between self-isolation
and a lifestyle careless of any epidemic risk. The strategy adoption is individual and depends on
the perceived disease risk compared to the quarantine cost. The game payoff governs the strategy
adoption, while the epidemic process governs the agent's health state. At the same time, the infection
rate depends on the agent's strategy while the perceived disease risk depends on the fraction of
infected agents. Results show recurrent infection waves, which were seen in previous epidemic
scenarios with quarantine. Notably, the risk perception is found to be fundamental for controlling
the magnitude of the infection peak, while the final infection size is mainly dictated by the infection
rates. Low awareness leads to a single and strong infection peak, while a greater disease risk leads
to shorter, although more frequent, peaks. The proposed model spontaneously captures relevant
aspects of a pandemic event, highlighting the fundamental role of social strategies.
