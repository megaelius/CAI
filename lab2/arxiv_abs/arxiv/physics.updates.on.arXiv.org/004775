Atomistic modeling of energetic disorder in organic semiconductors (OSCs) and its effects on the
optoelectronic properties of OSCs requires a large number of excited-state electronic-structure
calculations, a computationally daunting task for many OSC applications. In this work, we advocate
the use of deep learning to address this challenge and demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep neural
networks (DNNs) are capable of predicting the electronic properties of OSCs at an accuracy comparable
with the quantum chemistry methods used for generating training data. We extensively investigate
the performances of four recent DNNs (deep tensor neural network, SchNet, message passing neural
network, and multilevel graph convolutional neural network) in predicting various electronic
properties of an important class of OSCs, i.e., oligothiophenes (OTs), including their HOMO and
LUMO energies, excited-state energies and associated transition dipole moments. We find that
SchNet shows the best performance for OTs of different sizes (from bithiophene to sexithiophene),
achieving average prediction errors in the range of 20-80meV compared to the results from (time-dependent)
density functional theory. We show that SchNet also consistently outperforms shallow feed-forward
neural networks, especially in difficult cases with large molecules or limited training data.
We further show that SchNet could predict the transition dipole moment accurately, a task previously
known to be difficult for feed-forward neural networks, and we ascribe the relatively large errors
in transition dipole prediction seen for some OT configurations to the charge-transfer character
of their excited states. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SchNet by modeling the UV-Vis
absorption spectra of OTs in dichloromethane and a good agreement is observed between the calculated
and experimental spectra.
