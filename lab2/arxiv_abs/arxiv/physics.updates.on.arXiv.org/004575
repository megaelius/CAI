We investigate the stability of katabatic slope flows over an infinitely wide and uniformly cooled
planar surface subject to an additional forcing due to a uniform downslope wind field aloft. We adopt
an extension of Prandtl's original model for slope flows (Lykosov & Gutman 1972) to derive the base
flow, which constitutes an interesting basic state in stability analysis because it cannot be reduced
to a single universal form independent of external parameters. We apply a linear modal analysis
to this basic state to demonstrate that for a fixed Prandtl number and slope angle, two independent
dimensionless parameters are sufficient to describe the flow stability. One of these parameters
is the stratification perturbation number that we have introduced in Xiao & Senocak (2019). The
second parameter, which we will henceforth designate the wind forcing number, is hitherto uncharted
and can be interpreted as the ratio of the kinetic energy of the ambient wind aloft to the damping due
to viscosity and stabilizing effect of the background stratification. For a fixed Prandtl number,
stationary transverse and travelling longitudinal modes of instabilities can emerge, depending
on the value of the slope angle and the aforementioned dimensionless numbers. The influence of ambient
wind forcing on the base flow's stability is complicated as the ambient wind can be both stabilizing
as well as destabilizing for a certain range of the parameters. Our results constitute a strong counter-evidence
against the current practice of relying solely on the gradient Richardson number to describe the
dynamic stability of stratified atmospheric slope flows.
