A fundamental understanding of the evaporation/condensation phenomena is vital to many fields
of science and engineering, yet there is much discrepancy in the usage of phase change models and
associated coefficients. First, a brief review of kinetic theory of phase change is provided, and
the mass accommodation coefficient (MAC, $\alpha$) and its inconsistent definitions are discussed.
The discussion focuses on the departure from equilibrium; represented as a macroscopic "drift"
velocity. Then a continuous flow, phase change driven molecular dynamics setup is used to investigate
steady state condensation at a flat liquid-vapor interface of argon at various phase change rates
and temperatures to elucidate the effect of equilibrium departure. MAC is computed directly from
the kinetic theory based Hertz-Knudsen (H-K) and Schrage (exact and approximate) expressions
without the need for a priori physical definitions, ad hoc particle injection/removal or particle
counting. MAC values determined from the approximate and exact Schrage expressions ($\alpha_{app}^{Schrage}$
and $\alpha_{exact}^{Schrage}$) are between 0.8 and 0.9, while MAC values from the H-K expression
($\alpha^{H-K}$) are above unity for all cases tested. $\alpha_{exact}^{Schrage}$ yields values
closest to the results from transition state theory [J Chem Phys, 118, 1392-1399 (2003)]. The departure
from equilibrium does not affect the value of $\alpha_{exact}^{Schrage}$ but causes $\alpha^{H-K}$
to vary drastically emphasizing the importance of a drift velocity correction. Additionally,
equilibrium departure causes a non-uniform distribution in vapor properties. At the condensing
interface, a local rise in vapor temperature and a drop in vapor density are observed when compared
with the corresponding bulk values.
