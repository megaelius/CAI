In the recent years, commercial HTS superconductors have gained an increasing interest for their
use in applications involving large-scale superconductor systems, these systems are made from
hundreds to thousands of turns of HTS conductors. These applications can range from power engineering
components like power transformers, motors and generators, to commercial and scientific magnets.
Due to the large number of turns, the simulations involving the whole system can become prohibitive
and an efficient strategy which does not compromise the accuracy of calculations is needed. A recently
proposed method, based on a multi-scale approach, reduces the computational problem by simulating
in detail only several significant tapes from the superconductor system under study. The main limitation
of this approach is encountered in the accurate estimation of the background magnetic field. In
the present work, we describe an iterative method that improves the multi-scale method to overcome
this limitation. Beginning with a uniform current density distribution in every tape, the method
iterates to find a more realistic distribution until a convergence criterion is fulfilled. The
current density distribution in the remaining tapes that are not fully simulated is approximated
via an inverse cumulative density function interpolation technique. The more realistic current
density distribution allows for a better estimation of the background magnetic field, which in
turn allows for a better estimation of the hysteresis losses. This new method is flexible enough
to simulate different sections of the system with the right level of detail while providing a larger
computational speed than other approaches. In order to validate the proposed method, one system
is analyzed via a reference model.
