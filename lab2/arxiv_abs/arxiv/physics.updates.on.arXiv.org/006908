Risk and response communication of public agencies through social media played a significant role
in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and such interactions were echoed in
other information outlets. This study collected time-sensitive online social media data and analyzed
such communication patterns from public health (WHO, CDC), emergency (FEMA), and transportation
(FDOT) agencies using data-driven methods. The scope of the work includes a detailed understanding
of how agencies communicate risk information through social media during a pandemic and influence
community response (i.e. timing of lockdown, timing of reopening) and disease outbreak indicators
(i.e. number of confirmed cases, number of deaths). The data includes Twitter interactions from
different agencies (2.15K tweets per agency on average) and crowdsourced data (i.e. Worldometer)
on COVID-19 cases and deaths were observed between February 21, 2020 and June 06, 2020. Several machine
learning techniques such as (i.e. topic mining and sentiment ratings over time) are applied here
to identify the dynamics of emergent topics during this unprecedented time. Temporal infographics
of the results captured the agency-levels variations over time in circulating information about
the importance of face covering, home quarantine, social distancing and contact tracing. In addition,
agencies showed differences in their discussions about community transmission, lack of personal
protective equipment, testing and medical supplies, use of tobacco, vaccine, mental health issues,
hospitalization, hurricane season, airports, construction work among others. Findings could
support more efficient transfer of risk and response information as communities shift to new normal
as well as in future pandemics.
