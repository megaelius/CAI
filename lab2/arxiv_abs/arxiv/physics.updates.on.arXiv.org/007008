Process-based hydrologic models allow to identify the behavior of a basin providing a mathematical
description of the hydrologic processes underlying the runoff mechanisms that govern the streamflow
generation. This study focuses on a macroscale application of the Variable Infiltration Capacity
(VIC) model over 31 headwater subwatersheds belonging to the Duero River Basin, located in the Iberian
Peninsula, through a three-part approach: (1) the calibration and validation of the VIC model for
all the subwatersheds; (2) an integrated sensitivity analysis concerning the soil parameters
chosen for the calibration, and (3) an assessment of equifinality and the efficiency of the calibration
algorithm. The calibration and validation processes showed good results for most of the subwatersheds
in a computationally efficient way using the Shuffled-Complex-Evolution algorithm. The sensitivity
measures were obtained with the Standardized Regression Coefficients method through a post-process
of the outputs of a Monte Carlo simulation carried out for 10 000 parameter samples for each subwatershed.
This allowed to quantify the sensitivity of the water balance components to the selected parameters
for the calibration and understanding the strong dependencies between them. The final assessment
of the equifinality hypothesis manifested that there are many parameter samples with performances
as good as the optimum, calculated using the calibration algorithm. For almost all the analyzed
subwatersheds the calibration algorithm resulted efficient, reaching the optimal fit. Both the
Monte Carlo simulation and the use of a calibration algorithm will be of interest for other feasible
applications of the VIC model in other river basins.
