Based on energetic particle observations made at $\approx$1 AU, we present a catalogue of 46 wide-longitude
(>45{\deg}) solar energetic particle (SEP) events detected at multiple locations during 2009-2016.
The particle kinetic energies of interest were chosen as >55 MeV for protons and 0.18-0.31 MeV for
electrons. We make use of proton data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Energetic and
Relativistic Nuclei and Electron experiment (SOHO/ERNE) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory/High Energy Telescopes (STEREO/HET), together with electron data from the Advanced
Composition Explorer/Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (ACE/EPAM) and the STEREO/Solar Electron
and Proton Telescopes (SEPT). We consider soft X-ray data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellites (GOES) and coronal mass ejection (CME) observations made with the SOHO/Large Angle
and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) and STEREO/Coronagraphs 1 and 2 (COR1, COR2) to establish
the probable associations between SEP events and the related solar phenomena. Event onset times
and peak intensities are determined; velocity dispersion analysis (VDA) and time-shifting analysis
(TSA) are performed for protons; TSA is performed for electrons. In our event sample, there is a tendency
for the highest peak intensities to occur when the observer is magnetically connected to solar regions
west of the flare. Our estimates for the mean event width, derived as the standard deviation of a Gaussian
curve modelling the SEP intensities (protons $\approx$44{\deg}, electrons $\approx$50{\deg}),
largely agree with previous results for lower-energy SEPs. SEP release times with respect to event
flares, as well as the event rise times, show no simple dependence on the observer's connection angle,
suggesting that...
