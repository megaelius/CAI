Determining the 3-dimensional crystallography of a material with sub-nanometre resolution is
essential to understanding strain effects in epitaxial thin films. A new scanning transmission
electron microscopy imaging technique is demonstrated that visualises the presence and strength
of atomic movements leading to a period doubling of the unit cell along the beam direction, using
the intensity in an extra Laue zone ring in the back focal plane recorded using a pixelated detector
method. This method is used together with conventional atomic resolution imaging in the plane perpendicular
to the beam direction to gain information about the 3D crystal structure in an epitaxial thin film
of LaFeO3 sandwiched between a substrate of (111) SrTiO3 and a top layer of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. It is
found that a hitherto unreported structure of LaFeO3 is formed under the unusual combination of
compressive strain and (111) growth, which is triclinic with a periodicity doubling from primitive
perovskite along one of the three <110> directions lying in the growth plane. This results from a
combination of La-site modulation along the beam direction, and modulation of oxygen positions
resulting from octahedral tilting. This transition to the period-doubled cell is suppressed near
both the substrate and near the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 top layer due to the clamping of the octahedral tilting
by the absence of tilting in the substrate and due to an incompatible tilt pattern being present in
the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 layer. This work shows a rapid and easy way of scanning for such transitions in
thin films or other systems where disorder-order transitions or domain structures may be present
and does not require the use of atomic resolution imaging, and could be done on any scanning TEM instrument
equipped with a suitable camera.
