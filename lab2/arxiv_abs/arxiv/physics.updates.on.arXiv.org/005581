A detailed computational analysis has been performed, considering copper atomic contacts that
are exposed directly to water molecules, hydroxyl groups, and monatomic as well as molecular hydrogen
and oxygen species. The optimized physical bonding structure, electrical conductance and inelastic
tunneling spectra (IETS) have been determined theoretically for moderately large structures
by performing appropriate ab-initio and semi-empirical calculations. By considering the aforementioned
properties, it has been possible to determine that some of the molecular bridging structures may
be regarded as being highly-probable outcomes, resulting from the exposure of copper electrodes
to the atomic/molecular contaminants. We specifically identify the conductance properties of
a variety of configurations including examples with very high and very low conductance values.
This is done in order to identify junction geometries that may be realized experimentally and their
conductance and IETS signatures. By reporting geometries with very high and very low conductance
values here, we intend to provide a wider perspective view than previous studies of copper-molecular
junctions that have focused on high conductance structures. In addition, we explore the properties
of metal junctions with multiple molecules, a class of systems for which little theoretical work
has been available in the molecular electronics literature. We find that water molecules surrounding
the junction can influence the bonding geometry of the molecules within the junction and consequently
can affect strongly the calculated conductances of such junctions.
