The morphology of the stagnated plasma resulting from Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF)
is measured by imaging the self-emission x-rays coming from the multi-keV plasma, and the evolution
of the imploding liner is measured by radiographs. Equivalent diagnostic response can be derived
from integrated rad-MHD simulations from programs such as Hydra and Gorgon. There have been only
limited quantitative ways to compare the image morphology, that is the texture, of simulations
and experiments. We have developed a metric of image morphology based on the Mallat Scattering Transformation
(MST), a transformation that has proved to be effective at distinguishing textures, sounds, and
written characters. This metric has demonstrated excellent performance in classifying ensembles
of synthetic stagnation images. We use this metric to quantitatively compare simulations to experimental
images, cross experimental images, and to estimate the parameters of the images with uncertainty
via a linear regression of the synthetic images to the parameters used to generate them. This coordinate
space has proved very adept at doing a sophisticated relative background subtraction in the MST
space. This was needed to compare the experimental self emission images to the rad-MHD simulation
images. We have also developed theory that connects the transformation to the causal dynamics of
physical systems. This has been done from the classical kinetic perspective and from the field theory
perspective, where the MST is the generalized Green's function, or S-matrix of the field theory
in the scale basis. From both perspectives the first order MST is the current state of the system,
and the second order MST are the transition rates from one state to another. An efficient, GPU accelerated,
Python implementation of the MST was developed. Future applications are discussed.
