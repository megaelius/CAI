Fueled by breakthrough technology developments, the biological, biomedical, and behavioral
sciences are now collecting more data than ever before. There is a critical need for time- and cost-efficient
strategies to analyze and interpret these data to advance human health. The recent rise of machine
learning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity data, and reveal correlations
between intertwined phenomena presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, classical
machine learning techniques often ignore the fundamental laws of physics and result in ill-posed
problems or non-physical solutions. Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate
multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain the emergence of function.
However, multiscale modeling alone often fails to efficiently combine large data sets from different
sources and different levels of resolution. We show how machine learning and multiscale modeling
can complement each other to create robust predictive models that integrate the underlying physics
to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design spaces. We critically review the current
literature, highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions, and discuss potential
challenges and limitations in four overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations,
partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and theory-driven approaches. Towards
these goals, we leverage expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational biology,
biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics, experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary
perspective suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling can provide new
insights into disease mechanisms, help identify new targets and treatment strategies, and inform
decision making for the benefit of human health.
