The propagation of detonation waves in reactive media bounded by an inert, compressible layer is
examined via computational simulations in two different geometries, axisymmetric cylinders
and two dimensional, planar slabs. For simplicity, an ideal gas equation of state is used with a pressure-dependent
reaction rate that results in a stable detonation wave structure. The detonation is initiated as
an ideal Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation with a one-dimensional structure, and then allowed to
propagate into a finite diameter or thickness layer of explosive surrounded by an inert layer. The
yielding confinement of the inert layer results in the detonation wave decaying to a sub-CJ steady
state velocity or failing entirely. Simulations are performed with different values of the reaction
rate pressure exponent (n = 2 and 3) and different impedance confinement (greater than, less than,
and equal to the confinement of the explosive). The velocity decrement and critical dimension (critical
diameter or thickness) are determined, and a 2:1 scaling between the cylinder diameter and slab
thickness results is confirmed, in good agreement with curvature-based models of detonation propagation.
The measured shock front curvature and detonation velocity relation agrees with the classic model
of Wood and Kirkwood. The computational simulations are compared to a simple, analytic model that
treats the interaction of the confinement with the detonation products via Newtonian theory and
a model that assumes a continuous variation in shock front curvature with the shock angle at the interface
with the confinement matching the angle determined by shock polar analysis. The Newtonian model
works very well for the case of high impedance confinement, while the shock front curvature model
agrees with the simulations for the case of low impedance confinement.
