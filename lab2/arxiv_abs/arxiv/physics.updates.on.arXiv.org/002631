Given the quasi-static nature of optical-field emission and the nontrivial dependence of the emission
rate on the instantaneous electric field strength, the CEP-sensitive component of the emitted
photocurrent is highly sensitive to the energy of the optical pulse, and should carry information
about the underlying sub-cycle dynamics of electron emission. Here we examine CEP-sensitive photoemission
from plasmonic gold nanoantennas excited with few-cycle optical pulses of increasing energy.
We observe antiresonance-like features in the CEP-sensitive photocurrent; specifically, at
a critical pulse energy, we observe a sharp dip in the magnitude of the CEP-sensitive photocurrent
accompanied by a sudden shift of {\pi}-radians in the phase of the photocurrent. Using a quasi-static
tunneling emission model, we find that these antiresonance-like features arise due to competition
between electron emission from neighboring optical half-cycles, and that they are highly sensitive
to the precise shape of the driving optical waveform at the surface of the emitter. As the underlying
mechanisms that produce the antiresonance-like features are a general consequence of nonlinear,
field-driven photoemission, the antiresonance-like features could be used to probe sub-optical-cycle,
sub-femtosecond emission processes, not only from solid-state emitters, but also from gas-phase
atoms and molecules. Beyond applications in the study of ultrafast, field-driven electron physics,
an understanding of these antiresonance-like features will be critical to the development of novel
photocathodes for future time-domain metrology and microscopy applications that demand both
attosecond temporal and nanometer spatial resolution.
