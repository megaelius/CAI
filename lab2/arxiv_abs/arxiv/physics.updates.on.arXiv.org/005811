Within national and international innovation systems a pandemic calls for large-scale action
by many actors across sectors, to mobilise resources, developing and manufacturing Crisis-Critical
Products (CC-Products) efficiently and in the huge quantities needed. Nowadays, this also includes
digital innovations from complex epidemiological models, AI, to open data platforms for prevention,
diagnostic and treatment. Amongst the many challenges during a pandemic, innovation and manufacturing
stakeholders find themselves engaged in new relationships, and are likely to face intellectual
property (IP) related challenges. This paper adopts an IP perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic
to identify pandemic related IP considerations and IP challenges. The focus is on challenges related
to research, development and urgent upscaling of capacity to manufacture CC-Products in the huge
volumes suddenly in demand. Its purpose is to provide a structure for steering clear of IP challenges
to avoid delays in fighting a pandemic. We identify 4 stakeholder groups concerned with IP challenges:
(i) governments, (ii) organisations owning existing Crisis-Critical IP, described as incumbents
in Crisis-Critical Sectors (CC-Sectors), (iii) manufacturing firms from other sectors normally
not producing CC-Products suddenly rushing into CC-Sectors to support the manufacturing of CC-Products
(new entrants), and (iv) voluntary grassroot initiatives that are formed during a pandemic. This
paper discusses IP challenges related to the development and manufacturing of technologies and
products for (i) prevention (of spread), (ii) diagnosis of infected patients and (iii) the development
of treatments. We offer an initial discussion of potential response measures to reduce IP associated
risks among industrial stakeholders during a pandemic.
