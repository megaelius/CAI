When illuminated by a laser, nano particles immersed in water can very quickly and strongly heat
up, leading to the nucleation of so called vapor bubbles, which have huge application potential
in e.g. solar light-harvesting, catalysis, and for medical applications.Whilst the long-time
behavior of such bubbles has been well-studied, here, by employing ultra-high-speed imaging,
we reveal the nucleation and early life phase of these bubbles. After some delay time after beginning
of the illumination, a giant bubble explosively grows, up to a maximal radius of 80 um, and collapses
again within 200 us (bubble life phase 1). The maximal bubble volume remarkably increases with decreasing
laser power P. To explain this behavior, we measure the delay time from the beginning of the illumination
up to nucleation,which drastically increases with decreasing laser power, leading to less total
dumped energy . This dumped energy E shows a universal linear scaling relation. This finding supports
that the initial giant bubble is a pure vapor bubble. In contrast, the delay time does depend on the
gas concentration of the water, as gas pockets in the water facilitate an earlier vapor bubble nucleation,
which leads to smaller delay times and lower bubble nucleation temperatures. After the collapse
of the initial giant bubbles, first much smaller oscillating bubbles form out of the remaining gas
nuclei (bubble life phase 2, up to typically 10 ms). Subsequently the known vaporization dominated
growth phase takes over and the bubble stabilizes (life phase 3). In the final life phase 4 the bubble
slowly grows by gas expelling due to heating of the surrounding. Our findings on the explosive growth
and collapse during the early life phase of a vapor bubble have strong bearings on possible applications
of such bubbles, affecting their risk assessment.
