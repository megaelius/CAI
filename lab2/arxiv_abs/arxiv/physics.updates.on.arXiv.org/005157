Today the gold standard for in vivo imaging through scattering tissue is the point-scanning two-photon
microscope (PSTPM). Especially in neuroscience, PSTPM is widely used for deep-tissue imaging
in the brain. However, due to sequential scanning, PSTPM is slow. Temporal focusing microscopy
(TFM), on the other hand, focuses femtosecond pulsed laser light temporally, while keeping wide-field
illumination, and is consequently much faster. However, due to the use of a camera detector, TFM
suffers from the scattering of emission photons. As a result, TFM produces images of poor spatial
resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), burying fluorescent signals from small structures
such as dendritic spines. In this work, we present a data-driven deep learning approach to improve
resolution and SNR of TFM images. Using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) we build a map from
TFM to PSTPM modalities, to enable fast TFM imaging while maintaining high-resolution through
scattering media. We demonstrate this approach for in vivo imaging of dendritic spines on pyramidal
neurons in the mouse visual cortex. We show that our trained network rapidly outputs high-resolution
images that recover biologically relevant features previously buried in the scattered fluorescence
in the TFM images. In vivo imaging that combines TFM and the proposed 3D convolution neural network
is one to two orders of magnitude faster than PSTPM but retains the high resolution and SNR necessary
to analyze small fluorescent structures. The proposed 3D convolution deep network could also be
potentially beneficial for improving the performance of many speed-demanding deep-tissue imaging
applications such as in vivo voltage imaging.
