Interactions between countries originate from diverse aspects such as geographic proximity,
trade, socio-cultural habits, language, religions, etc. Geopolitics studies the influence of
a country's geographic space on its political power and its relationships with other countries.
This work reveals the potential of Wikipedia mining for geopolitical study. Actually, Wikipedia
offers solid knowledge and strong correlations among countries by linking web pages together for
different types of information (e.g. economical, historical, political, and many others). The
major finding of this paper is to show that meaningful results on the influence of country ties can
be extracted from the hyperlinked structure of Wikipedia. We leverage a novel stochastic matrix
representation of Markov chains of complex directed networks called the reduced Google matrix
theory. For a selected small size set of nodes, the reduced Google matrix concentrates direct and
indirect links of the million-node sized Wikipedia network into a small Perron-Frobenius matrix
keeping the PageRank probabilities of the global Wikipedia network. We perform a novel sensitivity
analysis that leverages this reduced Google matrix to characterize the influence of relationships
between countries from the global network. We apply this analysis to two chosen sets of countries
(i.e. the set of 27 European Union countries and a set of 40 top worldwide countries). We show that
with our sensitivity analysis we can exhibit easily very meaningful information on geopolitics
from five different Wikipedia editions (English, Arabic, Russian, French and German).
