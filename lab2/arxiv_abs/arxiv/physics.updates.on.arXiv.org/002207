A new low-dimensional parameterization based on principal component analysis (PCA) and convolutional
neural networks (CNN) is developed to represent complex geological models. The CNN-PCA method
is inspired by recent developments in computer vision using deep learning. CNN-PCA can be viewed
as a generalization of an existing optimization-based PCA (O-PCA) method. Both CNN-PCA and O-PCA
entail post-processing a PCA model to better honor complex geological features. In CNN-PCA, rather
than use a histogram-based regularization as in O-PCA, a new regularization involving a set of metrics
for multipoint statistics is introduced. The metrics are based on summary statistics of the nonlinear
filter responses of geological models to a pre-trained deep CNN. In addition, in the CNN-PCA formulation
presented here, a convolutional neural network is trained as an explicit transform function that
can post-process PCA models quickly. CNN-PCA is shown to provide both unconditional and conditional
realizations that honor the geological features present in reference SGeMS geostatistical realizations
for a binary channelized system. Flow statistics obtained through simulation of random CNN-PCA
models closely match results for random SGeMS models for a demanding case in which O-PCA models lead
to significant discrepancies. Results for history matching are also presented. In this assessment
CNN-PCA is applied with derivative-free optimization, and a subspace randomized maximum likelihood
method is used to provide multiple posterior models. Data assimilation and significant uncertainty
reduction are achieved for existing wells, and physically reasonable predictions are also obtained
for new wells. Finally, the CNN-PCA method is extended to a more complex non-stationary bimodal
deltaic fan system, and is shown to provide high-quality realizations for this challenging example.
