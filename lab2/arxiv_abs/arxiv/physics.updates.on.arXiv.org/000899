We study the waves and wave-making forces acting on ships travelling on currents which vary as a function
of depth. Our concern is realism; we consider a real current profile from the Columbia River, and
model ships with dimensions and Froude numbers typical of three classes of vessels operating in
these waters. To this end we employ the most general theory of waves from free-surface sources on
shear current to date, which we derive and present here. Expressions are derived for ship waves which
satisfy an arbitrary dispersion relation and are generated by a wave source acting on the free surface,
with the source's shape and time-dependence is also being arbitrary. Practical calculation procedures
for numerically calculating dispersion on a shear current which may vary arbitrarily with depth
both in direction and magnitude, are indicated. For ships travelling at oblique angle to a shear-current,
the ship wave pattern is asymmetrical, and wave-making radiation forces have a lateral component
in addition to the conventional wave resistance, the sternward component. No corresponding lateral
force exists in the absence of shear. We consider the dependence of wave resistance and lateral force
for upstream, downstream and cross-stream motion on the Columbia River current, both in steady
motion and during two different maneouvres: a ship suddenly set in motion, and a ship turning through
360 deg. We find that for smaller ships (tugboats, fishing-boats) the wave resistance can differ
drastically from that in quiescent water, and depends strongly on Froude number and direction of
motion. For Froude numbers typical of such boats, wave resistance can vary by a factor 3 between upstream
and downstream motion, and the strong Froude number dependence is made more complicated by interference
effects. The lateral radiation force ... [abstract truncated due to ArXiV's space restrictions]
