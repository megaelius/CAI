The present work examines the role of instability and diffusive phenomena in controlling the limits
of detonations subject to lateral strain rates. Experiments were conducted in hydrocarbon-oxygen
mixtures with varying levels of cellular instability. These detonations were propagated in channels
with exponentially enlarging cross-sections, following the recent works of Radulescu \& Borzou
(2018) and Xiao \& Radulescu (2020). Steady detonation waves were obtained at the macro-scale,
with the near-limit reaction zone structures characterized by significant unreacted gas pockets.
The turbulent flame burning velocity of these pockets was evaluated to be 30 m/s to 70 m/s, which is
larger than the theoretical laminar value by a factor of 2 to 7. For all the mixtures tested, the characteristic
$D-K$ relationships, relating the detonation mean propagation speed with lateral flow divergence,
were obtained directly from experiments and as well from the generalized ZND model with lateral
strain rates using the detailed chemical kinetics. The results showed that the degree of departures
between experiments and the theoretical predictions increases significantly with the detonation
instability level. As compared to the laminar ZND wave, the more unstable detonations are much more
detonable than the more stable detonations, with substantially larger limiting divergence rates
and maximum velocity deficits. Such enhanced detonability with detonation instability can be
manifested in the significantly enhanced global rates of energy release with the notably suppressed
thermal character of ignition for the more unstable detonations. This globally enhanced burning
mechanism is found to be realized by the intensified auto-ignition assisted by the turbulent diffusive
burning of the unreacted gas pockets, substantially shortening the characteristic reaction zone
lengths.
