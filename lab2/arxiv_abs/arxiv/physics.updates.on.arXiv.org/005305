The flow above idealized, two-dimensional series of parallelepipedal buildings is examined with
the aim of investigating how the building width to height aspect ratio affects the turbulence in
the roughness sublayer and the ventilation of the underlying street canyons. We compare the case
of buildings with a squared section with a configuration with slender buildings both in the case
of unit canyon width to height aspect ratio and in the case of AR = 2. The former corresponds to skimming
flow and the latter to wake-interference regime. Measurements are performed in a water channel,
measuring velocity on a vertical mid-plane using a particle image velocimetry technique. The mean
flow, its second-order turbulence statistics, the exchange fluxes, and the integral time scales
investigated, with results showing that slender buildings enhance turbulence production and
yield longer integral time scales in the region just above the building roof. The combined analysis
of the turbulence production fields and the snapshots of the flow during sweep and ejection events
demonstrate that the shear layer between the canyon and the external flow is significantly more
unstable with slender buildings, mainly because the damping effect of the vertical velocity fluctuations
from the flat roof of the upwind building is substantially missing. Consequently, a larger (downstream)
portion of the interface is prone to the direct interaction of the external flow structures. The
higher turbulence intensity promotes the ventilation at the canyon interface. In summary, the
present experiments show that the effect of the reduced building aspect ratio is particularly significant
when the urban canopy consists of narrow canyons. The result is of interest since narrow street canyons
are typically bounded by slender buildings in the urban texture of the old European city centres.
