Ising computing provides a new computing paradigm for many hard combinatorial optimization problems.
Ising computing essentially tries to solve the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem,
which is also described by the Ising spin glass model and is also the basis for so-called Quantum Annealing
computers. In this work, we propose a novel General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) solver
for the balanced min-cut graph partitioning problem, which has many applications in the area of
design automation and others. Ising model solvers for the balanced min-cut partitioning problem
have been proposed in the past. However, they have rarely been demonstrated in existing quantum
computers for many meaningful problem sizes. One difficulty is the fact that the balancing constraint
in the balanced min-cut problem can result in a complete graph in the Ising model, which makes each
local update a global update. Such global update from each GPU thread will diminish the efficiency
of GPU computing, which favors many localized memory accesses for each thread. To mitigate this
problem, we propose an novel Global Decoupled Ising (GDI) model and the corresponding annealing
algorithm, in which the local update is still preserved to maintain the efficiency. As a result,
the new Ising solver essentially eliminates the need for the fully connected graph and will use a
more efficient method to track and update global balance without sacrificing cut quality. Experimental
results show that the proposed Ising-based min-cut partitioning method outperforms the state
of art partitioning tool, METIS, on G-set graph benchmarks in terms of partitioning quality with
similar CPU/GPU times.
