The theory of lithopanspermia proposes the natural exchange of organisms between solar system
bodies through meteorites. The focus of this theory comprises three distinct stages: planetary
ejection, interplanetary transit and planetary entry. However, it is debatable whether organisms
transported within the ejecta can survive all three stages. If the conjecture is granted, that life
can indeed be safely transmitted from one world to another, then it is not only a topic pertaining
to planetary science but also biological sciences. Hence, these stages are only the first three
factors of the equation. The other factors for successful lithopanspermia are the quality, quantity
and evolutionary strategy of the transmitted organisms. When expanding into new environments,
invading organisms often do not survive in the first attempt and usually require several attempts
through propagule pressure to obtain a foothold. There is a crucial difference between this terrestrial
situation and the one brought about by lithopanspermia. While invasive species on Earth repeatedly
enters a new habitat, a species pragmatically arrives on another solar system body only once; thus,
an all-or-nothing response will be in effect. The species must survive in the first attempt, which
limits the probability of survival. In addition, evolution sets a boundary through the existence
of an inverse proportionality between the exchanges of life between two worlds, thus further restricting
the probability of survival. However, terrestrial populations often encounter unpredictable
and variable environmental conditions, which in turn necessitates an evolutionary response.
Thus, one evolutionary mode in particular, bet hedging, is the evolutionary strategy that best
smooth out this inverse proportionality.
