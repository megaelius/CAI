We consider an array of dual-core waveguides, which represent an optical realization of a chain
of dimers, with an active (gain-loss) coupling between the cores, opposite signs of discrete diffraction
in the parallel arrays, and a phase-velocity mismatch between them (which is necessary for the stability
of the system). The array provides an optical emulation of the charge-parity ($\mathcal{CP}$)
symmetry. The addition of the intracore cubic nonlinearity gives rise to several species of fundamental
discrete solitons, which exist in continuous families, although the system is non-Hermitian.
The existence and stability of the soliton families are explored by means of analytical and numerical
methods. An asymptotic analysis is presented for the case of weak intersite coupling (i.e., near
the anticontinuum limit), as well as weak coupling between cores in each dimer. Several families
of fundamental discrete solitons are found in the semi-infinite gap of the system's spectrum, that
have no counterparts in the continuum limit, as well as a branch which belongs to the finite band gap
and carries over into a family of stable gap solitons in that limit. One branch develops an oscillatory
instability above a critical strength of the intersite coupling, others being stable in their entire
existence regions. Unlike solitons in conservative lattices, which are controlled solely by the
strength of the intersite coupling, here fundamental-soliton families have several control parameters,
one of which, viz., the coefficient of the intercore coupling in the active host medium, may be readily
adjusted in the experiment by varying the gain applied to the medium.
