The cyclic format of the undergraduate physics curriculum depends on students' ability to recall
and utilize material covered in prior courses in order to reliably build on that knowledge in later
courses. However, there is evidence to suggest that people often do not retain all, or even most,
of what they learned previously. How much information is retained appears to be dependent both on
the individuals' approach to learning as well as the style of instruction. In particular, there
is evidence to suggest that active engagement techniques in the classroom can improve students'
retention of the material over time. Here, we report the findings of a longitudinal investigation
of students' retention of conceptual understanding as measured by the Force and Motion Conceptual
Evaluation (FMCE) following a first-semester, calculus-based introductory physics course,
which features significant active engagement in both lecture and recitation. By administering
the FMCE at the end of a first-semester physics course and again at the beginning of the subsequent
second-semester physics course, we examine students' knowledge retention over time periods ranging
from 1-15 months. We find that the shift in students' FMCE scores between these two courses is positive
but corresponds to a small effect size, indicating that students retained effectively all of their
conceptual learning (as measured by the FMCE). This finding largely persists even as the length
of the gap between the two courses increases. We also find that, when breaking out students' performance
on individual questions, the majority of students maintain their score on individual questions.
Averaged over all questions, roughly a fifth of the students switched their answers from right to
wrong or wrong to right on any given item.
