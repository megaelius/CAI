In this Colloquium, the wavefunction-based Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree approaches
to the dynamics of indistinguishable particles (MCTDH-F for Fermions and MCTDH-B for Bosons) are
reviewed. MCTDH-B and MCTDH-F or, together, MCTDH-X are methods for describing correlated quantum
systems of identical particles by solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation from first
principles. MCTDH-X is used to accurately model the dynamics of real-world quantum many-body systems
in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The key feature of these approaches is the time-dependence
and optimization of the single-particle states employed for the construction of a many-body basis
set, which yields nonlinear working equations. We briefly describe the historical developments
that have lead to the formulation of the MCTDH-X methods and motivate the necessity for wavefunction-based
approaches. We sketch the derivation of the unified MCTDH-F and MCTDH-B equations of motion for
complete and also specific restricted configuration spaces. The strengths and limitations of
the MCTDH-X approach are assessed via benchmarks against an exactly solvable model and via convergence
checks. We highlight some applications to instructive and experimentally-realized quantum many-body
systems: the dynamics of atoms in Bose-Einstein condensates in magneto-optical and optical traps
and of electrons in atoms and molecules. We discuss the current development and frontiers in the
field of MCTDH-X: theories and numerical methods for indistinguishable particles, for mixtures
of multiple species of indistinguishable particles, the inclusion of nuclear motion for the nonadiabatic
dynamics of atomic and molecular systems, the so-called multilayer generalizations to the MCTDH-F
and MCTDH-B methods, and the time-dependent orbital-adaptive coupled cluster theory are discussed.
