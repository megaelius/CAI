Environmental contaminant exposure can pose significant risks to human health. Therefore, evaluating
the impact of this exposure is of great importance; however, it is often difficult because both the
molecular mechanism of disease and the mode of action of the contaminants are complex. We used network
biology techniques to quantitatively assess the impact of environmental contaminants on the human
interactome and diseases with a particular focus on seven major contaminant categories: persistent
organic pollutants (POPs), dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, perfluorochemicals
(PFCs), metals, and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). We integrated publicly
available data on toxicogenomics, the diseasome, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and gene
essentiality and found that a few contaminants were targeted to many genes, and a few genes were targeted
by many contaminants. The contaminant targets were hub proteins in the human PPI network, whereas
the target proteins in most categories did not contain abundant essential proteins. Generally,
contaminant targets and disease-associated proteins were closely associated with the PPI network,
and the closeness of the associations depended on the disease type and chemical category. Network
biology techniques were used to identify environmental contaminants with broad effects on the
human interactome and contaminant-sensitive biomarkers. Moreover, this method enabled us to
quantify the relationship between environmental contaminants and human diseases, which was supported
by epidemiological and experimental evidence. These methods and findings have facilitated the
elucidation of the complex relationship between environmental exposure and adverse health outcomes.
