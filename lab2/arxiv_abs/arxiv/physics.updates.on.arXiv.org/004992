Streamflow is a dynamical process that integrates water movement in space and time within basin
boundaries. The authors characterize the dynamics associated with streamflow time series data
from about seventy-one U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream-gauge stations in the state of Iowa.
They employ a novel approach called visibility graph (VG). It uses the concept of mapping time series
into complex networks to investigate the time evolutionary behavior of dynamical system. The authors
focus on a simple variant of VG algorithm called horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The tracking
of dynamics and hence, the predictability of streamflow processes, are carried out by extracting
two key pieces of information called characteristic exponent, {\lambda} of degree distribution
and global clustering coefficient, GC pertaining to HVG derived network. The authors use these
two measures to identify whether streamflow process has its origin in random or chaotic processes.
They show that the characterization of streamflow dynamics is sensitive to data attributes. Through
a systematic and comprehensive analysis, the authors illustrate that streamflow dynamics characterization
is sensitive to the normalization, and the time-scale of streamflow time-series. At daily scale,
streamflow at all stations used in the analysis, reveals randomness with strong spatial scale (basin
size) dependence. This has implications for predictability of streamflow and floods. The authors
demonstrate that dynamics transition through potentially chaotic to randomly correlated process
as the averaging time-scale increases. Finally, the temporal trends of {\lambda} and GC are statistically
significant at about 40% of the total number of stations analyzed. Attributing this trend to factors
such as changing climate or land use requires further research.
