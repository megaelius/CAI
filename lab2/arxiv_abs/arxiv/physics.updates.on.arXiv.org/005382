Multichannel imaging -- the ability to acquire images of an object through more than one imaging
mode simultaneously -- has opened interesting new perspectives in areas ranging from astronomy
to medicine. Visible optics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer complementary advantages
of resolution, speed and depth of penetration, and as such would be attractive in combination. In
this paper, we take first steps towards marrying together optical and MR imaging in a class of biocompatible
particulate materials constructed out of diamond. The particles are endowed with a high density
of quantum defects (Nitrogen Vacancy centers) that under optical excitation fluoresce brightly
in the visible, but also concurrently electron spin polarize. This allows the hyperpolarization
of lattice 13C nuclei to make the particles over three-orders of magnitude brighter than in conventional
MRI. Dual-mode optical and MR imaging permits immediate access to improvements in resolution and
signal-to-noise especially in scattering environments. We highlight additional benefits in
background-free imaging, demonstrating lock-in suppression by factors of 2 and 5 in optical and
MR domains respectively. Ultimate limits could approach as much as two orders of magnitude in each
domain. Finally, leveraging the ability of optical and MR imaging to simultaneously probe Fourier-reciprocal
domains (real and k-space), we elucidate the ability to employ hybrid sub-sampling in both conjugate
spaces to vastly accelerate dual-image acquisition, by as much as two orders of magnitude in practically
relevant sparse-imaging scenarios. This is accompanied by a reduction in optical power by the same
factor. Our work suggests interesting possibilities for the simultaneous optical and low-field
MR imaging of targeted diamond nanoparticles.
