A major remaining challenge for magnetic resonance-based attenuation correction methods (MRAC)
is their susceptibility to sources of MRI artifacts (e.g. implants, motion) as well as uncertainties
due to the limitations of MRI contrast (e.g. accurate bone delineation and density, and separation
of air/bone). We propose using a Bayesian deep convolutional neural network that, in addition to
generating an initial pseudo-CT from MR data, also produces uncertainty estimates of the pseudo-CT
in order to quantify the limitations of the MR data. These outputs are combined with an MLAA reconstruction
that uses the PET emission data to improve the attenuation maps. With the proposed approach (UpCT-MLAA),
we demonstrate accurate estimation of PET uptake in pelvic lesions and show robust recovery of metal
implants. Methods: Twenty-nine patients were scanned using an integrated 3 Tesla time-of-flight
PET/MRI system: of the twenty-nine, three patients had metal implants. A Bayesian deep convolutional
neural network was trained to transform Dixon MRI into pseudo-CT images and estimate regions of
uncertainty. The pseudo-CT prior and uncertainty estimates were used to guide the MLAA reconstruction,
updating only regions of high uncertainty. Results: In patients with metal implants, standard
MLAA was able to extract the attenuation coefficients of the metal implant; however, the anatomy
outside the implant region was heavily obscured by noise and cross-talk artifacts. ZeDD-CT was
able to estimate the attenuation coefficients in normal anatomy; however, the metal implant was
estimated to have attenuation coefficients of air due to the metal artifact appearing as a signal
void on the MRI. UpCT-MLAA successfully estimated the attenuation coefficients of the metal implants
while still providing qualitatively and quantitatively accurate anatomic depiction outside
of metal implant regions.
