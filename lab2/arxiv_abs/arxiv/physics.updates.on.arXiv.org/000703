Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method has been increasingly used for simulating fluid
flows, however its ability to simulate evaporating flow requires significant improvements. This
paper proposes an SPH method for evaporating multiphase flows. The present SPH method can simulate
the heat and mass transfers across the liquid-gas interfaces. The conservation equations of mass,
momentum and energy were reformulated based on SPH, then were used to govern the fluid flow and heat
transfer in both the liquid and gas phases. The continuity equation of the vapor species was employed
to simulate the vapor mass fraction in the gas phase. The vapor mass fraction at the interface was
predicted by the Clausius-Clapeyron correlation. A new evaporation rate was derived to predict
the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase at the interface. Because of the mass transfer
across the liquid-gas interface, the mass of an SPH particle was allowed to change. New particle
splitting and merging techniques were developed to avoid large mass difference between SPH particles
of the same phase. The proposed method was tested by simulating three problems, including the Stefan
problem, evaporation of a static drop, and evaporation of a drop impacting on a hot surface. For the
Stefan problem, the SPH results of the evaporation rate at the interface agreed well with the analytical
solution. For drop evaporation, the SPH result was compared with the result predicted by a level-set
method from literature. In the case of drop impact on a hot surface, the evolution of the shape of the
drop, temperature, and vapor mass fraction were predicted.
