We study the melting of a horizontal layer of a pure solid above a convecting layer of its fluid rotating
about the vertical axis using numerical methods. In the rapidly rotating regime, and for the Rayleigh
numbers of order $10^7$ considered here, convection takes the form of columnar vortices. Since
these vortices transport heat from the bottom surface to the upper boundary, the melt pattern reflects
the number and size of the columnar vortices, which in turn depend on the Prandtl, Reynolds, Rossby
and Stefan numbers of the system, and on whether we treat periodic or confined horizontal geometries.
The phase boundary can be highly ramified, reflecting the nature and number of heat transporting
vortices. Whereas the number of vortices and the melt regions they produce increase with Reynolds
number, the average area of each vortex decreases and hence so too does the average melt rate. In addition
to the Stefan number, the overall melt rate also depends on the velocity boundary condition on the
lower boundary. For large values of the latent heat of fusion, a quasi-steady geostrophic convective
state is reached in which the net vertical heat flux, or Nusselt number, reaches nearly constant
maximal values over long time intervals, so that the constant heat supplied at the base balances
the melt rate. Commensurate with this, we find that the interfacial roughness is also maximal, independent
of the flow parameters. The confluence of processes responsible for the range of phase boundary
geometries found should influence the treatment of moving boundary problems in mathematical models,
particularly those in astrophysical and geophysical problems where rotational effects are important.
