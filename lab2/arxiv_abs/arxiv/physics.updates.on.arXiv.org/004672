NIKA2 is a dual-band millimetric continuum camera of 2900 Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KID),
operating at $150$ and $260\,\rm{GHz}$, installed at the IRAM 30-meter telescope. We present the
performance assessment of NIKA2 after one year of observation using a dedicated point-source calibration
method, referred to as the \em{baseline} method. Using a large data set acquired between January
2017 and February 2018 that span the whole range of observing elevations and atmospheric conditions
encountered at the IRAM 30-m telescope, we test the stability of the performance parameters against
time evolution and observing conditions. We assess the robustness of the performance results using
the \em{baseline} method against systematic effects by comparing to results using alternative
methods. We report an instantaneous field of view (FOV) of 6.5' in diameter, filled with an average
fraction of $84\%$ and $90\%$ of valid detectors at $150$ and $260\,\rm{GHz}$, respectively. The
beam pattern is characterized by a FWHM of $17.6'' \pm 0.2''$ and $11.1''\pm 0.1''$, and a beam efficiency
of $77\% \pm 2\%$ and $55\% \pm 3\%$ at $150$ and $260\,\rm{GHz}$, respectively. The rms calibration
uncertainties are about $3\%$ at $150\,\rm{GHz}$ and $6\%$ at $260\,\rm{GHz}$. The absolute calibration
uncertainties are of $5\%$ and the systematic calibration uncertainties evaluated at the IRAM
30-m reference Winter observing conditions are below $1\%$ in both channels. The noise equivalent
flux density (NEFD) at $150$ and $260\,\rm{GHz}$ are of $9 \pm 1\, \rm{mJy}\cdot s^{1/2}$ and $30
\pm 3\, \rm{mJy}\cdot s^{1/2}$. This state-of-the-art performance confers NIKA2 with mapping
speeds of $1388 \pm 174$ and $111 \pm 11 \,\rm{arcmin}^2\cdot \rm{mJy}^{-2}\cdot \rm{h}^{-1}$
at $150$ and $260\,\rm{GHz}$.
