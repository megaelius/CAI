The effect of a thermal gradient parallel or anti-parallel to the the main flow direction of a pressure-driven
symmetric electrolyte in a slit-microchannel is investigated, specifically with respect to the
electrokinetic streaming potential. Based on the non-isothermal Nernst-Planck equations as
well as the Poisson equation, and under the assumption that the thermal mobility is the same for each
ion species, a correlation of the electric double layer (EDL) potential is derived. The result indicates
that the local EDL thickness increases (approximately) exponentially with temperature. Consequently,
a temperature gradient applied along a channel with a constant wall zeta-potential leads to a corresponding
gradient in the EDL thickness. Within the Debye-H\"uckel approximation, the Navier-Stokes equation
with the corresponding electric body force term is solved. Analytical expressions for the flow
profile and the streaming potential under non-isothermal conditions are derived. For higher zeta-potentials,
the results are compared with full numerical simulations. It is shown that for large pressure differences,
the non-isothermal streaming potential can be adequately described by the well known isothermal
expression if the local modification of the Debye length due to the thermal effect is taken into account.
For a small intrinsic Soret coefficient, the total streaming potential becomes linearly dependent
on the temperature difference. For small channel heights at small driving pressure differences,
the streaming potential is over-predicted (under-predicted) by the isothermal expression for
thermal gradients parallel (anti-parallel) to the main flow direction. For vanishing pressure
differences, a nonzero flow velocity and a steady-state thermoelectric potential are found, which
are shown to result from a confinement effect not previously discussed in the literature.
