Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is a key quantity for the description of radiobiological
effects induced by charged-particle irradiation in the context of ion-beam cancer therapy. Since
RBE is a complex function that depends on different physical, chemical and biological parameters,
a fundamental understanding of these effects becomes increasingly important for clinical applications.
The phenomenon-based MultiScale Approach to the physics of radiation damage with ions (MSA) provides
a tool for a molecular-level understanding of physical and chemical mechanisms of radiation biodamage
and allows to quantify macroscopic biological effects caused by ion irradiation. This study reports
the first application of the MSA for the analysis of RBE of ion beams. As a case study, we quantify the
response of human normal tissue cell lines to carbon-ion irradiation at different values of linear
energy transfer. RBE corresponding to different biological endpoints as well as other radiobiological
parameters, such as clonogenic cell survival as a function of dose and inactivation cross section,
are analyzed and compared with experimental data. Good agreement with an extensive data set emphasizes
the predictive power of the MSA. The method is also used to make predictions of RBE at high values of
LET where RBE decreases due to the "overkill" effect. In this regime, the dose needed to achieve a
given biological effect is deposited by a few ions. The fact that a given number of ions may produce
more damage than needed for a given effect leads to a significant (up to 20%) variation in RBE. This
effect should be taken into consideration in the analysis of experimental data on irradiation with
high-LET ions.
