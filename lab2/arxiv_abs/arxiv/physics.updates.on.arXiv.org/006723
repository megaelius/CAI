Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent and disruptive disease. Medical management
including nasal steroid sprays is the primary treatment modality. Computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) has been used to characterize sinonasal airflow and intranasal drug delivery; however, variation
in simulation methods indicates a need for large scale CFD model validation. Methods: Anatomic
reconstructions of pre and post-operative CT scans of 3 functional endoscopic sinus surgery patients
were created in Mimics(TM). Fluid analysis and drug particle deposition modeling were conducted
using CFD methods with Fluent(TM) in 18 cases. Models were 3D printed and in vitro studies were performed
using Tc99-labeled Nasacort(TM). Gamma scintigraphy signals and CFD-modeled spray mass were
post-processed in a superimposed grid and compared. Statistical analysis using overlap coefficients
(OCs) evaluated similarities between computational and experimental distributions and Kendall's
tau rank correlation coefficient was employed to test independence. Results: OCs revealed strong
agreement in percent deposition and grid profiles between CFD models and experimental results
(mean [range] for sagittal, axial, and coronal grids were 0.69 [0.57], 0.61 [0.49], and 0.78 [0.44],
respectively). Kendall's tau values showed strong agreement (average 0.73) between distributions,
which were statistically significant (p < 0.05) apart from a single coronal grid in one model and
two sagittal grids of another. Conclusions: CFD modeling demonstrates statistical agreement
with in vitro experimental results. This validation study is one of the largest of its kind and supports
the applicability of CFD in accurately modeling nasal spray drug delivery and using computational
methods to investigate means of improving clinical drug delivery.
