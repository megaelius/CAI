In this study, we evaluated the performance of the MODIS C6.1 AOD products and compared them with
the C6 products over regions in China with multifarious underlying surfaces during 2001 to 2016.
The AOD retrievals were validated against 20 AERONET sites, and the results show that the R for DT
retrievals in C6.1 is 0.946, while the fraction within the EE can be considered relatively low at
only 54.03%. DB retrievals in C6.1 have a slightly lower R value, but the other criteria are superior
to DT. Comparing the results over urban and vegetation areas in C6.1, the overall quality of the DB
retrievals is better than the DT retrievals in urban areas. The performance of DT is significantly
superior to DB in the LEV areas. For the HEV areas, DB performs synthetically better than DT. In the
spatial distribution aspect in C6.1, most of the DB AOD values are less than those of DT, and the relationship
between DT and DB varies with the different land cover types. For the AOD coverage in C6.1, DT retrievals
with high coverage mainly distribute in east-central China. However, the effects of high surface
reflectance lead to low AOD coverage in the southwest. In contrast, the AOD coverage of DB tends to
be high in areas where the main land cover type is bare soil and tends to be low in areas affected by snow.
In terms of the comparison between C6.1 and C6, the overestimation of DT over urban areas in C6 is effectively
mitigated in C6.1. However, a nearly systematic decline in DT is discovered in C6.1 as well. With
respect to DB, consistent AOD coverage distribution is observed, with only subtle distinction.
The AOD coverage of DB in C6.1 appears higher than that in C6 in the middle, south, and northeast of
China. The quality of the DB retrievals in C6.1 increases slightly compared to C6, and the most remarkable
improvement is observed for the coarse aerosol particles.
