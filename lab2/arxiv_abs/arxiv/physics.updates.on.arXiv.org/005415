Plasmon-exciton polaritons provide exciting possibilities to control light-matter interactions
at the nanoscale by enabling closer investigation of quantum optical effects and facilitating
novel technologies based, for instance, on Bose-Einstein condensation and polaritonic lasing.
Nevertheless, observing and visualising polaritons is challenging, and traditional optical
microscopy techniques often lead to ambiguities regarding the emergence and strength of the plasmon-exciton
coupling. Electron microscopy offers a more robust means to study and verify the nature of plexcitons,
but is still hindered by instrument limitations and resolution. A simple theoretical description
of electron beam-excited plexcitons is therefore vital to complement ongoing experimental efforts.
Here we apply analytic solutions for the electron-loss and photon-emission probabilities to evaluate
plasmon-exciton coupling studied either with the recently adopted technique of electron energy-loss
spectroscopy, or with the so-far unexplored in this context cathodoluminescence spectroscopy.
Foreseeing the necessity to account for quantum corrections in the plasmonic response, we extend
these solutions within the framework of general nonlocal hydrodynamic descriptions. As a specific
example we study core-shell spherical emitter-molecule hybrids, going beyond the standard local-response
approximation through the hydrodynamic Drude model for screening and the generalised nonlocal
optical response theory for nonlocal damping. We show that electron microscopies are extremely
powerful in describing the interaction of emitters with the otherwise weakly excited by optical
means higher-order plasmonic multipoles, a response that survives when quantum-informed models
are considered.
