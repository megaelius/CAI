The present paper addresses the numerical solution of turbulent flows with high-order discontinuous
Galerkin methods for discretizing the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The efficiency
of high-order methods when applied to under-resolved problems is an open issue in literature. This
topic is carefully investigated in the present work by the example of the 3D Taylor-Green vortex
problem. Our implementation is based on a generic high-performance framework for matrix-free
evaluation of finite element operators with one of the best realizations currently known. We present
a methodology to systematically analyze the efficiency of the incompressible Navier-Stokes solver
for high polynomial degrees. Due to the absence of optimal rates of convergence in the under-resolved
regime, our results reveal that demonstrating improved efficiency of high-order methods is a challenging
task and that optimal computational complexity of solvers, preconditioners, and matrix-free
implementations are necessary ingredients to achieve the goal of better solution quality at the
same computational costs already for a geometrically simple problem such as the Taylor-Green vortex.
Although the analysis is performed for a Cartesian geometry, our approach is generic and can be applied
to arbitrary geometries. We present excellent performance numbers on modern, cache-based computer
architectures achieving a throughput for operator evaluation of 3e8 up to 1e9 DoFs/sec on one Intel
Haswell node with 28 cores. Compared to performance results published within the last 5 years for
high-order DG discretizations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, our approach reduces
computational costs by more than one order of magnitude for the same setup.
