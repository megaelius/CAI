Solitons are shape preserving waveforms that are ubiquitous across nonlinear dynamical systems
and fall into two separate classes, that of bright solitons, formed in the anomalous group velocity
dispersion regime, and `dark solitons' in the normal dispersion regime. Both types of soliton have
been observed in BEC, hydrodynamics, polaritons, and mode locked lasers, but have been particularly
relevant to the generation of chipscale microresonator-based frequency combs (microcombs),
used in numerous system level applications in timing, spectroscopy, and communications. For microcombs,
both bright solitons, and alternatively dark pulses based on interlocking switching waves, have
been studied. Yet, the existence of localized dissipative structures that fit between this dichotomy
has been theoretically predicted, but proven experimentally elusive. Here we report the discovery
of dissipative structures that embody a hybrid between switching waves and dissipative solitons,
existing in the regime of (nearly) vanishing group velocity dispersion where third-order dispersion
is dominant, hence termed as `zero-dispersion solitons'. These dissipative structures are formed
via collapsing switching wave fronts, forming clusters of quantized solitonic sub-structures.
The switching waves are formed directly via synchronous pulse-driving of a photonic chip-based
Si3N4 microresonator. The resulting frequency comb spectrum is extremely broad in both the switching
wave and zero-dispersion soliton regime, reaching 136 THz or 97% of an octave. Fourth-order dispersion
engineering results in dual-dispersive wave formation, and a novel quasi-phase matched wave related
to Faraday instability. This exotic unanticipated dissipative structure expands the domain of
Kerr cavity physics to the regime near zero-dispersion and could present a superior alternative
to conventional solitons for broadband comb generation.
