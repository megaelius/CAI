We use magnetic field and particle data from the WIND spacecraft MFI and SWE instruments to study
the nature of the solar wind turbulence at ion-kinetic scales. We begin by making the first in-flight
measurement of the MFI 'noise-floor' using tail-lobe crossings of the Earth's magnetosphere during
early 2004. We then analyze the spectral properties of the magnetic field fluctuations between
0.1 and 5.5 Hz using an automated routine on a year of data from 2012 and our noise-floor estimate to
ensure the spectral features are physical. We utilize Taylor's hypothesis to Doppler-shift into
the spacecraft frequency frame, finding that the spectral break observed at these frequencies
is best associated with the proton-cyclotron resonance scale, $1/k_c$, compared to the proton
inertial length $d_i$ and proton gyroscale $\rho_i$. This agreement is strongest when we consider
periods where $\beta_{i,\perp}\sim1$, and is consistent with a spectral break at $d_i$ for $\beta_{i,\perp}\ll1$
and $\rho_i$ for $\beta_{i,\perp}\gg1$. We also find that the coherent magnetic helicity signature
observed at these frequencies is bounded at low frequencies by $1/k_c$ and its absolute value reaches
a maximum at $\rho_i$. These results hold in both slow and fast wind streams, but with a better correlation
in the more Alfv\'enic fast wind where the helicity signature is strongest. We conclude that proton-cyclotron
resonance is an important mechanism for dissipation of turbulent energy in the solar wind at ion-kinetic
scales, occurring at least half the time in our selected interval, although we do not rule out additional
mechanisms.
