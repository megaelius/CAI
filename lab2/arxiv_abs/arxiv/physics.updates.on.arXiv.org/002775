It is common knowledge that integral and differential cross sections (DCSs) are strongly dependent
on the spatial distribution of the molecular axis of the reactants. Hence, by controlling the axis
distribution, it is possible to either promote or hinder the yield of products into specific final
states or scattering angles. This idea has been successfully implemented in experiments by polarizing
the internuclear axis before the reaction takes place, either by manipulating the rotational angular
distribution or by Stark effect in the presence of an orienting field. When there is a dominant reaction
mechanism, characterized by a set of impact parameters and angles of attack, it is expected that
a preparation that helps the system to reach the transition state associated with that mechanism
will promote the reaction, whilst a different preparation would generally impair the reaction.
However, when two or more competing mechanisms via interference contribute to the reaction into
specific scattering angles and final states, it is not evident which would be the effect of changing
the axis preparation. To address this problem, throughout this article we have simulated the effect
that different experimental preparations have on the DCSs for the H + D2 reaction at relatively high
energies, for which it has been shown that several competing mechanisms give rise to interference
that shapes the DCS. To this aim, we have extended the formulation of the polarization dependent
DCS to calculate polarization dependent generalized deflection functions of ranks greater than
zero. Our results show that interference are very sensitive to changes in the internuclear axis
preparation, and that the shape of the DCS can be controlled exquisitely.
