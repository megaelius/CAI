Magnetic skyrmion, topologically non-trivial spin texture, has been considered as promising
information carrier in future electronic devices because of its nanoscale size, low depinning
current density and high motion velocity. Despite the broad interests in skyrmion racetrack memory,
researchers have been recently exploiting logic functions enabled by using the particle-like
behaviors of skyrmions. These functions can be applied to unconventional computing, such as stochastic
computing (SC), which treats data as probabilities and is superior to binary computing due to its
simplicity of logic operation. In this work, we demonstrate SC implemented by skyrmionic logic
devices. We propose a skyrmionic AND-OR logic device as a multiplier in the stochastic domain and
two skyrmionic multiplexer (MUX) logic devices as stochastic adders. With the assist of voltage
controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), the precise control of skyrmions collision is not required
in the skyrmionic AND-OR logic device, thus improving the operation robustness. In the two MUX logic
devices, skyrmions can be driven by Zhang-Li torque or spin orbit torque (SOT). Particularly, we
can flexibly regulate the skyrmion motion by VCMA or voltage controlled Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
Interaction (VCDMI) in the SOT case. Furthermore, 3-bit stochastic multiplier and adder are demonstrated
by micromagnetic simulations. In addition, simulations in synthetic antiferromagnets (SAF)
show that the performance of our skyrmionic logic gates can be optimized through advanced materials.
Our work opens up perspective to implement SC using skyrmionic logic devices.
