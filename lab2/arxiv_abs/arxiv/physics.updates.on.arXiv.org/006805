The controversy of computed tomography (CT) use in COVID-19 screening is associated with ambiguous
characteristics of chest CT as a diagnostic test. The reported values of CT sensitivity and specificity
calculated using RT-PCR as a reference standard vary widely. The objective of this study was to reevaluate
the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT using an alternative approach. This study included 973
symptomatic COVID-19 patients aged 42 $\pm$ 17 years, 56% females. We reviewed the disease dynamics
between the initial and follow-up CT studies using a "CT0-4" grading system. Sensitivity and specificity
were calculated as conditional probabilities that a patient's condition would improve or deteriorate
relative to the initial CT study results. For the calculation of negative (NPV) and positive (PPV)
predictive values, we estimated the COVID-19 prevalence in Moscow. We used several ARIMA and EST
models with different parameters to fit the data on total cases of COVID-19 from March 6, 2020, to
July 20, 2020, and forecast the incidence. The "CT0-4" grading scale demonstrated low sensitivity
(28%) but high specificity (95%). The best statistical model for describing the pandemic in Moscow
was ETS with multiplicative trend, error, and season type. According to our calculations, with
the predicted prevalence of 2.1%, the values of NPV and PPV would be 98% and 10%, correspondingly.
We associate the low sensitivity and PPV values with the small sample size of the patients with severe
symptoms and non-optimal methodological setup for measuring these specific characteristics.
The "CT0-4" grading scale was highly specific and predictive for identifying admissions to hospitals
of COVID-19 patients. Despite the ambiguous accuracy, chest CT proved to be an effective practical
tool for patient management during the pandemic, provided that the necessary infrastructure and
human resources are available.
