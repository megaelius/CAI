As the 21st century progresses, photovoltaic technology is becoming a major provider of the worlds
electricity, while effects of global climate change unfold. This development begs the question:
is climate change affecting the energy production of solar cells? In this article, we attempt to
answer this question looking backward and forward. We start by analyzing recent trends for global
meteorological conditions and solar cell performance parameters, covering the ten-year period
between 20016 and 2015. We leverage a field-verified performance model for two of the most well-established
solar cell technologies that also feature very different sensitivities to changing operating
conditions: silicon and cadmium telluride. We find that climate change has already left its mark:
ten years ago, silicon solar panels -- on average -- generated 4 kWh per m2 more power than today. Correlating
solar cell performance ratio changes and changes in operating conditions, we find that temperature
globally is the leading factor for silicon (-0.52 pm 0.03% per K), accounting for approx. 85% of the
observed effect. Water related light absorption in the atmosphere is most likely responsible for
much of the remaining contribution. To predict how future solar cell performance is affected, we
focus on the implications of raising temperatures. For the end of the 21st century, we project that
silicon PV panels globally will suffer performance reductions of between 0.7% and 2.5% (8 to 30 kWh
per kWp in North America), depending on the global warming scenario. These reductions will result
in significant socioeconomic penalties, particularly in a world that produces a significant portion
of its electricity from PV panels, and especially if additional effects of global warming, like
accelerated panel degradation and extreme weather are considered.
