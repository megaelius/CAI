The transport of heavy particles in a medium that consists of fluid and solid phases such as stream
gravel beds, cracked soils and wetlands is affected by processes such as attachment-detachment,
gravity and drag, and by mixing processes that are induced by Taylor dispersion and mechanical dispersion.
This paper addresses an additional dispersion mechanism which is induced by gravitational settling
and is a result of the coupling between the modified particle concentration (the change of particle
number density due to settling) and the lateral velocity profiles at the subscale. Heavy particles
that move in areas of low horizontal velocity (e.g., near solid surfaces and wake regions) settle
closer to the release source as compared to particles in high velocity regions. The macroscopic
concentration field of such suspensions is influenced by the ratio between the settling velocity
and the subscale distribution of the horizontal velocities. The objective of the study is to isolate
and quantify this type of dispersion using controlled flow scenarios. We used a Taylor brush geometry
(an array of vertical grooves) to numerically solve the flow. Particles were released from a vertical
plane, generating a constant flux. The subscale Eulerian concentration was compiled from simulated
trajectories and then spatially averaged to generate macroscopic concentration fields. The results
show that this settling-induced dispersion is significant in regions near the source and that it
cannot be modeled using Fick's law type of formulations. A parametric investigation shows that
the location of the highest dispersion flux is linearly proportional to both the groove spacing
and depth. A proposed model that estimates this location is used to evaluate where settling-induced
dispersion should not be ignored.
