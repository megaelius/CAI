We present the results of a proof-of-concept experiment which demonstrates that deep learning
can successfully be used for production-scale classification of compact star clusters detected
in HST UV-optical imaging of nearby spiral galaxies (D < 20 Mpc) in the PHANGS-HST survey. Given the
relatively small nature of existing, human-labelled star cluster samples, we transfer the knowledge
of state-of-the-art neural network models for real-object recognition to classify star clusters
candidates into four morphological classes. We perform a series of experiments to determine the
dependence of classification performance on: neural network architecture (ResNet18 and VGG19-BN);
training data sets curated by either a single expert or three astronomers; and the size of the images
used for training. We find that the overall classification accuracies are not significantly affected
by these choices. The networks are used to classify star cluster candidates in the PHANGS-HST galaxy
NGC 1559, which was not included in the training samples. The resulting prediction accuracies are
70%, 40%, 40-50%, 50-70% for class 1, 2, 3 star clusters, and class 4 non-clusters respectively.
This performance is competitive with consistency achieved in previously published human and automated
quantitative classification of star cluster candidate samples (70-80%, 40-50%, 40-50%, and 60-70%).
The methods introduced herein lay the foundations to automate classification for star clusters
at scale, and exhibit the need to prepare a standardized dataset of human-labelled star cluster
classifications, agreed upon by a full range of experts in the field, to further improve the performance
of the networks introduced in this study.
