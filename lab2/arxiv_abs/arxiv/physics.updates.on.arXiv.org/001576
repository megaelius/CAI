Bulk niobium is the material mostly used in RF superconducting cavities for accelerator. Predicting
and reducing the surface dissipation in RF is mandatory, since it has a tremendous cost impact on
most of the large accelerator projects. The theoretical approach of superconducting radiofrequency
(SRF) behavior has been far less explored than DC behavior and is still based on the description of
relatively simple systems, quite remote from the realistic material in use. Nevertheless, because
the actual crystalline substructure is not taken into account, it is still difficult to predict
surface dissipation accurately. Moreover, Niobium with its large lambda (~40 nm), exhibit an original
behavior compared to the usual superconductors used in applied superconductivity, and generalities
(e.g. pinning at grain boundaries) needs to be reconsidered. In this paper we hope to demonstrate
that sources of dissipation usually attributed to external causes (mainly flux trapping during
cooldown and hydrides precipitates) are related to the same type of crystalline defects which are
not grain boundaries; that they affect the local superconducting properties and can also be at the
source of early vortex penetration at the surface. We want also to stretch out how those defects can
explain some of the discrepancies observed from lab to lab on recent results obtained i.e. in doping
experiments. Understanding the origin and the role of these defects could provide indications
for updating specification as well as fabrication follow up. Rather than new results the author
wishes to present to the superconducting accelerators community the synthesis of multiple experimental
results scattered in the literature that provide a new lighting on recently published work, in particular
in the domain of SRF cavity doping as well as issues such as sensitivity to trapped flux during cooldown.
