In this paper we consider a physical system in which two DNA molecules braid about each other. The
distance between the two molecular ends, on either side of the braid, is held at a distance much larger
than supercoiling radius of the braid. The system is subjected to an external pulling force, and
a moment that induces the braiding. In a model, developed for understanding such a system, we assume
that each molecule can be divided into a braided and unbraided section. We also suppose that the DNA
is nicked so that there is no constraint of the individual linking numbers of the molecules. Included
in the model are steric and electrostatic interactions, thermal fluctuations of the braided and
unbraided sections of the molecule, as well as the constraint on the braid linking (catenation)
number. We compare two approximations used in estimating the free energy of the braided section.
One is where the amplitude of undulations of one molecule with respect to the other is determined
only by steric interactions. The other is a self-consistent determination of the mean squared amplitude
of these undulations. In this second approximation electrostatics should play an important role
in determining this quantity, as suggested by physical arguments. We see that if the electrostatic
interaction is sufficiently large there are indeed notable differences between the two approximations.
We go on to test the self-consistent approximation, included in the full model, against experimental
data, for such a system, and we find good agreement. However, there seems to by a slight left/right
handed braid asymmetry in some of the experimental results. We discuss what might be the origin of
this small asymmetry
