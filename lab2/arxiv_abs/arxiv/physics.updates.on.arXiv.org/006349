Vertical diamond Schottky diodes with blocking voltages $V_{\text{BD}} > 2.4 \text{ kV}$ and on-resistances
$R_{\text{On}} < 400 \text{ m}\Omega \text{cm}^{2}$ were fabricated on homoepitaxially grown
diamond layers with different surface morphologies. The morphology (smooth as-grown, hillock-rich,
polished) influences the Schottky barrier, the carrier transport properties, and consequently
the device performance. The smooth as-grown sample exhibited a low reverse current density $J_{\text{Rev}}
< 10^{-4} \text{ A}/\text{cm}^{2}$ for reverse voltages up to $2.2 \text{ kV}$. The hillock-rich
sample blocked similar voltages with a slight increase in the reverse current density ($J_{\text{Rev}}
< 10^{-3} \text{ A}/\text{cm}^{2}$). The calculated 1D-breakdown field, however, was reduced
by $30 \text{ } \%$, indicating a field enhancement induced by the inhomogeneous surface. The polished
sample demonstrated a similar breakdown voltage and reverse current density as the smooth as-grown
sample, suggesting that a polished surface can be suitable for device fabrication. However, a statistical
analysis of several diodes of each sample showed the importance of the substrate quality: A high
density of defects both reduces the feasible device area and increases the reverse current density.
In forward direction, the hillock-rich sample exhibited a secondary Schottky barrier, which could
be fitted with a modified thermionic emission model employing the Lambert W-function. Both polished
and smooth sample showed nearly ideal thermionic emission with ideality factors $1.08$ and $1.03$,
respectively. Compared with literature, all three diodes exhibit an improved Baliga Figure of
Merit for diamond Schottky diodes with $V_{\text{BD}} > 2 \text{ kV}$.
