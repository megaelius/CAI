Neurogenic Bladder Dysfunction has detrimental effects on day-to-day life of millions of people.
Some of the most common symptoms faced by these patients include urinary incontinence, urgency
and retention. Since elevated bladder pressure due to prolonged urine storage inside bladder may
have adverse impacts on patient's renal health, urologists recommend clean-intermittent catheterization
(CIC) every 2 to 4 hours throughout the day to relieve bladder pressure. However, since urine production
by kidneys is an intermittent process and most of these patients have limited mobility, such frequent
trips to washroom can prove to be challenging. Sometimes, bladder fills to capacity before the recommended
CIC time is reached causing embarrassing situation due to leakage. Hence, time-based CIC strategy
is difficult to implement and has high chances of failure. As such, continence is the primary concern
for most of these patients but sadly there are no practical solutions available in the market that
address this concern. A real-time notification system that could give feedback to patients on when
"bladder is almost-full" could help these patients to better plan their bathroom trips. This work
explores the feasibility of using a near infrared-light based wearable, non-invasive spectroscopy
technique that can sense amount of urine present inside the bladder and give details on developing
a bladder state estimation device. We present preliminary results by testing our device on optical
phantoms and performing ex vivo measurements on porcine bladder and intestines. We later explored
the possibility of using the device on human subjects, after study was approved by the UC Davis Institution
Review Board (IRB).
