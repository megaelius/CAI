The design of efficient electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting with minimal amount
of precious metal is crucial to attain renewable and sustainable energy conversion. Here, we report
the use of a network of CdSe branched colloidal nanocrystals, made of a CdSe core and eight CdSe pods
(so-called octapods), able to host on their pods Pt particles, and thus catalyzing water splitting
reactions. Thanks to the octapod shape, the resulting Pt-hosting network is mechanically trapped
onto carbon nanotube buckypaper, providing mechanically flexible and binder-free electrodes.
We found that such hierarchical configuration maximizes the mass activity and the utilization
efficiency of Pt for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At a potential of -0.15 V vs. reversible
hydrogen electrode, the Pt/octapod network-based electrodes display a Pt mass activity on the
HER of 166 A mg-1 and 42 A mg-1 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. These values correspond
to turnover frequencies of 168 s-1 and 42 s-1, respectively, which are in that order 14 and 21 times
higher compared to commercially available Pt/C benchmarks. The strong chemical and mechanical
interactions between the Pt and the octapod surface, along with pod-aided adhesion of the Pt/octapod
network to the buckypaper, result in a long-term durability (>20 h) of the HER-activity in both media.
These results experimentally prove that the exploitation of our network of branched nanocrystals
hosting Pt particles can circumvent the durability issues of the catalysts while adopting either
ultralow Pt loadings or benchmarking carbon-supported Pt nanocrystals. Our work opens up prospects
for using porous networks made by branched nanocrystals as catalysts with ultralow amount of noble
metals and controlled catalytic properties.
