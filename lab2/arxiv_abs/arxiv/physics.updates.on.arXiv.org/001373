The Soreq Applied Research Accelerator Facility (SARAF) is under construction in the Soreq Nuclear
Research Center at Yavne, Israel. When completed at the beginning of the next decade, SARAF will
be a user facility for basic and applied nuclear physics, based on a 40 MeV, 5 mA CW proton/deuteron
superconducting linear accelerator. Phase I of SARAF (SARAF-I, 4 MeV, 2 mA CW protons, 5 MeV 1 mA CW
deuterons) is already in operation, generating scientific results in several fields of interest.
The main ongoing program at SARAF-I is the production of 30 keV neutrons and measurement of Maxwellian
Averaged Cross Sections (MACS), important for the astrophysical s-process. The world leading
Maxwellian epithermal neutron yield at SARAF-I ($5\times 10^{10}$ epithermal neutrons/sec),
generated by a novel Liquid-Lithium Target (LiLiT), enables improved precision of known MACSs,
and new measurements of low-abundance and radioactive isotopes. Research plans for SARAF-II span
several disciplines: Precision studies of beyond-Standard-Model effects by trapping light exotic
radioisotopes, such as $^6$He, $^8$Li and $^{18,19,23}$Ne, in unprecedented amounts (including
meaningful studies already at SARAF-I); extended nuclear astrophysics research with higher energy
neutrons, including generation and studies of exotic neutron-rich isotopes relevant to the rapid
(r-) process; nuclear structure of exotic isotopes; high energy neutron cross sections for basic
nuclear physics and material science research, including neutron induced radiation damage; neutron
based imaging and therapy; and novel radiopharmaceuticals development and production. In this
paper we present a technical overview of SARAF-I and II, including a description of the accelerator
and its irradiation targets; a survey of existing research programs at SARAF-I; and the research
potential at the completed facility (SARAF-II).
