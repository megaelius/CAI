1-propanol (CH3CH2CH2OH) is a three carbon-bearing representative of primary linear alcohols
that may have its origin in the cold dark cores in interstellar space. To test this, we investigated
in the laboratory whether 1-propanol ice can be formed along pathways possibly relevant to the prestellar
core phase. We aim to show in a two-step approach that 1-propanol can be formed through reaction steps
that are expected to take place during the heavy CO freeze-out stage by adding C2H2 into the CO + H hydrogenation
network via the formation of propanal (CH3CH2CHO) as an intermediate and its subsequent hydrogenation.
Temperature programmed desorption-quadrupole mass spectrometry (TPD-QMS) is used to identify
the newly formed propanal and 1-propanol. Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS)
is used as a complementary diagnostic tool. The mechanisms that can contribute to the formation
of solid-state propanal and 1-propanol, as well as other organic compounds, during the heavy CO
freeze-out stage are constrained by both laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations.
Here it is shown that recombination of HCO radicals, formed upon CO hydrogenation, with radicals
formed upon C2H2 processing - H2CCH and H3CCH2 - offers possible reaction pathways to solid-state
propanal and 1-propanol formation. This extends the already important role of the CO hydrogenation
chain in the formation of larger COMs (complex organic molecules). The results are used to compare
with ALMA observations. The resulting 1-propanol:propanal ratio concludes an upper limit of <
0:35-0:55, which is complemented by computationally-derived activation barriers in addition
to the experimental results.
