In this work we show that the Dimensional Regularization obtained by Bollini and Giambiagi (Phys.
Lett. {\bf B 40}, 566 (1972), Il Nuovo Cim. {\bf B 12}, 20 (1972). Phys. Rev. {\bf D 53}, 5761 (1996))
can be defined for all Schwartz Tempered Distributions ( L. Schwartz : "Th\'eorie des distributions".
Hermann, Paris (1966)), Lorentz Invariant ${\cal S}^{'}_L$ For this purpose, we resort to a formula
obtained in [Int. J. of Theor. Phys. {\bf 43}, 1019 (2004)] and demonstrate the existence of the convolution
(in Minkowskian space) of such distributions. This is done by following a procedure similar to that
used so as to define a general convolution between the Ultradistributions of J. Sebastiao e Silva
[Math. Ann. {\bf 136}, 38 (1958)], also known as Ultrahyperfunctions, obtained by Bollini et al.
[Int. J. of Theor. Phys. {\bf 38}, 2315 (1999), {\bf 43}, 1019 (2004), {\bf 43}, 59 (2004),{\bf 46},
3030 (2007)]. Using the Inverse Fourier Transform we get the ring with zero divisors ${\cal S}^{'}_{LA}$,
defined as ${\cal S}^{'}_{LA}={\cal F}^{-1}\{{\cal S}^{'}_L\}$, where ${\cal F}^{-1}$ denotes
the Inverse Fourier Transform. In this manner we effect a dimensional regularization in momentum
space (the ring ${\cal S}^{'}_{L}$) via convolution, and a product of distributions in the corresponding
configuration space (the ring ${\cal S}^{'}_{LA})$. This generalizes the results obtained by
Bollini and Giambiagi for Euclidean space in [Phys. Rev. {\bf D 53}, 5761 (1996)]. We also provide
several examples of the application of our new results in Quantum Field Theory. In particular, the
convolution of $n$ massless Feynman propagators and the convolution of two massless Wheeler propagators
in Minkowskian space.
