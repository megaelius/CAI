During laser and ultrasound thermotherapy it is always desirable to have a precise necrosis of deeply
seated tumor preserving the adjoining healthy tissue with minimum thermally induced nociceptive
pain sensation to the patient. The aim of the present study is to determine the effects of nanoparticle
mixed tissues under pulsed and continuous heating during high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
and laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT). The present problem incorporating the tissue thermal
relaxation times ( ) was solved in a 3-dimensional multilayered vasculature breast tumor model
signifying the complex inhomogeneous tissue structure. The coupled Radiative transfer, Helmontz,
momentum, dual phase lag (DPL) and equilibrium equations for optic, acoustic, fluid, temperature
and mechanical fields respectively were solved simultaneously using COMSOL Multiphysics (Bangalore,
India) software. An in-vitro study on agar based tissue phantom was also performed to validate the
present numerical results of focused ultrasound heating. The thermal relaxation times of tissue
causes significant changes of thermal and damage history under focused ultrasound heating compared
to unfocused laser heating. With limited rise in tissue temperature, the pulsed mode of heating
for longer period with lower duty cycle (16.6%) shows a target specific necrotic damage with reduced
nociceptive pain in contrast to continuous mode of heating. Further, the presence of nanoparticles
and multilevel artery and vein affect both the thermal and mechanical response under external heating.
Thus, the present findings could help to understand the role of different external heating modes
and sources on tumor necrosis during clinical practice of thermo-therapy.
