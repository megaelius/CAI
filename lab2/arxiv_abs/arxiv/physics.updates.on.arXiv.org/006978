In this work, we propose a novel approach which combines ultrasound with Eulerian and Lagrangian
descriptors, to analyse blood flow dynamics and fluid transport in stenotic aortic models with
morphology, mechanical and optical properties close to those of real arteries. To this end, vorticity,
particle residence time (PRT), particle's final position (FP) and finite time Lyapunov's exponents
(FTLE) were computed from the experimental fluid velocity fields acquired using ultrasonic particle
imaging velocimetry (Echo-PIV). For the experiments, CT-images were used to create morphological
realistic models of the descending aorta with 0%, 35% and 50% occlusion degree with same mechanical
properties as real arteries. Each model was connected to a circuit with a pulsatile programmable
pump which mimics physiological flow and pressure conditions. The pulsatile frequency was set
to 0.9 Hz (55 bpm) and the upstream peak Reynolds number (Re) was changed from 1100 to 2000. Flow in
the post-stenotic region was composed of two main structures: a high velocity jet over the stenosis
throat and a recirculation region behind the stenosis where vortex form and shed. We characterized
vortex kinematics showing that vortex propagation velocity increases with Re. Moreover, from
the FTLE field we identified Lagrangian Coherent Structures (i.e. material barriers) that dictate
transport behind the stenosis. The size and strength of those barriers increased with Re and the
occlusion degree. Finally, from the PRT and FP, we showed that independently of Re, the same amount
of fluid remains on the stenosis over more than a pulsatile period, which combined with large FTLE
values may provide an alternative way to understand stenosis growth.
