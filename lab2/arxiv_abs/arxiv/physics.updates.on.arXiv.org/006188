The propagation and refraction of waves in dispersive media are considered. A primary objective
is to determine whether waves refract as monochromatic waves by Snell's law with phase velocity
or as wave packets. The refraction of wave packets requires two refraction laws. The wave packets
refract according to Snell's law with the geometric group velocity while the wavelets within the
wave packets refract according to Snell's law with phase velocity. The tests were performed using
directional power spectra from gravity water waves originating in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico,
Indian Ocean, and the Southern Ocean. In all cases the waves were measured with arrays of pressure
sensors. It was found that the refraction of monochromatic waves led to backtracks from a measurement
site that spread out for the different wave periods and did not go back to a common source. When the
refraction was large the results were especially bad. When the data were used to test the refraction
of wave packets very good results were obtained. For every storm considered the backtracks of the
different wave periods went back together to the wave generation area. These results offer strong
support for refracting waves in dispersive media as wave packets, not as monochromatic waves. This
result for wave groups was also determined in a controlled wave tank experiment of gravity water
waves where a critical angle was tested. The properties of propagating wave packets are also considered
and illustrated. Reflection points and critical angles are found and explained. There can be major
differences between the propagation of wave packets and monochromatic waves.
