Purpose: Double diffusion encoding (DDE) MRI enables the estimation of microscopic diffusion
anisotropy, yielding valuable information on tissue microstructure. A recent study proposed
that the acquisition of rotationally invariant DDE metrics, typically obtained using a spherical
"5-design", could be greatly simplified by assuming Gaussian diffusion, facilitating reduced
acquisition times that are more compatible with clinical settings. Here, we aim to validate the
new minimal acquisition scheme against the standard DDE 5-design, and to quantify the proposed
method's noise robustness to facilitate future clinical use. Methods: DDE MRI experiments were
performed on both ex vivo and in vivo rat brains at 9.4 T using the 5-design and the proposed minimal
design and taking into account the difference in the number of acquisitions. The ensuing microscopic
fractional anisotropy ({\mu}FA) maps were compared over a range of b-values up to 5000 s/mm2. Noise
robustness was studied using analytical calculations and numerical simulations. Results: The
minimal protocol quantified {\mu}FA at an accuracy comparable to the estimates obtained via the
more theoretically robust DDE 5-design. {\mu}FA's sensitivity to noise was found to strongly depend
on compartment anisotropy and tensor magnitude in a non-linear fashion. When {\mu}FA < 0.75 or when
mean diffusivity is particularly low, very high signal to noise ratio (SNR) is required for precise
quantification of {\mu}FA. Conclusion: Our work supports using DDE for quantifying microscopic
diffusion anisotropy in clinical settings but raises hitherto overlooked precision issues when
measuring {\mu}FA with DDE and typical clinical SNR.
