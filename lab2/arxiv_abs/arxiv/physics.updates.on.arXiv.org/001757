Because the grand unification theory of gauge theories of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions
is based on principal bundle theory, and gravitational theory is based on the tangent vector bundle
theory, so people cannot unify the these four basic interactions in principal bundle theory. This
Letter, for the first time, discovers and gives giant unification theory of the grand unification
theory and gravitation theory, i.e., the giant unification theory of strong, weak, electromagnetic
and gravitational interactions according to the general fiber bundle theory, symmetry, quantitative
causal principle (QCP) and so on. Consequently, the research of this Letter is based on the rigorous
scientific bases of mathematics and physics. The Lagrangians of the well-known fundamental physics
interactions are unifiedly deduced from QCP and satisfy the gauge invariant principle of general
gauge fields interacting with Fermion and/or boson fields. The geometry and physics meanings of
gauge invariant property of different physical systems are revealed, and it is discovered that
all the Lagrangians of the well-known fundamental physics interactions are composed of the invariant
quantities in corresponding spacetime structures. The difficulties that fundamental physics
interactions and Noether theorem are not able to be unifiedly given and investigated are overcome,
the unified description and origin of the fundamental physics interactions and Noether theorem
are shown by QCP, their two-order general Euler-Lagrange Equations and corresponding Noether
conservation currents are derived in general curved spacetime. Therefore, using the new unification
theory, a lot of research works about different branches of physics etc can be renewedly done and
expressed simpler with clear quantitative causal physical meanings.
