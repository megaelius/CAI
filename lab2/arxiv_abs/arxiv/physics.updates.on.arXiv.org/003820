Nudging is an important data assimilation technique where partial field measurements are used
to control the evolution of a dynamical system and/or to reconstruct the entire phase-space configuration
of the supplied flow. Here, we apply it to the toughest problem in fluid dynamics: three dimensional
homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. By doing numerical experiments we perform a systematic
assessment of how well the technique reconstructs large- and small-scales features of the flow
with respect to the quantity and the quality/type of data supplied to it. The types of data used are:
(i) field values on a fixed number of spatial locations (Eulerian nudging), (ii) Fourier coefficients
of the fields on a fixed range of wavenumbers (Fourier nudging), or (iii) field values along a set
of moving probes inside the flow (Lagrangian nudging). We present state-of-the-art quantitative
measurements of the scale-by-scale {\it transition to synchronization} and a detailed discussion
of the probability distribution function of the reconstruction error, by comparing the nudged
field and the {\it truth} point-by-point. Furthermore, we show that for more complex flow configurations,
like the case of anisotropic rotating turbulence, the presence of cyclonic and anticyclonic structures
leads to unexpectedly better performances of the algorithm. We discuss potential further applications
of nudging to a series of applied flow configurations, including the problem of field-reconstruction
in thermal Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and to the determination
of optimal parametrisation for small-scale turbulent modeling. Our study fixes the standard requirements
for future applications of nudging to complex turbulent flows.
