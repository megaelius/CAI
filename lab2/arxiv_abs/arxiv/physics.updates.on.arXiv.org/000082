Numerical simulation of multiphase compositional flow in fractured porous media, when all the
species can transfer between the phases, is a real challenge. Despite the broad applications in
hydrocarbon reservoir engineering and hydrology, a compositional numerical simulator for three-phase
flow in fractured media has not appeared in the literature, to the best of our knowledge. In this work,
we present a three-phase fully compositional simulator for fractured media, based on higher-order
finite element methods. To achieve computational efficiency, we invoke the cross-flow equilibrium
(CFE) concept between discrete fractures and a small neighborhood in the matrix blocks. We adopt
the mixed hybrid finite element (MHFE) method to approximate convective Darcy fluxes and the pressure
equation. This approach is the most natural choice for flow in fractured media. The mass balance
equations are discretized by the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which is perhaps the most
efficient approach to capture physical discontinuities in phase properties at the matrix-fracture
interfaces and at phase boundaries. In this work, we account for gravity and Fickian diffusion.
The modeling of capillary effects is discussed in a separate paper. We present the mathematical
framework, using the implicit-pressure-explicit-composition (IMPEC) scheme, which facilitates
rigorous thermodynamic stability analyses and the computation of phase behavior effects to account
for transfer of species between the phases. A deceptively simple CFL condition is implemented to
improve numerical stability and accuracy. We provide six numerical examples at both small and larger
scales and in two and three dimensions, to demonstrate powerful features of the formulation.
