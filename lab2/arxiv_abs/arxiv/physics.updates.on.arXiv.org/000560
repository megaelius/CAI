T Bayr and D Dommenget [J. Climate 26 (2013) 1387] proposed a model of temperature-driven air redistribution
to quantify the ratio between changes of sea level pressure $p_s$ and mean tropospheric temperature
$T_a$ in the tropics. This model assumes that the height of the tropical troposphere is isobaric.
Here problems with this model are identified. A revised relationship between $p_s$ and $T_a$ is
derived governed by two parameters -- the isobaric and isothermal heights -- rather than just one.
Further insight is provided by the model of R S Lindzen and S Nigam [J. Atmos. Sci. 44 (1987) 2418],
which was the first to use the concept of isobaric height to relate tropical $p_s$ to air temperature,
and did this by assuming that isobaric height is always around 3 km and isothermal height is likewise
near constant. Observational data, presented here, show that neither of these heights is spatially
universal nor do their mean values match previous assumptions. Analyses show that the ratio of the
long-term changes in $p_s$ and $T_a$ associated with land-sea temperature contrasts in a warming
climate -- the focus of Bayr and Dommenget [2013] -- is in fact determined by the corresponding ratio
of spatial differences in the annual mean $p_s$ and $T_a$. The latter ratio, reflecting lower pressure
at higher temperature in the tropics, is dominated by meridional pressure and temperature differences
rather than by land-sea contrasts. Considerations of isobaric heights are shown to be unable to
predict either spatial or temporal variation in $p_s$. As noted by Bayr and Dommenget [2013], the
role of moisture dynamics in generating sea level pressure variation remains in need of further
theoretical investigations.
