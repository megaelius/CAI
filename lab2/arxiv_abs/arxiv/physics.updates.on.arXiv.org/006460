Wind forcing injects energy into the mesoscale eddies and near-inertial waves (NIWs) in the ocean,
and the NIW is believed to solve the puzzle of mesoscale energy budget by absorbing energy from mesoscale
eddies followed by a forward cascade of NIW energy which finally dissipates at the ocean interior.
This work studies the turbulent energy transfer in the NIW--quasigeostrophic mean mesoscale eddy
coupled system based on a previously derived two-dimensional model which has a Hamiltonian structure
and inherits conserved quantities in the Boussinesq equations (Xie \& Vanneste, \textit{J. Fluid
Mech.}, vol. 774, 2015, pp. 147--169). Based on the conservation of energy, potential enstrophy
and wave action, we propose a heuristic argument predicting the existence of phase transition with
changing the relative strength between NIW and mean flow. By running forced-dissipative numerical
simulations with varying parameter $R$, the ratio of the magnitude of NIW and mean-flow forcing,
we justify the existence of phase transition, which is found to be second-order, around critical
value $R_c$. When $0<R<R_c$, energy transfers bidirectionally, wave action transfers downscale,
and vorticity form strong cyclones. While when $R>R_c$, energy transfers downscale, wave action
transfers bidirectionally, and vortex filaments are dominant. We find the catalytic wave induction
(CWI) mechanism where the NIW induces a downscale energy flux of the mean flow. The CWI mechanism
differs from the stimulated loss of balance by the absence of energy conversion from the mesoscale
eddy to NIW, and it is found to be effective in the toy-model study, making it potentially important
for ocean energetics.
