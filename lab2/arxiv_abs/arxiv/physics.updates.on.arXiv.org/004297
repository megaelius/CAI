We use a hybrid deep learning model to predict June-July-August (JJA) daily maximum 8-h average
(MDA8) surface ozone concentrations in the US. A set of meteorological fields from the ERA-Interim
reanalysis as well as monthly mean NO$_x$ emissions from the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS)
inventory are selected as predictors. Ozone measurements from the US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) from 1980 to 2009 are used to train the model, whereas data from
2010 to 2014 are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The model captures well daily, seasonal
and interannual variability in MDA8 ozone across the US. Feature maps show that the model captures
teleconnections between MDA8 ozone and the meteorological fields, which are responsible for driving
the ozone dynamics. We used the model to evaluate recent trends in NO$_x$ emissions in the US and found
that the trend in the EPA emission inventory produced the largest negative bias in MDA8 ozone between
2010-2016. The top-down emission trends from the Tropospheric Chemistry Reanalysis (TCR-2),
which is based on satellite observations, produced predictions in best agreement with observations.
In urban regions, the trend in AQS NO$_2$ observations provided ozone predictions in agreement
with observations, whereas in rural regions the satellite-derived trends produced the best agreement.
In both rural and urban regions the EPA trend resulted in the largest negative bias in predicted ozone.
Our results suggest that the EPA inventory is overestimating the reductions in NO$_x$ emissions
and that the satellite-derived trend reflects the influence of reductions in NO$_x$ emissions
as well as changes in background NO$_x$. Our results demonstrate the significantly greater predictive
capability that the deep learning model provides over conventional atmospheric chemical transport
models for air quality analyses.
