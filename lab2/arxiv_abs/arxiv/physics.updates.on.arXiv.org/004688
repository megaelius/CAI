The growing need for affordable and accessible higher education is a major global challenge for
the 21st century. Consequently, there is a need to develop a deeper understanding of the functionality
and taxonomy of universities and colleges and, in particular, how their various characteristics
change with size. Scaling has been a powerful tool for revealing systematic regularities in systems
across a range of topics from physics and biology to cities, and for understanding the underlying
principles of their organization and growth. Here, we apply this framework to institutions of higher
learning in the United States and show that, like organisms, ecosystems and cities, they scale in
a surprisingly systematic fashion following simple power law behavior. We analyze the entire spectrum
encompassing 5,802 institutions ranging from large research universities to small professional
schools, organized in seven commonly used sectors, which reveal distinct regimes of institutional
scaling behavior. Metrics include variation in expenditures, revenues, graduation rates and
estimated economic added value, expressed as functions of total enrollment, our fundamental measure
of size. Our results quantify how each regime of institution leverages specific economies of scale
to address distinct priorities. Taken together, the scaling of features within a sector and shifts
in scaling across sectors implies that there are generic mechanisms and constraints shared by all
sectors which lead to tradeoffs between their different societal functions and roles. We particularly
highlight the strong complementarity between public and private research universities, and community
and state colleges, four sectors that display superlinear returns to scale.
