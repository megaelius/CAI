A mechanical model of a quasi-elastic body (aether) which reproduces Maxwell's equations with
charges and currents is presented. In MacCullagh's model [31], a quasi-elastic body with antisymmetrical
stress tensor was considered but it did not include any charges or currents. Indeed, any presence
of charges or currents appeared to contradict the continuity equation of the aether and it remained
a mystery as to where the aether goes and whence it comes. We present here a solution to this mystery.
In the model here presented, the amount of aether is conserved even in the presence of charges and
currents. It turns out that the charges themselves appear to be moving with the same local aethereal
velocity. In other words, the charges appear to be part of the aether itself, a kind of singularities
in the aether. The positive (negative) charge seems to blast away (draw in) aether with a rate equal
to the amount of charge, the electric field is interpreted as flux of the aether and the magnetic field
as a torque per unit volume. In addition it is shown that the model is consistent with the theory of
relativity, provided that Lorentz-Poincare interpretation of relativity theory is used instead
of the relativistic or Minkowskian interpretation (three very different but empirically equivalent
interpretations). Within the framework of the Lorentz-Poincare interpretation a statistical-mechanical
interpretation of the Lorentz transformations is provided. It turns out that the length of a body
is contracted by the electromagnetic field acting back on the body produced by the constituent particles
of this same body. This self-interaction causes also delay of all the processes.
