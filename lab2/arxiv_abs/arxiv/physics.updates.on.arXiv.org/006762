Lithium-ion technologies are increasingly employed to electrify transportation and provide
stationary energy storage for electrical grids, and as such their development has garnered much
attention. However, their deployment is still relatively limited, and their broader adoption
will depend their potential for cost reduction and performance improvement. Understanding this
potential can inform critical climate change mitigation strategies, including public policies
and technology development efforts. However, many existing models of cost decline rely on limited
data series and measures of technological progress. Here we systematically collect, harmonize,
and combine various data series of price, market size, research and development, and performance
of lithium-ion technologies. We then develop representative series for these measures and employ
performance curve models to measure improvement rates. To obtain a broader estimate of technological
progress, we incorporated additional performance characteristics into these models, notably
energy density and specific energy metrics. When energy density is incorporated into the definition
of service provided by a lithium-ion cell, estimated technological improvement rates increase
considerably, suggesting that previously reported improvement rates might underestimate the
rate of lithium-ion technologies' change. Moreover, our estimates allow for a rough quantification
of the degree to which lithium-ion technologies' price decline might have been limited by performance
requirements other than cost per energy capacity. These rates also suggest an approximate estimate
for how much faster costs might decline when developing battery technologies for stationary applications,
where restrictions on mass and volume are relaxed, though engineering-based mechanistic cost
modeling is required to further characterize this potential.
