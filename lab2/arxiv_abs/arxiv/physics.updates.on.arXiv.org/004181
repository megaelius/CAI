During the past earthquakes, different low ductile failure modes are observed in the gravity design
structures and thus, the most of existing damage indices may fail to assess the damage of gravity
design structures accurately in referring to the two main performance levels: immediate occupancy
and ultimate limit state. Therefore, this study investigates the energy dissipated by the brittle
structures and the possible damage indices based on energy for the damage assessment of gravity
design frames. In the framework of an Energy-Based Seismic Design Approach, we need the assessment
of the Demand and on the Capacity, both expressed in Energy. A methodology for the assessment of the
seismic energy demands imposed on structures is already proposed, but not such methodology that
makes consensus is proposed for the calculation of the Energy dissipation Capacity avoiding the
Hysteretic models. The estimation of the energy expended by the building during an earthquake excitation
is a tricky issue. For this purpose, this study considers the wavelet based energy estimation and
compares it with different approaches for measuring the damages of a structure: the dominant inelastic
period of a building and the more classical measure, the inter-story drift. IDA analysis are performed
in energy, drift and inelastic period. Furthermore, the damage assessment results based on the
expended energy for three gravity design buildings are compared and discussed relatively to the
results expressed in inelastic period and drift. Finally, this study concludes that no significant
effects of number of inelastic cycles to the damage assessment results for low ductile structures.
However, this study also highlights the effects of number of inelastic cycles to the damage for medium
and high ductile structures.
