In hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, expressions for the transfer rates rely
on integrals over wavenumber triads $(\textbf{k,p,q})$ satisfying $\textbf{k+p+q=0}$. As an
example $S_E^{uu}(\textbf{k|p,q})$ denotes the kinetic energy transfer rate to the mode $\textbf{k}$,
from the two other modes in the triad, $\textbf{p}$ and $\textbf{q}$. As noted by Kraichnan (1958),
in $S_E^{uu}(\textbf{k|p,q})$, what fraction of the energy transferred to the mode $\textbf{k}$
originated from $\textbf{p}$ and which from $\textbf{q}$ is unknown . Such an expression is thus
incongruent with the customary description of turbulence in terms of two-scale energy exchange.
Notwithstanding this issue, Dar etal. (2001) further decomposed these transfers into separate
contributions from $\textbf{p}$-to-$\textbf{k}$ and $\textbf{q}$-to-$\textbf{k}$, thus
introducing the concept of mode-to-mode transfers that they applied to MHD turbulence. Doing so,
they had to set aside additional transfers circulating within each triad, but failed to calculate
them. In the present paper we explain how to derive the complete expressions of the mode-to-mode
transfers, including the circulating transfers. We do it for kinetic energy and kinetic helicity
in hydrodynamic turbulence, for kinetic energy, magnetic energy and magnetic helicity in MHD turbulence.
Separating the contribution of magnetic advection from magnetic stretching, the energy mode-to-mode
transfer rates involving the magnetic field become uniquely defined, in striking contrast to the
hydrodynamic case. The magnetic helicity mode-to-mode transfer rate is also found to be uniquely
defined, contrary to kinetic helicity in hydrodynamics. We find that shell-to-shell transfer
rates have the same properties as mode-to-mode transfer rates. Finally calculating the fluxes,
we show how the circulating transfers cancel in accordance with conservation laws.
