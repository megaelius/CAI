As the recent COVID-19 outbreak rapidly expands all over the world, various containment measures
have been carried out to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In Mainland China, the containment
measures consist of three types, i.e., Wuhan travel ban, intra-city quarantine and isolation,
and inter-city travel restriction. In order to carry out the measures, local economy and information
acquisition play an important role. In this paper, we investigate the correlation of local economy
and the information acquisition on the execution of containment measures to fight against the COVID-19
pandemic in Mainland China. First, we use a parsimonious model, i.e., SIR-X model, to estimate the
parameters, which represent the execution of intra-city quarantine and isolation in major cities
of Mainland China. In order to understand the execution of intra-city quarantine and isolation,
we analyze the correlation between the representative parameters including local economy, mobility,
and information acquisition. To this end, we collect the data of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the
inflows from Wuhan and outflows, and the COVID-19 related search frequency from a widely-used Web
mapping service, i.e., Baidu Maps, and Web search engine, i.e., Baidu Search Engine, in Mainland
China. Based on the analysis, we confirm the strong correlation between the local economy and the
execution of information acquisition in major cities of Mainland China. We further evidence that,
although the cities with high GDP per capita attracts bigger inflows from Wuhan, people are more
likely to conduct the quarantine measure and to reduce going out to other cities. Finally, the correlation
analysis using search data shows that well-informed individuals are likely to carry out containment
measures.
