During reactive transport modeling, the computational cost associated with chemical reaction
calculations is often 10-100 times higher than that of transport calculations. Most of these costs
results from chemical equilibrium calculations that are performed at least once in every mesh cell
and at every time step of the simulation. Calculating chemical equilibrium is an iterative process,
where each iteration is in general so computationally expensive that even if every calculation
converged in a single iteration, the resulting speedup would not be significant. Thus, rather than
proposing a fast-converging numerical method for solving chemical equilibrium equations, we
present a machine learning method that enables new equilibrium states to be quickly and accurately
estimated, whenever a previous equilibrium calculation with similar input conditions has been
performed. We demonstrate the use of this smart chemical equilibrium method in a reactive transport
modeling example and show that, even at early simulation times, the majority of all equilibrium
calculations are quickly predicted and, after some time steps, the machine-learning-accelerated
chemical solver has been fully trained to rapidly perform all subsequent equilibrium calculations,
resulting in speedups of almost two orders of magnitude. We remark that our new on-demand machine
learning method can be applied to any case in which a massive number of sequential/parallel evaluations
of a computationally expensive function $f$ needs to be done, $y=f(x)$. We remark, that, in contrast
to traditional machine learning algorithms, our on-demand training approach does not require
a statistics-based training phase before the actual simulation of interest commences. The introduced
on-demand training scheme requires, however, the first-order derivatives $\partial f/\partial
x$ for later smart predictions.
