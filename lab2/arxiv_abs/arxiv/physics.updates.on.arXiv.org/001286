Inferring properties of macroscopic solutions from molecular simulations is complicated by the
limited size of systems that can be feasibly examined with a computer. When long-ranged electrostatic
interactions are involved, the resulting finite size effects can be substantial and may attenuate
very slowly with increasing system size, as shown by previous work on dilute ions in bulk aqueous
solution. Here we examine corrections for such effects, with an emphasis on solvation near interfaces.
Our central assumption follows the perspective of H\"{u}nenberger and McCammon [J. Chem. Phys.
110, 1856 (1999)]: Long-wavelength solvent response underlying finite size effects should be
well described by reduced models like dielectric continuum theory, whose size dependence can be
calculated straightforwardly. Applied to an ion in a periodic slab of liquid coexisting with vapor,
this approach yields a finite size correction for solvation free energies that differs in important
ways from results previously derived for bulk solution. For a model polar solvent, we show that this
new correction quantitatively accounts for the variation of solvation free energy with volume
and aspect ratio of the simulation cell. Correcting periodic slab results for an aqueous system
requires an additional accounting for the solvent's intrinsic charge asymmetry, which shifts
electric potentials in a size-dependent manner. The accuracy of these finite size corrections
establishes a simple method for a posteriori extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit, and also
underscores the realism of dielectric continuum theory down to the nanometer scale.
