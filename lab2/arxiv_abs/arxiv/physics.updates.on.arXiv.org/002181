Two-way coupled direct numerical simulations are used to investigate the effects of inertial particles
on self-sustained, turbulent coherent structures (i.e. the so-called the regeneration cycle)
in plane Couette flow at low Reynolds number just above the onset of transition. Tests show two limiting
behaviors with increasing particle inertia, similar to the results from the linear stability analysis
of saffman, 1962: low-inertia particles trigger the laminar-to-turbulent instability whereas
high-inertia particles tend to stabilize turbulence due to the extra dissipation induced by particle-fluid
coupling. Furthermore, it is found that the streamwise coupling between phases is the dominant
factor in damping the turbulence and is highly related to the spatial distribution of the particles.
The presence of particles in different turbulent coherent structures (large scale vortices or
large scale streaks) determines the turbulent kinetic energy of particulate phase, which is related
to the particle response time scaled by the turnover time of large scale vortices. By quantitatively
investigating the periodic character of the whole regeneration cycle and the phase difference
between linked sub-steps, we show that the presence of inertial particles does not alter the periodic
nature of the cycle or the relative length of each of the sub-steps. Instead, high-inertia particles
greatly weaken the large-scale vortices as well as the streamwise vorticity stretching and lift-up
effects, thereby suppressing the fluctuating amplitude of the large scale streaks. The primary
influence of low-inertia particles, however, is to strengthen the large scale vortices, which
fosters the cycle and ultimately reduces the critical Reynolds number.
