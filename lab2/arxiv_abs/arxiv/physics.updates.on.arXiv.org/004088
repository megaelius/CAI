The recent availability of digital traces from Information and Communications Technologies (ICT)
has facilitated the study of both individual- and population-level movement with unprecedented
spatiotemporal resolution, enabling us to better understand a plethora of socioeconomic processes
such as urbanization, transportation, impact on the environment and epidemic spreading to name
a few. Using empirical spatiotemporal trends, several mobility models have been proposed to explain
the observed regularities in human movement. With the advent of the World Wide Web, a new type of virtual
mobility has emerged that has begun to supplant many traditional facets of human activity. Here
we conduct a systematic analysis of physical and virtual movement, uncovering both similarities
and differences in their statistical patterns. The differences manifest themselves primarily
in the temporal regime, as a signature of the spatial and economic constraints inherent in physical
movement, features that are predominantly absent in the virtual space. We demonstrate that once
one moves to the time-independent space of events, i.e the sequences of visited locations, these
differences vanish, and the statistical patterns of physical and virtual mobility are identical.
The observed similarity in navigating these markedly different domains point towards a common
mechanism governing the movement patterns, a feature we describe through a Metropolis-Hastings
type optimization model, where individuals navigate locations through decision-making processes
resembling a cost-benefit analysis of the utility of locations. In contrast to existing phenomenological
models of mobility, we show that our model can reproduce the commonalities in the empirically observed
statistics with minimal input.
