Efficient computational methods that are capable of supporting experimental measures obtained
at constant values of pH and redox potential are important tools as they serve to, among other things,
provide additional atomic level information that cannot be obtained experimentally. Replica
Exchange is an enhanced sampling technique that allows converged results to be obtained faster
in comparison to regular molecular dynamics simulations. In this work we report the implementation,
also available with GPU-accelerated code, of pH and redox potential (E) as options for multidimensional
REMD simulations in AMBER. Previous publications have only reported multidimensional REMD simulations
with the temperature and Hamiltonian dimensions. In this work results are shown for N-acetylmicroperoxidase-8
(NAcMP8) axially connected to a histidine peptide. This is a small system that contains only a single
heme group. We compare results from E,pH-REMD, E,T-REMD and E,T,pH-REMD to one dimensional REMD
simulations and to simulations without REMD. We show that 2D-REMD simulations improve sampling
convergence in comparison to 1D-REMD simulations, and that 3D-REMD further improves convergence
in comparison to 2D-REMD simulations. Also, our computational benchmarks show that our multidimensional
REMD calculations have a small and bearable computational performance, essentially the same as
one dimensional REMD. However, in multidimensional REMD a significantly higher number of replicas
is required as the number of replicas scales geometrically with the number of dimensions, which
requires additional computational resources. In addition to the pH dependence on standard redox
potential values and the redox potential dependence on pKa values,we also investigate the influence
of the temperature in our results. We observe an agreement between our computational results and
theoretical predictions.
