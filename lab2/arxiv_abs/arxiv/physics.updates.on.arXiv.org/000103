This paper presents a complete theoretical framework for plasma turbulence and transport in tokamak
plasmas. The fundamental scale separations present in plasma turbulence are codified as an asymptotic
expansion in the ratio of the gyroradius to the equilibrium scale length. Proceeding order-by-order
in this expansion, a framework for plasma turbulence is developed. It comprises an instantaneous
equilibrium, the fluctuations driven by gradients in the equilibrium quantities, and the transport-timescale
evolution of mean profiles of these quantities driven by the fluctuations. The equilibrium distribution
functions are local Maxwellians with each flux surface rotating toroidally as a rigid body. The
magnetic equillibrium is obtained from the Grad-Shafranov equation for a rotating plasma and the
slow (resistive) evolution of the magnetic field is given by an evolution equation for the safety
factor q. Large-scale deviations of the distribution function from a Maxwellian are given by neoclassical
theory. The fluctuations are determined by the high-flow gyrokinetic equation, from which we derive
the governing principle for gyrokinetic turbulence in tokamaks: the conservation and local cascade
of free energy. Transport equations for the evolution of the mean density, temperature and flow
velocity profiles are derived. These transport equations show how the neoclassical corrections
and the fluctuations act back upon the mean profiles through fluxes and heating. The energy and entropy
conservation laws for the mean profiles are derived. Total energy is conserved and there is no net
turbulent heating. Entropy is produced by the action of fluxes flattening gradients, Ohmic heating,
and the equilibration of mean temperatures. Finally, this framework is condensed, in the low-Mach-number
limit, to a concise set of equations suitable for numerical implementation.
