Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed for two wall-bounded flow configurations: laminar
Couette flow at $Re=740$ and turbulent channel flow at $Re_{\tau}=180$, where $\tau$ is the shear
stress at the wall. The top wall is smooth and the bottom wall is a realistically rough superhydrophobic
surface (SHS), generated from a three-dimensional surface profile measurement. The air-water
interface, which is assumed to be flat, is simulated using the volume-of-fluid (VOF) approach.
The laminar Couette flow is studied with varying interface heights $h$ to understand the effect
on slip and drag reduction ($DR$). The presence of the surface roughness is felt up to $40\%$ of the
channel height in the wall-normal direction. A nonlinear dependence of $DR$ on $h$ is observed with
three distinct regions. The DNS results are used to obtain a nonlinear curve fit for gas fraction
$\phi_g$ as a function of $h$, where $\phi_g$ determines the amount of slip area exposed to the flow.
A power law linear regression fit is used to obtain $b_{eff}$ as a function of $\phi_g$. For the turbulent
channel flow, statistics of the flow field are compared to that of a smooth wall to understand the
effects of roughness and $h$. Two interface heights, $h=h_{rms}$ and $h=h_{max}$ are simulated
to study their effect on the behaviour of the flow, where $h_{rms}$ and $h_{max}$ are the rms and maximum
peak of the roughness heights respectively. Results show that the presence of trapped air in the
cavities significantly alters near wall flow physics. The fully wetted roughness increases the
peak value in turbulent intensities, whereas the presence of the interface suppresses them. Overall,
there exists a competing effect between the interface and the asperities, where the interface suppresses
turbulence whereas the asperities enhance them.
