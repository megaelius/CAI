Circuity, the ratio of network distances to straight-line distances, is an important measure of
urban street network structure and transportation efficiency. Circuity results from a circulation
network's configuration, planning, and underlying terrain. In turn, it impacts how humans use
urban space for settlement and travel. Although past research has examined overall street network
circuity, researchers have not studied the relative circuity of walkable versus drivable circulation
networks. To address this gap, this study uses OpenStreetMap data to explore relative network circuity.
We download walkable and drivable networks for 40 US cities using the OSMnx software, which we then
use to simulate two million routes and analyze circuity to characterize network structure. We find
that walking networks tend to allow for more direct trips than driving networks do in most cities:
average driving circuity exceeds average walking circuity in all but four of the cities that exhibit
statistically significant differences between network types. We discuss various reasons for
this phenomenon, illustrated with case studies. Network circuity also varies substantially between
different types of places. These findings underscore the value of using network-based distances
rather than straight-line distances when studying urban travel and access. They also suggest the
importance of differentiating between walkable and drivable circulation networks when modeling
and characterizing urban street networks: although different modes' networks overlap in any given
city, their relative structure and performance vary in most cities.
