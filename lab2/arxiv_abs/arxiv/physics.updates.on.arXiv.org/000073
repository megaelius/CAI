Extremely fast rotating molecules carrying significantly more energy in their rotation than in
any other degree of freedom are known as "super rotors". It has been speculated that super rotors
may exhibit a number of unique and intriguing properties. Theoretical studies showed that ultrafast
molecular rotation may change the character of molecular scattering from solid surfaces, alter
molecular trajectories in external fields, make super rotors surprisingly stable against collisions,
and lead to the formation of gas vortices. New ways of molecular cooling and selective chemical bond
breaking by ultrafast spinning have been proposed. Owing to the fundamental laws of nature, bringing
a large number of molecules to fast, directional and synchronous rotation is rather challenging.
As a result, only indirect evidence of super rotors has been reported to date. Here we demonstrate
the first controlled creation, direct observation and study of molecular super rotors. Using intense
laser pulses tailored to produce an "optical centrifuge", we spin different species, from lighter
H_2 to heavier O_2 and CO_2, to ultrafast uni-directional rotation with variable angular velocity.
We increase the molecular rotational energy by more than two orders of magnitude and follow the previously
undetectable super rotor states with femtosecond time resolution. This allows us to observe the
stretching of chemical bonds due to the centrifugal distortion, and the increased stability of
rotational coherence at high angular momentum. We demonstrate that molecular super rotors can
be created in dense samples under normal conditions where many-body effects, inter-molecular
collisions and chemical reactions can be readily explored. As virtually all molecules are amenable
to laser spinning, we anticipate this work to stimulate new studies of molecular dynamics and interactions
at previously inaccessible limits.
