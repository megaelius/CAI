Computer vision and image processing techniques provide important assistance to physicians and
relieve their workload in different tasks. In particular, identifying objects of interest such
as lesions and anatomical structures from the image is a challenging and iterative process that
can be done by using computer vision and image processing approaches in a successful manner. Optic
Nerve Head (ONH) detection is a crucial step in retinal image analysis algorithms. The goal of ONH
detection is to find and detect other retinal landmarks and lesions and their corresponding diameters,
to use as a length reference to measure objects in the retina. The objective of this study is to apply
three retinal vessel segmentation methods, Laplacian-of-Gaussian edge detector, Canny edge
detector, and Matched filter edge detector for detection of the ONH either in the normal fundus images
or in the presence of retinal lesions (e.g. diabetic retinopathy). To evaluate the accuracy of our
proposed method, we compare the output of our proposed method with the ground truth data collected
by ophthalmologists on retinal images belonging to a test set of 120 images. As shown in the results
section, by using the Laplacian-of-Gaussian vessel segmentation, our automated algorithm finds
18 ONHs in true location for 20 color images in the CHASE-DB database and all images in the DRIVE database.
For the Canny vessel segmentation, our automated algorithm finds 16 ONHs in true location for 20
images in the CHASE-DB database and 32 out of 40 images in the DRIVE database. And lastly, using the
matched filter in the vessel segmentation, our algorithm finds 19 ONHs in true location for 20 images
in the CHASE-DB database and all images in the DRIVE.
