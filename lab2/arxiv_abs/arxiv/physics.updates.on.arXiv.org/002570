One of the defining features of both recent and historical cases of global climate change is Arctic
Amplification (AA). This is the more rapid change in the surface air temperature (SAT) in the Arctic
compared to some wider reference region, such as the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mean. Many different
metrics have been developed to quantify the degree of AA based on SAT anomalies, trends and variability.
The use of different metrics, as well as the choice of dataset to use can affect conclusions about
the magnitude and temporal variability of AA. Here we review the established metrics of AA to see
how well they agree upon the temporal signature of AA, such as the multi-decadal variability, and
assess the consistency in these metrics across different commonly-used datasets which cover both
the early and late 20th century warming in the Arctic. We find the NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis most
closely matches the observations when using metrics based upon SAT trends (A2), variability (A3)
and regression (A4) of the SAT anomalies, and the ERA 20th Century Reanalysis is closest to the observations
in the SAT anomalies (A1) and variability of SAT anomalies (A3). However, there are large seasonal
differences in the consistency between datasets. Moreover, the largest differences between the
century-long reanalysis products and observations are during the early warming period, likely
due to the sparseness of the observations in the Arctic at that time. In the modern warming period,
the high density of observations strongly constrains all the reanalysis products, whether they
include satellite observations or only surface observations. Thus, all the reanalysis and observation
products produce very similar magnitudes and temporal variability in the degree of AA during the
recent warming period.
