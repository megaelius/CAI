We study the deformation and breakup of an axisymmetric electrolyte drop which is freely suspended
in an infinite dielectric medium and subjected to an imposed electric field. The electric potential
in the drop phase is assumed small, so that its governing equation is approximated by a linearized
Poisson-Boltzmann or modified Helmholtz equation (the Debye-H\"{u}ckel regime). An accurate
and efficient boundary integral method is developed to solve the low-Reynolds-number flow problem
for the time-dependent drop deformation, in the case of arbitrary Debye layer thickness. Extensive
numerical results are presented for the case when the viscosity of the drop and surrounding medium
are comparable. Qualitative similarities are found between the evolution of a drop with a thick
Debye layer (characterized by the parameter $\chi\ll 1$, which is an inverse dimensionless Debye
layer thickness) and a perfect dielectric drop in an insulating medium. In this limit, a highly elongated
steady state is obtained for sufficiently large imposed electric field, and the field inside the
drop is found to be well approximated using slender body theory. In the opposite limit $\chi\gg 1$,
when the Debye layer is thin, the drop behaves as a highly conducting drop, even for moderate permittivity
ratio $Q=\epsilon_1/\epsilon_2$, where $\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2$ is the dielectric permittivity
of drop interior and exterior, respectively. For parameter values at which steady solutions no
longer exist, we find three distinct types of unsteady solution or breakup modes. These are termed
conical end formation, end splashing, and open end stretching. The second breakup mode, end splashing,
resembles the breakup solution presented in a recent paper [R. B. Karyappa et al., J. Fluid Mech.
754, 550-589 (2014)]. We compute a phase diagram which illustrates the regions in parameter space
in which the different breakup modes occur.
