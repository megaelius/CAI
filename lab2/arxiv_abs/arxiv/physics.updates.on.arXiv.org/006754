In this work, different transmission modes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and their role in determining
the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic are analyzed. Probability of infection caused by inhaling
infectious droplets (initial, ejection diameters between 0.5-750$\mu m$) and probability of
infection by the corresponding desiccated nuclei that mostly encapsulate the virions post droplet
evaporation, are calculated. At typical, air-conditioned yet quiescent, large indoor space,
for the average viral loading, and at early times, cough droplets of initial diameter between $10
\mu m$ and $50 \mu m$ have the highest infection probability. However, by the time they are to be inhaled,
the diameters are most likely $5-6$ times smaller with respect to their initial diameters. While
the initially near unity infection probability due to droplets (airborne/ballistic) rapidly
decays within the first $25$s, the small yet persistent infection probability of airborne desiccated
nuclei decays appreciably only by $1000$s. Combined with molecular collision theory adapted to
calculate frequency of contact between the susceptible population and the droplet/nuclei cloud,
infection probabilities are used to define infection rate constants, ab-initio, leading to a SEIR
model. Assuming the virus sustains equally well within the dried droplet nuclei as in the droplets,
the floating nuclei leads to a stronger contribution to the corresponding rate constants with respect
to the droplets, in the above-mentioned conditions. Combining both pathways, the basic reproduction
number $\mathcal{R}_0$ caused by cough droplets and nuclei are calculated. Viral load, minimum
infectious dose, sensitivity of the virus half-life to the phase of its vector, extent of dilution
of the respiratory jet/puff by the entraining air are the important factors that determine specific
physical modes of transmission and the pandemic evolution.
