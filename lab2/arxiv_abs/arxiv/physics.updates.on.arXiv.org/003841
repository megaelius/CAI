Dielectrics are insulating materials used in many different electronic devices and play an important
role in all of them. Current advanced electronic devices use dielectric materials with a high dielectric
constant and avoid high leakage currents. However, these materials show several intrinsic problems,
and also a bad interaction with adjacent materials. Therefore, the race for finding a suitable dielectric
material for current and future electronic devices is still open. In this context two dimensional
[2D] materials have become a serious option, not only thanks to their advanced properties, but also
to the development of scalable synthesis methods. Graphene has been the most explored 2D material
for electronic devices. However, graphene has no band gap, and therefore it cannot be used as dielectric.
MoS2 and other 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are semiconducting 2D materials that
can provide more versatility in electronic devices. In this PhD thesis I have investigated the use
of monolayer and multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as dielectric for electronic devices,
as it is a 2D material with a band gap of ~5.9 eV. My work has mainly focused on the synthesis of the h-BN
using chemical vapor deposition, the study of its intrinsic morphological and electrical properties
at the nanoscale, and its performance as dielectric in different electronic devices, such as capacitors
and memristors. Overall, our experiments indicate that h-BN is a very reliable dielectric material,
and that it can be successfully used in capacitors and memristors. Moreover, h-BN shows additional
performances never observed in traditional dielectrics, such as volatile resistive switching,
which may also open the door for new applications.
