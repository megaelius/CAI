We present observations from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium of the effects of stormy solar wind on
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Four corotating interaction regions (CIRs), where the first
event has possibly merged with a CME, are traced from Earth via Mars (using Mars Express and MAVEN)
and to comet 67P from October to December 2014. When the comet is 3.1-2.7 AU from the Sun and the neutral
outgassing rate $\sim10^{25}-10^{26}$ s$^{-1}$ the CIRs significantly influence the cometary
plasma environment at altitudes down to 10-30 km. The ionospheric low-energy \textcolor{black}{($\sim$5
eV) plasma density increases significantly in all events, by a factor $>2$ in events 1-2 but less
in events 3-4. The spacecraft potential drops below -20V upon impact when the flux of electrons increases}.
The increased density is \textcolor{black}{likely} caused by compression of the plasma environment,
increased particle impact ionisation, and possibly charge exchange processes and acceleration
of mass loaded plasma back to the comet ionosphere. During all events, the fluxes of suprathermal
($\sim$10-100 eV) electrons increase significantly, suggesting that the heating mechanism of
these electrons is coupled to the solar wind energy input. At impact the magnetic field strength
in the coma increases by a factor of ~2-5 as more interplanetary magnetic field piles up around of
the comet. During two CIR impact events, we observe possible plasma boundaries forming, or moving
past Rosetta, as the strong solar wind compresses the cometary plasma environment. \textcolor{black}{We
also discuss the possibility of seeing some signatures of the ionospheric response to tail disconnection
