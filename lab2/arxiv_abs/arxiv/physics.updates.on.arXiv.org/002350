The nucleotides ATP and ADP regulate many aspects of endothelial cell (EC) biology, including intracellular
calcium concentrations, focal adhesion activation, cytoskeletal organization, and cellular
motility. In vivo, ECs are constantly under flow, and the concentration of ATP/ADP on the EC surface
is determined by the combined effects of nucleotide convective and diffusive transport as well
as hydrolysis by ectonucleotidases on the EC surface. In addition, experiments have demonstrated
that flow induces ATP release from the cells. Previously computational models have incorporated
the above effects and thus described concentration at the EC surface. However, it remains unclear
what physical processes are responsible for nucleotide regulation. While some EC responses to
flow have been shown to be directly driven by shear stress, others appear to also involve a non-negligible
contribution of transport. In the present work, we develop a mathematical model and perform numerical
simulations to investigate the relative contributions of shear stress and transport to nucleotide
concentration at the EC surface, with the effect of cell density. Because in vitro experiments are
performed by using confluent cells in some cases and subconfluent cells in other cases, we also investigate
the effect of cell density on the results. The outcomes of the simulations demonstrate a complex
interplay between shear stress and transport such that transport has a significant contribution
at certain shear stress values but not at others. The effect of transport on nucleotide concentration
increases with cell density. The present findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms
that govern the regulation of such molecules at the EC surface under flow. The implications of these
findings for downstream responses such as cellular motility merit future investigation.
