We report on a numerical investigation of turbulent bubbly flows. Bubbles of a size larger than the
dissipative scale, cannot be treated as point-wise inclusions, and generate important hydrodynamic
fields in the carrier fluid when in motion. Furthermore, when the volume fraction of bubbles is important
enough, the bubble motion may induce a collective agitation due to hydrodynamic interactions of
the wakes which display some turbulent-like features. We tackle this complex phenomenon from a
numerical point of view, performing direct numerical simulations (DNS) based on a Volume-of-fluid
(VOF) method. Adaptive grids are used to make the computational effort feasible when needed. In
the first part of the work, we investigate several 2D and 3D tests for which either analytical or other
numerical results are present. phases. It is shown that in order to get accurate results, even from
a qualitative point of view, it is key to carry out simulations with realistic physical parameters
and well-resolved bubbles. These constraints are increasingly severe with increasing velocity
of the bubbles. In the second part, we focus on the dynamics of a bubble column in two and three dimensions.
The configuration and the physical parameters are similar to those used in laboratory experiments.
In two dimensions, we have found that for high-enough Reynolds number an inverse cascade is produced
for scales larger than the bubble diameter. In three dimensions, a cascade process has been found
as in experiments which displays a $k^{-3}$ slope for the energy spectrum. The mechanisms underlying
the different cascades are unveiled by a local scale-by-scale analysis in physical space.
