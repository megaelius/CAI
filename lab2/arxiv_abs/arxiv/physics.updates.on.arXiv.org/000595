We are interested in characterization of synchronization transitions of bursting neurons in the
frequency domain. Instantaneous population firing rate (IPFR) $R(t)$, which is directly obtained
from the raster plot of neural spikes, is often used as a realistic collective quantity describing
population activities in both the computational and the experimental neuroscience. For the case
of spiking neurons, a realistic time-domain order parameter, based on $R(t)$, was introduced in
our recent work to characterize the spike synchronization transition. Unlike the case of spiking
neurons, the IPFR $R(t)$ of bursting neurons exhibits population behaviors with both the slow bursting
and the fast spiking timescales. For our aim, we decompose the IPFR $R(t)$ into the instantaneous
population bursting rate $R_b(t)$ (describing the bursting behavior) and the instantaneous population
spike rate $R_s(t)$ (describing the spiking behavior) via frequency filtering, and extend the
realistic order parameter to the case of bursting neurons. Thus, we develop the frequency-domain
bursting and spiking order parameters which are just the bursting and spiking "coherence factors"
$\beta_b$ and $\beta_s$ of the bursting and spiking peaks in the power spectral densities of $R_b$
and $R_s$ (i.e., "signal to noise" ratio of the spectral peak height and its relative width). Through
calculation of $\beta_b$ and $\beta_s$, we obtain the bursting and spiking thresholds beyond which
the burst and spike synchronizations break up, respectively. Consequently, it is shown in explicit
examples that the frequency-domain bursting and spiking order parameters may be usefully used
for characterization of the bursting and the spiking transitions, respectively.
