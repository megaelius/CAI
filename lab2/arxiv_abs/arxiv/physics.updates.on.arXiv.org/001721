In this work, the composite control-variate stratified sampling (CCSS) method is presented for
calculation of MO integrals without transformation of AO integrals. The central idea of this approach
is to obtain the 2-electron MO integrals by direct integration of 2-electron coordinates. This
method does not require or use pre-computed AO integrals and the value of the MOs at any point in space
is obtained directly from the linear combination of AOs. The integration over the electronic coordinates
was performed using stratified sampling Monte Carlo method. This approach was implemented by dividing
the integration region into a set of non-overlapping segments and performing Monte Carlo calculations
on each segment. The Monte Carlo sampling points for each segment were optimized to minimize the
total variance of the sample mean. Additional variance reduction of the overall calculations was
achieved by introducing control-variate in the stratified sampling scheme. The composite aspect
of the CCSS allows for simultaneous computation of multiple MO integrals during the stratified
sampling evaluation. The main advantage of the CCSS method is that unlike rejection sampling Monte
Carlo methods such as Metropolis algorithm, the stratified sampling uses all instances of the calculated
functions for the evaluation of the sample mean. The CCSS method is designed to be used for large systems
where AO-to-MO transformation is computationally prohibitive. Because it is based on numerical
integration, the CCSS method can be applied to a wide variety of integration kernels and does not
require \textit{a priori} knowledge of analytical integrals. In this work, the developed CCSS
method was applied for calculation of excitonic properties in CdSe quantum dots using electron-hole
explicitly correlated Hartree-Fock (eh-XCHF) and geminal-screened electron-hole interaction
kernel (GSIK) methods.
