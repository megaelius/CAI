Understanding the resilience of infrastructures such as transportation network has significant
importance for our daily life. Recently, a homogeneous spatial network model was developed for
studying spatial embedded networks with characteristic link length such as power-grids and the
brain. However, although many real-world networks are spatially embedded and their links have
characteristics length such as pipelines, power lines or ground transportation lines they are
not homogeneous but rather heterogeneous. For example, density of links within cities are significantly
higher than between cities. Here we present and study numerically and analytically a similar realistic
heterogeneous spatial modular model using percolation process to better understand the effect
of heterogeneity on such networks. The model assumes that inside a city there are many lines connecting
different locations, while long lines between the cities are sparse and usually directly connecting
only a few nearest neighbours cities in a two dimensional plane. We find that this model experiences
two distinct continues transitions, one when the cities disconnect from each other and the second
when each city breaks apart. Although the critical threshold for site percolation in 2D grid remains
an open question we analytically find the critical threshold for site percolation in this model.
In addition, while the homogeneous model experience a single transition having a unique phenomenon
called \textit{critical stretching} where a geometric crossover from random to spatial structure
in different scales found to stretch non-linearly with the characteristic length at criticality.
Here we show that the heterogeneous model does not experience such a phenomenon indicating that
critical stretching strongly depends on the network structure.
