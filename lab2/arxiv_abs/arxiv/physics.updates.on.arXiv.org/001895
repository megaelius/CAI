The classical Stokes' problem describing the fluid motion due to a steadily moving infinite wall
is revisited in the context of dense granular flows of mono-dispersed beads using the recently proposed
$\mu(I)$--rheology. In Newtonian fluids, molecular diffusion brings about a self-similar velocity
profile and the boundary layer in which the fluid motion takes place increases indefinitely with
time $t$ as $\sqrt{\nu t}$, where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. For a dense granular visco-plastic
liquid, it is shown that the local shear stress, when properly rescaled, exhibits self-similar
behaviour at short-time scales and it then rapidly evolves towards a steady-state solution. The
resulting shear layer increases in thickness as $\sqrt{\nu_g t}$ analogous to a Newtonian fluid
where $\nu_g$ is an equivalent granular kinematic viscosity depending not only on the intrinsic
properties of the granular media such as grain diameter $d$, density $\rho$ and friction coefficients
but also on the applied pressure $p_w$ at the moving wall and the solid fraction $\phi$ (constant).
In addition, the $\mu(I)$--rheology indicates that this growth continues until reaching the steady-state
boundary layer thickness $\delta_s = \beta_w (p_w/\phi \rho g )$, independent of the grain size,
at about a finite time proportional to $\beta_w^2 (p_w/\rho g d)^{3/2} \sqrt{d/g}$, where $g$ is
the acceleration due to gravity and $\beta_w = (\tau_w - \tau_s)/\tau_s$ is the relative surplus
of the steady-state wall shear-stress $\tau_w$ over the critical wall shear stress $\tau_s$ (yield
stress) that is needed to bring the granular media into motion... (see article for a complete abstract).
