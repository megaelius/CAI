Although ultrafast laser materials processing has advanced at a breakneck pace over the last two
decades, most applications have been developed with laser pulses at near-IR or visible wavelengths.
Recent progress in mid-infrared (MIR) femtosecond laser source development may create novel capabilities
for material processing. This is because, at high intensities required for such processing, wavelength
tuning to longer wavelengths opens the pathway to a special regime of laser-solid interactions.
Under these conditions, due to the ${\lambda}^2$ scaling, the ponderomotive energy of laser-driven
electrons may significantly exceed photon energy, band gap and electron affinity and can dominantly
drive absorption, resulting in a paradigm shift in the traditional concepts of ultrafast laser-solid
interactions. Irreversible high-intensity ultrafast MIR laser-solid interactions are of primary
interest in this connection, but they have not been systematically studied so far. To address this
fundamental gap, we performed a detailed experimental investigation of high-intensity ultrafast
modifications of silicon by single femtosecond MIR pulses (${\lambda}$ = 2.7 - 4.2 ${\mu}$m). Ultrafast
melting, interaction with silicon-oxide surface layer, and ablation of the oxide and crystal surfaces
were ex-situ characterized by scanning electron, atomic-force, and transmission electron microscopy
combined with focused ion-beam milling, electron diffractometry, and ${\mu}$-Raman spectroscopy.
Laser induced damage and ablation (LIDA) thresholds were measured as functions of laser wavelength.
The traditional theoretical models did not reproduce the wavelength scaling of the damage thresholds.
To address the disagreement, we discuss possible novel pathways of energy deposition driven by
the ponderomotive energy and field effects characteristic of the MIR wavelength regime.
