We have experimentally and theoretically investigated the electron spin transport and spin distribution
at room temperature in a Si two-dimensional (2D) inversion channel of back-gate-type spin metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistors (spin MOSFETs). The magnetoresistance ratio of the spin MOSFET with
a channel length of 0.4$\mu$m was increased by a factor of 6 from that in our previous paper [Phys.
Rev. B 99, 165301 (2019)] by lowering the parasitic resistances at the source/drain junctions with
highly-phosphorus-doped n+-Si regions and by increasing the lateral electric field in the channel
along the electron transport, called "spin drift". Clear Hanle signals with some oscillation peaks
were observed for the spin MOSFET with a channel length of 10 $\mu$ m under the lateral electric field,
indicating that the effective spin diffusion length is dramatically enhanced by the spin drift.
By taking into account the n+-Si regions and the spin drift in the channel, one-dimensional analytic
functions were derived for analyzing the effect of the spin drift on the spin transport through the
channel and these functions were found to explain almost all the experimental results. From the
calculated spin current and spin distribution, it was revealed that almost all the spins are unflipped
during the spin-drift-assisted transport through the 0.4-$\mu$m-long inversion channel, but
the most part of the injected spins from the source electrode are relaxed in the n+-Si regions of both
the source and drain junctions. This means that the spin drift is useful and precise design of the
device structure is essential to obtain a higher magnetoresistance ratio. Furthermore, we showed
that the effective spin resistances that are introduced in this study are very helpful to understand
how to improve the magnetoresistance ratio of spin MOSFETs for practical use.
