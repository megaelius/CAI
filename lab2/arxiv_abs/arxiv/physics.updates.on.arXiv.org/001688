The ability to reliably predict the structures and stabilities of a molecular crystal and its polymorphs
without any prior experimental information would be an invaluable tool for a number of fields, with
specific and immediate applications in the design and formulation of pharmaceuticals. In this
case, detailed knowledge of the polymorphic energy landscape for an active pharmaceutical ingredient
yields profound insight regarding the existence and likelihood of late-appearing polymorphs.
However, the computational prediction of the structures and stabilities of molecular crystal
polymorphs is particularly challenging due to the high dimensionality of conformational and crystallographic
space accompanied by the need for relative (free) energies to within $\approx$ 1 kJ/mol per molecule.
In this work, we combine the most successful crystal structure sampling strategy with the most accurate
energy ranking strategy of the latest blind test of organic crystal structure prediction (CSP),
organized by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC). Our final energy ranking is based
on first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations that include three key physical
contributions: (i) a sophisticated treatment of Pauli exchange-repulsion and electron correlation
effects with hybrid functionals, (ii) inclusion of many-body van der Waals dispersion interactions,
and (iii) account of vibrational free energies. In doing so, this combined approach has an optimal
success rate in producing the crystal structures corresponding to the five blind-test molecules.
With this practical approach, we demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining reliable structures
and stabilities for molecular crystals of pharmaceutical importance, paving the way towards an
enhanced fundamental understanding of polymorphic energy landscapes and routine industrial
application of molecular CSP methods.
