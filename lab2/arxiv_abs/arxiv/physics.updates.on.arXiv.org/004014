This paper reports experiments on self$-$excited longitudinal dust acoustic waves (DAWs) and
its propagation characteristics in a magnetized rf discharge plasma. A volumetric dusty plasma
is created by confining the dust particles into a potential well created over the electrode in a capacitively
coupled discharge. An electromagnet introduces the uniform longitudinal magnetic field to the
dust grain medium. The longitudinal DAWs are spontaneously excited in the dusty plasma after adding
more particles in the confining potential well and found to propagate in the direction of streaming
ions. The spontaneous excitation of such low-frequency modes is possible due to the instabilities
associated with streaming ions through the dust grain medium. The background E-field and neutral
pressure determine the stability of excited DAWs. The characteristics of DAWs strongly depend
on the strength of the external magnetic field. The magnetic field of strength B $<$ 0.05 T only modifies
the characteristics of propagating waves in dusty plasma at moderate power and pressure, P = 3.5
W and p = 27 Pa respectively. It is found that the DAWs start to be damped with increasing the magnetic
field beyond B $>$ 0.05 T and get completely damped at higher magnetic field B $\sim$ 0.13 T. After
lowering the power and pressure to 3 W and 23 Pa respectively, the excited DAWs in the absence of B are
highly unstable. In this case, the magnetic field only stabilizes and modifies the propagation
characteristics of DAWs while the strength of B is increased up to 0.1 T or even higher. The modification
of the sheath electric field where particles are confined in the presence of the external magnetic
field is the main cause of the modification and damping of the DAWs in a magnetized rf discharge plasma.
