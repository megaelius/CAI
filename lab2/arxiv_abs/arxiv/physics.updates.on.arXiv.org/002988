Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. It is also the lightest and as such the most
quantum of the elements, in the sense that quantum tunnelling, quantum delocalisation, and zero-point
motion can be important. For practical reasons most computer simulations of materials have not
taken such effects into account, rather they have treated atomic nuclei as classical point-like
particles. However, it is an exciting time for the theory and simulation of materials and thanks
to significant methodological developments over the last few decades, nuclear quantum effects
can now be accurately treated in complex materials. In this brief review we discuss our recent studies
on the role nuclear quantum effects play in hydrogen containing systems. We give examples of how
the quantum nature of the nuclei has a significant impact on the location of the boundaries between
phases in high pressure condensed hydrogen, including a dramatic lowering of the solid to liquid
melting line. We show how nuclear quantum effects facilitate the dissociative adsorption of molecular
hydrogen on solid surfaces and the diffusion of atomic hydrogen across surfaces; effects that are
of relevance to the catalytic performance of the surfaces. Finally, we discuss how nuclear quantum
effects alter the strength and structure of hydrogen bonds, including the hydrogen bonds in DNA.
Overall these studies demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects can manifest in many different,
interesting, and at times non-intuitive ways. Whilst historically it has been difficult to know
in advance what influence nuclear quantum effects will have, some of the important conceptual foundations
have now started to emerge.
