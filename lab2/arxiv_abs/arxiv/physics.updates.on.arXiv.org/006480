Instruction is unlikely to be effective if instructors do not know the common alternate conceptions
of introductory physics students and explicitly take into account common student difficulties
in their instructional design. Here, we discuss research involving the Conceptual Survey of Electricity
and Magnetism (CSEM) to evaluate one aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge of teaching assistants
(TAs): knowledge of introductory students' alternate conceptions in electricity and magnetism
as revealed by the CSEM. For each item on the CSEM, the TAs were asked to identify the most common incorrect
answer choice selected by introductory physics students if they did not know the correct answer
after traditional instruction. Then, we used introductory student CSEM post-test data to assess
the extent to which TAs were able to identify the most common alternate conception of introductory
students in each question on the CSEM. We find that the TAs were thoughtful when attempting to identify
common student difficulties and they enjoyed learning about student difficulties this way. However,
they struggled to identify many common difficulties of introductory students that persist after
traditional instruction. We discuss specific alternate conceptions that persist after traditional
instruction, the extent to which TAs were able to identify them, and results from think-aloud interviews
with TAs which provided valuable information regarding why the TAs sometimes selected certain
alternate conceptions as the most common but were instead very rare among introductory students.
We also discuss how tasks such as the one used in this study can be used in professional development
programs to engender productive discussions about the importance of being knowledgeable about
student alternate conceptions in order to help students learn.
