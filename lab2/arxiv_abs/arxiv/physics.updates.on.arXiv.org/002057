Dam breach models are commonly used to predict outflow hydrographs of potentially failing dams
and are key ingredients for evaluating flood risk. In this paper a new dam breach modeling framework
is introduced that shall improve the reliability of hydrograph predictions of homogeneous earthen
embankment dams. Striving for a small number of parameters, the simplified physics-based model
describes the processes of failing embankment dams by breach enlargement, driven by progressive
surface erosion. Therein the erosion rate of dam material is modeled by empirical sediment transport
formulations. Embedding the model into a Bayesian multilevel framework allows for quantitative
analysis of different categories of uncertainties. To this end, data available in literature of
observed peak discharge and final breach width of historical dam failures was used to perform model
inversion by applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. Prior knowledge is mainly based on non-informative
distribution functions. The resulting posterior distribution shows that the main source of uncertainty
is a correlated subset of parameters, consisting of the residual error term and the epistemic term
quantifying the breach erosion rate. The prediction intervals of peak discharge and final breach
width are congruent with values known from literature. To finally predict the outflow hydrograph
for real case applications, an alternative residual model was formulated that assumes perfect
data and a perfect model. The fully probabilistic fashion of hydrograph prediction has the potential
to improve the adequate risk management of downstream flooding.
