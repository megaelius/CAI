Different observations of a relation between inputs ("sources") and outputs ("targets") are often
reported in terms of histograms (discretizations of the source and the target densities). Transporting
these densities to each other provides insight regarding the underlying relation. In (forward)
uncertainty quantification, one typically studies how the distribution of inputs to a system affects
the distribution of the system responses. Here, we focus on the identification of the system (the
transport map) itself, once the input and output distributions are determined, and suggest a modification
of current practice by including data from what we call "an observation process". We hypothesize
that there exists a smooth manifold underlying the relation; the sources and the targets are then
partial observations (possibly projections) of this manifold. Knowledge of such a manifold implies
knowledge of the relation, and thus of "the right" transport between source and target observations.
When the source-target observations are not bijective (when the manifold is not the graph of a function
over both observation spaces, either because folds over them give rise to density singularities,
or because it marginalizes over several observables), recovery of the manifold is obscured. Using
ideas from attractor reconstruction in dynamical systems, we demonstrate how additional information
in the form of short histories of an observation process can help us recover the underlying manifold.
The types of additional information employed and the relation to optimal transport based solely
on density observations is illustrated and discussed, along with limitations in the recovery of
the true underlying relation.
