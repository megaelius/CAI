This review gives an overview of the development of machine learning in geoscience. A thorough analysis
of the co-developments of machine learning applications throughout the last 70 years relates the
recent enthusiasm for machine learning to developments in geoscience. I explore the shift of kriging
towards a mainstream machine learning method and the historic application of neural networks in
geoscience, following the general trend of machine learning enthusiasm through the decades. Furthermore,
this chapter explores the shift from mathematical fundamentals and knowledge in software development
towards skills in model validation, applied statistics, and integrated subject matter expertise.
The review is interspersed with code examples to complement the theoretical foundations and illustrate
model validation and machine learning explainability for science. The scope of this review includes
various shallow machine learning methods, e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support-Vector
Machines, and Gaussian Processes, as well as, deep neural networks, including feed-forward neural
networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial
networks. Regarding geoscience, the review has a bias towards geophysics but aims to strike a balance
with geochemistry, geostatistics, and geology, however excludes remote sensing, as this would
exceed the scope. In general, I aim to provide context for the recent enthusiasm surrounding deep
learning with respect to research, hardware, and software developments that enable successful
application of shallow and deep machine learning in all disciplines of Earth science.
