Structural engineering of van der Waals heterostructures via stacking and twisting has recently
been used to create moir\'e superlattices, enabling the realization of new optical and electronic
properties in solid-state systems. In particular, moir\'e lattices in twisted bilayers of transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been shown to lead to exciton trapping, host Mott insulating
and superconducting states, and act as unique Hubbard systems whose correlated electronic states
can be detected and manipulated optically. Structurally, these twisted heterostructures also
feature atomic reconstruction and domain formation. Unfortunately, due to the nanoscale sizes
(~10 nm) of typical moir\'e domains, the effects of atomic reconstruction on the electronic and
excitonic properties of these heterostructures could not be investigated systematically and
have often been ignored. Here, we use near-0$^o$ twist angle MoSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ bilayers with large
rhombohedral AB/BA domains to directly probe excitonic properties of individual domains with
far-field optics. We show that this system features broken mirror/inversion symmetry, with the
AB and BA domains supporting interlayer excitons with out-of-plane (z) electric dipole moments
in opposite directions. The dipole orientation of ground-state $\Gamma$-K interlayer excitons
(X$_{I,1}$) can be flipped with electric fields, while higher-energy K-K interlayer excitons
(X$_{I,2}$) undergo field-asymmetric hybridization with intralayer K-K excitons (X$_0$). Our
study reveals the profound impacts of crystal symmetry on TMD excitons and points to new avenues
for realizing topologically nontrivial systems, exotic metasurfaces, collective excitonic
phases, and quantum emitter arrays via domain-pattern engineering.
