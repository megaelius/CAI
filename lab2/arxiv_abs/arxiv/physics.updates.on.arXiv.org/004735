Purpose: To assess whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) could synthesize realistic
optical coherence tomography (OCT) images that satisfactorily serve as the educational images
for retinal specialists and the training datasets for the classification of various retinal disorders
using deep learning (DL). Methods: The GANs architecture was adopted to synthesis high-resolution
OCT images training on a publicly available OCT dataset including urgent referrals (choroidal
neovascularization and diabetic macular edema) and non-urgent referrals (normal and drusen).
400 real and synthetic OCT images were evaluated by 2 retinal specialists to assess image quality.
We further trained 2 DL models on either real or synthetic datasets and compared the performance
of urgent vs nonurgent referrals diagnosis tested on a local (1000 images from the public dataset)
and clinical validation dataset (278 images from Shanghai Shibei Hospital). Results: The image
quality of real vs synthetic OCT images was similar as assessed by 2 retinal specialists. The accuracy
of discrimination as real vs synthetic OCT images was 59.50% for retinal specialist 1 and 53.67%
for retinal specialist 2. For the local dataset, the DL model trained on real (DL_Model_R) and synthetic
OCT images (DL_Model_S) had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99, and 0.98 respectively. For the
clinical dataset, the AUC was 0.94 for DL_Model_R, 0.90 for DL_Model_S. Conclusions: The GAN-synthetic
OCT images can be used by clinicians for educational purposes and developing DL algorithms. Translational
Relevance: The medical image synthesis based on GANs is promising in human and machine to fulfill
clinical tasks.
