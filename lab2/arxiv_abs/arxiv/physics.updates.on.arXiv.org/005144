We present a description of the new complex installation for the study of extensive air showers which
was created at the Tien Shan mountain cosmic ray station, as well as the results of the test measurements
made there in 2014-2016. At present, the system for registration of electromagnetic shower component
consists of $\sim$100 detector points built on the basis of plastic scintillator plates with the
sensitive area of 0.25m$^2$ and 1m$^2$, spread equidistantly over $\sim$10$^4$m$^2$ space. The
dynamic range of scintillation amplitude measurements is currently about $(3-7)\cdot 10^4$,
and there is a prospect of it being extended up to $\sim$10$^6$. The direction of shower arrival is
defined by signal delays from a number of the scintillators placed cross-wise at the periphery of
the detector system. For the investigation of nuclear active shower components there was created
a multi-tier 55m$^2$ ionization-neutron calorimeter with a sum absorber thickness of $\sim$1000g/cm$^2$,
typical spatial resolution of the order of 10cm, and dynamic range of ionization measurement channel
about $\sim$10$^5$. Also, the use of saturation-free neutron detectors is anticipated for registration
of the high- and low-energy hadron components in the region of shower core. A complex of underground
detectors is designed for the study of muonic and penetrative nuclear-active components of the
shower. The full stack of data acquisition, detector calibration, and shower parameters restoration
procedures are now completed, and the newly obtained shower size spectrum and lateral distribution
of shower particles occur in agreement with conventional data. Future studies in the field of $10^{14}-10^{17}$eV
cosmic ray physics to be held at the new shower installation are discussed.
