A radioactive source in a betavoltaic battery is the most important component as it is the origin
of power. To evaluate energy conversion efficiency of a battery it is necessary to know first the
emitted power density of a source. In this paper, we present a model of Ni-63 source for betavoltaic
batteries. The suggest model predicts performance of Ni-63 source and analyses the effect of physical
and technological factors; active layer thickness, self-absorption and substrate back-scattering.
A Monte Carlo program is elaborated to simulate trajectories of beta particles (electrons) created
in Ni-63 radioactive layer until their escape or total energy dissipation inside the source (substrate,
active or protective layers). With this program, we can compute all source output parameters, such
as; activity energy spectrum and emitted power density. Firstly, the study covers self-absorption
effect, this phenomenon is characterised by Ni-63 attenuation coefficient, which could be extracted
from activity versus thickness curve. This process allow the determination of effective or apparent
source activity. The obtained attenuation coefficient value is in good agreement with empirical
formulas given in literature. The second effect to be investigated is substrate backscattering,
because of the isotropic nature of radioactive source, in an ideal one-sided sources, only about
half of the created beta particles are allowed to exit from surface. Back-scattering contribution
is observable for thin active layers only. Finally, in some cases a protective layer is added to the
emitting surface, this is known to further reduce the source emission because of absorption. Therefore,
its thickness has to be as thin as possible in order to get better source performance.
