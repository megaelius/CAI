We examined the effect of social distancing on changes in visits to urban hotspot points of interest.
Urban hotspots, such as central business districts, are gravity activity centers orchestrating
movement and mobility patterns in cities. In a pandemic situation, urban hotspots could be potential
superspreader areas as visits to urban hotspots can increase the risk of contact and transmission
of a disease among a population. We mapped origin-destination networks from census block groups
to points of interest (POIs) in sixteen cities in the United States. We adopted a coarse-grain approach
to study movement patterns of visits to POIs among the hotspots and non-hotspots from January to
May 2020. Also, we conducted chi-square tests to identify POIs with significant flux-in changes
during the analysis period. The results showed disparate patterns across cities in terms of reduction
in POI visits to hotspot areas. The sixteen cities are divided into two categories based on visits
to POIs in hotspot areas. In one category, which includes the cities of, San Francisco, Seattle,
and Chicago, we observe a considerable decrease in visits to POIs in hotspot areas, while in another
category, including the cites of, Austin, Houston, and San Diego, the visits to hotspot areas did
not greatly decrease during the social distancing period. In addition, while all the cities exhibited
overall decreasing visits to POIs, one category maintained the proportion of visits to POIs in the
hotspots. The proportion of visits to some POIs (e.g., Restaurant and Other Eating Places) remained
stable during the social distancing period, while some POIs had an increased proportion of visits
(e.g., Grocery Stores). The findings highlight that social distancing orders do yield disparate
patterns of reduction in movements to hotspots POIs.
