The paper is devoted to the motion of a body in a fluid under the influence of gravity and drag. Depending
on the regime considered, the drag force can exhibit a linear, quadratic or even more general dependence
on the velocity of the body relative to the fluid. The case of quadratic drag is substantially more
complex than the linear case, as it nonlinearly couples both components of the momentum equation.
Careful screening of the literature on this classical topic showed that, unexpectedly, the solutions
reported do not directly provide the particle velocity as a function of time but use auxiliary quantities
or apply to special cases only. No explicit solution using elementary operations on analytical
expressions is known for a general trajectory. After a detailed account of the literature, the paper
provides such a solution in form of a ratio of two series expansions. This result is discussed in detail
and related to previous approaches. In particular, it is shown to yield, as limiting cases, certain
approximate solutions proposed in the literature. The solution technique employs a strategy to
reduce systems of ordinary differential equations with a triangular dependence of the right-hand
side on the vector of unknowns to a single equation in an auxiliary variable. For the particular case
of quadratic drag, the auxiliary variable allows an interpretation in terms of canonical coordinates
of motion within the framework of Hamiltonian mechanics. Another result of the paper is the extension
of the solution technique to more general drag laws, such as general power laws or power laws with
an additional linear contribution. Furthermore, generalization to variable velocity of the surrounding
fluid is addressed by considering a linear velocity profile for which a solution is provided as well.
Throughout, the results obtained are illustrated by numerical examples.
