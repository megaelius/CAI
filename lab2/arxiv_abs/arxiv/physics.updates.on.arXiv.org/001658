In this work we used fractal statistics in order to decipher the mechanisms acting during explosive
volcanic eruptions by studying the grain size distribution (GSD) of natural pyroclastic-fall
deposits. The method was applied to lithic-rich proximal deposits from a stratigraphic section
of the Cretaio Tephra eruption (Ischia Island, Italy). Analyses were performed separately on bulk
material, juvenile, and lithic fraction from each pyroclastic layer. Results highlight that the
bulk material is characterized by a single scaling regime whereas two scaling regimes, with contrasting
power-law exponents, are observed for the juvenile and the lithic fractions. On the basis of these
results, we infer that the bulk material cannot be considered as a good proxy for deducing eruption
dynamics because it is the result of mixing of fragments belonging to the lithic and juvenile fraction,
both of which underwent different events of fragmentation governed by different mechanisms. In
addition, results from fractal analyses of the lithic fraction suggest that it likely experienced
a fragmentation eventin which the efficiency of fragmentation was larger for the coarser fragments
relative to the finer ones. On the contrary, we interpret the different scaling regimes observed
for the juvenile fraction as due to sequential events of fragmentation in the conduit, possibly
enhanced by the presence of lithic fragments in the eruptive mixture. In particular, collisional
events generated increasing amounts of finer particles modifying the original juvenile GSDs and
determining the development of two scaling regimes in which the finer fragments record a higher
efficiency of fragmentation relative to the coarser ones. We further suggest that in lithic-rich
proximal fall deposits possible indications about the original GSDs of the juvenile fraction might
still reside in the coarser particles fraction.
