A three-dimensional (3D) photonic band gap crystal is an ideal tool to completely inhibit the local
density of optical states (LDOS) at every position in the crystal throughout the band gap. This notion,
however, pertains to ideal infinite crystals, whereas any real crystal device is necessarily finite.
This raises the question as to how the LDOS in the gap depends on the position and orientation inside
a finite-size crystal. Therefore, we employ rigorous numerical calculations using finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) simulations of 3D silicon inverse woodpile crystals filled with air or with
toluene, as previously studied in experiments. %%{\color{blue}In order to quantify the position
and polarization dependence, we analyze the calculated LDOS inside the crystal in terms of the exponential
decay model and show how the observed characteristic decay length of the LDOS and its amplitude can
be related with the band structure calculations performed for the infinite crystal.} We find that
the LDOS versus position decreases exponentially into the bulk of the crystal. From the dependence
on dipole orientation, we infer that the characteristic LDOS decay length $\ell_{\rho}$ is mostly
related to far-field dipolar radiation effects, whereas the prefactor is mostly related to near-field
dipolar effects. The LDOS decay length has a remarkably similar magnitude as the Bragg length for
directional transport, which suggests that the LDOS in the crystal is dominated by vacuum states
that tunnel from the closest interface towards the position of interest. Our work leads to design
rules for applications of 3D photonic band gaps in emission control and lighting, quantum information
processing, and in photovoltaics.
