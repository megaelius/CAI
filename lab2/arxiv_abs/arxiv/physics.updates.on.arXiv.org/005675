Fast procedures for the beam quality assessment and for the monitoring of beam energy modulations
during the irradiation are among the most urgent improvements in particle therapy. Indeed, the
online measurement of the particle beam energy could allow assessing the range of penetration during
treatments, encouraging the development of new dose delivery techniques for moving targets. Towards
this end, the proof of concept of a new device, able to measure in a few seconds the energy of clinical
proton beams (from 60 to 230 MeV) from the Time of Flight (ToF) of protons, is presented. The prototype
consists of two Ultra Fast Silicon Detector (UFSD) pads, featuring an active thickness of 80 um and
a sensitive area of 3 x 3 mm2, aligned along the beam direction in a telescope configuration, connected
to a broadband amplifier and readout by a digitizer. Measurements were performed at the Centro Nazionale
di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO, Pavia, Italy), at five different clinical beam energies and four
distances between the sensors (from 7 to 97 cm) for each energy. In order to derive the beam energy
from the measured average ToF, several systematic effects were considered, Monte Carlo simulations
were developed to validate the method and a global fit approach was adopted to calibrate the system.
The results were benchmarked against the energy values obtained from the water equivalent depths
provided by CNAO. Deviations of few hundreds of keV have been achieved for all considered proton
beam energies for both 67 and 97 cm distances between the sensors and few seconds of irradiation were
necessary to collect the required statistics. These preliminary results indicate that a telescope
of UFSDs could achieve in a few seconds the accuracy required for the clinical application and therefore
encourage further investigations towards the improvement and the optimization of the present
prototype.
