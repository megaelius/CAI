We proposed a fully automatic workflow for glioblastoma (GBM) survival prediction using deep learning
(DL) methods. 285 glioma (210 GBM, 75 low-grade glioma) patients were included. 163 of the GBM patients
had overall survival (OS) data. Every patient had four pre-operative MR scans and manually drawn
tumor contours. For automatic tumor segmentation, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) was
trained and validated using 122 glioma patients. The trained model was applied to the remaining
163 GBM patients to generate tumor contours. The handcrafted and DL-based radiomic features were
extracted from auto-contours using explicitly designed algorithms and a pre-trained CNN respectively.
163 GBM patients were randomly split into training (n=122) and testing (n=41) sets for survival
analysis. Cox regression models with regularization techniques were trained to construct the
handcrafted and DL-based signatures. The prognostic power of the two signatures was evaluated
and compared. The 3D CNN achieved an average Dice coefficient of 0.85 across 163 GBM patients for
tumor segmentation. The handcrafted signature achieved a C-index of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55-0.73),
while the DL-based signature achieved a C-index of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57-0.77). Unlike the handcrafted
signature, the DL-based signature successfully stratified testing patients into two prognostically
distinct groups (p-value<0.01, HR=2.80, 95% CI: 1.26-6.24). The proposed 3D CNN generated accurate
GBM tumor contours from four MR images. The DL-based signature resulted in better GBM survival prediction,
in terms of higher C-index and significant patient stratification, than the handcrafted signature.
The proposed automatic radiomic workflow demonstrated the potential of improving patient stratification
and survival prediction in GBM patients.
