Gas modulation refractometry (GAMOR) is a technique based on a dual-Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity (DFPC)
for assessment of gas refractivity, density, and pressure that can alleviate significant limitations
of conventional refractometry systems, predominantly those related to drifts. Repeated assessments
of the beat frequency when the measurement cavity is evacuated provide conditions under which the
methodology is immune to the linear parts of the drifts in the system, both those from length changes
of the cavities and those from gas leaks and outgassing. This implies that the technique is solely
influenced by the non-linear parts of the drifts. This work provides a description of the principle
behind the GAMOR methodology and explicates the background to its unique property. Based on simple
models of the drifts of the temperature in the cavity spacer and the residual gas in the reference
cavity, this work predicts that a GAMOR system, when used for assessment of refractivity, can sustain
significant temperature drifts and leakage rates without being affected by noticeable errors
or uncertainties. The cavity spacer can be exposed to temperature fluctuations of 100 mK over 103
s, and the reference cavity can have a leakage that fills it up with gas on a timescale of days, without
providing errors or uncertainties in the assessment of refractivity that are 3 x 10^(-12), which,
for N2, corresponds to 0.01 ppm (parts per million) of the value under atmospheric pressure conditions,
and thereby 1 mPa. Since well-designed systems often have temperature fluctuations and leakage
rates that are smaller than these, it is concluded that there will, in practice, not be any appreciable
influence from cavity length drifts, gas leaks, and outgassing in the GAMOR methodology.
