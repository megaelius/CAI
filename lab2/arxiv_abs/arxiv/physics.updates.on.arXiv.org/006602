The term ``resilience'' is increasingly being used in the domain of complex systems science and
related fields. However, debated concepts and a certain vagueness of proposed definitions can
lead to misunderstandings and impede their application to systems modelling. We propose an approach
that aims to ease communication as well as to support systematic development of research questions
and models in the context of resilience. It can be applied independently of the modelling framework
or underlying system theory of choice. At the heart of this guideline is a checklist consisting of
four questions to be answered: (i) Resilience of what?, (ii) Resilience regarding what?, (iii)
Resilience against what?, and (iv) resilience how? We refer to the answers to these resilience questions
as the ``system'', the ``sustainant'', the ``adverse influence'', and the ``response options''.
The term ``sustainant'' is a neologism describing the feature of the system (state, structure,
function, pathway,...) that should be maintained (or restored quickly enough) in order to call
the system resilient. The use of this proposed guideline is demonstrated for three different application
examples: An electricity transmission system, a fishery system, and the Amazon rainforest. The
examples illustrate the diversity of possible answers to the checklist's questions as well as their
benefits in structuring the modelling process. The guideline supports the modeller in communicating
precisely what is actually meant by resilience in a specific context. This combination of freedom
and precision could help to advance the resilience discourse by building a bridge between those
demanding unambiguous definitions and those stressing the benefits of generality and flexibility
of the resilience concept.
