Turbulence in an accretion disk launches Alfv\'en waves (AWs) that propagate away from the disk
along magnetic field lines. Because the Alfv\'en speed varies with distance from the disk, the AWs
undergo partial non-WKB reflection, and counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing
AW energy to cascade to small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an
Elsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the theory of general
relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then derive a set of equations for the mean-square
AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent heating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame,
AWs propagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating toward the disk.
For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and time-independent, we solve these equations
analytically to determine $M_+$ and $Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized
thin disk threaded by a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\sim (\rho_{\rm
b}/\rho_{\rm d})^{1/2} \beta_{\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's radiative flux, where $\rho_{\rm
b}$ and $\rho_{\rm d}$ are the mass densities at the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively,
and $\beta_{\rm net,d}$ is the ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation
pressure to the pressure of the average vertical magnetic field. This energy flux could have a significant
impact on disk coronae and outflows. To lay the groundwork for future global simulations of turbulent
disk coronae and jets, we derive a set of averaged GRMHD equations that account for reflection-driven
AW turbulence using a sub-grid model.
