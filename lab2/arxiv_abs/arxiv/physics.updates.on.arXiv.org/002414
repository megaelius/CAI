The molecular polarizability describes the tendency of a molecule to deform or polarize in response
to an applied electric field. As such, this quantity governs key intra- and inter-molecular interactions
such as induction and dispersion, plays a key role in determining the spectroscopic signatures
of molecules, and is an essential ingredient in polarizable force fields and other empirical models
for collective interactions. Compared to other ground-state properties, an accurate and reliable
prediction of the molecular polarizability is considerably more difficult as this response quantity
is quite sensitive to the description of the underlying molecular electronic structure. In this
work, we present state-of-the-art quantum mechanical calculations of the static dipole polarizability
tensors of 7,211 small organic molecules computed using linear-response coupled-cluster singles
and doubles theory (LR-CCSD). Using a symmetry-adapted machine-learning based approach, we demonstrate
that it is possible to predict the molecular polarizability with LR-CCSD accuracy at a negligible
computational cost. The employed model is quite robust and transferable, yielding molecular polarizabilities
for a diverse set of 52 larger molecules (which includes challenging conjugated systems, carbohydrates,
small drugs, amino acids, nucleobases, and hydrocarbon isomers) at an accuracy that exceeds that
of hybrid density functional theory (DFT). The atom-centered decomposition implicit in our machine-learning
approach offers some insight into the shortcomings of DFT in the prediction of this fundamental
quantity of interest.
