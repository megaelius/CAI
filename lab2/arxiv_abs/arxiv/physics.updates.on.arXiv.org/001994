Although the stability properties of the wake past impervious bluff bodies have been widely examined
in the literature, similar analyses regarding the flow around and through porous ones are still
lacking. In this work, the effect of the porosity and permeability on the wake patterns of porous
rectangular cylinders is numerically investigated at low to moderate Reynolds numbers in the framework
of direct numerical simulation combined with local and global stability analyses. A modified Darcy-Brinkman
formulation is employed here so as to describe the flow behavior inside the porous media, where also
the convective terms are retained to correctly account for the inertial effects at high values of
permeability. Different aspect ratios of the cylinder are considered, varying the thickness-to-height
ratios, t/d, from 0.01 (flat plate) to 1.0 (square cylinder). The results show that the permeability
of the bodies has a strong effect in modifying the characteristics of the wakes and of the associated
flow instabilities, while the porosity weakly affects the resulting flow patterns. In particular,
the fluid flows through the porous bodies and, thus, as the permeability is progressively increased,
the recirculation regions, initially attached to the rear part of the bodies, at first detach from
the body and, eventually, disappear even in the near wakes. Global stability analyses lead to the
identification of critical values of the permeability above which any linear instability is prevented.
Moreover, a different scaling of the non-dimensional permeability allows to identify a general
threshold for all the configurations here studied that ensures the suppression of vortex shedding,
at least in the considered parameter space.
