Interactions of protons with nuclei are modeled in a form that is suitable for Monte Carlo simulation
of proton transport. The differential cross section (DCS) for elastic collisions of protons with
neutral atoms is expressed as the product of the Rutherford DCS, which describes scattering by a
bare point nucleus, and two correction factors that account for the screening of the nuclear charge
by the atomic electrons and for the effect of the structure of the nucleus. The screening correction
is obtained by considering the scattering of the projectile by an atom with a point nucleus and the
atomic electron cloud described by a parameterization of the Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater self-consistent
electron density. The DCS for scattering by this point nucleus atom is calculated by means of the
eikonal approximation. The nuclear correction to the DCS for elastic collisions is calculated
by conventional partial-wave analysis with a global optical-model potential that describes the
interaction with the bare nucleus. Inelastic interactions of the projectile with target nuclei
are described by using information from data files in ENDF-6 format, which provide cross sections,
multiplicities, and angle-energy distributions of all reaction products: light ejectiles (neutrons,
protons, . . . ), gammas, as well as recoiling heavy residuals. These interaction data have been used
in the Monte Carlo transport code PENH, an extension of the electron-gamma code PENELOPE, which
originally accounted for electromagnetic interactions only. The combined code system PENH/PENELOPE
performs simulations of coupled electron-photon-proton transport. A few examples of simulation
results are presented to reveal the influence of nuclear interactions on proton transport processes
and on the calculation of dose distributions from proton beams.
