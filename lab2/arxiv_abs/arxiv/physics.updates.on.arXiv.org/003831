Regression of data generated in simulations or experiments has important implications in sensitivity
studies, uncertainty analysis, and prediction accuracy. Depending on the nature of the physical
model, data points may not be evenly distributed. It is not often practical to choose all points for
regression of a model because it doesn't always guarantee a better fit. Fitness of the model is highly
dependent on the number of data points and the distribution of the data along the curve. In this study,
the effect of the number of points selected for regression is investigated and various schemes aimed
to process regression data points are explored. Time series data i.e., output varying with time,
is our prime interest mainly the temperature profile from enhanced geothermal system. The objective
of the research is to find a better scheme for choosing a fraction of data points from the entire set
to find a better fitness of the model without losing any features or trends in the data. A workflow
is provided to summarize the entire protocol of data preprocessing, regression of mathematical
model using training data, model testing, and error analysis. Six different schemes are developed
to process data by setting criteria such as equal spacing along axes (X and Y), equal distance between
two consecutive points on the curve, constraint in the angle of curvature, etc. As an example for
the application of the proposed schemes, 1 to 20% of the data generated from the temperature change
of a typical geothermal system is chosen from a total of 9939 points. It is shown that the number of
data points, to a degree, has negligible effect on the fitted model depending on the scheme. The proposed
data processing schemes are ranked in terms of R2 and NRMSE values.
