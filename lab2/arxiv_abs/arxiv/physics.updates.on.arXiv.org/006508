Simultaneous real-time fMRI and EEG neurofeedback (rtfMRI-EEG-nf) is an emerging neuromodulation
approach, that enables simultaneous volitional regulation of both hemodynamic (BOLD fMRI) and
electrophysiological (EEG) brain activities. Here we report the first application of rtfMRI-EEG-nf
for emotion self-regulation training in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In this
proof-of-concept study, MDD patients in the experimental group (n=16) used rtfMRI-EEG-nf during
a happy emotion induction task to simultaneously upregulate two fMRI and two EEG activity measures
relevant to MDD. The target measures included BOLD activities of the left amygdala (LA) and left
rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), and frontal EEG asymmetries in the alpha band (FAA, [7.5-12.5]
Hz) and high-beta band (FBA, [21-30] Hz). MDD patients in the control group (n=8) were provided with
sham feedback signals. An advanced procedure for improved real-time EEG-fMRI artifact correction
was implemented. The experimental group participants demonstrated significant upregulation
of the LA BOLD activity, FAA, and FBA during the rtfMRI-EEG-nf task, as well as significant enhancement
in fMRI connectivity between the LA and left rACC. Average individual FAA changes during the rtfMRI-EEG-nf
task positively correlated with depression and anhedonia severities, and negatively correlated
with after-vs-before changes in depressed mood ratings. Temporal correlations between the FAA
and FBA time courses and the LA BOLD activity were significantly enhanced during the rtfMRI-EEG-nf
task. The experimental group participants reported significant mood improvements after the training.
Our results suggest that the rtfMRI-EEG-nf may have potential for treatment of MDD.
