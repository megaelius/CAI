In October 2017, the first interstellar object within our solar system was discovered. Today designated
1I/'Oumuamua, it shows characteristics that have never before been observed in a celestial body.
Due to these characteristics, an in-situ investigation of 1I would be of extraordinary scientific
value. Previous studies have demonstrated that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible using current
and near-term technologies however with an anticipated launch date of 2020-2021, this is too soon
to be realistic. This paper aims at addressing the question of the feasibility of a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua
in 2024 and beyond. Using the OITS trajectory simulation tool, various scenarios are analyzed,
including a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, a Jupiter powered flyby, and more complex
flyby schemes including a Mars and Venus flyby. With a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver,
we identify a trajectory to 1I/'Oumuamua with a launch date in 2033, a total velocity increment of
18.2 km/s, and arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2048. With an additional deep space maneuver before the
powered Jupiter flyby, a trajectory with a launch date in 2030, a total velocity increment of 15.3
km/s, and an arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2052 were identified. Both launch dates would provide over
a decade for spacecraft development, in contrast to the previously identified 2020-2021 launch
dates. Furthermore, the distance from the Sun at the Oberth burn is at 5 Solar radii. This results
in heat flux values, which are of the same order of magnitude as for the Parker Solar Probe. We conclude
that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible, using existing and near-term technologies and there
is sufficient time for developing such a mission.
