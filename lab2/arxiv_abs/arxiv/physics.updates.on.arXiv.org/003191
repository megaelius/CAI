Radiation therapy of thoracic and abdominal tumors requires incorporating the respiratory motion
into treatments. To precisely account for the patient respiratory motions and predict the respiratory
signals, a generalized model for predictions of different types of respiratory motions is desired.
The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of developing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based
model for the respiratory signal prediction. To achieve that, 1703 sets of Real-Time Position Management
data were collected from retrospective studies across three clinical institutions. These datasets
were separated as the training, internal validity and external validity groups. 1187 datasets
were used for model development and the remaining 516 datasets were used to test the generality power
of the model. Furthermore, an exhaustive grid search was implemented to find the optimal hyper-parameters
of the LSTM model. The hyper-parameters are the number of LSTM layers, the number of hidden units,
the optimizer, the learning rate, the number of epochs, and the length of time lags. Our model achieved
superior accuracy over conventional artificial neural network models: with a prediction window
of 500ms, the LSTM model achieved an average relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.037, an average
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.048, and a Maximum Error (ME) of 1.687 in the internal validity
data, and an average relative MAE of 0.112, an average RMSE of 0.139 and an ME of 1.811 in the external
validity data. Compared to the LSTM model trained with default hyper-parameters, the MAE of the
optimized model results decreased by 20%, indicating the importance of tuning the hyper-parameters
of LSTM models to obtain superior accuracy. This study demonstrates the potential of deep LSTM models
for the respiratory signal prediction and illustrates the impacts of major hyper-parameters in
LSTM models.
