First predictive simulations of deuterium shattered pellet injection (SPI) into an ASDEX Upgrade
H-Mode plasma obtained using the non-linear extended MHD code JOREK are presented. It is evaluated
how various physical parameters corresponding to the plasma and SPI injection affect the MHD activity
and thermal quench (TQ) dynamics. The influence of MHD onto the ablation of the pellet shards is shown.
A TQ is obtained quickly after injection in many simulations with a typical TQ duration of 100 microseconds.
In the considered case with an initial central safety factor q above unity, the core TQ takes place
in the absence of a q=1 surface. Although the n=1 magnetic perturbation dominates in all simulations
(single injection), toroidal harmonics up to n=10 provide an important contribution to the stochastization
and stochastic transport in the plasma core. Right after the TQ, the density profile remains hollow
for a few hundred microseconds. However, at the time when intact flux surfaces re-form around the
magnetic axis, the density has become monotonic again suggesting a beneficial behaviour for runaway
electron avoidance/mitigation. With $10^{21}$ atoms injected, the TQ is typically incomplete
and triggered when the pellet shards reach the q=2 rational surface. At a larger number of injected
atoms, the TQ can set in even before the shards reach this surface. For low field side injection considered
here, a repeated formation of strong outward convection cells is observed in the ablation region.
This results from a sudden rise of pressure in the high density cloud whenever the stochastic region
expands further inwards such that heat is released from the hot plasma core. After the TQ, strong
sheared poloidal rotation is created by Maxwell stress, which contributes to the re-formation
of flux surfaces by decoupling modes at different rational surfaces. An outlook to future work is
given.
