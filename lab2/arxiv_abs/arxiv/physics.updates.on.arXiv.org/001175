Although compelling assessments have been examined in recent years, more studies are required
to yield a better understanding of the several methods where assessment techniques significantly
affect student learning process. Most of the educational research in this area does not consider
demographics data, differing methodologies, and notable sample size. To address these drawbacks,
the objective of our study is to analyse student learning outcomes of multiple assessment formats
for a web-facilitated in-class section with an asynchronous online class of a core data communications
course in the Undergraduate IT program of the Information Sciences and Technology (IST) Department
at George Mason University (GMU). In this study, students were evaluated based on course assessments
such as home and lab assignments, skill-based assessments, and traditional midterm and final exams
across all four sections of the course. All sections have equivalent content, assessments, and
teaching methodologies. Student demographics such as exam type and location preferences are considered
in our study to determine whether they have any impact on their learning approach. Large amount of
data from the learning management system (LMS), Blackboard (BB) Learn, had to be examined to compare
the results of several assessment outcomes for all students within their respective section and
amongst students of other sections. To investigate the effect of dissimilar assessment formats
on student performance, we had to correlate individual question formats with the overall course
grade. The results show that collective assessment formats allow students to be effective in demonstrating
their knowledge.
