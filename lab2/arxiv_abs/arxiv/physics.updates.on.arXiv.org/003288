We consider a recently introduced $D$-dimensional generalized Kuramoto model for many $(N\gg
1)$ interacting agents in which the agent states are $D$-dimensional unit vectors. It was previously
shown that, for even $D$, similar to the original Kuramoto model ($D=2$), there exists a continuous
dynamical phase transition from incoherence to coherence of the time asymptotic attracting state
as the coupling parameter $K$ increases through a critical value $K_c^{(+)}>0$. We consider this
transition from the point of view of the stability of an incoherent state, i.e., where the $N\to\infty$
distribution function is time-independent and the macroscopic order parameter is zero. In contrast
with $D=2$, for even $D>2$ there is an infinity of possible incoherent equilibria, each of which
becomes unstable with increasing $K$ at a different point $K=K_c$. We show that there are incoherent
equilibria for all $K_c$ within the range $(K_c^{(+)}/2)\leq K_c \leq K_c^{(+)}$. How can the possible
instability of incoherent states arising at $K=K_c<K_c^{(+)}$ be reconciled with the previous
finding that, at large time, the state is always incoherent unless $K>K_c^{(+)}$? We find, for a
given incoherent equilibrium, that, if $K$ is rapidly increased from $K<K_c$ to $K_c<K<K_c^{(+)}$,
due to the instability, a short, macroscopic burst of coherence is observed, which initially grows
exponentially, but then reaches a maximum, past which it decays back into incoherence. After this
decay, we observe that the equilibrium has been reset to one whose $K_c$ value exceeds that of the
increased $K$. Thus this process, which we call `Instability-Mediated Resetting,' leads to an
increase in the effective $K_c$ with continuously increasing $K$, until the equilibrium has been
effectively set to one for which for which $K_c\approx K_c^{(+)}$, leading to a unique critical
point of the time asymptotic state.
