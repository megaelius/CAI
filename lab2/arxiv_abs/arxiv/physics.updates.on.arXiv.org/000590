Constructing and using models are core scientific practices that have gained significant attention
within K-12 and higher education. Although modeling is a broadly applicable process, within physics
education, it has been preferentially applied to the iterative development of broadly applicable
principles (e.g., Newton's laws of motion in introductory mechanics). We review and extend existing
frameworks on modeling to develop a new framework that more naturally describes model-based reasoning
in upper-division physics labs. A significant feature of the new framework is that measurement
tools (in addition to the physical system being studied) are subjected to the process of modeling.
Think-aloud interviews were used to document examples of model-based reasoning in the laboratory
and refine the modeling framework. The interviews showed how students productively applied similar
facets of modeling to the physical system and measurement tools: construction, prediction, interpretation
of data, identification of model limitations, and revision. A modeling perspective reframes many
of the seemingly arbitrary technical details of measurement tools and apparatus as an opportunity
for authentic and engaging scientific sense-making. Further, we show evidence that students may
be challenged in explicitly articulating assumptions in their models of experimental systems.
Finally, we document challenges in model construction due to students' insufficient prior conceptual
understanding. This finding supports the idea that alignment between lecture and lab has dual purposes
of enabling a higher level of engagement in the experiment by building on prior conceptual understanding,
while also supporting students' conceptual development through carrying out the experimental
activities.
