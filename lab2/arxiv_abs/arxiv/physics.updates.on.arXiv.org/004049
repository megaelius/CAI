Complex object wave recovery from single-shot interference pattern is an important practical
problem in interferometry and digital holography. The most popular single-shot interferogram
analysis method involves Fourier filtering of cross-term but this method suffers from poor resolution.
For obtaining full pixel resolution, it is necessary to model the object wave recovery as an optimization
problem. The optimization approach typically involves minimizing a cost function consisting
of a data consistency term and one or more constraint terms. Despite its potential performance advantages,
this method is not used widely due to several tedious and difficult tasks such as empirical tuning
of free parameters. We introduce a new optimization approach Mean gradient descent (MGD) for single-shot
interferogram analysis that is simple to implement, robust and does not require any free parameters.
The MGD iteration does not try to achieve minimization of any cost function but instead aims to reach
a solution point where the data consistency and the constraint terms balance each other. This is
achieved by iteratively progressing the solution in the direction that bisects the descent directions
associated with the error and constraint terms. Numerical illustrations are shown for recovery
of a step phase object from its corresponding off-axis as well as on-axis interferograms simulated
with multiple noise levels. Our results show full pixel resolution as evident from the recovery
of phase step and excellent rms phase accuracy relative to the ground truth phase map. The concept
of MGD as presented here can potentially find applications to wider class of optimization problems.
