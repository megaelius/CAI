We experimentally investigate the influence of finite-size spherical particles in turbulent
flows of a Newtonian and a drag reducing viscoelastic fluid at varying particle volume fractions
and fixed Reynolds number. Experiments are performed in a square duct at a Reynolds number $Re_{2H}$
of nearly $1.1\times10^4$, Weissenberg number $Wi$ for single-phase flow is between 1-2 and results
in a drag-reduction of 43% compared to a Newtonian flow (at the same $Re_{2H}$). Particles are almost
neutrally-buoyant hydrogel spheres having a density ratio of 1.0035$\pm$0.0003 and a duct height
${2H}$ to particle diameter $d_p$ ratio of around 10. We measure flow statistics for four different
volume fractions $\phi$ namely 5, 10, 15 and 20% by using refractive-index-matched Particle Image
Velocimetry (PIV). For both Newtonian Fluid (NF) and Viscoelastic Fluid (VEF), the drag monotonically
increases with $\phi$. For NF, the magnitude of drag increase due to particle addition can be reasonably
estimated using a concentration dependent effective viscosity for volume fractions below 10%.
The drag increase is, however, underestimated at higher $\phi$. For VEF, the absolute value of drag
is lower than NF but, its rate of increase with $\phi$ is higher. Similar to particles in a NF, particles
in VEF tend to migrate towards the center of the duct and form a layer of high concentration at the wall.
Interestingly, relatively higher migration towards the center and lower migration towards the
walls is observed for VEF. The primary Reynolds shear stress reduces with increasing $\phi$ throughout
the duct height for both types of fluid.
