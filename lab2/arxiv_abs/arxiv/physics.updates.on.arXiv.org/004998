Metasurfaces have emerged as a promising technology for the manipulation of electromagnetic waves
within a thin layer. Initially based on narrowband design principles, the field has since expanded
to include broadband achromatic designs, which maintain reflection or refraction angles over
some bandwidth, and broadband dispersive designs, which maintain high efficiency in a broad bandwidth,
but with varying reflection or refraction angle. To date most of these broadband structures were
designed using relatively ad-hoc methods. For planar metallic structures used at microwave and
millimeter waves, there exist rigorous narrowband design methods, based on the equivalent impedance
of the patterned metallic layers. In this work we extend these methods, to show how broadband impedance
functions can be fitted to LC resonance models. This enables the realization of broadband reflective
metasurfaces, using relatively simple geometries. We show the limitations on bandwidth that arise
when using a structure with a single resonance, and the minimum physically realizable frequency,
which is dictated by the substrate properties. We demonstrate that for achromatic metasurfaces,
the required capacitance and inductance values become extreme as the metasurface size increases,
leading to difficulties in realizing them with meta-atoms. Therefore, we apply our method to the
design and realization of a broadband dispersive metasurface, which avoids extreme values. We
perform measurements at millimeter wave frequencies, showing a fractional bandwidth of 18.22\%,
compared to 9.98\% for a reference design based on the more conventional narrowband approach.
