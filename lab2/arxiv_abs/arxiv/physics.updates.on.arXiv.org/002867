Convexity in a network (graph) has been recently defined as a property of each of its subgraphs to
include all shortest paths between the nodes of that subgraph. It can be measured on the scale [0,
1] with 1 being assigned to fully convex networks. The largest convex component of a graph that emerges
after the removal of the least number of edges is called a convex skeleton. It is basically a tree of
cliques, which has been shown to have many interesting features. In this article the notions of convexity
and convex skeletons in the context of scientific collaboration networks are discussed. More specifically,
we analyze the co-authorship networks of Slovenian researchers in computer science, physics,
sociology, mathematics, and economics and extract convex skeletons from them. We then compare
these convex skeletons with the residual graphs (remainders) in terms of collaboration frequency
distributions by various parameters such as the publication year and type, co-authors' birth year,
status, gender, discipline, etc. We also show the top-ranked scientists by four basic centrality
measures as calculated on the original networks and their skeletons and conclude that convex skeletons
may help detect influential scholars that are hardly identifiable in the original collaboration
network. As their inherent feature, convex skeletons retain the properties of collaboration networks.
These include high-level structural properties but also the fact that the same authors are highlighted
by centrality measures. Moreover, the most important ties and thus the most important collaborations
are retained in the skeletons.
