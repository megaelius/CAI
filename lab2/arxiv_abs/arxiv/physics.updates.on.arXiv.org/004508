The MyShake project aims to build a global smartphone seismic network to facilitate large-scale
earthquake early warning and other applications by leveraging the power of crowdsourcing. The
MyShake mobile application first detects earthquake shaking on a single phone. The earthquake
is then confirmed on the MyShake servers using a "network detection" algorithm that is activated
by multiple single-phone detections. In part two of this two paper series, we report the first order
performance of MyShake's Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) capability in various selected locations
around the world. Due to the present sparseness of the MyShake network in most parts of the world,
we use our simulation platform to understand and evaluate the system's performance in various tectonic
settings. We assume that 0.1% of the population has the MyShake mobile application installed on
their smartphone, and use historical earthquakes from the last 20 years to simulate triggering
scenarios with different network configurations in various regions. Then, we run the detection
algorithm with these simulated triggers to understand the performance of the system. The system
performs best in regions featuring high population densities and onshore, upper crustal earthquakes
M<7.0. In these cases, alerts can be generated ~4-6 sec after the origin time, magnitude errors are
within ~0.5 magnitude units, and epicenters are typically within 10 km of true locations. When the
events are offshore or in sparsely populated regions, the alerts are slower and the uncertainties
in magnitude and location increase. Furthermore, even with 0.01% of the population as the MyShake
users, in regions of high population density, the system still performs well for earthquakes larger
than M5.5. For details of the simulation platform and the network detection algorithm, please see
part one of this two paper series.
