Genetic studies have identified associations between gene mutations and clear cell renal cell
carcinoma (ccRCC). Because the complete gene mutational landscape cannot be characterized through
biopsy and sequencing assays for each patient, non-invasive tools are needed to determine the mutation
status for tumors. Radiogenomics may be an attractive alternative tool to identify disease genomics
by analyzing amounts of features extracted from medical images. Most current radiogenomics predictive
models are built based on a single classifier and trained through a single objective. However, since
many classifiers are available, selecting an optimal model is difficult. On the other hand, a single
objective may not be a good measure to guide model training. We proposed a new multi-classifier multi-objective
(MCMO) radiogenomics predictive model. To obtain more reliable prediction results, similarity-based
sensitivity and specificity were defined and considered as the two objective functions simultaneously
during training. To take advantage of different classifiers, the evidential reasoning (ER) approach
was used for fusing the output of each classifier. Additionally, a new similarity-based multi-objective
optimization algorithm (SMO) was developed for training the MCMO to predict ccRCC related gene
mutations (VHL, PBRM1 and BAP1). Preliminary results revealed an association between some quantitative
computed tomography (CT) features and underlying mutations. Using the proposed MCMO model, we
achieved a predictive area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) over 0.86 for
VHL, PBRM1, and BAP1 genes with balanced sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, MCMO outperformed
all the individual classifiers and yielded more reliable results than other optimization algorithms
and commonly used fusion strategies.
