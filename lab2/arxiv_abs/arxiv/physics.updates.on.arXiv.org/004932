Vertically-stacked monolayers of graphene and other atomically-thin 2D materials have attracted
considerable research interest because of their potential in fabricating materials with specifically-designed
properties. Chemical vapor deposition has proved to be an efficient and scalable fabrication method.
However, a lack of mechanistic understanding has hampered efforts to control the fabrication process
beyond empirical trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we develop a general multiscale Burton-Cabrera-Frank
(BCF) type model of the vertical growth of 2D materials to predict the necessary growth conditions
for vertical versus in-plane (monolayer) growth of arbitrarily-shaped layers. This extends previous
work where we developed such a model assuming the layers were fully-faceted (Ye et al., ACS Nano,
11, 12780-12788, 2017). To solve the model numerically, we reformulate the system using the phase-field/diffuse
domain method that enables the equations to be solved in a fixed regular domain. We use a second-order
accurate, adaptive finite-difference/nonlinear multigrid algorithm to discretize and solve
the discrete system. We investigate the effect of parameters, including the van der Waals interaction
energies between the layers, the kinetic attachment rates, the edge-energies and the deposition
flux, on layer growth and morphologies. While the conditions that favor vertical growth generally
follow an analytic thermodynamic criterion we derived for circular layers, the layer boundaries
may develop significant curvature during growth, consistent with experimental observations.
Our approach provides a mechanistic framework for controlling and optimizing the growth multilayered
2D materials.
