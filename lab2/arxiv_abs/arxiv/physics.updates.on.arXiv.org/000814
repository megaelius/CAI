Conventional microwave imaging schemes, enabled by the ubiquity of coherent sources and detectors,
have traditionally relied on frequency bandwidth to retrieve range information, while using mechanical
or electronic beamsteering to obtain cross-range information. This approach has resulted in complex
and expensive hardware when extended to large-scale systems requiring ultrawide bandwidth. Relying
on bandwidth can create difficulties in calibration, alignment, and imaging of dispersive objects.
We present an alternative approach using an electrically-large, dynamically reconfigurable,
metasurface antenna that generates spatially-distinct radiation patterns as a function of tuning
state. The metasurface antenna comprises a waveguide feeding an array of metamaterial radiators,
each of whose properties can be modified by applying a voltage to a diode integrated into the element.
By deploying two of these apertures, one as the transmitter and one as the receiver, we realize sufficient
spatial diversity to alleviate the dependence on frequency bandwidth and obtain both range and
cross-range information using measurements at a single frequency. We demonstrate the method experimentally,
using one-dimensional dynamic metasurface apertures and reconstructing various two-dimensional
scenes (range and cross-range). Furthermore, we modify a conventional microwave imaging technique---the
range migration algorithm---to be compatible with such configurations, resulting in an imaging
system that is fast and simple in both software and hardware. The imaging scheme presented in this
paper has broad application to radio frequency imaging, including security screening, through-wall
imaging, biomedical diagnostics, and synthetic aperture radar.
