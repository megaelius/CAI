Droplet impact on solid surfaces is a fluid phenomenon widely involved in additive manufacturing,
heat management, and coating, in which the ability to exert control over the impact dynamics and
duration is critical. While past studies have established a comprehensive understanding of the
impact on flat substrates, what we know about the impact dynamics on curved solid surfaces is still
limited. This work aims to elucidate the physics of droplet impact on spherical targets with different
radii and surface wettability using a combination of axisymmetric lattice Boltzmann method (LBM)
and theoretical analysis. The model developed in our previous work [H. Dalgamoni and X. Yong, Phys.
Rev. E 98, 13102 (2018)] was extended and modified for simulating the normal impact of droplet on
curved substrates in the low Weber number regime, in which axisymmetric assumption of droplet deformation
holds. The LBM simulations show that the surface geometry and wettability significantly affect
the spreading and recoiling of droplet during impact. The parametric studies uncover five outcomes
of impact, which range from complete deposition to total rebound. A simulation-predicted phase
diagram was constructed and correlated with the total time that the droplet was in contact with the
solid. In addition, a theoretical model based on energy budget during impact was developed to predict
the rebound threshold when varying the target radius and wettability independently, which agrees
well with simulation results. These findings provide fundamental insight into surface structure
design for controlling droplet hydrodynamics and the contact time during impact.
