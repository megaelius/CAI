The effects of isothermal stratification strength on vorticity dynamics for single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor
instability (RTI) are examined using two dimensional fully compressible wavelet-based direct
numerical simulations. The simulations model low Atwood number ($A=0.04$) RTI development for
four different stratification strengths, corresponding to Mach numbers from 0.3 (weakly stratified)
to 1.2 (strongly stratified), and for three different perturbation Reynolds numbers, from 5,000
to 20,000. All simulations use adaptive wavelet-based mesh refinement to achieve very fine spatial
resolutions at relatively low computational cost. For all stratifications, the bubble and spike
go through the exponential growth regime, followed by a slowing of the RTI evolution. For the weakest
stratification, this slow-down is then followed by a re-acceleration, while for stronger stratifications
the suppression of RTI growth continues. Bubble and spike asymmetries are observed for weak stratifications,
with bubble and spike growth rates becoming increasingly similar as the stratification strength
increases. For the range of cases studied, there is relatively little effect of Reynolds number
on bubble and spike heights, although the formation of secondary vortices becomes more pronounced
as Reynolds number increases. The underlying dynamics are analyzed in detail through an examination
of the vorticity transport equation, revealing that incompressible baroclinicity drives RTI
growth for small and moderate stratifications, but increasingly leads to the suppression of vorticity
production and RTI growth for stronger stratifications. These variations in baroclinicity are
used to explain the suppression of RTI growth for strong stratifications, as well as the anomalous
asymmetry in bubble and spike growth rates for weak stratifications.
