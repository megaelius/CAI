Direct numerical simulations, performed with a high-order spectral-element method, are used
to study coherent structures in turbulent pipe flow at friction Reynolds numbers $Re_{\tau} = 180$
and $550$. The database was analysed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) to
identify energetically dominant coherent structures, most of which turn out to be streaks and quasi-streamwise
vortices. To understand how such structures can be modelled, the linear flow responses to harmonic
forcing were computed using the singular value decomposition of the resolvent operator, using
the mean field as a base flow. The SPOD and resolvent analysis were calculated for several combinations
of frequencies and wavenumbers, allowing to map out the similarities between SPOD modes and optimal
responses for a wide range of relevant scales in turbulent pipe flows. In order to explore physical
reasons behind the agreement between both methods, an indicator of lift-up mechanism in the resolvent
analysis was introduced, activated when optimal forcing represents quasi-streamwise vortices
and associated response corresponds to streaks. Good agreement between leading SPOD and resolvent
modes is observed in a large region of parameter space. In this region, a significant gain separation
is found in resolvent analysis, which may be attributed to the strong amplification associated
with the lift-up mechanism. For both Reynolds numbers, the observed concordances were generally
for structures with large energy in the buffer layer. The results highlight resolvent analysis
as a pertinent reduced-order model for coherent structures in wall-bounded turbulence, particularly
for streamwise elongated structures corresponding to near-wall streamwise vortices and streaks.
