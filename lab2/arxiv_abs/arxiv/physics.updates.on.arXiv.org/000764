Thermal noise is expected to be one of the noise sources limiting the astrophysical reach of Advanced
LIGO (once commissioning is complete) and third-generation detectors. Adopting crystalline
materials for thin, reflecting mirror coatings, rather than the amorphous coatings used in current-generation
detectors, could potentially reduce thermal noise. Understanding and reducing thermal noise
requires accurate theoretical models, but modeling thermal noise analytically is especially
challenging with crystalline materials. Thermal noise models typically rely on the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, which relates the power spectral density of the thermal noise to an auxiliary elastic problem.
In this paper, we present results from a new, open-source tool that numerically solves the auxiliary
elastic problem to compute the Brownian thermal noise for both amorphous and crystalline coatings.
We employ open-source frameworks to solve the auxiliary elastic problem using a finite-element
method, adaptive mesh refinement, and parallel processing that enables us to use high resolutions
capable of resolving the thin reflective coating. We compare with approximate analytic solutions
for amorphous materials, and we verify that our solutions scale as expected. Finally, we model the
crystalline coating thermal noise in an experiment reported by Cole and collaborators (2013),
comparing our results to a simpler numerical calculation that treats the coating as an "effectively
amorphous" material. We find that treating the coating as a cubic crystal instead of as an effectively
amorphous material increases the thermal noise by about 3%. Our results are a step toward better
understanding and reducing thermal noise to increase the reach of future gravitational-wave detectors.
