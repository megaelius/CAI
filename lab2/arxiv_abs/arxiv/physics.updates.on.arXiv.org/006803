We study both numerically and experimentally the breakup of a viscoelastic liquid bridge between
two parallel electrodes. We solve the leaky-dielectric FENE-P model to describe the dynamical
response of the liquid bridge under isothermal conditions. The results show that the surface charge
screens the inner electric field perpendicular to the free surface over the entire dynamical process.
The liquid bridge deformation produces a normal electric field on the outer side of the free surface
that is commensurate with the axial one. The surface conduction does not significantly affect the
current intensity in the time interval analyzed in the experiments. The force due to the shear electric
stress becomes comparable to both the viscoelastic and surface tension forces in the last stage
of the filament. However, it does not alter the elasto-capillary balance in the filament. The extensional
relaxation times approximately coincides with the stress relaxation time prescribed in the FENE-P
model. We measure experimentally the filament electrical conductivity and extensional relaxation
time for PEO dissolved in deionized water and in a mixture of water and glycerine. We compare the filament
electrical conductivity with the value measured in hydrostatic conditions for the same estimated
temperature. Good agreement was found for PEO dissolved in water+glycerine, which indicates that
the change of the filament microscopic structure due to the presence of stretched polymeric chains
does not significantly alter the ion mobility in the stretching direction. Significant deviations
are found for PEO dissolved in deionized water that may be attributed to the heat transferred to the
ambient, neglected in the calculation of the filament temperature. The extensional relaxation
time measured from the images acquired during the filament thinning hardly depends on the applied
voltage.
