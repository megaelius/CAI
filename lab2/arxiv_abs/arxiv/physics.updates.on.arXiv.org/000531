This paper outlines an energy-minimization finite-element approach to the modeling of equilibrium
configurations for nematic liquid crystals in the presence of internal and external electric fields.
The method targets minimization of system free energy based on the electrically and flexoelectrically
augmented Frank-Oseen free energy models. The Hessian, resulting from the linearization of the
first-order optimality conditions, is shown to be invertible for both models when discretized
by a mixed finite-element method under certain assumptions. This implies that the intermediate
discrete linearizations are well-posed. A coupled multigrid solver with Vanka-type relaxation
is proposed and numerically vetted for approximation of the solution to the linear systems arising
in the linearizations. Two electric model numerical experiments are performed with the proposed
iterative solver. The first compares the algorithm's solution of a classical Freedericksz transition
problem to the known analytical solution and demonstrates the convergence of the algorithm to the
true solution. The second experiment targets a problem with more complicated boundary conditions,
simulating a nano-patterned surface. In addition, numerical simulations incorporating these
nano-patterned boundaries for a flexoelectric model are run with the iterative solver. These simulations
verify expected physical behavior predicted by a perturbation model. The algorithm accurately
handles heterogeneous coefficients and efficiently resolves configurations resulting from
classical and complicated boundary conditions relevant in ongoing research.
