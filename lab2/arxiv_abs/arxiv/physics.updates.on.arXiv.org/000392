We consider a class of evolution equations describing population dynamics in the presence of a carrying
capacity depending on the population with delay. In an earlier work, we presented an exhaustive
classification of the logistic equation where the carrying capacity is linearly dependent on the
population with a time delay, which we refer to as the "linear delayed carrying capacity" model.
Here, we generalize it to the case of a nonlinear delayed carrying capacity. The nonlinear functional
form of the carrying capacity characterizes the delayed feedback of the evolving population on
the capacity of their surrounding by either creating additional means for survival or destroying
the available resources. The previously studied linear approximation for the capacity assumed
weak feedback, while the nonlinear form is applicable to arbitrarily strong feedback. The nonlinearity
essentially changes the behavior of solutions to the evolution equation, as compared to the linear
case. All admissible dynamical regimes are analyzed, which can be of the following types: punctuated
unbounded growth, punctuated increase or punctuated degradation to a stationary state, convergence
to a stationary state with sharp reversals of plateaus, oscillatory attenuation, everlasting
fluctuations, everlasting up-down plateau reversals, and divergence in finite time. The theorem
is proved that, for the case characterizing the evolution under gain and competition, solutions
are always bounded, if the feedback is destructive. We find that even a small noise level profoundly
affects the position of the finite-time singularities. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility
of predicting the critical time of solutions having finite-time singularities from the knowledge
of a simple quadratic approximation of the early time dynamics.
