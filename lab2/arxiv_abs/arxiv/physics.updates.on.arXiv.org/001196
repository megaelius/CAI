We have estimated the performance of discrimination criterion based on the P/S spectral amplitude
ratios obtained from six underground tests conducted by the DPRK since October 2006 and six aftershocks
induced by the last two explosions. Two aftershocks were detected in routine processing at the IDC.
Three aftershocks were detected by a prototype waveform cross correlation procedure with explosions
as master events, and one aftershock was found with the aftershocks as master event. Two seismic
arrays USRK and KSRS of the IMS and two non-IMS 3-C stations SEHB (South Korea) and MDJ (China) were
used. With increasing frequency, all stations demonstrate approximately the same level of deviation
between the Pg/Lg spectral amplitude ratios belonging to the DPRK explosions and their aftershocks.
For a single station, simple statistical estimates show that the probability of any of six aftershocks
not to be a sample from the explosion population is larger than 99.996% at the KSRS and even larger
at USRK. The probability of any of the DPRK explosion to be a representative of the aftershock population
is extremely small as defined by the distance of 20 and more standard deviations to the mean explosion
Pg/Lg value. For network discrimination, we use the Mahalanobis distance combining the Pg/Lg estimates
at three stations: USRK, KSRS and MDJ. At frequencies above 4 Hz, the (squared) Mahalanobis distance,
D2, between the populations of explosions and aftershocks is larger than 100. In the frequency band
between 6 and 12 Hz at USRK, the aftershocks distance from the average explosion D2>21,000. Statistically,
the probability to confuse explosions and aftershocks is negligible. These discrimination results
are related only to the aftershocks of the DPRK tests and cannot be directly extrapolated to the population
of tectonic earthquakes in the same area.
