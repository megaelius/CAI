The open source MATLAB package IGUG for 3D inversion of gravity data is presented. It is based on methodology
that was introduced by Bijani et al (2015), in which a homogeneous subsurface body is modeled by an
ensemble of simple point masses. The model parameters are the Cartesian coordinates of the point
masses and their total mass. Associating the point masses to the vertices of a weighted full graph
with weights computed by the Euclidean pairwise distances separating vertices, Kruskal's algorithm
is used to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Stabilization is achieved using an equidistance
function that restricts the spatial distribution of the masses and favors a homogeneous subsurface
structure. A regularization parameter $\lambda$ is introduced to balance the two terms of the objective
function, and reasonable physically-relevant bound constraints are imposed on the model parameters.
Then the bound constrained objective function is solved using a genetic algorithm. A new diagnostic
approach is presented for determining a suitable choice for $\lambda$, requiring a limited number
of solutions for a small set of $\lambda$ without using the L-curve as suggested by Bijani et al. Simulations
for synthetic examples demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the implementation of
the algorithm. It is verified that the constraints on the model parameters are not restrictive.
Included in the package is the script GMD.m which is used for generating synthetic data and for putting
measurement data in the format required for the inversion implemented by IGUG.m The script Diagnostic_Results.m
is included for analyzing and visualizing the results. The software can be used to verify the simulations
and the analysis of real data that is presented here, The real data set uses gravity data from the Mobrun
ore body, north east of Noranda, Quebec, Canada.
