Electrospun nanofibrous membranes of natural polymers, such as gelatin, are fundamental in the
design of regenerative devices. Crosslinking of electrospun fibres from gelatin is required to
prevent dissolution in water, to retain the original nanofibre morphology after immersion in water,
and to improve the thermal and mechanical properties, although this is still challenging to accomplish
in a controlled fashion. In this study, we have investigated the scalable manufacture and structural
stability in aqueous environment of a UV-cured nanofibrous membrane fabricated by free surface
electrospinning (FSES) of aqueous solutions containing vinylbenzylated gelatin and poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
dimethacrylate (PCL-DMA). Vinylbenzylated gelatin was obtained via chemical functionalisation
with photopolymerisable 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (4VBC) groups, so that the gelatin and PCL phase
in electrospun fibres were integrated in a covalent UV-cured co-network at the molecular scale,
rather than being simply physically mixed. UV-cured nanofibrous membranes did not dissolve in
water and showed enhanced thermal and mechanical properties, with respect to as-spun samples,
indicating the effectiveness of the photo-crosslinking reaction. In addition, UV-cured gelatin/PCL
membranes displayed increased structural stability in water with respect to PCL-free samples
and were highly tolerated by G292 osteosarcoma cells. These results therefore support the use of
PCL DMA as hydrophobic, biodegradable crosslinker and provide new insight on the scalable design
of water insoluble, mechanical competent gelatin membranes for healthcare applications.
