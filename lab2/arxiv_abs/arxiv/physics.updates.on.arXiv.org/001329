When performing precision measurements, the quantity being measured is often perturbed by the
measurement process itself. This includes precision frequency measurements for atomic clock
applications carried out with Ramsey spectroscopy. With the aim of eliminating probe-induced
perturbations, a method of generalized auto-balanced Ramsey spectroscopy (GABRS) is presented
and rigorously substantiated. Here, the usual local oscillator frequency control loop is augmented
with a second control loop derived from secondary Ramsey sequences interspersed with the primary
sequences and with a different Ramsey period. This second loop feeds back to a secondary clock variable
and ultimately compensates for the perturbation of the clock frequency caused by the measurements
in the first loop. We show that such a two-loop scheme can lead to perfect compensation of measurement-induced
light shifts and does not suffer from the effects of relaxation, time-dependent pulse fluctuations
and phase-jump modulation errors that are typical of other hyper-Ramsey schemes. Several variants
of GABRS are explored based on different secondary variables including added relative phase shifts
between Ramsey pulses, external frequency-step compensation, and variable second-pulse duration.
We demonstrate that a universal anti-symmetric error signal, and hence perfect compensation at
finite modulation amplitude, is generated only if an additional frequency-step applied during
both Ramsey pulses is used as the concomitant variable parameter. This universal technique can
be applied to the fields of atomic clocks, high-resolution molecular spectroscopy, magnetically
induced and two-photon probing schemes, Ramsey-type mass spectrometry, and to the field of precision
measurements. Some variants of GABRS can also be applied for rf atomic clocks using CPT-based Ramsey
spectroscopy of the two-photon dark resonance.
