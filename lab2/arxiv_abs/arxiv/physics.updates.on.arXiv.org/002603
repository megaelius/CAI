We exploit a lesser-known connection between the Reynolds transport theorem, Reynolds averaging
and the Liouville equation for a conserved quantity, to derive new spatial and parametric forms
of these theorems and associated evolution operators, which provide mappings between different
domains (in various spaces) associated with a continuous vector or tensor field. First, for a time-independent
continuous flow field described by Eulerian velocity and position coordinates $(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x})$,
we derive spatial analogs of the Reynolds transport theorem and Liouville equation -- the latter
based on the joint-conditional probability density function $f(\mathbf{u} | \mathbf{x})$ --
and spatial analogs of the Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators. These provide spatial maps
between different positions within a velocity gradient field. Two distinct proofs of the spatial
Reynolds transport theorem are provided, based on continuum mechanics arguments or coordinate
transformation. For intrinsic motion (with a fixed tensorial frame of reference), the spatial
mapping is induced by the shear stress tensor field. For flows with a two-dimensional velocity gradient,
the analysis also furnishes an orthogonal coordinate system and a Liouville equation of Hamilitonian
form, analogous to those used for potential flow. The analysis is then generalized to derive parametric
Reynolds transport theorems and Liouville equations -- the latter based either on a probability
differential form (using a generalized Lie derivative and other operators) or probability density
function -- and generalized parametric Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators. The findings
are illustrated by application to a variety of fluid flow and dynamical systems, including turbulent
flow, two-point and $n$-point correlation, Lagrangian, phase space, spectral and chemical reaction
systems.
