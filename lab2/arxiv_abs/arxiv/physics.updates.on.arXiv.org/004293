Imaging of biological cells and tissues often relies on fluorescent labels, which offer high contrast
with molecular specificity. The use of exogenous labeling agents, however, may alter the normal
physiology of the bio-specimens. Complementary to the established fluorescence microscopy,
label-free quantitative phase imaging provides an objective morphological measurement tool
for bio-specimens and is free of variability introduced by contrast agents. Here we report a $5 microscope
add-on, termed Ptychographic Modulation Engine (PME), for super-resolution quantitative phase
imaging. In this microscope add-on module, we attach a diffuser to a 3D-printed holder that can be
mechanically moved to different x-y positions. We then use two vibrational motors to introduce
random positional shifts to the diffuser. The add-on module can be placed between the objective
lens and the specimen in most existing microscope platforms. Thanks to the diffuser modulation
process, the otherwise inaccessible high-resolution object information can now be encoded into
the captured images. In the ptychographic phase retrieval process, we jointly recover the complex
object wavefront, the complex diffuser profile, and the unknown positional shifts of the diffuser.
We demonstrate a 4-fold resolution gain over the diffraction limit of the employed 2X objective
lens. We also test our approach for in-vivo cell imaging, where we are able to adjust the focus after
the data has been captured. The reported microscope add-on provides a turnkey solution for super-resolution
quantitative phase imaging. It may find applications in label-free bio-imaging where both large
field-of-view and high resolution are needed.
