The performance of strained silicon as the channel material for transistors has plateaued. Motivated
by increasing charge-carrier mobility within the device channel to improve transistor performance,
germanium (Ge) is considered as an attractive option as a silicon replacement due to its highest
p-type mobility in all of the known semiconductor materials and being compatible with today's conventional
CMOS manufacturing process. However, the intrinsically high carrier mobility of Ge becomes significantly
degraded because Ge's native oxide is unstable and readily decomposes into several GexOy suboxides
with a high density of dangling bonds at the surface. In addition, these interface trap states will
also degrade the off-state leakage current and subthreshold turn-off of a Ge-based device, significantly
affecting its stability. Furthermore, obtaining low-resistance Ohmic contacts to n-type Ge is
another key challenge in developing Ge CMOS. To solve these challenges, extensive efforts have
been made about the incorporation of new materials, such as Al2O3, SiN3, TiO2, ZnO, Ge3N4, MgO, HfO2,
SrTiO3, and Y2O3, into Ge transistors. Controlling the diffusion of foreign atoms into Ge is therefore
a critical issue in developing Ge transistors regarding that foreign impurities may be detrimental
to devices. In this work, we study the diffusion properties of all common elements in Ge by performing
the first-principle calculations with a nudged elastic band method. We find some large atoms, such
as Cu, Au, Pd, etc., have a very small diffusion barrier. We reveal the underlying mechanism in a combination
of local distortion induced by size effect and bonding effect that controls the diffusion behaviors
of different atoms in Ge. This comprehensive study and relatively in-depth understanding of diffusion
in Ge provides us with a practical guide for utilizing it more efficiently in semiconductor devices.
