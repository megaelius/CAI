Developing a detailed understanding for the role of core electron excitation in liquid water under
proton irradiation has become important due to the growing use of proton beams in radiation oncology.
Using a first-principles, non-equilibrium simulation approach based on real-time time-dependent
density functional theory, we determine the electronic stopping power, the velocity-dependent
energy transfer rate from irradiating ions to electrons. The electronic stopping power curve agrees
quantitatively over the entire velocity range for which experimental data is available. Also notably,
we observe significant differences between our first-principles results and commonly-used perturbation
theoretic models. Excitations of the water molecules' oxygen core electrons are a crucial factor
in determining the electronic stopping power curve beyond its maximum. The core electron contribution
is responsible for as much as one-third of the stopping power at the high proton velocity of 8.0 a.u.
(1.6 MeV). These K-shell core electron excitations not only provide an additional channel for the
energy transfer but they also significantly influence the valence electron excitation. In the
excitation process, generated holes remain highly localized within a few angstroms around the
irradiating proton path whereas electrons are excited away from the path. In spite of its great contribution
to the electronic stopping power, the K-shell electrons play a rather minor role in terms of the excitation
density: Only one percent of the hole population comprises K-shell holes, even at the high proton
velocity of 8.0 a.u.. The excitation behavior revealed here is distinctly different from that of
X/gamma-ray photon radiation, which is the most commonly used type of ionizing radiation in radiation
oncology.
