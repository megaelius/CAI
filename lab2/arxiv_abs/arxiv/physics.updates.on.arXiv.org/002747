Transition metals with their densely confined and strongly coupled valence electrons are key constituents
of many materials with unconventional properties, such as high-Tc superconductors, Mott insulators
and transition-metal dichalcogenides. Strong electron interaction offers a fast and efficient
lever to manipulate their properties with light, creating promising potential for next-generation
electronics. However, the underlying dynamics is a fast and intricate interplay of polarization
and screening effects, which is poorly understood. It is hidden below the femtosecond timescale
of electronic thermalization, which follows the light-induced excitation. Here, we investigate
the many-body electron dynamics in transition metals before thermalization sets in. We combine
the sensitivity of intra-shell transitions to screening effects with attosecond time resolution
to uncover the interplay of photo-absorption and screening. First-principles time-dependent
calculations allow us to assign our experimental observations to ultrafast electronic localization
on d-orbitals. The latter modifies the whole electronic structure as well as the collective dynamic
response of the system on a timescale much faster than the light-field cycle. Our results demonstrate
a possibility for steering the electronic properties of solids prior to electron thermalization,
suggesting that the ultimate speed of electronic phase transitions is limited only by the duration
of the controlling laser pulse. Furthermore, external control of the local electronic density
serves as a fine tool for testing state-of-the art models of electron-electron interactions. We
anticipate our study to facilitate further investigations of electronic phase transitions, laser-metal
interactions and photo-absorption in correlated electron systems on its natural timescale.
