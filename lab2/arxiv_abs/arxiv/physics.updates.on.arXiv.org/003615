The development of scalable Out of Autoclave (OoA) in situ thermoset curing methods are required
to overcome important drawbacks related to the autoclave based processing methods typically used
in industry. The incorporation of graphene, an electrothermal carbon nanomaterial with the ability
to transform electric energy into heat through Joule heating, emerges as a promising route to replace
the conventional processing methods. In this work the electrical behaviour of both uncured and
oven cured GNPs/epoxy composites with loadings of up to 10 wt% were evaluated and electrical percolation
thresholds were established for both. Above the critical loading found for oven cured materials
(8.5 wt%) the electrically conducting networks of GNPs formed in the matrix showed the ability to
act as integrated nanoheaters when an electric current was passed through them, successfully curing
the composites by Joule heating. Composites prepared by this OoA curing method (as an alternative
to the traditional oven based one) at 10 wt% loading of GNPs were also prepared and compared to the
oven cured ones. They showed more compact composite structures, with less microvoids and a preferred
orientation of the GNPs in the matrix relative to the oven cured material at identical loading, as
revealed by electron microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy, respectively. This microstructure
and anisotropy induced by the electrically induced (i.e. OoA) cure led to GNPs/epoxy composites
with superior electrical and mechanical properties (revealed by tensile testing). The well distributed
GNP nanoparticles acting as nanoheaters integrated in a thermosetting matrix, in combination
with excellent mechanical and electrical performances achieved for the overall graphene/epoxy
composites and the simplicity associated to the method, should open the door to novel industrial
applications.
