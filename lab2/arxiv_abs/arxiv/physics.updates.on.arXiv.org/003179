Solar wind charge-changing reactions are of paramount importance to the physico-chemistry of
the atmosphere of a comet because they mass-load the solar wind through an effective conversion
of fast, light solar wind ions into slow, heavy cometary ions. The ESA/Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
(67P) provided a unique opportunity to study charge-changing processes in situ. An extended analytical
formalism describing solar wind charge-changing processes at comets along solar wind streamlines
is presented. It is based on a thorough book-keeping of available charge-changing cross sections
of hydrogen and helium particles in a water gas. After presenting a general 1D solution of charge
exchange at comets, we study the theoretical dependence of charge-state distributions of (He$^{2+}$,
He$^+$, He$^0$) and (H$^+$, H$^0$, H$^-$) on solar wind parameters at comet 67P. We show that double
charge exchange for the He$^{2+}$-H$_2$O system plays an important role below a solar wind bulk
speed of 200 km/s , resulting in the production of He energetic neutral atoms, whereas stripping
reactions can in general be neglected. Retrievals of outgassing rates and solar wind upstream fluxes
from local Rosetta measurements deep in the coma are discussed. Solar wind ion temperature effects
at 400 km/s solar wind speed are well contained during the Rosetta mission. As the comet approaches
perihelion, the model predicts a sharp decrease of solar wind ion fluxes by almost one order of magnitude
at the location of Rosetta, forming in effect a solar wind ion cavity. This study is the second part
of a series of three on solar wind charge-exchange and ionization processes at comets, with a specific
application to comet 67P and the Rosetta mission.
