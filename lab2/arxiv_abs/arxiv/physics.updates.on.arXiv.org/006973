Advancements in numerical weather prediction models have accelerated, fostering a more comprehensive
understanding of physical phenomena pertaining to the dynamics of weather and related computing
resources. Despite these advancements, these models contain inherent biases due to parameterization
and linearization of the differential equations that reduce forecasting accuracy. In this work,
we investigate the use of a computationally efficient deep learning method, the Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN), as a post-processing technique that improves mesoscale Weather and Research
Forecasting (WRF) one day forecast (with a one-hour temporal resolution) outputs. Using the CNN
architecture, we bias-correct several meteorological parameters calculated by the WRF model
for all of 2018. We train the CNN model with a four-year history (2014-2017) to investigate the patterns
in WRF biases and then reduce these biases in forecasts for surface wind speed and direction, precipitation,
relative humidity, surface pressure, dewpoint temperature, and surface temperature. The WRF
data, with a spatial resolution of 27 km, covers South Korea. We obtain ground observations from
the Korean Meteorological Administration station network for 93 weather station locations. The
results indicate a noticeable improvement in WRF forecasts in all station locations. The average
of annual index of agreement for surface wind, precipitation, surface pressure, temperature,
dewpoint temperature and relative humidity of all stations are 0.85 (WRF:0.67), 0.62 (WRF:0.56),
0.91 (WRF:0.69), 0.99 (WRF:0.98), 0.98 (WRF:0.98), and 0.92 (WRF:0.87), respectively. While
this study focuses on South Korea, the proposed approach can be applied for any measured weather
parameters at any location.
