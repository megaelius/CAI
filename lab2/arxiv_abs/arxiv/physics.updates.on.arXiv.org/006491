X-ray emission K-spectra of highly charged He- and Li-like argon ions recorded with high spectral,
spatial, and temporal resolution at the TEXTOR tokamak were employed to develop a self-consistent
approach (SCA) for deriving information on plasma parameters and the verification (estimation
of accuracy) of both atomic data, needed for spectra interpretation, and methods of their calculation.
The approach is based on solving the spectral inverse problem for these spectra in the framework
of the semi-empirical ``spectroscopic model'' (SM) by means of two complimentary inversion methods.
The SCA was justified by comparing and analyzing measured and synthetic spectra on the basis of the
calculated and corrected atomic data. The three different sets of atomic data for He- and Li-like
argon ions were analyzed and verified. The SCA allowed us to verify the methods for calculating the
atomic data with an accuracy within of 5--10\%. The spectra calculated with corrected atomic data
are in agreement with the spectra measured in the wide range of plasma conditions within the experimental
accuracy of 10\%. Corrected atomic data made it possible to perform an accurate diagnostics of plasma
parameters: plasma temperatures and relative ion abundances in the tokamak plasma. This procedure
provided also a method for determining the temperature of the plasma core with high accuracy within
5\% in a good agreement with the diagnostics technique based on the electron cyclotron emission.
The relative ion abundances obtained by the application of the spectroscopic and impurity transport
model are in agreement within the experimental errors. The presented results show that the X-ray
spectroscopy of tokamak plasma is an effective tool for both high accuracy verification of atomic
data and precision plasma diagnostics.
