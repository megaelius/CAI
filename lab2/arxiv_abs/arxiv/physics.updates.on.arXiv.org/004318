The Schwabe cycle of solar activity exhibits modulations and frequency fluctuations on slow time
scales of centuries and millennia. Plausible physical explanations for the cause of these long-term
variations of the solar cycle are still elusive, with possible theories including stochasticity
of alpha effect and fluctuations of the differential rotation. It has been suggested recently in
the literature that there exists a possible relation between the spatio-temporal structure of
Solar cycle and the nonlinear dynamics of magnetohydrodynamic Rossby waves at the solar tachocline,
including both wave-wave and wave-mean flow interactions. Here we extend the nonlinear theory
of MHD Rossby waves presented in a previous article to take into account long term modulation effects
due to a recently discovered mechanism that allows significant energy transfers throughout different
wave triads: the precession resonance mechanism. We have found a large number of Rossby-Haurwitz
wave triads whose frequency mismatches are compatible with the solar cycle frequency. Consequently,
by analyzing the reduced dynamics of two triads coupled by a single mode (five-wave system), we have
demonstrated that in the amplitude regime in which precession resonance occurs, the energy transfer
throughout the system yields significant long-term modulations on the main $\sim 11$yr period
associated with intra-triad energy exchanges. We further show that such modulations display an
inverse relationship between the characteristic wave amplitude and the period of intra-triad
energy exchanges, which is consistent with the Waldmeier's law for the solar cycle. In the presence
of a constant forcing and dissipation, the five-wave system in the precession resonance regime
exhibits irregular amplitude fluctuations with some periods resembling the Grand Minimum states.
