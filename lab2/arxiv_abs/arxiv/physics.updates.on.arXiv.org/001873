We argue that for the proof of Bell's theorem no assumptions about realism or free will are necessary.
The key formula \[E(AB|a,b) = \int A(a,b,\lambda)B(a,b,\lambda)\rho(\lambda) d\lambda\] follows
from the logic of plausible reasoning (the objective Bayesian interpretation of probability theory)
taken alone, without any further assumptions about realism. The space $\Lambda$, usually interpreted
as some space of `hidden variables', can be constructed for an arbitrary `field of discourse' using
Stone's theorem. The rejection of superdeterminism follows from logical independence -- the non-existence
of information which suggest a dependence -- of the free decisions of the experimenters from everything
else. To prove the Bell inequality it is, then, sufficient to reduce this to \[E(AB|a,b) = \int A(a,\lambda)B(b,\lambda)\rho(\lambda)
d\lambda.\] This follows for space-like separated measurements from Einstein causality alone.
So, the consequence of the violation of Bell's inequality is that Einstein causality has been empirically
falsified, without any loopholes left. We consider and reject the idea of weakening the logic of
plausible reasoning could be used to create a loophole. Finally, we discuss what can be used to replace
Einstein causality. While weak (signal) Einstein causality holds, it follows either from a notion
of strong causality or from human inability to prepare states which violate quantum uncertainty,
which makes it uninteresting for fundamental considerations. A notion of strong causality has
either unacceptable causal loops or requires a hidden preferred frame. Given that a hidden preferred
frame is completely compatible with modern physics, it is argued that this choice is preferable.
