We consider an isotropic compressible non-dissipative fluid with broken parity subject to free
surface boundary conditions in two spatial dimensions. The hydrodynamic equations describing
the bulk dynamics of the fluid as well as the free surface boundary conditions depend explicitly
on the parity breaking non-dissipative odd viscosity term. We construct a variational principle
in the form of an effective action which gives both bulk hydrodynamic equations and free surface
boundary conditions. The free surface boundary conditions require an additional boundary term
in the action which resembles a $1+1D$ chiral boson field coupled to the background geometry. We
solve the linearized hydrodynamic equations for the deep water case and derive the dispersion of
chiral surface waves. We show that in the long wavelength limit the flow profile exhibits an oscillating
vortical boundary layer near the free surface. The thickness of the layer is controlled by the length
scale given by the ratio of odd viscosity to the sound velocity $\delta \sim \nu_o/c_s$. In the incompressible
limit, $c_s\to \infty$ the vortical boundary layer becomes singular with the vorticity within
the layer diverging as $\omega \sim c_s$. The boundary layer is formed by odd viscosity coupling
the divergence of velocity $\boldsymbol\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v}$ to vorticity $\boldsymbol\nabla
\times \boldsymbol{v}$. It results in non-trivial chiral free surface dynamics even in the absence
of external forces. The structure of the odd viscosity induced boundary layer is very different
from the conventional free surface boundary layer associated with dissipative shear viscosity.
