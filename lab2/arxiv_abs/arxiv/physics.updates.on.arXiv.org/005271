This paper employs an input-output based approach to analyze convective velocities and the transport
of fluctuations in turbulent channel flows. The convective velocity for a fluctuating quantity
associated with streamwise-spanwise wavelength pairs at each wall-normal location is obtained
through the maximization of the power spectral density associated with the linearized Navier-Stokes
equations with a turbulent mean profile and delta-correlated Gaussian forcing. We first demonstrate
that the mean convective velocities computed in this manner agree well with those reported previously
in the literature. We then exploit the analytical framework to probe the underlying mechanisms
contributing to the local convective velocity at different wall-normal locations by isolating
the contributions of each spanwise-streamwise wavelength pair (flow scale). The resulting analysis
suggests that the behavior of the convective velocity in the near-wall region is influenced by large
scale structures further away from the wall. These structures resemble Townsend's attached eddies
in the cross-plane, yet show incomplete similarity in the streamwise direction. We then investigate
the role of each linear term in the momentum equation to isolate the contribution of the pressure,
mean shear, and viscous effects to the deviation of the convective velocity from the mean at each
flow scale. Our analysis highlights the role of the viscous effects, particularly in regards to
large channel spanning structures whose influence extends to the near-wall region. The results
of this work suggest the promise of an input-output approach for analyzing convective velocity
across a range of flow scales using only the mean velocity profile.
