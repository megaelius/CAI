Recommender systems are becoming more and more important in our daily lives. However, traditional
recommendation methods are challenged by data sparsity and efficiency, as the numbers of users,
items, and interactions between the two in many real-world applications increase fast. In this
work, we propose a novel clustering recommender system based on node2vec technology and rich information
network, namely N2VSCDNNR, to solve these challenges. In particular, we use a bipartite network
to construct the user-item network, and represent the interactions among users (or items) by the
corresponding one-mode projection network. In order to alleviate the data sparsity problem, we
enrich the network structure according to user and item categories, and construct the one-mode
projection category network. Then, considering the data sparsity problem in the network, we employ
node2vec to capture the complex latent relationships among users (or items) from the corresponding
one-mode projection category network. Moreover, considering the dependency on parameter settings
and information loss problem in clustering methods, we use a novel spectral clustering method,
which is based on dynamic nearest-neighbors (DNN) and a novel automatically determining cluster
number (ADCN) method that determines the cluster centers based on the normal distribution method,
to cluster the users and items separately. After clustering, we propose the two-phase personalized
recommendation to realize the personalized recommendation of items for each user. A series of experiments
validate the outstanding performance of our N2VSCDNNR over several advanced embedding and side
information based recommendation algorithms. Meanwhile, N2VSCDNNR seems to have lower time complexity
than the baseline methods in online recommendations, indicating its potential to be widely applied
in large-scale systems.
