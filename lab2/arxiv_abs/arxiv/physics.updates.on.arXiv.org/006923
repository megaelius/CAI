Viscoelastic material properties at high strain rates are needed to model many biological and medical
systems. Bubble cavitation can induce such strain rates, and the resulting bubble dynamics are
sensitive to the material properties. Thus, in principle, these properties can be inferred via
measurements of the bubble dynamics. Estrada et al. (2018) demonstrated such bubble-dynamic high-strain-rate
rheometry by using least-squares shooting to minimize the difference between simulated and experimental
bubble radius histories. We generalize their technique to account for additional uncertainties
in the model, initial conditions, and material properties needed to uniquely simulate the bubble
dynamics. Ensemble-based data assimilation minimizes the computational expense associated
with the bubble cavitation model. We test an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), an iterative ensemble
Kalman smoother (IEnKS), and a hybrid ensemble-based 4D--Var method (En4D--Var) on synthetic
data, assessing their estimations of the viscosity and shear modulus of a Kelvin--Voigt material.
Results show that En4D--Var and IEnKS provide better moduli estimates than EnKF. Applying these
methods to the experimental data of Estrada et al. (2018) yields similar material property estimates
to those they obtained, but provides additional information about uncertainties. In particular,
the En4D--Var yields lower viscosity estimates for some experiments, and the dynamic estimators
reveal a potential mechanism that is unaccounted for in the model, whereby the viscosity is reduced
in some cases due to material damage occurring at bubble collapse.
