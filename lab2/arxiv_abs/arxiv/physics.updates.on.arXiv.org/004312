Street networks may be planned according to clear organizing principles or they may evolve organically
through accretion, but their configurations and orientations help define a city's spatial logic
and order. Measures of entropy reveal a city's streets' order and disorder. Past studies have explored
individual cases of orientation and entropy, but little is known about broader patterns and trends
worldwide. This study examines street network orientation, configuration, and entropy in 100
cities around the world using OpenStreetMap data and OSMnx. It measures the entropy of street bearings
in weighted and unweighted network models, along with each city's typical street segment length,
average circuity, average node degree, and the network's proportions of four-way intersections
and dead-ends. It also develops a new indicator of orientation-order that quantifies how a city's
street network follows the geometric ordering logic of a single grid. A cluster analysis is performed
to explore similarities and differences among these study sites in multiple dimensions. Significant
statistical relationships exist between city orientation-order and other indicators of spatial
order, including street circuity and measures of connectedness. On average, US/Canadian study
sites are far more grid-like than those elsewhere, exhibiting less entropy and circuity. These
indicators, taken in concert, help reveal the extent and nuance of the grid. These methods demonstrate
automatic, scalable, reproducible tools to empirically measure and visualize city spatial order,
illustrating complex urban transportation system patterns and configurations around the world.
