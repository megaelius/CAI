Seismic interpretation is now serving as a fundamental tool for depicting subsurface geology and
assisting activities in various domains, such as environmental engineering and petroleum exploration.
However, most of the existing interpretation techniques are designed for interpreting a certain
seismic pattern (e.g., faults and salt domes) in a given seismic dataset at one time; correspondingly,
the rest patterns would be ignored. Interpreting all the important seismic patterns becomes feasible
with the aid of multiple classification techniques. When implementing them into the seismic domain,
however, the major drawback is the low efficiency particularly for a large dataset, since the classification
need to be repeated at every seismic sample. To resolve such limitation, this study first present
a seismic pattern interpretation dataset (SpiDat), which tentatively categorizes 12 commonly-observed
seismic patterns based on their signal intensity and lateral geometry, including these of important
geologic implications such as faults, salt domes, gas chimneys, and depositional sequences. Then
we propose a seismic pattern interpretation network (SpiNet) based on the state-of-the-art deconvolutional
neural network, which is capable of automatically recognizing and annotating the 12 defined seismic
patterns in real time. The impacts of the proposed SpiNet come in two folds. First, applying the SpiNet
to a seismic cube allows interpreters to quickly identify the important seismic patterns as input
to advanced interpretation and modeling. Second, the SpiNet paves the foundation for deriving
more task-oriented seismic interpretation networks, such as fault detection. It is concluded
that the proposed SpiNet holds great potentials for assisting the major seismic interpretation
challenges and advancing it further towards cognitive seismic data analysis.
