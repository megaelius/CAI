From experimental spark ignition (SI) engine studies, it is known that the slow-down of early flame
kernel development caused by the ($\mathrm{Le}>1$)-property of common transportation-fuel/air
mixtures tends to increase cycle-to-cycle variations (CCV). To improve the fundamental understanding
of the complex phenomena inside the flame structure of developing flame kernels, an engine-relevant
DNS database is investigated in this work. Conclusive analyses are enabled by considering equivalent
flame kernels and turbulent planar flames computed with $\mathrm{Le}>1$ and $\mathrm{Le}=1$.
In Part I of the present study (Falkenstein et al., Combust. Flame, 2019), a reduced representation
of the local mixture state based on the parameters local enthalpy, local equivalence ratio, and
H-radical mass fraction was proposed for the purpose of this analysis. Here, a coupling relation
for the diffusion-controlled mixture parameter local enthalpy with local flame geometry and structure
is derived, characterized by the key parameters $\kappa$ and ${\ |\nabla c \ t|/\ |\nabla c \ |_{\mathrm{lam}}}$.
The analysis shows that the large positive global mean curvature intrinsic to the flame kernel configuration
may detrimentally affect the local mixture state inside the reaction zone, particularly during
the initial kernel development phase. External energy supply by spark ignition may effectively
bridge over this critical stage, which causes the impact of global mean flame kernel curvature to
be small under the present conditions compared to the overall effect of $\mathrm{Le}\neq1$. Once
ignition effects have decayed, the mixture state inside the reaction zone locally exhibits an identical
dependence on $\ |\nabla c \ |$ as in a strained laminar flame. This implies that differential diffusion
effects under engine-typical Karlovitz numbers are not weakened by small-scale turbulent mixing.
