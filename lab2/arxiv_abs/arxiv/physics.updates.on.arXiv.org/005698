Many-electron wavepacket dynamics based on time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI)
is a numerically rigorous approach to quantitatively model electron-transfer across molecular
junctions. TDCI simulations of cyanobenzene thiolates---para- and meta-linked to an acceptor
gold atom---show donor states \emph{conjugating} with the benzene $\pi$-network to allow better
through-molecule electron migration in the para isomer compared to the meta counterpart. For dynamics
involving \emph{non-conjugating} states, we find electron-injection to stem exclusively from
distance-dependent non-resonant quantum mechanical tunneling, in which case the meta isomer
exhibits better dynamics. Computed trend in donor-to-acceptor net-electron transfer through
differently linked azulene bridges agrees with the trend seen in low-bias conductivity measurements.
Disruption of $\pi$-conjugation has been shown to be the cause of diminished electron-injection
through the 1,3-azulene, a pathological case for graph-based diagnosis of destructive quantum
interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate quantum interference of many-electron wavefunctions
to drive para- vs. meta- selectivity in the coherent evolution of superposed $\pi$(CN)- and $\sigma$(NC-C)-type
wavepackets. Analyses reveal that in the para-linked benzene, $\sigma$ and $\pi$ MOs localized
at the donor terminal are \emph{in-phase} leading to constructive interference of electron density
distribution while phase-flip of one of the MOs in the meta isomer results in destructive interference.
These findings suggest that \emph{a priori} detection of orbital phase-flip and quantum coherence
conditions can aid in molecular device design strategies.
