It is a straightforward result of electromagnetism that dipole oscillators radiate more strongly
when they are synchronized, and that if there are $N$ dipoles, the overall emitted intensity scales
with $N^2$. In atomic physics, such an enhanced radiative property appears when coherence among
two-level identical atoms is established, and is well-known as "superradiance" \cite{Dicke:1954aa}.
In superfluorescence (SF), atomic coherence develops via a self-organisation process stemming
from the common radiated field, starting from a incoherently prepared population inversion \cite{Bonifacio:1975aa}.
First demonstrated in a gas \cite{Skribanowitz:1973} and later in condensed matter systems \cite{Florian:1984},
its potential is currently being investigated in the fields of ultranarrow linewidth laser development
for fundamental tests in physics \cite{Meiser:2009,Meiser:2010,Bohnet:2012aa,Norcia:2016,
Norcia:2018}, and for the development of devices enabling entangled multi-photon quantum light
sources \cite{Raino:2018aa,Angerer:2018aa}. A barely developed aspect in superradiance is
related to the properties of the dipole array that generates the pulsed radiation field. In this
work we establish the experimental conditions for formation of a macroscopic dipole via superfluorescence,
involving the remarkable number of $4\times10^{12}$ atoms. Even though rapidly evolving in time,
it represents a flexible test-bed in quantum optics. Self-driven atom dynamics, without the mediation
of cavity QED nor quantum dots or quantum well structures, is observed in a cryogenically-cooled
rare-earth doped material. We present clear evidence of a decay rate that is enhanced by more than
1-million times compared to that of independently emitting atoms. We thoroughly resolve the dynamics
by directly measuring the intensity of the emitted radiation as a function of time.
