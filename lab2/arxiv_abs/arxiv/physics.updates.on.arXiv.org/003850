We propose a model describing the scattering of hadrons as bound states of their constituent quarks.
We analyze the role of simultaneity in measurements of the characteristics of different particles
for the description of relativistic quantum systems. We also consider the impossibility of the
same realization of such measurements in different inertial reference frames because of the relativity
of simultaneity in relativistic situation. On the basis of this analysis we conclude that the relativistic
scattering of bound states of particles should not be described by the fields defined on the Minkowski
space, but on the subset of simultaneous events, which is singled out from the tensor product of two
Minkowski spaces. Such fields are called multi-particle fields. The arguments of the field functions
in different reference frames are impossible to relate neither by using Lorentz transformations,
nor in any other way. Next we build the dynamic equations for the multi-particle fields on the subset
of simultaneity, using the Lagrange method, similar to the case of "usual" single-particle fields.
We then consider the gauge fields restoring the local internal symmetry on the subset of simultaneity.
The dynamic equations for the multi-particle gauge fields describe such phenomena as confinement
and asymptotic freedom of colored objects under certain boundary conditions, and the mechanism
of spontaneous braking of symmetry -- under anothers. With these dynamic equations we are able to
describe within a single model the quark confinement in hadrons, and their interaction during hadron
scattering through the exchange of the bound states of gluons -- the glueballs.
