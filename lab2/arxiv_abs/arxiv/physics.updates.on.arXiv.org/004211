Physics-constrained data-driven computing is a hybrid approach that integrates universal physical
laws with data-based models of experimental data to enhance scientific computing. A new data-driven
simulation approach enriched with a locally convex reconstruction, termed the local convexity
data-driven (LCDD) computing, is proposed to enhance accuracy and robustness against noise and
outliers in data sets in the data-driven computing. In this approach, for a given state obtained
by the physical simulation, the corresponding optimum experimental solution is sought by projecting
the state onto the associated local convex manifold reconstructed based on the nearest experimental
data. This learning process of local data structure is less sensitivity to noisy data and consequently
yields better accuracy. A penalty relaxation is also introduced to recast the local learning solver
in the context of non-negative least squares that can be solved effectively. The reproducing kernel
approximation with stabilized nodal integration are employed for the solution of the physical
manifold to allow reduced stress-strain data at the discrete points for enhanced effectiveness
in the LCDD learning solver. Due to the inherent manifold learning properties, LCDD performs well
for high-dimensional data sets that are relatively sparse in real-world engineering applications.
Numerical tests demonstrated that LCDD enhances nearly one order of accuracy compared to the standard
distance-minimization data-driven scheme when dealing with noisy database, and a linear exactness
is achieved when local stress-strain relation is linear.
