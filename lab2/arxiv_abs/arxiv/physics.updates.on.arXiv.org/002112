Reconstruction of fine-scale information from sparse data is relevant to many practical fluid
dynamic applications where the sensing is typically sparse. Fluid flows in an ideal sense are manifestations
of nonlinear multiscale PDE dynamical systems with inherent scale separation that impact the system
dimensionality. There is a common need to analyze the data from flow measurements or high-fidelity
computations for stability characteristics, identification of coherent structures and develop
evolutionary models for real-time data-driven control. Given that sparse reconstruction is inherently
an ill-posed problem, the most successful approaches require the knowledge of the underlying basis
space spanning the manifold in which the system resides. In this study, we employ an approach that
learns basis from singular value decomposition (SVD) of training data to reconstruct sparsely
sensed information at randomly sampled locations. This allows us to leverage energy sparsity with
l2 minimization instead of the more expensive, sparsity promoting l1 minimization. Further, for
unknown flow systems where only global operating parameters such as Reynolds (Re) number and raw
data are available, it is often not clear what the optimal number of sensors and their placement for
near-exact reconstruction needs to be. In this effort, we explore the interplay of data sparsity,
sparsity of the underlying flow system and sensor placement on energy sparse reconstruction performance
enabled by data- driven SVD basis. To this end, we investigate sparse convolution-based reconstruction
performance by characterizing operational bounds for canonical laminar cylinder wake flows in
both limit-cycle and transient regimes.
