Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) has become an increasingly important
tool in data science with wide applications in many engineering and scientific fields such as geoscience1-12,
biology13 and the financial industry14. The 4DVar seeks a solution that minimizes the departure
from the background field and the mismatch between the forecast trajectory and the observations
within an assimilation window. The current state-of-the-art 4DVar offers only two choices by using
different forms of the forecast model: the strong- and weak-constrained 4DVar approaches15-16.
The former ignores the model error and only corrects the initial condition error at the expense of
reduced accuracy; while the latter accounts for both the initial and model errors and corrects them
separately, which increases computational costs and uncertainty. To overcome these limitations,
here we develop an integral correcting 4DVar (i4DVar) approach by treating all errors as a whole
and correcting them simultaneously and indiscriminately. To achieve that, a novel exponentially
decaying function is proposed to characterize the error evolution and correct it at each time step
in the i4DVar. As a result, the i4DVar greatly enhances the capability of the strong-constrained
4DVar for correcting the model error while also overcomes the limitation of the weak-constrained
4DVar for being prohibitively expensive with added uncertainty. Numerical experiments with the
Lorenz model show that the i4DVar significantly outperforms the existing 4DVar approaches. It
has the potential to be applied in many scientific and engineering fields and industrial sectors
in the big data era because of its ease of implementation and superior performance.
