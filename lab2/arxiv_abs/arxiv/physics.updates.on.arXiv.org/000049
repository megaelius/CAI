The recent geoneutrino experimental results from KamLAND and Borexino detectors reveal the usefulness
of analyzing the Earth geoneutrino flux, as it provides a constraint on the strength of the radiogenic
heat power and this, in turn, provides a test of compositional models of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE).
This flux is dependent on the amount and distribution of heat producing elements (HPEs: U, Th and
K) in the Earth interior. We have developed a geophysically-based, three-dimensional global reference
model for the abundances and distributions of HPEs in the BSE. The structure and composition of the
outermost portion of the Earth, the crust and underlying lithospheric mantle, is detailed in the
reference model, this portion of the Earth has the greatest influence on the geoneutrino fluxes.
The reference model combines three existing geophysical models of the global crust and yields an
average crustal thickness of 34.4+-4.1 km in the continents and 8.0+-2.7 km in the oceans. In situ
seismic velocity provided by CRUST 2.0 allows us to estimate the average composition of the deep
continental crust by using new and updated compositional databases for amphibolite and granulite
facies rocks in combination with laboratory ultrasonic velocities measurements. An updated xenolithic
peridotite database is used to represent the average composition of continental lithospheric
mantle. Monte Carlo simulation is used to predict the geoneutrino flux at 16 selected locations
and to track the asymmetrical uncertainties of radiogenic heat power due to the log-normal distributions
of HPE concentrations in crustal rocks.
