A strategy based on photo sequencing batch operation was used to select cyanobacteria over unsettled
green algae in a wastewater treatment system, evaluating for the first time the effect of hydraulic
regimes on nutritional dynamics and microorganisms competition. During 30 days of operation,
an initial microalgae mixed consortia dominated by the green microalgae Scenedesmus sp. was cultivated
in two different photo-sequencing batch reactors operated at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of
6 days (PSBR6) and 4 days (PSBR4) at a theoretical solids retention time (SRT) of 10 d. Both reactors
were compared with a semi-continuous reactor (SC10) operated at 10 d of HRT and 10 days of SRT (used
as a control). The results indicated that PSBR6 and PSBR4 decreased Scenedesmus sp. population
by 88% and 48%, respectively. However, only PSBR6 provided suitable conditions to select cyanobacteria
from an initial green algae dominated culture. These conditions included volumetric loads of 11.72
mg TN L-1d-1, 2.04 mg TP L-1d-1 and 53.31 mg TOC L-1d-1. The remaining nutrients in the culture led
also to a phosphorus limiting N:P ratio (34:1) that improved the increase of cyanobacteria from
an initial 2% until 70% of the total population. In addition, PSBR6 reached a biomass production
of 0.12 g L-1d-1, while removing TN, TP and TOC by 58%, 83% and 85%, respectively. Conversely, the
application of higher nutrients loads caused by lower HRT (PSBR4) led to an increase of only 13% of
cyanobacteria while SC10 remained with the same biomass composition during all the experimental
time. Thus, this study showed that the dominance of cyanobacteria in microalgal based wastewater
treatment systems can be controlled by the operational and nutritional conditions. This knowledge
could contribute to control microalgae contamination from up-scaling cyanobacterial biomass
production in wastewater treatment systems.
