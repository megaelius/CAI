Clean energy systems have been investigated recently by the researchers of the University of New
Mexico to increase the efficiency specifically in the solar tower technology. Similar to solar
energy, wave power harnesses energy that comes from the sun. Solar irradiation causes wind by changing
the pressure, and wind gives its momentum to the ocean surface which produces waves. Modeling and
simulation (M&S) of free surface flow can be a very useful tool for the wave energy industry. However,
if these tools are to be relied upon, their accuracy must be tested and shown to be sound. In this investigation,
we focus on verification and validation (V&V) of wave tank flow M&S. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) model
was applied to perform transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis using the numerical
simulation software OpenFOAM. To assess V&V, the height of the free surface flow was considered
as the system response quantity (SRQ). Stokes theory (fifth order) was utilized as the most accurate
available approximation of the exact solution to measure the order of accuracy of the discretized
mathematical model which is known as code verification. Data collected during model-scale testing
at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) Maneuvering and Seakeeping (MASK)
basin were utilized to validate the computational results. The CFD domain consists of a two-dimensional
plane representing the region of interest of the wave basin which has several wave height measurement
probes. Our simulation results were compared to the data from one of these probes in order to conduct
the V&V analysis. Code verification and comparison with experimental values demonstrate the accuracy
and efficiency of our model.
