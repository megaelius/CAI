In growing plant cells, parallel ordering of microtubules (MTs) along the inner surface of the cell
membrane influences the direction of cell expansion and thereby plant morphology. For correct
expansion of organs that primarily grow by elongating, such as roots and stems, MTs must bend in the
high-curvature direction along the cylindrically shaped cell membrane in order to form the required
circumferential arrays. Previous studies, which have recapitulated the self-organization of
these arrays, ignored MT mechanics and assumed MTs follow geodesics of the cell surface. Here, we
show, through analysis of a derived Euler-Lagrange equation, that an elastic MT constrained to
a cylindrical surface will deflect away from geodesics and toward low curvature directions to minimize
bending energy. This occurs when the curvature of the cell surface is relatively high for a given
anchor density. In the limit of infinite anchor density, MTs always follow geodesics. We compare
our analytical predictions to measured curvatures and anchor densities and find that the regime
in which cells are forming these cortical arrays straddles the region of parameter space in which
arrays must form under the antagonistic influence of this mechanically induced deflection. Although
this introduces a potential obstacle to forming circumferentially orientated arrays that needs
to be accounted for in the models, it also raises the question of whether plants use this mechanical
phenomenon to regulate array orientation. The model also constitutes an elegant generalization
of the classical Euler-bucking instability along with an intrinsic unfolding of the associated
pitchfork bifurcation.
