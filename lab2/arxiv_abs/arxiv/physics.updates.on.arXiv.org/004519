In pulsed laser deposition, thin film growth is mediated by a laser-generated plasma, whose properties
are critical for controlling the film microstructure. The advent of 2D materials has renewed the
interest in how this ablation plasma can be used to manipulate the growth and processing of atomically
thin systems. For such purpose, a quantitative understanding of the density, charge state, and
kinetic energy of plasma constituents is needed at the location where they contribute to materials
processes. Here we study laser-induced plasmas over expansion distances of several centimeters
from the ablation target, which is the relevant length scale for materials growth and modification.
The study is enabled by a fast implementation of a laser ablation/plasma expansion model using an
adaptive Cartesian mesh solver. Simulation outcomes for KrF excimer laser ablation of Cu are compared
with Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy measurements. Simulation predictions
for the plasma-shielding threshold, the ionization state of species in the plasma, and the kinetic
energy of ions, are in good correspondence with experimental data. For laser fluences of 1-4 J/cm$^2$,
the plume is dominated by Cu$^0$, with small concentrations of Cu$^{+}$ and electrons at the expansion
front. Higher laser fluences (e.g., 7 J/cm$^2$) lead to a Cu$^{+}$-rich plasma, with a fully ionized
leading edge where Cu$^{2+}$ is the dominant species. In both regimes, simulations indicate the
presence of a low-density, high-temperature plasma expansion front with a high degree of ionization
that may play a significant role in doping, annealing, and kinetically-driven phase transformations
in 2D materials.
