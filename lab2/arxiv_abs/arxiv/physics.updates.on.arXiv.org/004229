Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from the existing vessels. During tumor angiogenesis,
tumor cells secret a number of chemical substrates called tumor angiogenic factors (TAFs). These
factors diffuse through the extracellular matrix (ECM) and degrade the basement membrane of nearby
vasculature. The TAFs also disrupt the corresponding endothelial cell receptors and form finger
like capillary sprouts. These factors also create a chemical gradient (chemotaxis) between the
tumor and the surrounding blood vessels. Due to the chemotactic force, the capillary sprouts migrate
toward the tumor. On the other hand, a haptotactic force due to fibronectin, secreted by the endothelial
cell is also acts on these sprouts. These sprouts grow through the proliferation of recruited endothelial
cells from the parent vessels. The process of tumor angiogenesis is not fully understood. We use
2-D cellular automata (CA) modeling for studying the behavior of tumor angiogenesis using both
Moore and von-Neumann neighborhood. In vivo microenvironment, the chemical substrates are not
uniformly distributed in the ECM. These chemical species diffuse through the ECM depending on their
source, their physical characteristics, and functions. To keep similarities with the in vivo tumor
microenvironment, the CA model is simulated with properly distributed chemical factors for example,
exponential decay have been used to initialize TAFs, and fibronectin; the ECM is initialized with
random values between 0 to 1, etc. The CA model also captures capillary sprout branching and the fusion
of two adjacent sprout tips (anastomoses).
