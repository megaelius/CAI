A Kinetic Inviscid Flux (KIF) is proposed for simulating incompressible and compressible flows.
It is constructed based on the direct modeling of multi-scale flow behaviors, which is used in the
Gas-Kinetic Scheme (GKS), the Unified Gas-Kinetic Scheme (UGKS), the Discrete Unified Gas-Kinetic
Scheme (DUGKS), etc.. In KIF, the discontinuities (such as the shock wave) that can not be well resolved
by mesh cells are mainly solved by the Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting (KFVS) method representing
the free transport mechanism (or micro-scale mechanism), while in other flow regions that are smooth,
the flow behavior is solved mainly by the central-scheme-like Totally Thermalized Transport (TTT).
The weights of KFVS and TTT in KIF is automatically determined by those in the theory of direct modeling.
Two ways of choosing the weights in KIF are proposed, which are actually the weights adopted in the
UGKS and the DUGKS, respectively. By using the test cases of Sod shock tube, rarefaction wave, the
boundary layer of flat plate, the cavity flow and hypersonic flow over circular cylinder, the validity
and accuracy of the present method are examined. The KIF does not suffer from the carbuncle phenomenon,
and does not introduce extra numerical viscosity in smooth regions. Especially, in the case of hypersonic
cylinder, it gives a quite sharp and clear density and temperature contours. The KIF can be viewed
as an inviscid-viscous splitting version of the GKS. By the doing this splitting, it is easy to be
used in the traditional CFD frameworks. It can also be classified as a new type in the numerical schemes
based on the kinetic theory that are represented by the works in Ref. \cite{SunA} and Ref. \cite{ohwada2018a},
except the weights are determined by the weights of direct modeling.
