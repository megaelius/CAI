Purpose: Whole-heart MRA techniques typically target pre-determined motion states and address
cardiac and respiratory dynamics independently. We propose a novel fast reconstruction algorithm,
applicable to ungated free-running sequences, that leverages inherent similarities in the acquired
data to avoid such physiological constraints. Theory and Methods: The proposed SIMilarity-Based
Angiography (SIMBA) method clusters the continuously acquired k-space data in order to find a motion-consistent
subset that can be reconstructed into a motion-suppressed whole-heart MRA. Free-running 3D radial
datasets from six ferumoxytol-enhanced scans of pediatric cardiac patients and twelve non-contrast
scans of healthy volunteers were reconstructed with a non-motion-suppressed regridding of all
the acquired data (All Data), our proposed SIMBA method, and a previously published free-running
framework (FRF) that uses cardiac and respiratory self-gating and compressed sensing. Images
were compared for blood-myocardium interface sharpness, contrast ratio, and visibility of coronary
artery ostia. Results: Both the fast SIMBA reconstruction (~20s) and the FRF provided significantly
higher blood-myocardium sharpness than All Data (P<0.001). No significant difference was observed
among the former two. Significantly higher blood-myocardium contrast ratio was obtained with
SIMBA compared to All Data and FRF (P<0.01). More coronary ostia could be visualized with both SIMBA
and FRF than with All Data (All Data: 4/36, SIMBA: 30/36, FRF: 33/36, both P<0.001) but no significant
difference was found between the first two. Conclusion: The combination of free-running sequences
and the fast SIMBA reconstruction, which operates without a priori assumptions related to physiological
motion, forms a simple workflow for obtaining whole-heart MRA with sharp anatomical structures.
