We present the design, fabrication and experimental investigation of a printed circuit board (PCB)
metagrating (MG) for perfect anomalous reflection. The design follows our previously developed
analytical formalism, resulting in a single-element MG capable of unitary coupling of the incident
wave to the specified (first order) Floquet-Bloch (FB) mode while suppressing the specular reflection.
We characterize the MG performance experimentally using a bistatic scattering pattern measurement,
relying on an original beam-power integration approach for accurate evaluation of the coupling
to the various modes across a wide frequency range. The results show that highly-efficient wide-angle
anomalous reflection is achieved, as predicted by the theory, with a relatively broadband response.
In addition, the MG is found to perform well when illuminated from different angles, acting as a multichannel
reflector, and to scatter efficiently also to higher-order FB modes at other frequencies, exhibiting
multifunctional capabilities. Importantly, the merits of the introduced beam-integration approach,
namely, its improved resilience to measurement inaccuracies or noise effects, and the implicit
accommodation of different effective aperture sizes, are emphasized, highly relevant in view
of the numerous recent experimental reports on anomalous reflection metasurfaces. Finally, we
discuss the source for losses associated with the MG; interestingly, we show that these correlate
well with edge diffraction effects, rather than (commonly assumed) power dissipation. These experimental
results verify our theoretical synthesis scheme, showing that highly-efficient anomalous reflection
is achievable with a realistic fabricated MG, demonstrating the practical applicability and potential
mutifunctionality of analytically designed MGs for future wavefront manipulating devices.
