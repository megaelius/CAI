The Italian government has been one of the most responsive to COVID-19 emergency, through the adoption
of quick and increasingly stringent measures to contain the outbreak. Despite this, Italy has suffered
a huge human and social cost, especially in Lombardy. The aim of this paper is dual: i) first, to investigate
the reasons of the case fatality rate (CFR) differences across Italian 20 regions and 107 provinces,
using a multivariate OLS regression approach; and ii) second, to build a taxonomy of provinces with
similar mortality risk of COVID-19, by using the Ward hierarchical agglomerative clustering method.
I considered health system metrics, environmental pollution, climatic conditions, demographic
variables, and three ad hoc indexes that represent the health system saturation. The results showed
that overall health care efficiency, physician density, and average temperature helped to reduce
the CFR. By the contrary, population aged 70 and above, car and firm density, level of air pollutants
(NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5), relative average humidity, COVID-19 prevalence, and all three indexes
of health system saturation were positively associated with the CFR. Population density, social
vertical integration, and altitude were not statistically significant. In particular, the risk
of dying increases with age, as 90 years old and above had a three-fold greater risk than the 80 to 89
years old and four-fold greater risk than 70 to 79 years old. Moreover, the cluster analysis showed
that the highest mortality risk was concentrated in the north of the country, while the lowest risk
was associated with southern provinces. Finally, since prevalence and health system saturation
indexes played the most important role in explaining the CFR variability, a significant part of
the latter may have been caused by the massive stress of the Italian health system.
