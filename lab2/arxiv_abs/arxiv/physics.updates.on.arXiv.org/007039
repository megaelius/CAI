The use of metals of nanometer dimensions to enhance and manipulate light-matter interactions
for a range of emerging plasmonics-enabled nanophotonic and optoelectronic applications is an
interesting, yet not highly explored area of research outside of plasmonics1,2. Even more importantly,
the concept of an active metal, i.e. a metal that can undergo an optical non-volatile transition
has not been explored. Nanostructure-based applications would have unprecedented impact on both
the existing and future of optics with the development of active and nonlinear optical tunabilities
in single elemental metals3-5. Compared to alloys, pure metals have the material simplicity and
uniformity; however single elemental metals have not been viewed as tunable optical materials,
although they have been explored as viable electrically switchable materials. In this paper we
demonstrate for the first time that antimony (Sb), a pure metal, is optically distinguishable between
two programmable states as nanoscale thin films. We then show that these states are stable at room
temperature, and the states correspond to the crystalline and amorphous phases of the metal. Crucially
from an application standpoint, we demonstrate both its optoelectronic modulation capabilities
as well as speed of switching using single sub-picosecond (ps) pulses. The simplicity of depositing
a single metal portends its potential for use in applications ranging from high speed active metamaterials
to photonic neuromorphic computing, and opens up the possibility for its use in any optoelectronic
application where metallic conductors with an actively tunable state is important.
