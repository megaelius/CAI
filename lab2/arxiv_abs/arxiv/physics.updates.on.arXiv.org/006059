Kinetic Ising models are powerful tools for studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of complex,
discrete systems and for analyzing their experimental recordings. However, the behaviour of the
model is in general not tractable for large networks; therefore, mean field theories are frequently
used to approximate its statistical properties. Many variants of the classical naive and TAP (i.e.,
second-order) mean field approximations have been proposed, each of which makes unique assumptions
about the temporal evolution of the system's correlation structure. This disparity of methods
makes it difficult to systematically advance mean field approaches beyond previous contributions.
Here, we propose a unified framework for mean field theories of the dynamics of asymmetric kinetic
Ising systems based on information geometry. The framework is built on Plefka expansions of the
model around a simplified model obtained by an orthogonal projection to a sub-manifold of tractable
probability distributions. This view not only unifies previous methods but also allows us to propose
novel methods that, in contrast with traditional mean-field approaches, preserve correlations
of the system, both in stationary and transient states. By comparing analytical approximations
and exact numerical simulations, we show that the proposed methods provide more accurate estimates
of covariance evolution in the system than classical equations, and consequently outperform previous
mean field theories for solving the inverse Ising problem. In sum, our framework unifies and extends
current mean-field approximations of kinetic Ising model, constituting a powerful tool for studying
non-equilibrium dynamics of complex systems.
