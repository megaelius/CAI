Animals use a wide variety of strategies to reduce or avoid aggression in conflicts over resources.
These strategies range from sharing resources without outward signs of conflict to the development
of dominance hierarchies, in which initial fighting is followed by the submission of subordinates.
Although models have been developed to analyze specific strategies for resolving conflicts over
resources, little work has focused on trying to understand why particular strategies are more likely
to arise in certain situations. In this paper, we use a model based on an iterated Hawk--Dove game
to analyze how resource holding potentials (RHPs) and other factors affect whether sharing, dominance
relationships, or other behaviors are evolutionarily stable. We find through extensive numerical
simulations that sharing is stable only when the cost of fighting is low and the animals in a contest
have similar RHPs, whereas dominance relationships are stable in most other situations. We also
explore what happens when animals are unable to assess each other's RHP without fighting, and we
compare a range of strategies for this problem using simulations. We find that the most successful
strategies involve a limited period of assessment followed by a stable relationship in which fights
are avoided, and that the duration of assessment depends both on the costliness of fighting and on
the difference between the animals' RHPs. Along with our direct work on modeling and simulations,
we develop extensive software to facilitate further testing; and we make it publicly available
