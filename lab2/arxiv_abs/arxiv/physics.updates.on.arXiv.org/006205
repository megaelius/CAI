The presented paper is a comprehensive analysis of two dark energy cosmological models wherein
exact solutions of the Einstein field equations (EFEs) are obtained in a model-independent way
(or by cosmological parametrization). A simple parametrization of Hubble parameter ($H$) is considered
for the purpose in the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. The parametrization
of $H$ covers some known models for some specific values of the model parameters involved. Two models
are of special interest which shows the behavior of cosmological phase transition from the deceleration
in the past to acceleration at late-times and are in good agreement with some observations. The cosmic
history is discussed in some details for both the models obtained. Moreover, the model parameters
are constrained with updated $57$ points of Hubble datasets together with the $% 580$ points of Union
$2.1$ compilation supernovae datasets and baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) datasets. With
the constrained values of the model parameters, both the models are analyzed and compared with the
standard $\Lambda $CDM model showing nice fit to the observations. Two different candidates of
dark energy are considered, cosmological constant $% \Lambda $ and a general scalar field $\phi
$ and their dynamics are discussed on the geometrical base built. The geometrical and physical interpretation
of the two models in consideration are discussed in details and the evolution of various cosmological
parameters are shown graphically. The age of the Universe in both models is also calculated which
are larger than the standard model. Various cosmological parametrization schemes used in the past
few decades to find exact solutions of the EFEs are also summarized at the end which can serve as a unified
reference for the readers.
