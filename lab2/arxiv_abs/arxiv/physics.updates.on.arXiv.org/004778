We have investigated photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer dynamics following metal-to-ligand
charge-transfer (MLCT) excitation of [Fe(CN)$_4$(2,2'-bipyridine)]$^{2-}$ (1), [Fe(CN)$_4$(2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine)]$^{2-}$
(2) and [Fe(CN)$_4$(2,2'-bipyrimidine)]$^{2-}$ (3) complexes in various solvents with static
and time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and Fe 2p3d resonant inelastic X-ray scattering.
We observe $^3$MLCT lifetimes from 180 fs to 67 ps over a wide range of MLCT energies in different solvents
by utilizing the strong solvatochromism of the complexes. Intramolecular electron transfer lifetimes
governing $^3$MLCT relaxation increase monotonically and (super)exponentially as the $^3$MLCT
energy is decreased in 1 and 2 by changing the solvent. This behavior can be described with non-adiabatic
classical Marcus electron transfer dynamics along the indirect $^3$MLCT->$^3$MC pathway, where
the $^3$MC is the lowest energy metal-centered (MC) excited state. In contrast, the $^3$MLCT lifetime
in 3 changes non-monotonically and exhibits a maximum. This qualitatively different behaviour
results from direct electron transfer from the $^3$MLCT to the electronic ground state (GS). This
pathway involves nuclear tunnelling for the high-frequency polypyridyl skeleton mode ($\hbar\omega$
= 1530 cm$^{-1}$), which is more displaced for 3 than for either 1 or 2, therefore making the direct
pathway significantly more efficient in 3. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of an
efficient $^3$MLCT->GS relaxation pathway in an Fe polypyridyl complex. Our study suggests that
further extending the MLCT state lifetime requires (1) lowering the $^3$MLCT state energy with
respect to the $^3$MC state and (2) suppressing the intramolecular distortion of the electron-accepting
ligand in the $^3$MLCT excited state to suppress the rate of direct $^3$MLCT->GS electron transfer.
