The response of proteins to chemical reactions or impulsive excitation that occurs within the molecule
has fascinated chemists for decades. In recent years ultrafast X-ray studies have provided ever
more detailed information about the evolution of protein structural change following ligand photolysis,
and time-resolved IR and Raman techniques, e.g., have provided detailed pictures of the nature
and rate of energy transport in peptides and proteins, including recent advances in identifying
transport through individual amino acids of several heme proteins. Computational tools to locate
energy transport pathways in proteins have also been advancing. Energy transport pathways in proteins
have since some time been identified by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and more recent efforts
have focused on the development of coarse graining approaches, some of which have exploited analogies
to thermal transport in other molecular materials. With the identification of pathways in proteins
and protein complexes, network analysis has been applied to locate residues that control protein
dynamics and possibly allostery, where chemical reactions at one binding site mediate reactions
at distance sites of the protein. In this chapter we review approaches for locating computationally
energy transport networks in proteins. We present background into energy and thermal transport
in condensed phase and macromolecules that underlies the approaches we discuss before turning
to a description of the approaches themselves. We also illustrate the application of the computational
methods for locating energy transport networks and simulating energy dynamics in proteins with
several examples.
