Flight is a complicated task at small scales in part due to the ubiquitous unsteady air which contains
it. Flying organisms deal with these difficulties using active and passive control mechanisms
to steer their body motion. Body attitudes of flapping organisms are linked with their resultant
flight trajectories and performance, yet little is understood about how discrete unsteady aerodynamic
phenomena affect the interlaced dynamics of such systems. In this study, we examined freely flying
bumblebees subject to a single discrete gust to emulate aerodynamic disturbances encountered
in nature. Bumblebees are expert commanders of the aerial domain as they persistently forage within
complex terrain elements. Physical obstacles such as flowers produce local effects representative
of a typified gust which threatens the precise control of intricate maneuvers. By tracking the 3D
dynamics of bees flying through gusts, we determined the sequences of motion that permit flight
in three disturbance conditions. Bees repetitively executed a series of passive impulsive maneuvers
followed by active recovery maneuvers. Impulsive motion was unique in each gust direction, maintaining
control purely by passive manipulation of the body. Bees pitched up and slowed-down at the beginning
of recovery in every disturbance, followed by corrective maneuvers which brought attitudes back
to their original state. Bees were displaced the most by the sideward gust, displaying large lateral
translations and roll deviations. Upward gusts were easier for bees to fly through, causing only
minor flight changes and minimal recovery times. Downward gusts severely impaired the control
response of bees, inflicting strong adverse forces which sharply upset trajectories. Bees used
interesting control strategies when flying in each disturbance, offering new insights into insect-scale
flapping flight and bio-inspired robotic systems.
