We study the influence of the grafted polyelectrolyte layer on the flow dynamics, and its consequences
on underlying mixing in the rotating microfluidic channel. The methodusedbySadeghi et al. (Phys.
Rev. Fluids., vol. 4(6), 2019, 063701-23; J. Fluid Mech., vol. 887, 2020, pp. A13),is modified by
incorporating the non-linear effect stemming from the polyelectrolyte layer induced electrostaticsto
solve the coupled system of equations integrated with the non-homogeneous boundary conditions.
This method is used to obtain the velocity distribution in the asymptotic limit of geostrophic plug
flow under the framework of the variational calculus approach.We analyze the mixing dynamics from
the perspective of both qualitative assessment and quantitative evaluation. For the qualitative
estimation, we focus on the Poincar\'e map analysis, while the entropy of mixing approach is used
for the mixing quantification. Results show that the grafted polyelectrolyte layer leads to the
development of an electrical double layer, which upon interacting with the external electric field,
strengthens the electroosmotic pumping. Such polyelectrolyte layer modulated strong electroosmotic
pumping together with its intrinsic feature of offering a frictional drag to the underlying transport
helps to modulate the primary as well as the secondary flows under the influence of rotational forces.
With an alteration in the electroosmotic pumping and frictional drag force, tunable through the
thickness of the grafted polyelectrolyte layer, we obtain three different types of secondary flow
vortex configurations viz., a standard double-vortex, dumbbell-shaped vortices and the transition
state between these two.A significant change in the structure and strengths of thesevortices constitutes
a variation in the periodic motion of the secondary flow, which in turn, modulates the chaotic mixing
in the present flow configuration.
