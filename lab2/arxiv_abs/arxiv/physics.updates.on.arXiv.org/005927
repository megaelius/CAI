Spectral pattern recognition is used to measure temperature and generate calibrated wavelength/frequency
combs using a single silicon waveguide ring resonator. The ring generates two incommensurate interleaving
TE and TM spectral combs that shift independently with temperature to create a spectral pattern
that is unique at every temperature. Following an initial calibration, the ring temperature can
be determined by recognizing the spectral resonance pattern, and as a consequence the wavelength
of every resonance is also known. Two methods of pattern based temperature retrieval are presented.
In the first method, the ring is locked to a previously determined temperature set-point defined
by the coincidence of only two specific TE and TM cavity modes. Based on a prior calibration at the
set-point, the ring temperature and hence all resonance wavelengths are then known and the resulting
comb can be used as a wavelength calibration reference. In this configuration, all reference comb
wavelengths have been reproduced within a 5 pm accuracy across an 80 nm range by using an on-chip micro-heater
to tune the ring. For more general photonic thermometry, a spectral correlation algorithm is developed
to recognize a resonance pattern across a 30 nm wide spectral window and thereby determine ring temperature
continuously to 50 mK accuracy. The correlation method is extended to simultaneously determine
temperature and to identify and correct for wavelength calibration errors in the interrogating
light source. The temperature and comb wavelength accuracy is limited primarily by the linewidth
of the ring resonances, with accuracy and resolution scaling with the ring quality factor.
