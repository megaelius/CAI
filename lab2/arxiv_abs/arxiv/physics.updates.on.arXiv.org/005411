Rotational mixing, the key process in stellar evolution, transports angular momentum and chemical
elements in stellar radiative zones. In the past two decades, an emphasis has been placed on the turbulent
transport induced by the vertical shear instability. However, instabilities arising from horizontal
shear and the strength of the anisotropic turbulent transport that they may trigger remain relatively
unexplored. This paper investigates the combined effects of stable stratification, rotation,
and thermal diffusion on the horizontal shear instabilities in the context of stellar radiative
zones. The eigenvalue problem describing linear instabilities of a flow with a hyperbolic-tangent
horizontal shear profile was solved numerically for a wide range of parameters. As a first step,
we consider a polar $f$-plane where the gravity and rotation vector are aligned. Two types of instabilities
are identified: the inflectional and inertial instabilities. The inflectional instability that
arises from the inflection point is the most unstable when at a zero vertical wavenumber and a finite
wavenumber in the streamwise direction along the imposed-flow direction. The three-dimensional
inflectional instability is destabilized by stratification, while it is stabilized by thermal
diffusion. The inertial instability is rotationally driven, and a WKBJ analysis reveals that its
growth rate reaches the maximum $\sqrt{f(1-f)}$ in the inviscid limit as the vertical wavenumber
goes to infinity, where $f$ is the dimensionless Coriolis parameter. The inertial instability
for a finite vertical wavenumber is stabilized as the stratification increases, whereas it is destabilized
by the thermal diffusion. Furthermore, we found a self-similarity in both the inflectional and
inertial instabilities based on the rescaled parameter $PeN^2$ with the P\'{e}clet number $Pe$
and the Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} frequency $N$.
