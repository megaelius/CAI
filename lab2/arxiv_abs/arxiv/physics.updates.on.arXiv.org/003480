Investigating neural activity from a global brain perspective in-vivo has been in the domain of
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) over the past few decades. The intricate neurovascular
couplings that govern fMRI's blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional contrast
are invaluable in mapping active brain regions, but they also entail significant limitations,
such as non-specificity of the signal to active foci. Diffusion-weighted functional MRI (dfMRI)
with relatively high diffusion-weighting strives to ameliorate this shortcoming as it offers
functional contrasts more intimately linked with the underlying activity. Insofar, apart from
somewhat smaller activation foci, dfMRI's contrasts have not been convincingly shown to offer
significant advantages over BOLD, and its contrasts relied on significant modelling. Here, we
study whether dfMRI could offer a better representation of neural activity in the thalamocortical
pathway compared to its (spin-echo (SE)) BOLD counterpart. Using high-end forepaw stimulation
experiments in the rat at 9.4 T, and with significant sensitivity enhancements due to the use of cryocoils,
we show for the first time that dfMRI signals exhibit layer specificity, and, additionally, display
signals in areas devoid of SE-BOLD responses. We find that dfMRI signals in the thalamocortical
pathway cohere with each other, namely, dfMRI signals in the ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamic
nucleus cohere specifically with layers IV and V in the somatosensory cortex. These activity patterns
are much better correlated (compared with SE-BOLD signals) with literature-based electrophysiological
recordings in the cortex as well as thalamus. All these findings suggest that dfMRI signals better
represent the underlying neural activity in the pathway. In turn, this may entail significant implications
towards a much more specific and accurate (...)
