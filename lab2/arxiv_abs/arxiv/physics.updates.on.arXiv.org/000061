Newton set the stage for our view of how science should be done. We remain in what I will call the `Newtonian
Paradigm' in all of physics, including Newton, Einstein, and Schrodinger. As I will show shortly,
Newton invented and bequeathed to us `efficient cause entailing laws' for the entire becoming of
the universe. With Laplace this became the foundation of contemporary reductionism in which all
that can happen in the world is due to efficient cause entailing laws. More this framework stands
as our dominant way to do science. The Newtonian Paradigm has done enormous work in science, and helped
lead to the Industrial Revolution, and even our entry into Modernity. In this paper I propose to challenge
the adequacy of the Newtonian Paradigm on two ground: 1) For the evolution of the biosphere beyond
the watershed of life, we can formulate no efficient cause entailing laws that allow us to deduce
the evolution of the biosphere. A fortiori, the same holds for the evolution of the economy, legal
systems, social systems, and culture. Because I have discussed this before with my colleagues Longo
and Montevil (1,2) and elsewhere, (3,4), my discussion of this first point will be rather brief.
2) What I shall choose to call, after Aristotle's four causes, noted below, Formal Cause Laws derived
from specific `ensemble theories' tell us about the world. But Formal Cause Laws are not reducible
to efficient cause entailing laws of the Newtonian Paradigm and, critically, have already, unnoticed,
crept into biology concerning the origin of life, and economics concerning economic growth. Formal
cause laws appear to be a new way to do science, independent of efficient cause entailing laws. Thus
Formal Cause laws can be independent of any specific material substrate. This may bear on the sufficiency
of Materialism in our account of the world.
