A major remaining challenge for magnetic resonance-based attenuation correction methods (MRAC)
is their susceptibility to sources of MRI artifacts (e.g. implants, motion) as well as uncertainties
due to the limitations of MRI contrast (e.g. accurate bone delineation and density, and separation
of air/bone). We propose using a Bayesian deep convolutional neural network that, in addition to
generating an initial pseudo-CT from MR data, also produces uncertainty estimates of the pseudo-CT
to quantify the limitations of the MR data. These outputs are combined with an MLAA reconstruction
that uses the PET emission data to improve the attenuation maps. With the proposed approach (UpCT-MLAA),
we demonstrate accurate estimation of PET uptake in pelvic lesions and show recovery of metal implants.
In patients without metal implants, UpCT-MLAA had acceptable but slightly higher RMSE than ZeDD-CT
for bone lesions (3.4% and 2.7%, p=0.037 respectively) and soft tissue lesions (4.8% and 4.1%, p=0.16,
respectively) when compared to CTAC. In patients with metal implants, standard MLAA was able to
extract the attenuation coefficients of the metal implant; however, the anatomy outside the implant
region was heavily obscured by noise and cross-talk artifacts. BpCT-AC was able to estimate the
attenuation coefficients in normal anatomy; however, the metal implant was estimated to have attenuation
coefficients of air due to the metal artifact appearing as a signal void on the MRI. UpCT-MLAA estimated
attenuation coefficients of the metal implants while still providing qualitatively and quantitatively
accurate anatomic depiction outside of metal implant regions.
