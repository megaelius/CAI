We report thin-film InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) solar cells with $n-i-p{+}$ deep junction structure
and planar back reflector fabricated by epitaxial lift-off (ELO) of full 3-inch wafers. External
quantum efficiency measurements demonstrate twofold enhancement of the QD photocurrent in the
ELO QD cell compared to the wafer-based QD cell. In the GaAs wavelength range, the ELO QD cell perfectly
preserves the current collection efficiency of the baseline single-junction ELO cell. We demonstrate
by full-wave optical simulations that integrating a micro-patterned diffraction grating in the
ELO cell rearside provides more than tenfold enhancement of the near-infrared light harvesting
by QDs. Experimental results are thoroughly discussed with the help of physics-based simulations
to single out the impact of QD dynamics and defects on the cell photovoltaic behavior. It is demonstrated
that non radiative recombination in the QD stack is the bottleneck for the open circuit voltage ($V_{oc}$)
of the reported devices. More important, our theoretical calculations demonstrate that the $V_{oc}$
offest of 0.3 V from the QD ground state identified by \emph{Tanabe et al., 2012}, from a collection
of experimental data of high quality III-V QD solar cells is a reliable - albeit conservative - metric
to gauge the attainable $V_{oc}$ and to quantify the scope for improvement by reducing non radiative
recombination. Provided that material quality issues are solved, we demonstrate - by transport
and rigorous electromagnetic simulations - that light-trapping enhanced thin-film cells with
twenty InAs/GaAs QD layers reach efficiency higher than 28\% under unconcentrated light, ambient
temperature. If photon recycling can be fully exploited, 30\% efficiency is deemed to be feasible.
