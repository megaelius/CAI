The prediction of turbulent boundary layer (TBL) flow over a convex surface as in aircraft wings
or gas turbine blades is a challenging problem. Finding a universal scaling law of turbulence statistics
of TBLs over a wide range of adverse pressure gradients (APG) remains unresolved. Here, we introduce
characteristic length and velocity scales for APG-TBLs and nondimensionalise the turbulence
statistics of the recent canonical self-similar APG-TBLs by Kitsios {\it et al.} ({\it J. Fluid
Mech.}, vol.829, 2018, pp. 392--419). The characteristic length scale, which is termed the `shear
thickness', $\delta^\ast$, is defined as the location which corresponds to the end of an actively
sheared region in a turbulent shear flow, where the nondimensional shear rate normalised by the
kinetic energy and the dissipation rate is approximately constant. Next, we show a universal scaling
using a mixed velocity, termed the `friction-pressure velocity', $u^\ast$, which is based on total
shear stress. It is revealed that the velocity fluctuations and the Reynolds stresses in TBLs over
a wide range of APGs agree well with those in TBLs with zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG). The present
scaling is used to scale the kinetic energy balance in TBLs, and compare them to other shear flows.
Furthermore, a scaling for small-scale properties, i.e. vorticities, using $\delta^\ast$ and
$u^\ast$ is also obtained assuming the local equilibrium in the inertial range. The present scaling
for wall-bounded shear flows, including TBLs over a wide range of pressure gradients, implies that
the underlying instantaneous turbulence structures have common features under a proper scaling
and is key to the development and application of turbulent models.
