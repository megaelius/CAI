The development of knowledge of how the coronal origin of the solar wind affects its in situ properties
is one of the keys to understanding the relationship between the Sun and the heliosphere. In this
paper, we analyse ACE/SWICS and WIND/3DP data spanning >12 years, and test properties of solar wind
suprathermal electron distributions for the presence of signatures of the coronal temperature
at their origin which may remain at 1AU. In particular we re-examine a previous suggestion that these
properties correlate with the oxygen charge state ratio O7+/O6+; an established proxy for coronal
electron temperature. We find only a very weak but variable correlation between measures of suprathermal
electron energy content and O7+/O6+. The weak nature of the correlation leads us to conclude, in
contrast to earlier results, that an initial relationship with core electron temperature has the
possibility to exist in the corona, but that in most cases no strong signatures remain in the suprathermal
electron distributions at 1AU. It can not yet be confirmed whether this is due to the effects of coronal
conditions on the establishment of this relationship, or to the altering of the electron distributions
by processing during transport in the solar wind en route to 1AU. Contrasting results for the halo
and strahl population favours the latter interpretation. Confirmation of this will be possible
using Solar Orbiter data (cruise and nominal mission phase) to test whether the weakness of the relationship
persists over a range of heliocentric distances. If the correlation is found to strengthen when
closer to the Sun, then this would indicate an initial relationship which is being degraded, perhaps
by wave-particle interactions, en route to the observer
