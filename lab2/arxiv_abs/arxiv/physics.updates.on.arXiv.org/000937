Electro-optic modulators for high-speed on-off keying (OOK) are key components of short- and mediumreach
interconnects in data-center networks. Besides small footprint and cost-efficient large-scale
production, small drive voltages and ultra-low power consumption are of paramount importance
for such devices. Here we demonstrate that the concept of silicon-organic hybrid (SOH) integration
is perfectly suited for meeting these challenges. The approach combines the unique processing
advantages of large-scale silicon photonics with unrivalled electro-optic (EO) coefficients
obtained by molecular engineering of organic materials. In our proof-of-concept experiments,
we demonstrate generation and transmission of OOK signals with line rates of up to 100 Gbit/s using
a 1.1 mm-long SOH Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) which features a {\pi}-voltage of only 0.9 V. This
experiment represents not only the first demonstration of 100 Gbit/s OOK on the silicon photonic
platform, but also leads to the lowest drive voltage and energy consumption ever demonstrated at
this data rate for a semiconductor-based device. We support our experimental results by a theoretical
analysis and show that the nonlinear transfer characteristic of the MZM can be exploited to overcome
bandwidth limitations of the modulator and of the electric driver circuitry. The devices are fabricated
in a commercial silicon photonics line and can hence be combined with the full portfolio of standard
silicon photonic devices. We expect that high-speed power-efficient SOH modulators may have transformative
impact on short-reach optical networks, enabling compact transceivers with unprecedented energy
efficiency that will be at the heart of future Ethernet interfaces at Tbit/s data rates.
