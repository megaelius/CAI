The proposed homogeneous flat-faced layer-like model of a city (termed overlayer), covering what
is generally considered to be a dangerous site (from the point of view of seismic hazard) lends itself
to an explicit theoretical analysis of its response to a seismic body wave radiated by distant sources.
This study is carried out for: ground response of the complete site/overlayer configuration which
is compared to the response of the configuration in which the overlayer is absent, response at the
top of the layer for various layer thicknesses, and determination, as a function of frequency, of
the fraction of incident flux that is dissipated in the overlayer, the underlying layer and, by radiation
damping, in the hard half space. It is shown that all of these entities are highly frequency-dependent
and even large in certain frequency intervals, without any resonant (in the sense of mode excitation)
phenomena coming into play. The results of this study also show that transfer functions do not necessarily
reflect the global response in the built component of a city and that more-appropriate energy-related
functions, termed spectral absorptance (in the blocks of the city or their layer-like surrogate
at the characteristic frequency of the seismic pulse) and absorptance (integral over frequency
of the spectral absorptance), can increase with increasing city density or increasing city height.
In fact, it is shown that more than a third of the incident seismic energy can be sent into, and therefore
cause serious damage to, the built component. On the basis of these findings, it appears that the
probable evolution of the morphology and constitutive properties of cities with time will make
the latter more vulnerable to damage and destruction when submitted to seismic waves.
