Flow behavior in the near-wall region, the variation of natural wavelength (a pair of counter rotating
vortices) and its influence on the normalized torque in Taylor vortex flow (TVF), transition phase
of Taylor vortex flow into wavy vortex and wavy vortex flow (WVF) have been investigated using Direct
Numerical Simulation (DNS) in Taylor-Couette flow for radius ratio 0.5. Near wall region is defined
by the viscous layer (VL) along the axial direction. VL is found to be thinner in the jet impingement
and thicker towards the flow separation region. A distinct drop in the VL thickness with two peak
values of VL across the drop is observed in the flow separation region, and the axial and radial spatial
behavior of VL thickness in the drop region in TVF, transition of TVF into WVF and WVF provide a possibility
of the origin of the non-axisymmetric disturbances and its propagation is in the flow separation
region of outer wall (inflow region) which results in the formation of WVF. The study of flow structure
reveals that in the transition of TVF into WVF, whole inflow region becomes unstable and this results
in the appearance of periodic secondary flow in between two counter rotating vortices. This periodic
secondary flow plays most dominating role in the appearance of strong azimuthal wave in the inflow
region. Study finds that flow structure remains axisymmetric up to Re 425 beyond which WVF appears.
Besides, the natural wavelength varies for TVF and WVF with the change in Reynolds number. The natural
wavelength is found to be maximum in the transition phase of WVF with comparatively lower normalized
torque. The VL thickness and normalized torque is strongly influenced by the natural wavelength,
where decrease in natural wavelength results in the decrease in the thickness of VL and increase
in normalized torque and vice versa.
