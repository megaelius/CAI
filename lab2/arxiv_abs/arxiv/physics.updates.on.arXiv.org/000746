To investigate the role of tachysterol in the photophysical/chemical regulation of vitamin D photosynthesis,
we studied its electronic absorption properties and excited state dynamics using time-dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT), coupled cluster theory (CC2), and non-adiabatic molecular
dynamics. In excellent agreement with experiments, the simulated electronic spectrum shows a
broad absorption band covering the spectra of the other vitamin D photoisomers. The broad band stems
from the spectral overlap of four different ground state rotamers. After photoexcitation, the
first excited singlet state (S1) decays within 882 fs. The S1 dynamics is characterized by a strong
twisting of the central double bond. 96% of all trajectories relax without chemical transformation
to the ground state. In 2.3 % of the trajectories we observed [1,5]-sigmatropic hydrogen shift forming
the partly deconjugated toxisterol D1. 1.4 % previtamin D formation is observed via hula-twist
double bond isomerization. We find a strong dependence between photoreactivity and dihedral angle
conformation: hydrogen shift only occurs in cEc and cEt rotamers and double bond isomerization
occurs mainly in cEc rotamers. Our study confirms the hypothesis that cEc rotamers are more prone
to previtamin D formation than other isomers. We also observe the formation of a cyclobutene-toxisterol
in the hot ground state (0.7 %). Due to its strong absorption and unreactive behavior, tachysterol
acts mainly as a sun shield suppressing previtamin D formation. Tachysterol shows stronger toxisterol
formation than previtamin D. Absorption of low energy UV light by the cEc rotamer can lead to previtamin
D formation. Our study reinforces a recent hypothesis that tachysterol can act as a previtamin D
source when only low energy ultraviolet light is available, as it is the case in winter or in the morning
and evening hours of the day.
