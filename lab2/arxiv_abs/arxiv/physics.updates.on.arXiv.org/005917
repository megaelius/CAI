Standard approaches for uncertainty quantification in cardiovascular modeling pose challenges
due to the large number of uncertain inputs and the significant computational cost of realistic
three-dimensional simulations. We propose an efficient uncertainty quantification framework
utilizing a multilevel multifidelity Monte Carlo estimator to improve the accuracy of hemodynamic
quantities of interest while maintaining reasonable computational cost. This is achieved by leveraging
three cardiovascular model fidelities, each with varying spatial resolution to rigorously quantify
the variability in hemodynamic outputs. We employ two low-fidelity models to construct several
different estimators. Our goal is to investigate and compare the efficiency of estimators built
from combinations of these low-fidelity and high-fidelity models. We demonstrate this framework
on healthy and diseased models of aortic and coronary anatomy, including uncertainties in material
property and boundary condition parameters. We seek to demonstrate that for this application it
is possible to accelerate the convergence of the estimators by utilizing a MLMF paradigm. Therefore,
we compare our approach to Monte Carlo and multilevel Monte Carlo estimators based only on three-dimensional
simulations. We demonstrate significant reduction in total computational cost with the MLMF estimators.
We also examine the differing properties of the MLMF estimators in healthy versus diseased models,
as well as global versus local quantities of interest. As expected, global quantities and healthy
models show larger reductions than local quantities and diseased model, as the latter rely more
heavily on the highest fidelity model evaluations. In all cases, our workflow coupling Dakota's
MLMF estimators with the SimVascular cardiovascular modeling framework makes uncertainty quantification
feasible for constrained computational budgets.
