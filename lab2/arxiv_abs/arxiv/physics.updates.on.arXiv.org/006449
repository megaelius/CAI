In this research, we propose a series of methodologies to mine transit riders travel pattern and
behavioral preferences, and then we use these knowledges to adjust and optimize the transit systems.
Contributions are: 1) To increase the data validity: a) we propose a novel approach to rectify the
time discrepancy of data between the AFC (Automated Fare Collection) systems and AVL (Automated
Vehicle Location) system, our approach transforms data events into signals and applies time domain
correlation the detect and rectify their relative discrepancies. b) By combining historical data
and passengers ticketing time stamps, we induct and compensate missing information in AVL datasets.
2) To infer passengers alighting point, we introduce a maximum probabilistic model incorporating
passengers home place to recover their complete transit trajectory from semi-complete boarding
records.Then we propose an enhance activity identification algorithm which is capable of specifying
passengers short-term activity from ordinary transfers. Finally, we analyze the temporal-spatial
characteristic of transit ridership. 3) To discover passengers travel demands. We integrate each
passengers trajectory data in multiple days and construct a Hybrid Trip Graph (HTG). We then use
a depth search algorithm to derive the spatially closed transit trip chains; Finally, we use closed
transit trip chains of passengers to study their travel pattern from various perspectives. Finally,
we analyze urban transit corridors by aggregating the passengers critical transit chains.4) We
derive eight influential factors, and then construct passengers choice models under various scenarios.
Next, we validate our model using ridership re-distribute simulations. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on passengers temporal choice preference and use this information to optimize urban transit
systems.
