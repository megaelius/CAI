Direct numerical simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are not feasible
yet for most practical turbulent flows. Therefore, dynamically less complex mathematical formulations
are necessary for coarse-grained simulations. In this regard, eddy-viscosity models for Large-Eddy
Simulation (LES) are probably the most popular example thereof. This type of models requires the
calculation of a subgrid characteristic length which is usually associated with the local grid
size. For isotropic grids this is equal to the mesh step. However, for anisotropic or unstructured
grids, such as the pancake-like meshes that are often used to resolve near-wall turbulence or shear
layers, a consensus on defining the subgrid characteristic length has not been reached yet despite
the fact that it can strongly affect the performance of LES models. In this context, a new definition
of the subgrid characteristic length is presented in this work. This flow-dependent length scale
is based on the turbulent, or subgrid stress, tensor and its representations on different grids.
The simplicity and mathematical properties suggest that it can be a robust definition that minimizes
the effects of mesh anisotropies on simulation results. The performance of the proposed subgrid
characteristic length is successfully tested for decaying isotropic turbulence and a turbulent
channel flow using artificially refined grids. Finally, a simple extension of the method for unstructured
meshes is proposed and tested for a turbulent flow around a square cylinder. Comparisons with existing
subgrid characteristic length scales show that the proposed definition is much more robust with
respect to mesh anisotropies and has a great potential to be used in complex geometries where highly
skewed (unstructured) meshes are present.
