COVID-19 pandemic is severely impacting the lives of billions across the globe. Even after taking
massive protective measures like nation-wide lockdowns, discontinuation of international flight
services, rigorous testing etc., the infection spreading is still growing steadily, causing thousands
of deaths and serious socio-economic crisis. Thus, the identification of the major factors of this
infection spreading dynamics is becoming crucial to minimize impact and lifetime of COVID-19 and
any future pandemic. In this work, a probabilistic cellular automata based method has been employed
to model the infection dynamics for a significant number of different countries. This study proposes
that for an accurate data-driven modeling of this infection spread, cellular automata provides
an excellent platform, with a sequential genetic algorithm for efficiently estimating the parameters
of the dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to understand and interpret
COVID-19 data using optimized cellular automata, through genetic algorithm. It has been demonstrated
that the proposed methodology can be flexible and robust at the same time, and can be used to model
the daily active cases, total number of infected people and total death cases through systematic
parameter estimation. Elaborate analyses for COVID-19 statistics of forty countries from different
continents have been performed, with markedly divergent time evolution of the infection spreading
because of demographic and socioeconomic factors. The substantial predictive power of this model
has been established with conclusions on the key players in this pandemic dynamics.
