A break in traditional pore morphology approach, is presented here to see its niche merit over the
conventional sensors for water vapour detection. Tubular pores were replaced with normal cone
for trace- and inverse cone for RH- level detection. The normal conical pore was fabricated by sheer
manipulation of reaction rates of electrolytes, anodic polarization rate and time; and the procedure
made reversed in case of inverse cone structure. Sensor with normal cone geometry exhibits response
in ppm level with sensitivity of 13pF/ppm, lower detection limit(LOD)~120 ppm with excellent response/recovery
time. Lowering LOD further requires alteration of conical geometric parameters in tandem with
kinetic theory of water vapour molecules. In contrast, sensor developed from inverse conical structure
shows response in RH level and LOD touches down to even less than 20 RH% unlike 45 RH% in conventional
RH sensors. Linear response characteristics with sensitivity of 5.14 pF/RH%; surprisingly, the
limitations such as nonlinear response, large response recovery time and high hysteresis as observed
in conventional anodic alumina based humidity sensors have been removed. Sensing mechanism in
both the structures have been suitably demonstrated and ratified with experimental data. Trace
level detection is interpreted with the statistical probabilistic approach in the light of kinetic
theory of gases and Brownian energy. A correlation between top surface pore diameter (through which
water molecule enters) and the optimized mean free path of vapour molecule is established, and demonstrated
its effectiveness for humidity detection in trace level. Results are encouraging and same concept
may be tried for detection of other gaseous stimuli including organic vapours.
