Turbulent flows, ubiquitous in nature and engineering, comprise fluctuations over a wide range
of spatial and temporal scales. While flows with fluctuations in thermodynamic variables are much
more common, much less is known about these flows than their incompressible counterparts in which
thermodynamics is decoupled from hydrodynamics. A critical element in the study of the latter has
been the concept of universal scaling laws which provides fundamental as well as practical information
about the spatio-temporal behavior of these complex systems. Part of this success is due to the dependence
on a single non-dimensional parameter, that is the Reynolds number. Universality in compressible
flows, on the other hand, have proven to be more elusive as no unifying set of parameters were found
to yield universal scaling laws. This severely limits our understanding of these flows and the successful
development of theoretically sound models. Using results in specific asymptotic limits of the
governing equations we show that universal scaling is indeed observed when the set of governing
parameters is expanded to include internally generated dilatational scales which are the result
of the driving mechanisms that produce the turbulence. The analysis demonstrate why previous scaling
laws fail in the general case, and opens up new venues to identify physical processes of interest
and create turbulence models needed for simulations of turbulent flows at realistic conditions.
We support our results with a new massive database of highly-resolved direct numerical simulations
along with all data available in the literature. In search of universal features, we suggest classes
which bundle the evolution of flows in the new parameter space. An ultimate asymptotic regime predicted
independently by renormalization group theories and statistical mechanics is also assssed with
available data.
