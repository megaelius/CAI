Atom interferometers have a multitude of proposed applications in space including precise measurements
of the Earth's gravitational field, in navigation & ranging, and in fundamental physics such
as tests of the weak equivalence principle (WEP) and gravitational wave detection. While atom interferometers
are realized routinely in ground-based laboratories, current efforts aim at the development of
a space compatible design optimized with respect to dimensions, weight, power consumption, mechanical
robustness and radiation hardness. In this paper, we present a design of a high-sensitivity differential
dual species $^{85}$Rb/$^{87}$Rb atom interferometer for space, including physics package,
laser system, electronics and software. The physics package comprises the atom source consisting
of dispensers and a 2D magneto-optical trap (MOT), the science chamber with a 3D-MOT, a magnetic
trap based on an atom chip and an optical dipole trap (ODT) used for Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
creation and interferometry, the detection unit, the vacuum system for $10^{-11}$ mbar ultra-high
vacuum generation, and the high-suppression factor magnetic shielding as well as the thermal control
system. The laser system is based on a hybrid approach using fiber-based telecom components and
high-power laser diode technology and includes all laser sources for 2D-MOT, 3D-MOT, ODT, interferometry
and detection. Manipulation and switching of the laser beams is carried out on an optical bench using
Zerodur bonding technology. The instrument consists of 9 units with an overall mass of 221 kg, an
average power consumption of 608 W (819 W peak), and a volume of 470 liters which would well fit on a
satellite to be launched with a Soyuz rocket, as system studies have shown.
