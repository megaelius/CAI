We consider the theoretical maximum extractable average power from an energy harvesting device
attached to a vibrating table which provides a unidirectional displacement $A\sin(\omega t)$.
The total mass of moving components in the device is $m$. The device is assembled in a container of
dimension $L$, limiting the displacements and deformations of components within. The masses in
the device may be interconnected in arbitrary ways. The maximum extractable average power is bounded
by $\frac{mLA\omega^3}{\pi}$, for motions in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions; with both rectilinear and rotary
motions as special cases; and with either single or multiple degrees of freedom. The limiting displacement
profile of the moving masses for extracting maximum power is discontinuous, and not physically
realizable. But smooth approximations can be nearly as good: with $15$ terms in a Fourier approximation,
the upper limit is $99$\% of the theoretical maximum. Purely sinusoidal solutions are limited to
$\frac{\pi}{4}$ times the theoretical maximum. For both single-degree-of-freedom linear resonant
devices and nonresonant whirling devices where the energy extraction mimics a linear torsional
damper, the maximum average power output is $\frac{mLA\omega^3}{4}$. Thirty-six experimental
energy harvesting devices in the literature are found to extract power amounts ranging from $0.0036$\%
to $29$\% of the theoretical maximum. Of these thirty-six, twenty achieve less than 2\% and three
achieve more than 20\%. We suggest, as a figure of merit, that energy extraction above $\frac{0.2
mLA\omega^3}{\pi}$ may be considered excellent, and extraction above $\frac{0.3 mLA\omega^3}{\pi}$
may be considered challenging.
