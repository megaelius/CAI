We experimentally investigated the contrast mechanism of infrared photoinduced force microscopy
(PiFM) for recording vibrational resonances. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that spectroscopic
contrast in PiFM is mediated by opto-mechanical damping of the cantilever oscillation as the optical
wavelength is scanned through optical resonance. To our knowledge, this is the first time opto-mechanical
damping has been observed in the AFM. We hypothesize that this damping force is a consequence of the
dissipative interaction between the sample and the vibrating tip; the modulated light source in
PiFM modulates the effective damping constant of the 2nd eigenmode of the cantilever which in turn
generate side-band signals producing the PiFM signal at the 1st eigenmode. A series of experiments
have eliminated other mechanisms of contrast. By tracking the frequency shift of the PiFM signal
at the 1st cantilever eigenmode as the excitation wavenumber is tuned through a mid-infrared absorption
band, we showed that the near-field optical interaction is attractive. By using a vibrating piezoelectric
crystal to mimic sample thermal expansion in a PiFM operating in mixing mode, we determined that
the minimum thermal expansion our system can detect is 30 pm limited by system noise. We have confirmed
that van der Waal mediated thermal-expansion forces have negligible effect on PiFM signals by detecting
the resonant response of a 4-methylbenzenethiol mono molecular layer deposited on template-stripped
gold, where thermal expansion was expected to be < 3 pm, i.e., 10 times lower than our system noise
level. Finally, the basic theory for dissipative tip-sample interactions was introduced to model
the photoinduced opto-mechanical damping. Theoretical simulations are in excellent agreement
with experiment.
