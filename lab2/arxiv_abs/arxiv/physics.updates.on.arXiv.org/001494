We use interface-resolved simulations to study finite-size effects in turbulent channel flow
of neutrally-buoyant spheres. Two cases with particle sizes differing by a factor of 2, at the same
solid volume fraction of 20% and bulk Reynolds number are considered. These are complemented with
two reference single-phase flows: the unladen case, and the flow of a Newtonian fluid with the effective
suspension viscosity of the same mixture in the laminar regime. As recently highlighted in Costa
et al. (PRL 117, 134501), a particle-wall layer is responsible for deviations of the statistics
from what is observed in the continuum limit where the suspension is modeled as a Newtonian fluid
with an effective viscosity. Here we investigate the fluid and particle dynamics in this layer and
in the bulk. In the particle-wall layer, the near wall inhomogeneity has an influence on the suspension
micro-structure over a distance proportional to the particle size. In this layer, particles have
a significant (apparent) slip velocity that is reflected in the distribution of wall shear stresses.
This is characterized by extreme events (both much higher and much lower than the mean). Based on
these observations we provide a scaling for the particle-to-fluid apparent slip velocity as a function
of the flow parameters. We also extend the flow scaling laws in to second-order Eulerian statistics
in the homogeneous suspension region away from the wall. Finite-size effects in the bulk of the channel
become important for larger particles, while negligible for lower-order statistics and smaller
particles. Finally, we study the particle dynamics along the wall-normal direction. Our results
suggest that 1-point dispersion is dominated by particle-turbulence (and not particle-particle)
interactions, while differences in 2-point dispersion and collisional dynamics are consistent
with a picture of shear-driven interactions.
