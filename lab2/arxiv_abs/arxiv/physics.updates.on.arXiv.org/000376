Flux emergence is widely recognized to play an important role in the initiation of coronal mass ejections.
The Chen-Shibata (2000) model, which addresses the connection between emerging flux and flux rope
eruptions, can be implemented numerically to demonstrate how emerging flux through the photosphere
can ultimately cause the eruption of a coronal flux rope. The model's sensitivity to the initial
conditions is investigated with a parameter study. We aim to understand the stability of the coronal
flux rope in the context of X-point collapse, and study the effect of boundary driving on both unstratified
and stratified atmospheres. A modified version of the model is implemented in a code with high numerical
accuracy with different combinations of initial parameters governing the magnetic equilibrium
and gravitational stratification of the atmosphere. In the absence of driving, we assess the behavior
of waves in the vicinity of the X-point. With boundary driving applied, we study the effect of stratification
on the eruption. We find that the Chen-Shibata equilibrium can be unstable to an X-point collapse
even in the absence of driving due to wave accumulation at the X-point. Such a collapse can generate
a coronal mass ejection, or produce a failed eruption. However, the equilibrium can be stabilized
by reducing the compressibility of the plasma, which allows small-amplitude waves to pass through
the X-point without accumulation. For stable initial configurations, simulations of the flux
emergence via photospheric boundary driving demonstrate the impact of atmospheric stratification
on the dynamics of resulting eruptions. In particular, in a stratified atmosphere, we identify
a novel mechanism for producing quasi-periodic behavior at the reconnection site behind a coronal
mass ejection as a possible explanation of similar phenomena previously observed in solar and stellar
flares.
