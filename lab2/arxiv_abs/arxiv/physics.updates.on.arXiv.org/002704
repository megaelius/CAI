This paper analyzes the effects of input uncertainties on the outputs of a three dimensional natural
convection problem in a differentially heated cubical enclosure. Two different cases are considered
for parameter uncertainty propagation and global sensitivity analysis. In case A, stochastic
variation is introduced in the two non-dimensional parameters (Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers)
with an assumption that the temperature boundary condition is uniform. Being a two dimensional
stochastic problem, the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method is used as a surrogate model. Case
B deals with non-uniform stochasticity in the boundary temperature. Instead of the traditional
Gaussian process model with the Karhunen-Lo$\grave{e}$ve expansion, a novel approach is successfully
implemented to model uncertainty in the boundary condition. The boundary is divided into multiple
domains and the temperature imposed on each domain is assumed to be an independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d) random variable. Deep neural networks are trained with the boundary temperatures
as inputs and Nusselt number, internal temperature or velocities as outputs. The number of domains
which is essentially the stochastic dimension is 4, 8, 16 or 32. Rigorous training and testing process
shows that the neural network is able to approximate the outputs to a reasonable accuracy. For a high
stochastic dimension like 32, it is computationally expensive to fit the PCE. This paper demonstrates
a novel way of using the deep neural network as a surrogate modeling method of uncertainty quantification
with the number simulations much lesser than that required for fitting the PCE thus, saving the computational
cost.
