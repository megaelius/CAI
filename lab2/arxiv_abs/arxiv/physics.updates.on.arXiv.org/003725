This work introduces a 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pressure reconstruction method
which employs weighted least-squares (WLS) for pressure integration. Pressure gradients are
calculated from the velocity fields, and velocity errors are estimated from the velocity divergence
for incompressible flow. Pressure gradient errors are estimated by propagating the velocity errors
through Navier-Stokes momentum equation. A weight matrix is generated based on the pressure gradient
errors, then employed for pressure reconstruction. The pressure reconstruction method was demonstrated
and analyzed using synthetic velocity fields as well as Poiseuille flow measured using in vitro
4D-flow MRI. Performance of the proposed WLS method was compared to the method of solving the pressure
Poisson equation which has been the primary method used in the previous studies. Error analysis
indicated that the proposed method is more robust to velocity measurement errors. Improvement
on pressure results was found to be more significant for the cases with spatially-varying velocity
error level, with reductions in error ranging from 50% to over 200%. Finally, the method was applied
to flow in a patient-specific cerebral aneurysm. Validation was performed with in vitro flow data
collected using Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) and Shake the Box (STB) method, and in vivo
flow measurement obtained using 4D-flow MRI. Pressure calculated by WLS, as opposed to the Poisson
equation, was more consistent with the flow structures and showed better agreement between the
in vivo and in vitro data. These results suggest the utility of WLS method to obtain reliable pressure
field from clinical flow measurement data.
