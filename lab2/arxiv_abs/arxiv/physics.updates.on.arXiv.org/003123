Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are emerging as mathematical tools to assist in the diagnostic
assessment of cardiovascular disease. Recent advances in medical imaging and computational algorithms
for analyzing said images have made subject-specific modeling of the cardiovascular system a feasible
task. This is particularly important in the case of pulmonary hypertension, as the pulmonary circulation
transports oxygen to the lungs via a rapidly bifurcating network of highly compliant blood vessels.
However, medical image analysis is subject to uncertainty, which can lead to variation in fluid
model predictions. This study addresses this issue by developing a computational algorithm to
determine pulmonary hemodynamics (blood pressure and flow) in a large network of arterial vessels
and subsequently quantify the uncertainty of these predictions to geometric variation associated
with image segmentation. We introduce uncertainty in the blood vessel network by generating multiple
segmentations of a pulmonary tree from a single image of an excised mouse lung using randomly selected
pre-segmentation parameters. We use a custom MATLAB algorithm to extract vessel radii, length,
and connectivity for each pulmonary network generated. We quantify the uncertainty in geometric
features of the network using density estimation techniques to specify probability densities
for vessel radius and length. We sample from these distributions, compute model parameters, and
propagate uncertainties to pressure and flow predictions using a one-dimensional (1D) fluid dynamics
model. Results show that variation in network connectivity is a larger contributor to hemodynamic
uncertainty in comparison to changes in vessel radius and length.
