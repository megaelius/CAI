We use magnetic field and ion moment data from the MFI and SWE instruments onboard the Wind spacecraft
to study the nature of solar wind turbulence at ion-kinetic scales. We analyze the spectral properties
of magnetic field fluctuations between 0.1 and 5.5 Hz over 2012 using an automated routine, computing
high-resolution 92 s power and magnetic helicity spectra. To ensure the spectral features are physical,
we make the first in-flight measurement of the MFI `noise-floor' using tail-lobe crossings of the
Earth's magnetosphere during early 2004. We utilize Taylor's hypothesis to Doppler-shift into
the spacecraft frequency frame, finding that the spectral break observed at these frequencies
is best associated with the proton-cyclotron resonance scale, $1/k_c$, compared to the proton
inertial length $d_i$ and proton gyroscale $\rho_i$. This agreement is strongest when we consider
periods where $\beta_{i,\perp}\sim1$, and is consistent with a spectral break at $d_i$ for $\beta_{i,\perp}\ll1$
and $\rho_i$ for $\beta_{i,\perp}\gg1$. We also find that the coherent magnetic helicity signature
observed at these frequencies is bounded at low frequencies by $1/k_c$ and its absolute value reaches
a maximum at $\rho_i$. These results hold in both slow and fast wind streams, but with a better correlation
in the more Alfv\'enic fast wind where the helicity signature is strongest. We conclude that these
findings are consistent with proton-cyclotron resonance as an important mechanism for dissipation
of turbulent energy in the solar wind, occurring at least half the time in our selected interval.
However, we do not rule out additional mechanisms.
