The tracking of radiation dose is a fundamental concept for the safe operation of nuclear instruments,
and this concept is a multi-task challenge in the case of neutron sources since not only the neutron
emissions from the main radioactive source but also the neutron capture gamma-rays as well as the
gamma-rays from the inelastic neutron scattering make contribution to the total dose received
by the facility personnel. The present study is devoted to the assessment of the equivalent dose
rates on the surface of a Nuclear-Chicago NH3 neutron howitzer with a 5-Ci 239Pu-Be neutron source
by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The 5-Ci 239Pu- Be neutron source is mounted within a vertical
aluminum channel at the center of the neutron howitzer, and we use the axial symmetry of the aluminum
drum filled with an ordinary paraffin without any potent neutron absorber such as boron or cadmium.
We utilise the ICRP-21 ux-to-dose rate conversion factors and we track the neutron and photon equivalent
dose rates on the lateral and top surfaces including the outlets of the vertical and horizontal irradiation
channels by the aid of point detectors in the MCNP5 code. From the results over a number of sub- regions
on the semi-cylindrical drum of the Nuclear-Chicago NH3 neutron howitzer, we show that the outlets
of both the vertical and horizontal irradiation channels deliver approximately the same level
of equivalent dose rates, and the maximum equivalent dose rates for neutrons and photons on the lateral
surface are obtained at the spatial coordinates aligned with the location of the 5-Ci 239Pu-Be neutron
source, whereas the periphery around the source channel on the top surface of the neutron howitzer
constitutes the highest level of equivalent dose rates among the tracked locations.
