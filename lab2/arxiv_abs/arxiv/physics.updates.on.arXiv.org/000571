We report results of long timescale adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations aimed at identifying
possible molecular reordering processes on both proton-disordered and ordered (Fletcher) basal
plane (0001) surfaces of hexagonal ice. The simulations are based on a force field for flexible molecules
and span a time interval of up to 50 {\mu}s at a temperature of 100 K, which represents a lower bound
to the temperature range of Earth's atmosphere. Additional calculations using both density functional
theory and an ab initio based polarizable potential function are performed to test and refine the
force field predictions. Several distinct processes are found to occur readily even at this low
temperature, including concerted reorientation (flipping) of neighboring surface molecules,
which changes the pattern of dangling H-atoms, and the formation of interstitial defects by the
downwards motion of upper-bilayer molecules. On the proton-disordered surface, one major surface
roughening process is observed that significantly disrupts the crystalline structure. Despite
much longer simulation time, such roughening processes are not observed on the highly ordered Fletcher
surface which is energetically more stable because of smaller repulsive interaction between neighboring
dangling H-atoms. However, a more localized process takes place on the Fletcher surface involving
a surface molecule transiently leaving its lattice site. The flipping process provides a facile
pathway of increasing proton-order and stabilizing the surface, supporting a predominantly Fletcher-like
ordering of low-temperature ice surfaces, but our simulations also show that proton- disordered
patches on the surface may induce significant local reconstructions. Further, a subset of the molecules
on the Fletcher surface are susceptible to forming interstitial defects.
