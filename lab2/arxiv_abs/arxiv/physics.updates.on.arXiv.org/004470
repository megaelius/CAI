When monitoring a reactor site for nuclear nonproliferation purposes, the presence of an unknown
or hidden nuclear reactor could be obscured by the activities of a known reactor of much greater power
nearby. Thus when monitoring reactor activities by the observation of antineutrino emissions,
one must discriminate known background reactor fluxes from possible unknown reactor signals under
investigation. To quantify this discrimination, we find the confidence to reject the (null) hypothesis
of a single proximal reactor, by exploiting directional antineutrino signals in the presence of
a second, unknown reactor. In particular, we simulate the inverse beta decay (IBD) response of a
detector filled with a 1 kT fiducial mass of Gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator in mineral oil.
We base the detector geometry on that of WATCHMAN, an upcoming antineutrino monitoring experiment
soon to be deployed at the Boulby mine in the United Kingdom whose design and deployment will be detailed
in a forthcoming white paper. From this simulation, we construct an analytical model of the IBD event
distribution for the case of one $4\mathrm{\ GWt}\pm2\%$ reactor 25 km away from the detector site,
and for an additional, unknown, 35 MWt reactor 3 to 5 km away. The effects of natural-background rejection
cuts are approximated. Applying the model, we predict $3\sigma$ confidence to detect the presence
of an unknown reactor within five weeks, at standoffs of 3 km or nearer. For more distant unknown reactors,
the $3\sigma$ detection time increases significantly. However, the relative significance of
directional sensitivity also increases, providing up to an eight week speedup to detect an unknown
reactor at 5 km away. Therefore, directionally sensitive antineutrino monitoring can accelerate
the mid-field detection of unknown reactors whose operation might otherwise be masked by more powerful
reactors in the vicinity.
