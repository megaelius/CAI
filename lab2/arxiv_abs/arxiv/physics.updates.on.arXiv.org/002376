Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the main methods in Quantum Chemistry that offers an attractive
trade off between the cost and accuracy of quantum chemical computations. The electron density
plays a key role in DFT. In this work, we explore whether machine learning - more specifically, deep
neural networks (DNNs) - can be trained to predict electron densities faster than DFT. First, we
choose a practically efficient combination of a DFT functional and a basis set (PBE0/pcS-3) and
use it to generate a database of DFT solutions for more than 133,000 organic molecules from a previously
published database QM9. Next, we train a DNN to predict electron densities and energies of such molecules.
The only input to the DNN is an approximate electron density computed with a cheap quantum chemical
method in a small basis set (HF/cc-VDZ). We demonstrate that the DNN successfully learns differences
in the electron densities arising both from electron correlation and small basis set artifacts
in the HF computations. All qualitative features in density differences, including local minima
on lone pairs, local maxima on nuclei, toroidal shapes around C-H and C-C bonds, complex shapes around
aromatic and cyclopropane rings and CN group, etc. are captured by the DNN. Accuracy of energy predictions
by the DNN is ~ 1 kcal/mol, on par with other models reported in the literature, while those models
do not predict the electron density. Computations with the DNN, including HF computations, take
much less time that DFT computations (by a factor of ~20-30 for most QM9 molecules in the current version,
and it is clear how it could be further improved).
