The integration of miniaturized optical spectrometers into mobile platforms will have an unprecedented
impact on applications ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to mobile phones. To address
this demand, silicon photonics stands out as a platform capable of delivering compact and cost-effective
devices. The Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) is largely used in free-space spectroscopy,
and its implementation in silicon photonics will contribute to bringing broadband operation and
fine resolution to the chip scale. The implementation of an integrated silicon photonics FTS (Si-FTS)
must nonetheless take into account effects such as waveguide dispersion and non-linearity of refractive
index tuning mechanisms. Here we present the modeling and experimental demonstration of a silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) Si-FTS with integrated microheaters. We show how the power spectral density (PSD) of a light
source and the interferogram measured with the Si-FTS can be related through a simple Fourier transform
(FT), provided the optical frequency and time delay are corrected to account for dispersion, thermo-optic
non-linearity and thermal expansion. We calibrate the Si-FTS, including the correction parameters,
using a tunable laser source and we successfully retrieve the PSD of a broadband source. The aforementioned
effects are shown to effectively enhance the Si-FTS resolution when properly accounted for. Finally,
we discuss the Si-FTS resilience to chip-scale fabrication variations, a major advantage for large-scale
manufacturing. Providing design flexibility and robustness, the Si-FTS is poised to become a fundamental
building-block for on-chip spectroscopy
