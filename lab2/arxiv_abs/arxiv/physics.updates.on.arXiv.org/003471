Each living species carries a complex DNA sequence that determines their unique features and functionalities.
It is generally assumed that life started from a random pool of oligonucleotides sequences, generated
by a prebiotic polymerization of nucleotides. The mechanism that initially facilitated the emergence
of sequences that code for the function of the first species from such a random pool of sequences remains
unknown. It is a central problem of the origin of life. An interesting option would be a self-selection
mechanism by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Initial concentration fluctuations of specific
sequence motifs would have been amplified and outcompeted less abundant sequences, enhancing
the signal to noise to replicate and select functional sequences. Here, we demonstrate with experimental
and theoretical findings that templated ligation would provide such a self-selection. In templated
ligation, two adjacent single sequences strands are chemically joined when a third complementary
strand sequence brought them in close proximity. This simple mechanism was a likely side-product
of a prebiotic polymerization chemistry once the strands reach the length to form double stranded
species. As shown here, the ligation gave rise to a nonlinear replication process by the cooperative
ligation of matching sequences which self-promoted their own elongation. This led to a cascade
of enhanced template binding and faster ligation reactions. A requirement was the reshuffling
of the strands by thermal cycling, enabled for example by microscale convection. Assuming that
templated ligation was driven by the same chemical mechanism that generated prebiotic polymerization
of oligonucleotides, the mechanism could function as a missing link between polymerization and
the self-stabilized replication, offering a pathway to the autonomous emergence of Darwinian
evolution for the origin of life.
