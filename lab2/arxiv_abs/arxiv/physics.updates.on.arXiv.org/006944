During its Run 2 (2015-2018), the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operated at almost twice higher energy,
and provided Pb-Pb collisions with an order of magnitude higher luminosity, than in the previous
Run 1. In consequence, the power of the secondary beams emitted from the interaction points by the
bound-free pair production (BFPP) process increased by a factor ~20, while the propensity of the
bending magnets to quench increased with the higher magnetic field. This beam power is about 35 times
greater than that contained in the luminosity debris from hadronic interactions and is focused
on specific locations that fall naturally inside superconducting magnets. The risk of quenching
these magnets has long been recognized as severe and there are operational limitations due to the
dynamic heat load that must be evacuated by the cryogenic system. High-luminosity operation was
nevertheless possible thanks to orbit bumps that were introduced in the dispersion suppressors
around the ATLAS and CMS experiments to prevent quenches by displacing and spreading out these beam
losses. Further, in 2015, the BFPP beams were manipulated to induce a controlled quench, thus providing
the first direct measurement of the steady-state quench level of an LHC dipole magnet. The same experiment
demonstrated the need for new collimators that are being installed around the ALICE experiment
to intercept the secondary beams in the future. This paper discusses the experience with BFPP at
luminosities very close to the future High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) target, gives results on the
risk reduction by orbit bumps and presents a detailed analysis of the controlled quench experiment.
