Power dissipation in electromagnetic absorbers is a quadratic function of the incident fields.
To characterize an absorber, one needs to deal with the coupling that may occur between different
excitations. Energy Absorption Interferometry (EAI) is a technique that highlights the independent
degrees of freedom through which a structure can absorb energy: the natural absorption modes of
the structure. The coupling between these modes vanishes. In this paper, we use the EAI formalism
to analyse different kinds of plasmonic periodic absorbers while rigorously accounting for the
coupling: resonant golden patches on a grounded dielectric slab, parallel free-standing silver
wires and a silver slab of finite thickness. The EAI formalism is used to identify the physical processes
that mediate absorption in the near and far field. First, we demonstrate that the angular absorption,
which is classically used to characterize periodic absorbers in the far field and which neglects
the coupling between different plane waves, is only valid under stringent conditions (subwavelength
periodicity, far field excitation and negligible coupling between the two possible polarizations).
Using EAI, we show how the dominant absorption channels can be identified through the signature
of the absorption modes of the structure, while rigorously accounting for the coupling. We then
exploit these channels to improve absorption. We show that long-range processes can be exploited
to enhance the spatial selectivity, while short-range processes can be exploited to improve absorptivity
over wide angles of incidence. Lastly, we show that simply adding scatterers with the proper periodicity
on top of the absorber, the absorption can be increased by more than one order of magnitude.
