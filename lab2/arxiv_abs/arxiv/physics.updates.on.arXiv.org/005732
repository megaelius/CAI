Previous self-assembly experiments on a model icosahedral plant virus have shown that, under physiological
conditions, capsid proteins initially bind to the genome through an en masse mechanism and form
nucleoprotein complexes in a disordered state, which raises the questions as to how virions are
assembled into a highly ordered structure in the host cell. Using small-angle X-ray scattering,
we find out that a disorder-order transition occurs under physiological conditions upon an increase
in capsid protein concentrations. Our cryo-transmission electron microscopy reveals closed
spherical shells containing in vitro transcribed viral RNA even at pH 7.5, in marked contrast with
the previous observations. We use Monte Carlo simulations to explain this disorder-order transition
and find that, as the shell grows, the structures of disordered intermediates in which the distribution
of pentamers does not belong to the icosahedral subgroups become energetically so unfavorable
that the caps can easily dissociate and reassemble overcoming the energy barriers for the formation
of perfect icosahedral shells. In addition, we monitor the growth of capsids under the condition
that the nucleation and growth is the dominant pathway and show that the key for the disorder-order
transition in both en masse and nucleation and growth pathways lies in the strength of elastic energy
compared to the other forces in the system including protein-protein interactions and the chemical
potential of free subunits. Our findings explain, at least in part, why perfect virions with icosahedral
order form under different conditions including physiological ones.
