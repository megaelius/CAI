Using meteor wind data from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) in the Northern Hemisphere,
we (1) demonstrate that the migrating (Sun-synchronous) tides can be separated from the nonmigrating
components in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region and (2) use this to determine the
response of the different components of the semidiurnal tide (SDT) to sudden stratospheric warming
(SSW) conditions. The radars span a limited range of latitudes around 60$^{\circ}$ N and are located
over nearly 180$^{\circ}$ of longitude. The migrating tide is extracted from the nonmigrating
components observed in the meridional wind recorded from meteor ablation drift velocities around
95-km altitude, and a 20-year climatology of the different components is presented. The well-documented
late summer and wintertime maxima in the semidiurnal winds are shown to be due primarily to the migrating
SDT, whereas during late autumn and spring the nonmigrating components are at least as strong as
the migrating SDT. The robust behavior of the SDT components during SSWs is then examined by compositing
13 SSW events associated with an elevated stratopause recorded between 1995 and 2013. The migrating
SDT is seen to reduce in amplitude immediately after SSW onset and then return anomalously strongly
around 10-17 days after the SSW onset. We conclude that changes in the underlying wind direction
play a role in modulating the tidal amplitude during the evolution of SSWs and that the enhancement
in the midlatitude migrating SDT (previously reported in modeling studies) is observed in the MLT
at least up to 60$^{\circ}$ N.
