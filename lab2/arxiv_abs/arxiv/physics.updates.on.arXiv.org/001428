A linear stability analysis of a two-layer plane Couette flow of two immiscible fluid layers with
different densities, viscosities and thicknesses, bounded by two infinite parallel plates moving
at a constant relative velocity to each other, with an insoluble surfactant along the interface
and in the presence of gravity is carried out. The normal modes approach is applied to the equations
governing flow disturbances. These equations, together with boundary conditions at the plates
and the interface, yield a linear eigenvalue problem. When inertia is neglected velocity amplitudes
are linear combinations of hyperbolic functions, and a quadratic dispersion equation for the complex
growth rate is obtained where coefficients depend on the aspect ratio, the viscosity ratio, the
basic velocity shear, the Marangoni number Ma that measures the effects of surfactant, and the Bond
number Bo that measures the influence of gravity. An extensive investigation is carried out that
examines the stabilizing or destabilizing influences of these parameters. There are two continuous
branches of the normal modes: a robust branch that exists even with no surfactant, and a surfactant
branch that vanishes when Ma $\downarrow 0$. Due to the availability of the explicit forms for the
growth rates, in many instances the numerical results are corroborated with analytical asymptotics.
For the less unstable branch, a mid-wave interval of unstable wavenumbers (Halpern and Frenkel
(2003)) sometimes co-exists with a long-wave one. We study the instability landscape, determined
by the threshold curve of the long-wave instability and the critical curve of the mid-wave instability
in the (Ma, Bo)-plane. The changes of the extremal points of the critical curves with the variation
of the other parameters, such as the viscosity ratio, and the extrema bifurcation points are investigated.
