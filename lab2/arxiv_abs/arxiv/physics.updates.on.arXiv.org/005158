The synthetic emission spectra and opacity of high-density, high-temperature germanium (Z=32)
plasma from super-transition-array (STA) calculations are presented. The viability of the STA
model, which is based on a statistical superconfigurations accounting approach for calculating
the atomic and radiative properties, is examined by comparing and contrasting its results against
the available experimental data and other theoretical calculations. First, we focus on the emission
data. To model the data, the Eulerian radiation-hydrodynamics code FastRad3D is used in conjunction
with STA to obtain the STA-required inputs, namely, the time-dependent temperature and density
profiles of the Ge plasmas. Consequently, we find that STA results fit the experimental spectrum
[High Energy Density Phys., 6 (2010) 105] reasonably well. However, careful comparison between
experimental and theoretical results in the photon-energy regions of ~ 1.7 keV shows some degrees
of disparity between the two. This may be due to the non-LTE effects and the presence of spatial gradients
in the sample. Limitations of STA to model the experimental spectrum precisely is expected and underscoring
the difficulty of the present attempts as the model assumed local thermodynamics equilibrium population
dynamics. Second, we examine the STA calculated multi-frequency opacities, ionized population
fraction and average ionization for a broad range of Ge plasma conditions. Comparing with a hybrid
LTE opacity code which combines the statistical super-transition-array and fine-structure methods
[High Energy Density Phys., 7 (2011) 234], impressively good agreement is found between the two
calculations.
