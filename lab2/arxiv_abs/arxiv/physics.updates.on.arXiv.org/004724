Single-photon detectors (SPDs) play important roles in highly sensitive detection applications,
such as fluorescence spectroscopy, remote sensing and ranging, deep space optical communications,
elementary particle detection, and quantum communications. However, the adverse conditions
in space, such as the increased radiation flux and thermal vacuum, severely limit their noise performances,
reliability, and lifetime. Herein, we present the first example of spaceborne, low-noise, high
reliability SPDs, based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) silicon avalanche photodiodes (APD).
Based on the high noise-radiation sensitivity of silicon APD, we have developed special shielding
structures, multistage cooling technologies, and configurable driver electronics that significantly
improved the COTS APD reliability and mitigated the SPD noise-radiation sensitivity. This led
to a reduction of the expected in-orbit radiation-induced dark count rate (DCR) from ~219 counts
per second (cps) per day to ~0.76 cps/day. During a continuous period of continuous operations in
orbit which spanned of 1029 days, the SPD DCR was maintained below 1000 cps, i.e., the actual in-orbit
radiation-induced DCR increment rate was ~0.54 cps/day, i.e., two orders of magnitude lower than
those evoked by previous technologies, while its photon detection efficiency was > 45%. Our spaceborne,
low-noise SPDs established a feasible satellite-based up-link quantum communication that was
validated on the quantum experiment science satellite platform. Moreover, our SPDs open new windows
of opportunities for space research and applications in deep-space optical communications, single-photon
laser ranging, as well as for testing the fundamental principles of physics in space.
