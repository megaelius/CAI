...Micro perforated elements are innovative acoustic solutions,which silencing effect is based
on the dissipation of the acoustic wave energy in a pattern of sub-millimeter apertures. Similarly
to fibrous materials the micro-perforated materials have been proved to provide effective sound
absorption in a wide frequency range. Additionally, the silencer is designed as a two-stage system
that provides an optimal solution for a variety of exploitation conditions. In this paper a novel
design for a cruiser type motorcycle silencer, based on micro-perforated elements, is presented.
It has been demonstrated that the micro-perforated elements can successfully be used to achieve
high attenuation of IC-engine noise in strictly limited circumstances. A technical description
of the design and manufacturing of the prototype silencer is given and technological issues are
discussed. The acoustical and fluid-dynamical performance of the silencer is characterized by
transmission loss and pressure drop data. The influence of the two-stage system valve operation
has been analyzed by studying the acoustics data and engine output characteristics. In addition
to the experimental investigations, numerical 1-D models were developed for the optimization
of the silencer geometry and the results are compared in a number of operating conditions. The studies
have resulted in development of a silencer system for a small series cruiser type motorcycle. The
first silencer prototypes have been tested on the motorcycle. While maintaining acceptable pressure
drop characteristics, it has proven to comply with standard noise criteria without incorporating
fibrous materials....
