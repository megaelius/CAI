The classically encountered problem of acceleration runaway of radiation recoiled charged particle
is addressed by ab-initio variational approach for electrodynamics. The dynamic paths of stationary
action evolving with minimum loss of self field energy of the charge are only considered. Noting
that the energy loss as radiation grows with the path displacement, the minimum loss criterion will
be met when paths of shortest segment lengths together establish the dynamic course. The delocalized
dynamic course involves incessant exchange of energy and momentum among the paths sharing virtual
radiation. The nonlocally accomplished dynamics optimizes the radiative interaction of the charged
particle with its external field. The radiation loss in the interaction can approach null value
in the coherent evolution of the field-particle system. Energy and momentum evolve in quantized
form obeying integral conservation principle. The mediating nonlocal field defends the coherent
evolution against external perturbation is shown to have critical upper limit beyond which it fails
to maintain the coherence. The limit could be expressed by the reactive stress from momentum field
of radiation emitting under the decoherence with the changeover of energy state of the field-particle
system. It is shown that the polarized vacuum of the evolutionary charge receives the yielded nonlocal
stress before relaxing it out spontaneously through its promptly oscillating ( ) modes. The prompt
dissipation does not allow ever increasing growth of the acceleration by radiation reaction eliminating
thus acceleration runaway problem. The dissipated power from decoherence finally warms up the
surrounding. Key words: Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation, Nonlocality, Quantized action, Coherence
