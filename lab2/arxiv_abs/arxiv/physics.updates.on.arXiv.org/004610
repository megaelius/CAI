An unprecedented demand for Food, Energy, and Water (FEW) over coming decades require integrated
FEW innovations with least environmental footprint. Collocating solar photovoltaic (PV) technology
with agriculture is a promising approach towards dual land productivity that could locally fulfil
growing food and energy demands. This 'agrivoltaic' (AV) solution can be highly suitable for hot
and arid climates where an optimized solar panel coverage could prevent excessive thermal stress
thereby increasing the crop yield and lowering the water budget. One of the concerns with using standard
fixed tilt solar array structure that faces north/south (N/S) direction for AV farming is the spatial
heterogeneity in the daily sunlight distribution for crops and soil water contents, both of which
could affect crop yield. Dynamic tilt control through a tracking system can eliminate this problem
but could increase the system cost and complexity. Here, we investigate east/west (E/W) faced vertical
bifacial panel structure for AV farming and show that this could provide a much better spatial homogeneity
for daily sunlight distribution relative to the fixed tilt N/S faced PV structure implying a better
suitability for monoculture cropping. By modeling PV energy and crop yield under varying density
(row to row pitch) for PV arrays and shade tolerances for crops, we show that E/W vertical bifacial
panels can provide ~5% better land productivity as compared to N/S faced fixed tilt panels for Lahore
(31.520N, 74.358E) when PV array density is slightly lower than that of a standard solar farm. In
contrast, when PV arrays are denser than the standard, land productivity for E/W vertical bifacial
panels degrades due to mutual shading. These results, together with high inherent resilience to
soiling (dust accumulation) losses for E/W vertical bifacial panels, indicate their attractive
prospects for AV applications.
