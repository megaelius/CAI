The mechanical behaviour of porous sandstones is generally modelled using concepts from granular
mechanics, often overlooking the effect of cementation. To probe the key differences between sand
and sandstone mechanics, we performed triaxial deformation experiments on Ottawa quartz sand
at $5-40$ MPa effective confining pressure. At $5$ MPa, the samples are able to dilate. At higher
confinement, the aggregates show continuous compaction, displaying strain hardening. The stress-strain
behaviour is non-linear and the exact onset of inelastic compaction could not be determined accurately.
Measured P-wave velocities show the development of anisotropy. With increasing axial strain,
the along-axis velocities tend to increase, while velocities perpendicular to the compression
axis tend to decrease (at low pressure) or remain constant (at high pressure). In samples deformed
under elevated pressure conditions, acoustic emission event locations are diffuse. Microstructural
investigations show an increase in grain chipping and crushing with increasing confining pressure,
but no evidence of localised compaction could be observed. The nature of the pore-fluid, either
decane or water, does not significantly influence the mechanical behaviour at strain rates of $10^{-6}$
to $10^{-4}$ $s^{-1}$. Grain angularity and grain-size distribution also did not significantly
change the mechanical behaviour. We infer that our observations indicate that the lack of cementation
introduces additional degrees of freedom for grains to slide, rotate, and reorganise at the sample-scale,
precluding the existence and sustainability of stress concentrations beyond the grain-scale.
This results in progressive compaction and hardening, and lack of compaction localisation.
