Due to the interconnectedness of financial entities, estimating certain key properties of a complex
financial system, including the implied level of systemic risk, requires detailed information
about the structure of the underlying network of dependencies. However, since data about financial
linkages are typically subject to confidentiality, network reconstruction techniques become
necessary to infer both the presence of connections and their intensity. Recently, several "horse
races" have been conducted to compare the performance of the available financial network reconstruction
methods. These comparisons were based on arbitrarily chosen metrics of similarity between the
real network and its reconstructed versions. Here we establish a generalised maximum-likelihood
approach to rigorously define and compare weighted reconstruction methods. Our generalization
uses the maximization of a certain conditional entropy to solve the problem that the density-dependent
constraints required to reliably reconstruct the network are typically unobserved and cannot
therefore enter directly as sufficient statistics in the likelihood function. The resulting approach
admits as input any reconstruction method for the purely binary topology and, conditionally on
the latter, exploits the available partial information to infer link weights. We find that the most
reliable method is obtained by "dressing" the best-performing binary method with an exponential
distribution of link weights having a properly density-corrected and link-specific mean value.
As a particular case, the method can place optimal weights on a network if the bare topology is known.
The method is fast, safe (i.e. unbiased in the sense of maximum conditional entropy) and reproduces
empirical networks with highest generalised likelihood.
