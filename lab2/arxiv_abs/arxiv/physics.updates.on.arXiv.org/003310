Benford's Law predicts that the first significant digit on the leftmost side of numbers in real-life
data is proportioned between all possible 1 to 9 digits approximately as in LOG(1 + 1/digit), so that
low digits occur much more frequently than high digits in the first place. The two essential prerequisites
for data configuration with regards to compliance with Benford's Law are high order of magnitude
and positive skewness with a tail falling to the right of the histogram, so that quantitative configuration
is such that the small is numerous and the big is rare. In this article various quantitative partition
models are examined in terms of the quantitative and digital behavior of the resultant set of parts.
The universal feature found across all partition models is having many small parts but only very
few big parts, while Benford's Law is valid only in some particular partition cases and under certain
constraints. Hence another suggested vista of Benford's Law is viewing it as a particular subset
of the broader positive skewness phenomenon in quantitative partitioning. Significantly, such
a vista is true in all other causes and explanations of Benford's Law where the small consistently
outnumbers the big also in partial structures of the model or well before full convergence to Benford
is achieved - endowing the principle universality in a sense. In conclusion, either the active act
of partitioning or the passive consideration of a large quantity as the composition of smaller parts
can be considered as another independent explanation for the widespread empirical observation
of Benford's Law in the physical sciences.
