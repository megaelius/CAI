Vibrational properties of molecular crystals are constantly used as structural fingerprints,
in order to identify both the chemical nature and the structural arrangement of molecules. The simulation
of these properties is typically very costly, especially when dealing with response properties
of materials to e.g. electric fields, which require a good description of the perturbed electronic
density. In this work, we use Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict the static polarizability
and dielectric susceptibility of molecules and molecular crystals. We combine this framework
with ab initio molecular dynamics to predict their anharmonic vibrational Raman spectra. We stress
the importance of data representation, symmetry, and locality, by comparing the performance of
different flavors of GPR. In particular, we show the advantages of using a recently developed symmetry-adapted
version of GPR. As an examplary application, we choose Paracetamol as an isolated molecule and in
different crystal forms. We obtain accurate vibrational Raman spectra in all cases with less than
1000 training points, and obtain improvements when using a GPR trained on the molecular monomer
as a baseline for the crystal GPR models. Finally, we show that our methodology is transferable across
polymorphic forms: we can train the model on data for one structure, and still be able to accurately
predict the spectrum for a second polymorph. This procedure provides an independent route to access
electronic structure properties when performing force-evaluations on empirical force-fields
or machine-learned potential energy surfaces.
