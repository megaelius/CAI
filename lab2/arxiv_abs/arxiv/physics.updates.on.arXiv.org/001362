This work reports an approach to study complementary pairs of bipolar junction transistors, often
used in push-pull circuits typically found at the output stages of operational amplifiers. After
the data is acquired and pre-processed, an Early modeling approach is applied to estimate the two
respective parameters (the Early voltage $V_a$ and the proportionality parameter $s$). A voting
procedure, inspired on the Hough transform image analysis method, is adopted to improve the identification
of $V_a$. Analytical relationships are derived between the traditional parameters current gain
($\beta$) and output resistance ($R_o$) and the two Early parameters. It is shown that $\beta$ tends
to increase with the magnitude of $V_a$ and $s$, while $R_o$ depends only on $V_a$, varying linearly
with this parameter. Several interesting results are obtained with respect to 7 pairs of complementary
BJTs, each represented by 10 samples. First, we have that the considered BJTs occupy a restricted
region along the Early parameter space, and also that the NPN and PNP groups are mostly segregated
into two respective regions in this space. In addition, PNP devices tended to present an intrinsically
larger parameter variation. The NPN group has higher $V_a$ magnitude and smaller $s$ than PNP devices.
PNP transistors yielded larger $R_o$ and slightly smaller $\beta$ than NPN transistors. A pattern
recognition method was employed to obtain a linear separatrix between the NPN and PNP groups in the
Early space and the respective average parameters were used to estimate respective prototype devices.
Two complementary pairs of the real-world BJTs with large and small parameters differences were
used in three configurations of push pull circuits, and the respective total harmonic distortions
were measured and discussed, indicating a definite influence of parameter matching on the results.
