Gridded data products, for example interpolated daily measurements of precipitation from weather
stations, are commonly used as a convenient substitute for direct observations because these products
provide a spatially and temporally continuous and complete source of data. However, when the goal
is to characterize climatological features of extreme precipitation over a spatial domain (e.g.,
a map of return values) at the native spatial scales of these phenomena, then gridded products may
lead to incorrect conclusions because daily precipitation is a fractal field and hence any smoothing
technique will dampen local extremes. To address this issue, we create a new "probabilistic" gridded
product specifically designed to characterize the climatological properties of extreme precipitation
by applying spatial statistical analyses to daily measurements of precipitation from the GHCN
over CONUS. The essence of our method is to first estimate the climatology of extreme precipitation
based on station data and then use a data-driven statistical approach to interpolate these estimates
to a fine grid. We argue that our method yields an improved characterization of the climatology within
a grid cell because the probabilistic behavior of extreme precipitation is much better behaved
(i.e., smoother) than daily weather. Furthermore, the spatial smoothing innate to our approach
significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio in the estimated extreme statistics relative
to an analysis without smoothing. Finally, by deriving a data-driven approach for translating
extreme statistics to a spatially complete grid, the methodology outlined in this paper resolves
the issue of how to properly compare station data with output from earth system models. We conclude
the paper by comparing our probabilistic gridded product with a standard extreme value analysis
of the Livneh gridded daily precipitation product.
