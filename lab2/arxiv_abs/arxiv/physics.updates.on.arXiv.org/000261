The dimensionality of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at low Magnetic Reynolds number is
analysed in the generic configuration of a wall-bounded channel. Forcing is applied near one of
the walls only, by injecting a DC electric current $I$ through it. Depending on the strength of the
externally applied, transverse magnetic field, the forcing extends part or all the way through
the channel. This principle allows us to precisely control the forcing intensity but also its dimensionality.
It is applied in a theoretical analysis and in a liquid metal experiment were we are thusly able to
single out the influence of the walls and of the forcing on the flow dimensionality. The latter is
characterised in several ways: first, we show that when inertia drives three-dimensionality,
the velocity near the wall where current is injected scales as $U_b\sim I^{2/3}$. Secondly, we show
that when the distance $l_z$ over which momentum diffuses under the action of the Lorentz force (\cite{sm82})
reaches the channel width $h$, the velocity near the opposite wall $U_t$ follows a similar law with
a correction factor that measures three-dimensionality. When $l_z<h$, by contrast, the opposite
wall has less influence on the flow and $U_t\sim I^{1/2}$. The scaling $l_z\sim N^{1/2}$ put forward
by \cite{sm82} ($N$ is the interaction parameter), is also verified experimentally. By distinguishing
\emph{weak} and \emph{strong} three-dimensionality previously introduced by \cite{kp10_prl},
we find that both types vanish only asymptotically in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$. This provides
evidence that because of the no-slip walls, the transition between quasi-two dimensional and three
dimensional turbulence does not result from a global instability of the flow, unlike in domains
with non-dissipative boundaries, and that it doesn't occur simultaneously at all scales.
