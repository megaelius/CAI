Kinetic Alfv\'en waves represent an important subject in space plasma physics, since they are thought
to play a crucial role in the development of the turbulent energy cascade in the solar wind plasma
at short wavelengths (of the order of the proton inertial length $d_p$ and beyond). A full understanding
of the physical mechanisms which govern the kinetic plasma dynamics at these scales can provide
important clues on the problem of the turbulent dissipation and heating in collisionless systems.
In this paper, hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations are employed to analyze in detail the features
of the kinetic Alfv\'en waves at proton kinetic scales, in typical conditions of the solar wind environment.
In particular, linear and nonlinear regimes of propagation of these fluctuations have been investigated
in a single-wave situation, focusing on the physical processes of collisionless Landau damping
and wave-particle resonant interaction. Interestingly, since for wavelengths close to $d_p$
and proton plasma beta $\beta$ of order unity the kinetic Alfv\'en waves have small phase speed compared
to the proton thermal velocity, wave-particle interaction processes produce significant deformations
in the core of the particle velocity distribution, appearing as phase space vortices and resulting
in flat-top velocity profiles. Moreover, as the Eulerian hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell algorithm allows
for a clean almost noise-free description of the velocity space, three-dimensional plots of the
proton velocity distribution help to emphasize how the plasma departs from the Maxwellian configuration
of thermodynamic equilibrium due to nonlinear kinetic effects.
