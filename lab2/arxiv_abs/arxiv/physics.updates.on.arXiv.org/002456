We study the relationship between the El Ni\~no--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian summer
monsoon in ensemble simulations from state-of-the-art climate models, the Max Planck Institute
Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) and the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We consider two simple
variables: the Tahiti--Darwin sea-level pressure difference and the Northern Indian precipitation.
We utilize ensembles converged to the system's snapshot attractor for analyzing possible changes
(i) in the teleconnection between the fluctuations of the two variables, and (ii) in their climatic
means. (i) With very high confidence, we detect an increase in the strength of the teleconnection,
as a response to the forcing, in the MPI-ESM under historical forcing between 1890 and 2005, concentrated
to the end of this period. We explain that our finding does not contradict instrumental observations,
since their existing analyses regarding the nonstationarity of the teleconnection are either
methodologically unreliable, or consider an ill-defined teleconnection concept. In the MPI-ESM
we cannot reject stationarity between 2006 and 2099 under the Representative Concentration Pathway
8.5 (RCP8.5), and in a 110-year-long 1-percent pure CO2 scenario; neither can we in the CESM between
1960 and 2100 with historical forcing and RCP8.5. (ii) In the latter ensembles, the climatic mean
is strongly displaced in the phase space projection spanned by the two variables. This displacement
is nevertheless linear. However, the slope exhibits a strong seasonality, falsifying a hypothesis
of a universal, emergent relationship between these two climatic means, excluding applicability
in an emergent constraint.
