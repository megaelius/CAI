Activity-based models appeared as an answer to the limitations of the traditional trip-based and
tour-based four-stage models. The fundamental assumption of activity-based models is that travel
demand is originated from people performing their daily activities. This is why they include a consistent
representation of time, of the persons and households, time-dependent routing, and microsimulation
of travel demand and traffic. In spite of their potential to simulate traffic demand management
policies, their practical application is still limited. One of the main reasons is that these models
require a huge amount of very detailed input data hard to get with surveys. However, the pervasive
use of mobile devices has brought a valuable new source of data. The work presented here has a twofold
objective: first, to demonstrate the capability of mobile phone records to feed activity-based
transport models, and, second, to assert the advantages of using activity-based models to estimate
the effects of traffic demand management policies. Activity diaries for the metropolitan area
of Barcelona are reconstructed from mobile phone records. This information is then employed as
input for building a transport MATSim model of the city. The model calibration and validation process
proves the quality of the activity diaries obtained. The possible impacts of a cordon toll policy
applied to two different areas of the city and at different times of the day is then studied. Our results
show the way in which the modal share is modified in each of the considered scenario. The possibility
of evaluating the effects of the policy at both aggregated and traveller level, together with the
ability of the model to capture policy impacts beyond the cordon toll area confirm the advantages
of activity-based models for the evaluation of traffic demand management policies.
