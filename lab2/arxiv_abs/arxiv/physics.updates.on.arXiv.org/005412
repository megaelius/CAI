Sensors and actuators based on resonant micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), such as scanning
micro mirrors, are well-established in automotive and consumer products. As the areas of application
broaden, the requirements for the MEMS are increasing. Devices outside of the performance specifications
have to be rejected which is costly due to the high processing times of MEMS technologies. In particular,
nonlinear system behavior is often found to cause unexpected device failure or performance issues.
Thus, accurate simulation or rather system models which account for nonlinear sensor dynamics
can not only increase process yield, but more importantly, lead to a comprehensive understanding
of the underlying physics and to improved MEMS design. We have studied [1] the possibility of a rather
drastic device failure induced by nonlinearities on the example of a resonant scanning MEMS micro
mirror. On the level of a few selected chips, we have carefully measured the complex nonlinear system
behavior and modeled it by a nonlinear mode-coupling phenomenon known as spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC). The most intriguing feature of SPDC is the sudden change from a rather linear
to a nonlinear system behavior at the critical oscillation amplitude. However, the threshold only
lies within the range of the mirror's operational amplitude, if certain frequency resonance conditions
regarding the mechanical modes are met. Thus, the critical amplitude strongly depends on the frequency
spectrum of the MEMS design which in turn is largely influenced by fabrication imperfections. We
validate the dependence of the critical amplitude on the resonance condition by measuring it for
over 600 micro mirrors on wafer-level. Our work does not only validate the theory of SPDC with measurements
on such a large scale, but also demonstrates modeling strategies which are essential for MEMS product
design.
