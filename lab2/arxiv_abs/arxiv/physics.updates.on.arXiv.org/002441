Suspensions of elongated micelles under shear display complex non-linear behaviour including
shear banding, spatio-temporal oscillatory patterns and chaotic response. Based on a suitable
rheological model [S. M. Fielding and P. D. Olmsted, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 084502 (2004)], we here
explore possibilities to manipulate the dynamical behaviour via closed-loop (feedback) control
involving a time delay $\tau$. The model considered relates the viscoelastic stress of the system
to a structural variable, that is, the length of the micelles, yielding two time- and space-dependent
dynamical variables $\xi_1$, $\xi_2$. As a starting point we perform a systematic linear stability
analysis of the uncontrolled system for (i) an externally imposed average shear rate and (ii) an
imposed total stress, and compare the results to those from extensive numerical simulations. We
then apply the so-called Pyragas feedback scheme where the equations of motion are supplemented
by a control term of the form $K\left(a(t)-a(t-\tau)\right)$ with $a$ being a measurable quantity
depending on the rheological protocol. For the choice of an imposed shear rate, the Pyragas scheme
for the total stress reduces to a non-diagonal scheme concentrating on the viscoelastic stress.
Focusing on parameters close to a Hopf bifurcation, where the uncontrolled system displays oscillatory
states as well as hysteresis in the shear rate controlled protocol, we demonstrate that (local)
Pyragas control leads to a full stabilization to the steady state solution of the total stress, while
a global control scheme does not work. In contrast, for the case of imposed total stress, global Pyragas
control fully stabilizes the system. In both cases, the control does not change the space of solutions,
rather it selects the steady state solutions out of the existing solutions. This underlines the
non-invasive character of the Pyragas scheme.
