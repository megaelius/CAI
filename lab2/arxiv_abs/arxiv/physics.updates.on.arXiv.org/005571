In the current work, we develop a single droplet model to describe particle formation in multicomponent-liquid
droplet combustion. Both the gas-to-particle conversion and droplet-to-particle conversion
routes of different solution properties are investigated, together with the population balance
model and the droplet drying model. For multi-component droplets without precursors, the droplet
combustion is limited by the species diffusion in the liquid phase. The model can well predict the
droplet shrinkage history observed by previous PDA measurements. For the precursor with a low boiling
point than its thermal decomposition temperature, the precursor in the droplet can then transform
into nanoparticles through the gas-to-particle conversion route. The population balance model
reveals that the generated nanoparticle size relies on both the precursor mass fraction and the
residence time, which is consistent with the vapor-fed aerosol flame synthesis. For the precursor
that tends to decompose or precipitate in the liquid, it then undergoes the droplet-to-particle
conversion route. The droplet behavior can be classified by the ratio of droplet evaporation time
and precursor reaction or precipitation time. For small droplets with short evaporation time,
the nanoparticle formation obeys the one-droplet-one-particle rule. For large droplets with
long evaporation time, the competition among precipitation, thermal decomposition, and evaporation
determines the final nanoparticle morphology. The single droplet model established in this study
can potentially guide the precursor design and be coupled with the turbulent flame simulation of
the whole flame spray pyrolysis burner.
