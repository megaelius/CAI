Rayleigh-Taylor-instability induced flow and mixing are of great importance both in nature and
engineering scenarios. To capture the underpinning physics, one-way coupled particles are introduced
to make a Lagrangian tracking supplement to the discrete Boltzmann simulation. Detailed morphological
information of the flow field and thermodynamic nonequilibrium behavior around the interfaces
in a two-miscible-fluid system are delineated. Via a defined local mixedness, from densities of
two kinds of particles, we quantitatively captured the appearance position and indicated the intensity
of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The effects of compressibility and viscosity on mixing are investigated
separately. Both of them show two-stage effects on mixing process. The underlying mechanism of
these two-stage effects is interpreted as that a "hard" system with low compressibility and/or
high viscosity is beneficial to the development of large structures at the initial stage and a "soft"
system with high compressibility and/or low viscosity is favorable for the generation of small
structures at the late stage. At the late stage, for a fixed time, the field averaged mixedness exponentially
decreases with the viscosity, which indicates the existence of a characteristic viscosity $\mu_0$.
The tracer particles make possible to observe finer structures with clear interfaces in the late
mixing stage. One can clearly observe the mixing process and distinguish tracer particles from
the heavy and light fluids. Results in this paper are helpful for understanding the mechanism of
complex compressible flow with Rayleigh-Taylor instability and present references for related
particle tracking experiments.
