Over the last few years it became clear that turbulent magnetic reconnection and magnetized turbulence
are inseparable. It was not only shown that reconnection is responsible for violating the frozen-in
condition in turbulence, but also that stochastic reconnection in 3D generates turbulence by itself.
The actual mechanism responsible for this driving is still unknown. Processes such turbulent tearing
mode or Kelvin--Helmholtz, among other plasma instabilities, could generate turbulence from
irregular current sheets. We address the nature of driving mechanism for this process and consider
a relative role of tearing and Kelvin--Helmholtz instabilities for the process of turbulence generation.
In particular, we analyze the conditions for development of these two instabilities within three-dimensional
reconnection regions. We show that both instabilities can excite turbulence fluctuations in reconnection
regions. However, tearing mode has relatively slow growth rate, and at later times it becomes partially
suppressed by transverse to the current sheet component of magnetic field, generated during the
growth of turbulent fluctuations. On the contrary, the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability establishes
quickly in the outflow region, and at later times it dominates the turbulence generation comparing
to the contribution from tearing mode. Our results demonstrate that the tearing instability is
subdominant compared to the the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability in terms of generation of turbulence
in the 3D reconnection layers and therefore the self-driven reconnection is turbulent reconnection
with tearing instability being important only at the initial stage of the reconnection.
