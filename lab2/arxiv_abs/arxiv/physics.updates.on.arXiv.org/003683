We investigate the effect of turbulence on the combined condensational and collisional growth
of cloud droplets by means of high resolution direct numerical simulations of turbulence and a superparticle
approximation for droplet dynamics and collisions. The droplets are subject to turbulence as well
as gravity, and their collision and coalescence efficiencies are taken to be unity. We solve the
thermodynamic equations governing temperature, water-vapor mixing ratio, and the resulting
supersaturation fields together with the Navier-Stokes equation. We find that the droplet size
distribution broadens with increasing Reynolds number and/or mean energy dissipation rate. Turbulence
affects the condensational growth directly through supersaturation fluctuations, and it influences
collisional growth indirectly through condensation. Our simulations show for the first time that,
in the absence of updraft cooling, supersaturation fluctuation-induced broadening of droplet
size distributions enhances the collisional growth. This is contrary to classical (non-turbulent)
condensational growth, which leads to a growing mean droplet size, but a narrower droplet size distribution.
Our findings, instead, show that condensational growth facilitates collisional growth by broadening
the size distribution in the tails at an early stage of rain formation. With increasing Reynolds
numbers, evaporation becomes stronger. This counteracts the broadening effect due to condensation
at late stages of rain formation. Our conclusions are consistent with results of laboratory experiments
and field observations, and show that supersaturation fluctuations are important for precipitation.
