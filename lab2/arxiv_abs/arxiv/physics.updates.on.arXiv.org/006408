Next generation wound care technology capable of diagnosing wound parameters, promoting healthy
cell growth and reducing pathogenic infections noninvasively will provide patients with an improved
standard of care and an accelerated wound repair. Temperature is one of the indicating biomarkers
specific to chronic wounds. This work reports a hybrid, multifunctional optical platform: nanodiamond-silk
membranes as bioinspired dressings capable of temperature sensing and wound healing. The hybrid
was fabricated through electrospinning and formed sub-micron fibrous membranes with high porosity.
The silk fibres are capable of compensating for the lack of extracellular matrix at the wound site,
supporting the wound healing. The negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) color centres in nanodiamonds
(NDs) exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties and act as fluorescent
nanoscale thermometers, capable of sensing temperature variations associated to the presence
of infection or inflammation in a wound, without physically removing the dressing. Our results
show that the presence of NDs in the hybrid ND-silk membranes improve the thermal stability of silk
fibres. The NV- color centres in NDs embedded in silk fibres exhibit well-retained fluorescent
and ODMR. Using the NV- centres as fluorescent nanoscale thermometers, we achieved temperature
sensing at a range of temperatures, including the biologically relevant temperature window, on
cell-cultured ND-silk membranes. Enhancement in the temperature sensitivity of the NV- centres
was observed for the hybrids. The membranes were further tested in vivo in a murine wound healing
model and demonstrated biocompatibility and equivalent wound closure rates as the control wounds.
Additionally, the hybrid ND-silk membranes showed selective antifouling and biocidal propensity
toward Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli.
