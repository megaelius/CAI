We study the epidemic patterns of the COVID-19 virus in Argentina from a mathematical modelling
perspective. We implement an SEIR model, consisting of a set of first-order temporal differential
equations (ODE's) to analyze the time evolution of the disease caused by the virus. The model is applied
to the city of Buenos Aires and neighbouring cities (RMBA) with approximately 15 million inhabitants.
The parameters of the model are calibrated by using as data the number of casualties officially reported.
Since there are infinite solutions honouring the data, we show a set of cases by considering different
situations. The first set of parameters yields initially a reproduction ratio R0 = 3.30 decreasing
to 0.92 in April 8, after the lockdown, but increasing to 2.44 after April 27, most probably due to
an increase of the contagion in highly populated slums. This case has incubation and infection periods
of 11 and 7 days, approximately, and about 13 million people infected at the end of the epidemic. The
infection fatality rate (IFR) is 1.88 % and the predicted number of casualties is approximately
249000 deaths at the end of the epidemic. However, this death toll is highly affected by the evolution
of the reproduction ratio, and keeping R0 = 0.92 after April 27, would cause 1321 casualties and only
66000 infected individuals.Other cases, assuming the present trend, predict smaller incubation
periods (between 4 and 5 days) and yield between 30000 and 90000 deaths and IFRs between 0.5 % and 1
%. This means that the intensity of the lockdown (and behaviour of the population) is essential and
that the measures have to be guided by precise model predictions. We also consider doubling the number
of casualties to date and, in this case, the death toll is almost 44000 individuals and about 5.1 million
people being infected.
