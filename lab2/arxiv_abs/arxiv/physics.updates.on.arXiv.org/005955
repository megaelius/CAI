This paper presents a general synthetic iteration scheme (GSIS) for efficient steady-state solution
of the non-linear gas kinetic equation. The GSIS has been recently developed for steady-state solution
of the linearized Boltzmann equation and demonstrated its computational efficiency for multiscale
rarefied flow, which can achieve converged solutions within a few dozens of iteration steps. The
key ingredient of GSIS is to solve the synthetic macroscopic equations after each iteration step
for solving the gas-kinetic equation using the discrete velocity method (DVM). The constitutive
relations for shear stress and heat flux, i.e., Newton's law and Fourier's law are explicitly included
in the macroscopic equations. The contributions of the higher-order velocity moments to shear
stress and heat flux are calculated from the updated velocity distribution function. This synthetic
coupling can resolve the long-standing problems of the conventional for low-Knudsen-number flows,
i.e. extremely slow convergence and requirement of ultra-fine grids. In this paper, the synthetic
macroscopic equations are implicitly solved after each DVM step to steady-state using the lower-upper
symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) technique. The spatial discretization in both the DVM and macroscopic
solvers uses the existing conventional schemes without complex evaluation of numerical fluxes
at the cell interfaces. Although the non-linear GSIS algorithm presented here uses the Shakhov
model equation as an example, it can be used to solve the full Boltzmann equation and other model equations.
The efficiency and accuracy of the non-linear GSIS are demonstrated by a range of two-dimensional
flows in various regimes.
