We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the 193 nm photolysis of the
cyano-ester, methyl cyanoformate (MCF). Specifically, nanosecond time-resolved infrared emission
spectroscopy was used to monitor the ro-vibrationally excited photoproducts generated in the
photolysis reaction. The signal-to-noise of all time-resolved spectra were enhanced using the
recently developed algorithm, spectral reconstruction analysis, which allowed observation
of previously obscured minor resonances, and revealed new dissociation channels producing HCN
and HNC. Spectral fit analysis of the nascent HCN and electronically excited CN($A^2\Pi_1$) resonances
yield a lower bound estimate for the HCN quantum yield of ca. 0.42$\pm$0.24%. Multi-configuration
self-consistent field calculations were used to interrogate the ground and four lowest energy
singlet excited states of MCF. At 193 nm, dissociation is predicted to occur predominantly on the
repulsive S$_2$ state. Nevertheless, minor pathways leading to the production of highly excited
ground state MCF are available via cascading internal conversion from nascent S$_2$ population.
An automated transition-state search algorithm was employed to identify the corresponding ground
state dissociation channels, and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus and Kinetic Monte Carlo kinetic
simulations were used to calculate the associated branching ratios. The proposed mechanism was
validated by direct comparison of the experimentally measured and quasi-classical trajectory
deduced nascent internal energy distribution of HCN, which were found to be in near perfect agreement.
The propensity for cyano containing hydrocarbons to act as photolytic sources for ro-vibrationally
excited HCN and HNC, as well as their significance to astrophysical environments, are discussed.
