Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is a standard clinical procedure used to quantify
antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Currently, the gold standard method requires incubation for
18-24 h and subsequent inspection for growth by a trained medical technologist. We demonstrate
an automated, cost-effective optical system that delivers early AST results, minimizing incubation
time and eliminating human errors, while remaining compatible with standard phenotypic assay
workflow. The system is composed of cost-effective components and eliminates the need for optomechanical
scanning. A neural network processes the captured optical intensity information from an array
of fiber optic cables to determine whether bacterial growth has occurred in each well of a 96-well
microplate. When the system was blindly tested on isolates from 33 patients with Staphylococcus
aureus infections, 95.03% of all the wells containing growth were correctly identified using our
neural network, with an average of 5.72 h of incubation time required to identify growth. 90% of all
wells (growth and no-growth) were correctly classified after 7 h, and 95% after 10.5 h. Our deep learning-based
optical system met the FDA-defined criteria for essential and categorical agreements for all 14
antibiotics tested after an average of 6.13 h and 6.98 h, respectively. Furthermore, our system
met the FDA criteria for major and very major error rates for 11 of 12 possible drugs after an average
of 4.02 h, and 9 of 13 possible drugs after an average of 9.39 h, respectively. This system could enable
faster, inexpensive, automated AST, especially in resource limited settings, helping to mitigate
the rise of global AMR.
