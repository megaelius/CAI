Modern threats have emerged from the prevalence of social networks. Hostile actors, such as extremist
groups or foreign governments, utilize these networks to run propaganda campaigns with different
aims. For extremists, these campaigns are designed for recruiting new members or inciting violence.
For foreign governments, the aim may be to create instability in rival nations. Proper social network
counter-measures are needed to combat these threats. Here we present one important counter-measure:
penetrating social networks. This means making target users connect with or follow agents deployed
in the social network. Once such connections are established with the targets, the agents can influence
them by sharing content which counters the influence campaign. In this work we study how to penetrate
a social network, which we call the follow-back problem. The goal here is to find a policy that maximizes
the number of targets that follow the agent. We conduct an empirical study to understand what behavioral
and network features affect the probability of a target following an agent. We find that the degree
of the target and the size of the mutual neighborhood of the agent and target in the network affect
this probability. Based on our empirical findings, we then propose a model for targets following
an agent. Using this model, we solve the follow-back problem exactly on directed acyclic graphs
and derive a closed form expression for the expected number of follows an agent receives under the
optimal policy. We then formulate the follow-back problem on an arbitrary graph as an integer program.
To evaluate our integer program based policies, we conduct simulations on real social network topologies
in Twitter. We find that our polices result in more effective network penetration, with significant
increases in the expected number of targets that follow the agent.
