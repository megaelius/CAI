We propose a method using supervised machine learning to estimate velocity fields from particle
images having missing regions due to experimental {limitations.} As a first example, a velocity
field around a square cylinder at Reynolds number of ${\rm Re}_D=300$ is considered. To train machine
learning models, we utilize artificial particle images (APIs) as the input data, which mimic the
images of the particle image velocimetry (PIV). The output data are the velocity fields, and the
correct answers for them are given by a direct numerical simulation (DNS). We examine two types of
the input data: APIs without missing regions (i.e., full APIs) and APIs with missing regions (lacked
APIs). The missing regions in the lacked APIs are assumed following the exact experimental situation
in our wind tunnel setup. The velocity fields estimated from both full and lacked APIs are in great
agreement with the reference DNS data in terms of various statistical assessments. We further apply
these machine learned models trained with the DNS data to experimental particle images so that their
applicability to the exact experimental situation can be investigated. The velocity fields estimated
by the machine learned models contain approximately 40 folds denser data than that with the conventional
cross-correlation method. This finding suggests that we may be able to obtain finer and hidden structures
of the flow field which cannot be resolved with the conventional cross-correlation method. We also
found that even the complex flow structures are hidden due to the alignment of two square cylinders,
the machine learned model is able to estimate the field in the missing region reasonably well. The
present results indicate a great potential of the proposed machine learning based method as a new
data reconstruction method for PIV.
