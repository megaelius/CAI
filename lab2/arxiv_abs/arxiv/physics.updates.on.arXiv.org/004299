The GRAPES-3 muon telescope located in Ooty, India records 4x10^9 muons daily. These muons are produced
by interaction of primary cosmic rays (PCRs) in the atmosphere. The high statistics of muons enables
GRAPES-3 to make precise measurement of various sun-induced phenomenon including coronal mass
ejections (CME), Forbush decreases, geomagnetic storms (GMS) and atmosphere acceleration during
the overhead passage of thunderclouds. However, the understanding and interpretation of observed
data requires Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of PCRs and subsequent development of showers in the atmosphere.
CORSIKA is a standard MC simulation code widely used for this purpose. However, these simulations
are time consuming as large number of interactions and decays need to be taken into account at various
stages of shower development from top of the atmosphere down to ground level. Therefore, computing
resources become an important consideration particularly when billion of PCRs need to be simulated
to match the high statistical accuracy of the data. During the GRAPES-3 simulations, it was observed
that over 60% of simulated events don't really reach the Earth's atmosphere. The geomagnetic field
(GMF) creates a threshold to PCRs called cutoff rigidity Rc, a direction dependent parameter below
which PCRs can't reach the Earth's atmosphere. However, in CORSIKA there is no provision to set a
direction dependent threshold. We have devised an efficient method that has taken into account
of this Rc dependence. A reduction by a factor ~3 in simulation time and ~2 in output data size was achieved
for GRAPES-3 simulations. This has been incorporated in CORSIKA version v75600 onwards. Detailed
implementation of this along the potential benefits are discussed in this work.
