We addressed the carrier dynamics in so-called G-centers in silicon (consisting of substitutional-interstitial
carbon pairs interacting with interstitial silicons) obtained via ion implantation into a silicon-on-insulator
wafer. For this point defect in silicon emitting in the telecommunication wavelength range, we
unravel the recombination dynamics by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. More specifically,
we performed detailed photoluminescence experiments as a function of excitation energy, incident
power, irradiation fluence and temperature in order to study the impact of radiative and non-radiative
recombination channels on the spectrum, yield and lifetime of G-centers. The sharp line emitting
at 969 meV ($\sim$1280 nm) and the broad asymmetric sideband developing at lower energy share the
same recombination dynamics as shown by time-resolved experiments performed selectively on each
spectral component. This feature accounts for the common origin of the two emission bands which
are unambiguously attributed to the zero-phonon line and to the corresponding phonon sideband.
In the framework of the Huang-Rhys theory with non-perturbative calculations, we reach an estimation
of 1.6$\pm$0.1 $\angstrom$ for the spatial extension of the electronic wave function in the G-center.
The radiative recombination time measured at low temperature lies in the 6 ns-range. The estimation
of both radiative and non-radiative recombination rates as a function of temperature further demonstrate
a constant radiative lifetime. Finally, although G-centers are shallow levels in silicon, we find
a value of the Debye-Waller factor comparable to deep levels in wide-bandgap materials. Our results
point out the potential of G-centers as a solid-state light source to be integrated into opto-electronic
devices within a common silicon platform.
