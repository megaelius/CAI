An expression of the filtered Eulerian drag force is proposed based on the second order Taylor polynomial
approximation of the microscopic Eulerian drag coefficient. Theoretical computations of the
expression are performed at low Reynolds numbers based on an available microscopic drag model.
It shows that four sub-grid quantities, i.e., the gas drift velocity, the solid drift velocity,
the scalar variance of solid volume fraction and a third-order moment, defined as the covariance
of squared solid volume fraction and the slip velocity, are significant for an accurate estimation
of the filtered drag force at low Reynolds numbers. The gas drift velocity is nothing but the drift
velocity defined by Parmentier et al. (AIChE Journal, 2012, 58 (4): 1084-1098), and in analogy to
the gas drift velocity, we defines the solid drift velocity in the present work. The great relevance
of the gas drift velocity and the scalar variance of solid volume fraction to the filtered drag force
have been demonstrated through numerous correlative analyses of fully resolved simulations.
Present theoretical analysis shows that the gas drift velocity term is primarily responsible for
the drag reduction, whereas the solid drift velocity term is prone to attenuate this reduction,
especially at moderate and high solid volume fractions. The scalar variance of solid volume fraction
term is found to increase the filtered drag force in the full range of solid volume fractions. The
third-order term has exactly the same coefficient with that of the variance term, and it mostly attains
negative values with the trend to decrease the filtered drag force.
