We investigate the socioeconomic urban scaling behavior in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.
In the case of Denmark we examine the scaling of larger cities, municipalities within the Copenhagen
agglomeration, and municipalities in rural areas. We also distinguish between municipalities
with high and low centrality. Superlinear scaling of the gross urban product with population size
is found in all cases, with exponents between 1.14 and 1.24. In Germany we distinguish between major
cities of which the surrounding urban region belongs to the municipality of the city, and regions
around smaller cities consisting of several municipalities. We find in most cases a superlinear
scaling with exponents up to 1.33. A strong relation is found between the measured residuals of the
scaling equations and the socio-economic position of a cities assessed with a set of different indicators.
We also investigate the relation between scaling of the regions and centrality, including the Zipf-distribution.
We find that urban scaling is related to generative and not to distributive processes. For the Netherlands
we focus on the group of the major cities with their agglomerations and on all municipalities in the
Province of Zuid-Holland. We examined the scaling of municipalities within larger urban areas
in the Netherlands. In all cases significant superlinear scaling is measured with exponents up
to 1.28. One-governance urban areas perform better than multi-governance urban areas. This leads
to challenging conclusions about the importance of a one-municipality instead of a multi-municipality
governance in major urban regions. A coherent governance of major cities and their agglomerations
may create more effective social interactions which reinforce economic and cultural activities
generating a substantial wealth benefit.
