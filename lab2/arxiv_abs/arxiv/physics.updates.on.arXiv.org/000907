The Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) is the hadronic calorimeter covering the central region of the ATLAS
detector at the LHC. It is a sampling calorimeter consisting of alternating thin steel plates and
scintillating tiles. Wavelength shifting fibers coupled to the tiles collect the produced light
and are read out by photomultiplier tubes. Currently, an analog sum of the processed signal of several
photomultipliers serves as input to the first level of trigger. Photomultiplier signals are then
digitized and stored on detector and are only transferred off detector once the first trigger acceptance
has been confirmed. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has envisaged a series of upgrades towards a
High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) delivering five times the LHC nominal instantaneous luminosity.
The ATLAS Phase II upgrade, in 2024, will accommodate the detector and data acquisition system for
the HL-LHC. In particular, TileCal will undergo a major replacement of its on- and off-detector
electronics. All signals will be digitized and then transferred directly to the off-detector electronics,
where the signals will be reconstructed, stored, and sent to the first level of trigger at a rate of
40 MHz. This will provide better precision of the calorimeter signals used by the trigger system
and will allow the development of more complex trigger algorithms. Changes to the electronics will
also contribute to the reliability and redundancy of the system. Three different front-end options
are presently being investigated for the upgrade. Results of extensive laboratory tests and with
beams of the three options will be presented, as well as the latest results on the development of the
power distribution and the off-detector electronics.
