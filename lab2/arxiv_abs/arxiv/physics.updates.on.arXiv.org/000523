We herein investigate shock formation and particle acceleration processes for both protons and
electrons in a quasi-parallel high-Mach-number collisionless shock through a long-term, large-scale
particle-in-cell simulation. We show that both protons and electrons are accelerated in the shock
and that these accelerated particles generate large-amplitude Alfv\'{e}nic waves in the upstream
region of the shock. After the upstream waves have grown sufficiently, the local structure of the
collisionless shock becomes substantially similar to that of a quasi-perpendicular shock due
to the large transverse magnetic field of the waves. A fraction of protons are accelerated in the
shock with a power-law-like energy distribution. The rate of proton injection to the acceleration
process is approximately constant, and in the injection process, the phase-trapping mechanism
for the protons by the upstream waves can play an important role. The dominant acceleration process
is a Fermi-like process through repeated shock crossings of the protons. This process is a `fast'
process in the sense that the time required for most of the accelerated protons to complete one cycle
of the acceleration process is much shorter than the diffusion time. A fraction of the electrons
is also accelerated by the same mechanism, and have a power-law-like energy distribution. However,
the injection does not enter a steady state during the simulation, which may be related to the intermittent
activity of the upstream waves. Upstream of the shock, a fraction of the electrons is pre-accelerated
before reaching the shock, which may contribute to steady electron injection at a later time.
