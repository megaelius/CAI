Modulation of metasurfaces in time gives rise to several exotic space-time scattering phenomena
by violating the reciprocity and generation of higher-order frequency harmonics. We introduce
a new design paradigm for time-modulated metasurfaces, offering electrically tunable engineering
of the generated frequency harmonics and their emerging wavefronts by controlling the phase delay
in modulation. It is demonstrated that the light acquires a dispersionless phase shift regardless
of incident angle and polarization, upon undergoing frequency conversion in a time-modulated
metasurface which is determined by the modulation phase delay and the order of generated frequency
harmonic. The conversion efficiency to the frequency harmonics is independent of modulation phase
delay and only depends on the modulation depth and resonant characteristics of the metasurface
element, with the highest efficiency occurring in the vicinity of resonance, and decreasing away
from the resonance. The design approach allows for creating tunable spatially varying phase discontinuties
with 2$\pi$ span in the generated frequency harmonics for a wide range of frequencies and incident
angles. Specifically, we apply this approach to a time-modulated metasurface in the Teraherz regime
consisted of graphene-wrapped silicon microwires. For this purpose, we use an accurate and efficient
semi-analytical framework based on multipole scattering. We demonstrate the utility of the design
for tunable beam steering and focusing of the generated frequency harmonics. Furthermore, we rigorously
verify the broadband and wide-angle performance of the metasurface in manipulation of the generated
frequency harmonics. The proposed design approach enables a new class of high-efficiency tunable
metasurfaces with wide angular and frequency bandwidth, wavefront engineering capabilities
and multi-functionality.
