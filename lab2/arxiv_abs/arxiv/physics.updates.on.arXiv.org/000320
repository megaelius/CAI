One of the most remarkable features of known nonstationary solutions to the incompressible Euler
equations is the phenomenon that coarse scale averages of the velocity carry the fine scale features
of the flow. In this paper, we study time-regularity properties of Euler flows which are connected
to this phenomenon and the observation that each frequency level has a natural time scale when it
is viewed along the coarse scale flow. We assume only that our velocity field is H\"{o}lder continuous
in the spatial variables, which is well-motivated by problems related to turbulence. We show that
any periodic Euler flow in the class $C_tC_x^\alpha$ also belongs to $C_{t,x}^\alpha$, and that
the pressure belongs to $C_{t,x}^{2 \alpha-}$. We also show that, when $\alpha \leq 1/3$, the energy
profile of the solution has H\"{o}lder regularity $2 \alpha/(1 - \alpha)$ in time, even though it
might fail to be conserved in view of Onsager's conjecture. We demonstrate improved regularity
for advective derivatives of the velocity and pressure. In particular, we recover in our context
the celebrated result of Chemin that the particle trajectories of classical solutions to Euler
are smooth, and establish this result in any case where the particle trajectories are unique and
the velocity field has borderline regularity. The analysis demonstrates that many of the main analytic
features of solutions constructed by convex integration methods are consequences of the Euler
equations rather than artifacts of the constructions. The proof proceeds by estimating frequency
increments associated to the various physical quantities of interest. Several types of commutator
estimates play a role in the proof, including the commutator estimate of Constantin, E and Titi for
the relevant Reynolds stress and a more flexible proof of this estimate.
