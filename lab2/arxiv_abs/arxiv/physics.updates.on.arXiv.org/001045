We have recently shown that the electromagnetic field in a medium is made of mass-polariton (MP)
quasiparticles, quantized coupled states of the field and an atomic mass density wave (MDW) [Phys.
Rev. A 95, 063850 (2017)]. In this work, we generalize the MP theory of light for dispersive media
assuming that absorption and scattering losses are very small. Following our previous work, we
present two different approaches to the theory of light: (1) the MP quasiparticle theory, which
is derived by only using the fundamental conservation laws and the Lorentz transformation; (2)
the classical optoelastic continuum dynamics (OCD), which is a generalization of the electrodynamics
of continuous media to include the dynamics of the medium under the influence of optical forces.
For the coupled MP state of a single photon and the medium, we obtain the total MP momentum of the Minkowski
form while the field's share of the momentum is equal to the Abraham momentum. We also show that the
correspondence between the MP and OCD models and the conservation of momentum at interfaces gives
an unambiguous formula for the optical force. The dynamics of the light pulse and the related MDW
lead to nonequilibrium of the medium and to relaxation of the atomic density by sound waves in the
same way as for nondispersive media. We also carry out simulations for optimal measurements of atomic
displacements related to the MDW in silicon. In the simulations, we consider different waveguide
cross-sections and optical pulse widths and account for the breakdown threshold irradiance of
materials. We also compare the MP theory to previous theories of the momentum of light in a dispersive
medium. We show that our generalized MP theory resolves all the problems related to the Abraham-Minkowski
dilemma in a dispersive medium.
