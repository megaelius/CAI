An experimental study of NMR spin decoherence in nematic liquid crystals (LC) is presented. Decoherence
dynamics can be put in evidence by means of refocusing experiments of the dipolar interactions.
The experimental technique used in this work is based on the MREV8 pulse sequence. The aim of the work
is to detect the main features of the Irreversible Quantum Decoherence (IQD) in LC, on the basis of
the theory presented by the authors recently. The focus is laid on experimentally probing the eigen-selection
process in the intermediate time scale, between quantum interference of a closed system and thermalization,
as a signature of the IQD of the open quantum system, as well as on quantifying the effects of non-idealities
as possible sources of signal decays which could mask the intrinsic IQD. In order to contrast experiment
and theory, the theory was adapted to obtain the IQD function corresponding to the MREV8 reversion
experiments. Non-idealities of the experimental setting are analysed in detail within this framework
and their effects on the observed signal decay are numerically estimated. It is found that, though
these non-idealities could in principle affect the evolution of the spin dynamics, their influence
can be mitigated and they do not present the characteristic behavior of the IQD. As unique characteristic
of the IQD, the experimental results clearly show the occurrence of eigen-selectivity in the intermediate
timescale, in complete agreement with the theoretical predictions. We conclude that the eigen-selection
effect is the fingerprint of IQD associated with a quantum open spin system in LC. Besides, these
features of the results account for the quasi-equilibrium states of the spin system, which were
observed previously in these mesophases, and lead to conclude that the quasi-equilibrium is a definite
stage of the spin dynamics during its evolution towards equilibrium
