The surfactant-driven spreading of droplets is an essential process in many applications ranging
from coating flow technology to enhanced oil recovery. Despite the significant advancement in
describing spreading processes in surfactant-laden droplets, including the exciting phenomena
of superspreading, many features of the underlying mechanisms require further understanding.
Here, we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model with a force-field
obtained from the statistical associating fluid theory to study droplets laden with common and
superspreading surfactants. We have confirmed the important elements of the superspreading mechanism,
i.e. the adsorption of surfactant at the contact line and the fast replenishment of surfactant from
the bulk. Through a detailed comparison of a range of droplets with different surfactants, our analysis
has indicated that the ability of surfactant to adsorb at the interfaces is the key feature of the
superspreading mechanism. To this end, surfactants that tend to form aggregates and have a strong
hydrophobic attraction in the aggregated cores prevent the fast replenishment of the interfaces,
resulting in reduced spreading ability. We also show that various surfactant properties, such
as diffusion and architecture, play a secondary role in the spreading process. Moreover, we discuss
various drop properties such as the height, contact angle, and surfactant surface concentration,
highlighting differences between superspreading and common surfactants. We anticipate that
our study will provide further insight for applications requiring the control of wetting.
