In this paper, we explain a magneto quantum hydrodynamics (MQHD) method for the study of the quantum
evolution of a system of spinning particles in an external electromagnetic field. The fundamental
equations of microscopic quantum hydrodynamics (the momentum balance equation, the energy evolution
equation, the vorticity equation and the magnetic moment density equation) were derived from the
many-particle microscopic Schredinger equation with a spin-spin and coulomb modified Hamiltonian.
It has been showed that in the absence of external electromagnetic field the system of particles
are subject to the new spin-dependent addition (Spin stress) and the magnetic moments are subject
to the new Spin Torque. The new spin-dependent Spin Stress and Spin Torque which have been derived
taken into account thermal fluctuations of the spins about the macroscopic average. Spin-dependent
additions appears even in absence of the external magnetic field. We begin by describing the whistler
wave model based on two dimensional electron magnetohydrodynamic equations. The spin effects
were taken into account. The spin dynamics and spin torque in quantum plasmas is shown to cause formation
of a new type of waves as well as changes in the dispersion characteristics of whistler waves. We also
analyzed the dispersion of the collective excitations in the three dimensional samples of the magnetized
dielectrics. We show that dynamics of the spin-current leads to formation of new type of stable spin
waves. We obtained more general nonlinear dynamical equations for the amplitudes of whistler waves.
The collective Spin stress and Spin torque associated with electron - 1/2 spin effect were taken
into account.
