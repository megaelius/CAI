This paper will discuss simulations of the full ionization process (i.e. plasma burn-through),
fundamental to creating high temperature plasma. By means of an applied electric field, the gas
is partially ionized by the electron avalanche process. In order for the electron temperature to
increase, the remaining neutrals need to be fully ionized in the plasma burn-through phase, as radiation
is the main contribution to the electron power loss. The radiated power loss can be significantly
affected by impurities resulting from interaction with the plasma facing components. The DYON
code is a plasma burn-through simulator developed at Joint European Torus (JET) [1] [2]. The dynamic
evolution of the plasma temperature and plasma densities including impurity content is calculated
in a self-consistent way, using plasma wall interaction models. The recent installation of a beryllium
wall at JET enabled validation of the plasma burn-through model in the presence of new, metallic
plasma facing components. The simulation results of the plasma burn-through phase show consistent
good agreement against experiments at JET, and explain differences observed during plasma initiation
with the old carbon plasma facing components. In the International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor (ITER), the allowable toroidal electric field is restricted to 0.35 [V/m], which is significantly
lower compared to the typical value (~ 1 [V/m]) used in the present devices. The limitation on toroidal
electric field also reduces the range of other operation parameters during plasma formation in
ITER. Thus, predictive simulations of plasma burn-through in ITER using validated model is of crucial
importance. This paper provides an overview of the DYON code and the validation, together with new
predictive simulations for ITER using the DYON code.
