This work presents a review of previous articles dealing with an original turbulence theory proposed
by the author, and provides new theoretical insights into some related issues. The new theoretical
procedures and methodological approaches confirm and corroborate the previous results. These
articles study the regime of homogeneous isotropic turbulence for incompressible fluids and propose
theoretical approaches based on a specific Lyapunov theory for determining the closures of the
von K\'arm\'an-Howarth and Corrsin equations, and the statistics of velocity and temperature
difference. While numerous works are present in the literature which concern the closures of the
autocorrelation equations in the Fourier domain (i.e. Lin equation closure), few articles deal
with the closures of the autocorrelation equations in the physical space. These latter, being based
on the eddy--viscosity concept, describe diffusive closure models. On the other hand, the proposed
Lyapunov theory leads to nondiffusive closures based on the property that, in turbulence, contiguous
fluid particles trajectories continuously diverge. Therefore, the main motivation of this review
is to present a theoretical formulation which does not adopt the eddy--viscosity paradigm, and
summarizes the results of the previous works. Next, this analysis assumes that the current fluid
placements, together with velocity and temperature fields, are fluid state variables. This leads
to the closures of the autocorrelation equations and helps to interpret the mechanism of energy
cascade as due to the continuous divergence of the contiguous trajectories. Furthermore, novel
theoretical issues are here presented.
