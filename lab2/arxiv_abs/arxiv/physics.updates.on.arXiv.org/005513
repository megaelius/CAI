A systematic approach is presented to exploit the rich field transformation capabilities of Electromagnetic
(EM) metasurfaces for creating a variety of illusions using the concept of metasurface holograms.
A system level approach to metasurface hologram synthesis is presented here, in which the hologram
is co-designed with the desired object to be projected. A structured approach for the classification
of the creation of EM illusions is proposed for better organization and tractability of the overall
synthesis problem. The deliniation is in terms of the initial incident (reference) illumination
of the object to be recreated (front/back-lit), the position of illusion (posterior/anterior),
and the illumination used to create the illusion (front/back). Therefore the classification is
based on the specific relationship between the reference object to be recreated, the observer measuring
the object, the orientation and placement of the reference and illumination field, and the desired
placement of the metasurface hologram creating a virtual image. In the paper a general design procedure
to synthesize metasurface holograms is presented based on Integral Equations (IE) and Generalized
Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs), where the metasurface hologram is described as zero thickness
sheet with tensorial surface susceptibility densities. Several selected configurations are
chosen to illustrate various aspects of the hologram creation in 2D, along with a novel numerical
technique to artificially reverse propagate the scattered fields, required in the synthesis process.
Finally, the impact of the metasurface size and the illumination field strength on the quality of
the reconstructed scattered fields is also discussed.
