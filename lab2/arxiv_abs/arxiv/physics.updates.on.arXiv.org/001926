Spectrally-tailored interactions of light with material interfaces offer many exciting applications
in sensing, photo-detection, and optical energy conversion. In particular, complete suppression
of light reflectance at select frequencies accompanied by sharp phase variations in the reflected
signal forms the basis for the development of ultra-sensitive singular-phase optical detection
schemes such as Brewster and surface plasmon interferometry. However, both the Brewster effect
and surface-plasmon-mediated absorption on planar interfaces are limited to one polarization
of the incident light and oblique excitation angles, and may have limited bandwidth dictated by
the material dielectric index and plasma frequency. To alleviate these limitations, we design
narrow-band super-absorbers composed of plasmonic materials embedded into dielectric photonic
nanostructures with topologically-protected interfacial Tamm plasmon states. These structures
have planar geometry and do not require nanopatterning to achieve perfect absorption of both polarizations
of the incident light in a wide range of incident angles, including the normal incidence. Their absorption
lines are tunable across a very broad spectral range via engineering of the photon bandstructure
of the dielectric photonic nanostructures to achieve reversal of the geometrical phase across
the interface with the plasmonic absorber. We outline the design strategy to achieve perfect absorptance
in Tamm structures with dissipative losses via conjugate impedance matching. We further demonstrate
via modeling how these structures can be engineered to support sharp asymmetric amplitude resonances,
which can be used to improve the sensitivity of optical sensors in the amplitude-only detection
scheme that does not require use of bulky and expensive ellipsometry equipment.
