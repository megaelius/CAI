We study the mixing in the presence of convective flow in a porous medium. Convection is characterized
by the formation of vortices and stagnation points, where the fluid interface is stretched and compressed
enhancing mixing. We analyze the behavior of the mixing dynamics in different scenarios using an
interface deformation model. We show that the scalar dissipation rate, which is related to the dissolution
fluxes, is controlled by interfacial processes, specifically the equilibrium between interface
compression and diffusion, which depends on the flow field configuration. We consider different
scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we analyze a double-gyre synthetic velocity field.
Second, a Rayleigh-B\'enard instability (the Horton-Rogers-Lapwood problem), in which stagnation
points are located at a fixed interface. This system experiences a transition from a diffusion controlled
mixing to a chaotic convection as the Rayleigh number increases. Finally, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability
with a moving interface, in which mixing undergoes three different regimes: diffusive, convection
dominated, and convection shutdown. The interface compression model correctly predicts the behavior
of the systems. It shows how the dependency of the compression rate on diffusion explains the change
in the scaling behavior of the scalar dissipation rate. The model indicates that the interaction
between stagnation points and the correlation structure of the velocity field is also responsible
for the transition between regimes. We also show the difference in behavior between the dissolution
fluxes and the mixing state of the systems. We observe that while the dissolution flux decreases
with the Rayleigh number, the system becomes more homogeneous. That is, mixing is enhanced by reducing
diffusion. This observation is explained by the effect of the instability patterns.
