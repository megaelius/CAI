Electoral forecasting is an ongoing scientific challenge with high social impact, as current data-driven
methods try to efficiently combine statistics with economic indices and machine learning. However,
recent studies in network science pinpoint towards the importance of temporal characteristics
in the diffusion of opinion. As such, we combine concepts of micro-scale opinion dynamics and temporal
epidemics, and develop a novel macro-scale temporal attenuation (TA) model, which uses pre-election
poll data to improve forecasting accuracy. Our hypothesis is that the timing of publicizing opinion
polls plays a significant role in how opinion oscillates, especially right before elections. Thus,
we define the momentum of opinion as a temporal function which bounces up when opinion is injected
in a multi-opinion system of voters, and dampens during states of relaxation. We validate TA on survey
data from the US Presidential Elections between 1968-2016, and TA outperforms statistical methods,
as well the best pollsters at their time, in 10 out of 13 presidential elections. We present two different
implementations of the TA model, which accumulate an average forecasting error of 2.8-3.28 points
over the 48-year period. Conversely, statistical methods accumulate 7.48 points error, and the
best pollsters accumulate 3.64 points. Overall, TA offers increases of 23-37% in forecasting performance
compared to the state of the art. We show that the effectiveness of TA does not drop when relatively
few polls are available; moreover, with increasing availability of pre-election surveys, we believe
that our TA model will become a reference alongside other modern election forecasting techniques.
