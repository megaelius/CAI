The thermodynamic (TD) properties of biological membranes play a central role for living systems.
It has been suggested, for instance, that nonlinear pulses such as action potentials (APs) can only
exist if the membrane state is in vicinity of a TD transition. Herein, two membrane properties - excitability
and AP velocity - are investigated for a broad spectrum of conditions in living systems (temperature
(T), 3D-pressure (p) and pH dependence). Based on these data we predict parameter ranges in which
a transition of the membrane is located (15-35{\deg}C below growth temperature; 1-3 pH units below
pH 7; at ~800 atm) and propose the corresponding phase diagrams. The latter explain: (i) changes
of AP velocity with T, p and pH. (ii) The existence and origin of two qualitatively different forms
of loss of nonlinear excitability ("nerve blockage", anesthesia). (iii) The type and quantity
of parameter changes that trigger APs. Finally, a quantitative comparison between the TD behaviour
of 2D-lipid model membranes with living systems is attempted. The typical shifts in transition
temperature with pH and p of model membranes agree closely with values obtained from cell physiological
measurements (excitability and propagation velocity). Taken together, these results strongly
suggest that it is not specific molecules that control the excitability of living systems but rather
the TD properties of the quasi 2D-membrane interface. The approach as proposed herein can be extended
to other quantities (surface potential, calcium concentration, etc.) and makes clearly falsifiable
predictions, for example, that a transition exists within the specified parameter ranges in excitable
cells.
