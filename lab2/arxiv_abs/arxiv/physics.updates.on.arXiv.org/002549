Trailing edge noise generated by turbulent flow traveling past an edge of an airfoil is one of the
most essential aeroacoustic sound generation mechanisms. It is of great interest for noise problems
in various areas of industrial application. First principle based CAA with short response time
are needed in the industrial design process for reliable prediction of spectral differences in
turbulent-boundary-layer trailing-edge noise due to design modifications. In this paper, an
aeroacoustic method is studied, resting on a hybrid CFD/CAA procedure. In a first step RANS simulation
provides a time-averaged solution, including the mean-flow and turbulence statistics such as
length-scale, time-scale and turbulence kinetic energy. Based on these, fluctuating sound sources
are then stochastically generated by the Fast Random Particle-Mesh Method to simulate in a second
CAA step broadband aeroacoustic sound. From experimental findings it is well known that porous
trailing edges significantly lower trailing edge noise level over a large range of frequencies
reaching up to 8dB reduction. Furthermore, sound reduction depends on the porous material parameters,
e.g. geometry, porosity, permeability and pore size. The paper presents first results for an extended
hybrid CFD/CAA method including porous materials with prescribed parameters. To incorporate
the effect of porosity, an extended formulation of the Acoustic Perturbation Equations with source
terms is derived based on a reformulation of the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations into perturbation
form. Proper implementation of the Darcy and Forchheimer terms is verified for sound propagation
in homogeneous and anisotropic porous medium. Sound generation is studied for a generic symmetric
NACA0012 airfoil without lift to separate secondary effects of lift and camber on sound from those
of the basic edge noise treatments.
