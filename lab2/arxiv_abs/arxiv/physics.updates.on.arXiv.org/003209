The PICOSEC Micromegas detector has demonstrated experimentally that it can time the arrival of
Minimum Ionizing Particles with a sub-25ps accuracy. A very good timing resolution in detecting
single photons is also demonstrated in laser beams. It was found that the PICOSEC timing resolution
is determined mainly from the drift field and that the signal arrival time and the timing resolution
vary with the size of the electron-peak waveform. Detailed simulations based on GARFIELD++ reproduce
the experimental PICOSEC timing characteristics. This agreement was exploited to identify the
microscopic physical variables, which determine the observed timing characteristics. In these
studies, several counter-intuitive observations were made for the behaviour of such microscopic
variables. In order to gain insight on the main physical mechanisms causing the observed behavior,
a phenomenological model is built and presented in this work. The model is based on a simple mechanism
of "time-gain per interaction" and it employs a statistical description of the avalanche evolution.
It describes quantitatively the dynamical and statistical properties of the microscopic quantities,
which determine the PICOSEC timing characteristics, in an excellent agreement with the simulations.
In parallel, it offers phenomenological explanations to the behaviour of these microscopic variables.
The formulae expressing this model can be used as a tool for fast and reliable predictions, provided
that the values of the model input-parameters (e.g. drift velocities) are known for the considered
operational conditions. As demonstrated in this work, having available sets of input parameter
values for certain operational settings, empirical parameterizations of the input parameters
can be derived, which can be used to provide input to the model for the whole region of operational
settings covered by the above parameterizations.
