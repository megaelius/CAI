A number of applications utilise the energy focussing potential of imploding shells to dynamically
compress matter or magnetic fields, including magnetised target fusion schemes. This paper examines
the effect of fluid rotation on the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) driven growth of perturbations at the inner
surface of an imploding cylindrical liquid shell which compresses a gas-filled cavity. The shell
was formed by rotating water in solid body rotation prior to the piston-driven implosion, which
was propelled by a modest external gas pressure. The fast rise in pressure in the gas-filled cavity
at the point of maximum convergence results in an RT unstable configuration where the cavity surface
accelerates in the direction of the density gradient at the interface. The experimental arrangement
allowed for visualization of the cavity surface during the implosion using high-speed videography,
while offering the possibility to provide geometrically similar implosions over a wide range of
initial angular velocities such that the effect of rotation on the interface stability could be
quantified. A model developed for the growth of perturbations on the inner surface indicated that
the RT instability may be suppressed by rotating the liquid shell at a sufficient angular velocity
so that the net surface acceleration remains opposite to the interface density gradient throughout
the implosion. Rotational stabilisation of high-mode-number perturbation growth was examined
by collapsing nominally smooth cavities and demonstrating the suppression of spray-like perturbations
that appear on RT unstable cavity surfaces. Experiments observing the evolution of low-mode-number
perturbations, prescribed using a mode-6 obstacle plate, showed that the RT-driven growth was
suppressed by rotation, while geometric growth remained along with significant non-linear distortion
of the perturbations near final convergence.
