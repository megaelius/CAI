The rich structures arising from the impingement dynamics of water drops onto solid substrates
at high velocities are investigated numerically. Current methodologies in the aircraft industry
estimating water collection on aircraft surfaces are based on particle trajectory calculations
and empirical extensions thereof in order to approximate the complex fluid-structure interactions.
We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) using the volume-of-fluid method in three dimensions,
for a collection of drop sizes and impingement angles. The high speed background air flow is coupled
with the motion of the liquid in the framework of oblique stagnation-point flow. Qualitative and
quantitative features are studied in both pre- and post-impact stages. One-to-one comparisons
are made with experimental data available from the investigations of Sor et al. (Journal of Aircraft
52 (6), pp. 1838-1846, 2015), while the main body of results is created using parameters relevant
to flight conditions with droplet sizes in the ranges from tens to several hundreds of microns, as
presented by Papadakis et al. (AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit 0565, pp. 1-40, 2004).
Drop deformation, collision, coalescence and microdrop ejection and dynamics, all typically
neglected or empirically modelled, are accurately accounted for. In particular, we identify new
morphological features in regimes below the splashing threshold in the modelled conditions. We
then expand on the variation in the number and distribution of ejected microdrops as a function of
the impacting drop size beyond this threshold. The presented model of drop impact addresses key
questions at a fundamental level, however the conclusions of the study extend towards the advancement
of understanding of water dynamics on aircraft surfaces, which has important implications in terms
of compliance to aircraft safety regulations.
