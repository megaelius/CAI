The Brazil Current (BC) is a weak western boundary current described as a flow with intense mesoscale
activity and relatively low volume transport. We use a 13-year simulation to show that the presence
of persistent meanders and eddies leads to characteristic quasi-steady Lagrangian transport
patterns, extracted through climatological Lagrangian Coherent Structures (cLCSs). The cLCSs
position the surface expression of the BC core along the 2km isobath, in agreement with satellite
sea-surface temperature and the model Eulerian mean velocity. The cLCSs deformation pattern responds
to zonally persistent cross-shelf SSH transition from positive values near coastline to low values
between 200m and 2km and back to positive offshore from the 2km isobath. Zonally-paired cyclonic
and anticyclonic structures are embedded in this transition, causing the cLCSs to deform into chevrons.
An transport barrier is identified close to the 200m isobath confirmed by limited inshore movement
of drogued buoys and indicated by an along slope maxima of climatological strength of attraction
(cp). We show that the persistent cyclonic and anticyclonic structures may induce localized cross-shelf
transport. Regions of low cp coincide with large shelves and with stagnant synthetic trajectories.
We show that cLCSs depict trajectories initiated at the location of Chevron spill (Nov. 2011) as
compared to synthetic and satellite trajectories, and the outline of the oil from that accident.
There is an agreement between the large-scale oil slicks reaching the Brazilian beaches (Aug. 2019
to Feb. 2020) and the cp at the coast. The identification and quantitative description of cLCSs improves
the effectiveness of future emergency response to oil spills, contingency planning, rescue operations,
larval and fish connectivity assessment, drifter launch strategies, waste pollutant dispersion
and destination.
