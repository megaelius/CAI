As an important class of systems with unique topological effects beyond the periodic lattices,
quasiperiodic topological structures have attracted much attention in recent years. Due to the
quasiperiodic modulation, the topological states in the quasiperiodic topological structures
have the characteristics of self-similarity, which can be used to observe the charming Hofstadter
butterfly. In addition, because of the asymmetric distribution, the edge states in quasiperiodic
chain can be used to realize the adiabatic pumping. When the topological parameters in quasiperiodic
topological lattices are considered as synthetic dimensions, they can also be used to study the
topological properties with higher dimensions. Here, by using ultra-subwavelength resonators,
we design and fabricate a type of one-dimensional quasiperiodic Harper chain with asymmetric topological
edge states for the directional wireless power transfer (WPT). By further introducing a power source
into the system, we selectively light up two Chinese characters which is composed of LED lamps at
both ends of the chain. Moreover, the directional WPT implemented by the topological quasiperiodic
chain has the property of topological protection, which is immune to the internal disorder perturbation
of the structure. Not only do we apply the asymmetric edge state for directional WPT, but also may
further actively control the directional WPT by using the external voltage. In addition, this work
provides a flexible platform for designing new WPT devices, such as using the corner states in high-order
topological structures or the skin effect in the non-Hermitian topological lattices.
