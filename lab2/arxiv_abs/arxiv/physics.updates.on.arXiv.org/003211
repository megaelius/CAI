The research of metamaterials has achieved enormous success in the manipulation of light in an artificially
prescribed manner using delicately designed sub-wavelength structures, so-called meta-atoms.
Even though modern numerical methods allow to accurately calculate the optical response of complex
structures, the inverse design of metamaterials is still a challenging task due to the non-intuitive
and non-unique relationship between physical structures and optical responses. To better unveil
this implicit relationship and thus facilitate metamaterial design, we propose to represent metamaterials
and model the inverse design problem in a probabilistically generative manner. By employing an
encoder-decoder configuration, our deep generative model compresses the meta-atom design and
optical response into a latent space, where similar designs and similar optical responses are automatically
clustered together. Therefore, by sampling in the latent space, the stochastic latent variables
function as codes, from which the candidate designs are generated upon given requirements in a decoding
process. With the effective latent representation of metamaterials, we can elegantly model the
complex structure-performance relationship in an interpretable way, and solve the one-to-many
mapping issue that is intractable in a deterministic model. Moreover, to alleviate the burden of
numerical calculation in data collection, we develop a semi-supervised learning strategy that
allows our model to utilize unlabeled data in addition to labeled data during training, simultaneously
optimizing the generative inverse design and deterministic forward prediction in an end-to-end
manner. On a data-driven basis, the proposed model can serve as a comprehensive and efficient tool
that accelerates the design, characterization and even new discovery in the research domain of
metamaterials and photonics in general.
