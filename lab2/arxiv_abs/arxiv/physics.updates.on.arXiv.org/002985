A single quantum of excitation of a mechanical oscillator is a textbook example of the principles
of quantum physics. Mechanical oscillators, despite their pervasive presence in nature and modern
technology, do not generically exist in an excited Fock state. In the past few years, careful isolation
of GHz-frequency nano-scale oscillators has allowed experimenters to prepare such states at milli-Kelvin
temperatures. These developments illustrate the tension between the basic predictions of quantum
mechanics that should apply to all mechanical oscillators existing even at ambient conditions,
and the complex experiments in extreme conditions required to observe those predictions. We resolve
the tension by creating a single Fock state of a vibration mode of a crystal at room temperature using
a technique that can be applied to any Raman-active system. After exciting a bulk diamond with a femtosecond
laser pulse and detecting a Stokes-shifted photon, the 40~THz Raman-active internal vibrational
mode is prepared in the Fock state $|1>$ with $98.5\%$ probability. The vibrational state is read
out by a subsequent pulse, which when subjected to a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss intensity correlation
measurement reveals the sub-Poisson number statistics of the vibrational mode. By controlling
the delay between the two pulses we are able to witness the decay of the vibrational Fock state over
its $3.9$ ps lifetime at room temperature. Our technique is agnostic to specific selection rules,
and should thus be applicable to any Raman-active medium, opening a new generic approach to the experimental
study of quantum effects related to vibrational degrees of freedom in molecules and solid-state
systems.
