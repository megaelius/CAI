We study the effect of particle shape on the turbulence in suspensions of spheroidal particles at
volume fraction $\phi = 10\%$ and show how the near-wall particle dynamics deeply changes with the
particle aspect ratio and how this affects the global suspension behavior. The turbulence reduces
with the aspect ratio of oblate particles, leading to drag reduction with respect to the single phase
flow for particles with aspect ratio $\mathcal{AR}\leq1/3$, when the significant reduction in
Reynolds shear stress is more than the compensation by the additional stresses, induced by the solid
phase. Oblate particles are found to avoid the region close to the wall, travelling parallel to it
with small angular velocities, while preferentially sampling high-speed fluid in the wall region.
Prolate particles, also tend to orient parallel to the wall and avoid its vicinity. Their reluctancy
to rotate around spanwise axis reduce the wall-normal velocity fluctuation of the flow and therefore
the turbulence Reynolds stress similar to oblates; however, they undergo rotations in wall-parallel
planes which increases the additional solid stresses due to their relatively larger angular velocities
compared to the oblates. These larger additional stresses compensates for the reduction in turbulence
activity and leads to a wall-drag similar to that of single-phase flows. Spheres on the other hand,
form a layer close to the wall with large angular velocities in spanwise direction, which increases
the turbulence activity in addition to exerting the largest solid stresses on the suspension, in
comparison to the other studied shapes. Spherical particles therefore increase the wall-drag
with respect to the single-phase flow.
