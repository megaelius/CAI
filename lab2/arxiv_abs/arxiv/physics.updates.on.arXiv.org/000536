Various ways to analyze the dynamical response of clusters and molecules to electromagnetic perturbations
exist. Particularly rich information can be obtained from measuring the properties of electrons
emitted in the course of the excitation dynamics. Such an analysis of electron signals covers total
ionization, Photo-Electron Spectra, Photoelectron Angular Distributions, and ideally combined
PES/PAD, with a long history in molecular physics, also increasingly used in cluster physics. Recent
progress in the design of new light sources (high intensity and/or frequency, ultra short pulses)
opens new possibilities for measurements and thus has renewed the interest on the analysis of dynamical
scenarios through these observables, well beyond a simple access to a density of states. This, in
turn, has motivated many theoretical investigations of the dynamics of electronic emission for
molecules and clusters. A theoretical tool of choice is here Time-Dependent Density Functional
Theory (TDDFT) propagated in real time and on a spatial grid, and augmented by a Self-Interaction
Correction. This provides a pertinent, robust, and efficient description of electronic emission
including the detailed pattern of PES and PAD. A direct comparison between experiments and well
founded elaborate microscopic theories is thus readily possible, at variance with more demanding
observables such as for example fragmentation or dissociation cross sections. The aim of this paper
is to review the available experimental results motivating such studies, describe the theoretical
tools developed on the basis of real-time and real-space TDDFT to address in a realistic manner the
analysis of electronic emission following irradiation of clusters and molecules by various laser
pulses, discuss representative results, and finally give some future directions of investigations.
