The smuggling of special nuclear materials (SNM) through international borders could enable nuclear
terrorism and constitutes a significant threat to global security. This paper presents the experimental
demonstration of a novel radiographic technique for quantitatively reconstructing the density
and type of material present in commercial cargo containers, as a means of detecting such threats.
Unlike traditional techniques which use sources of bremsstrahlung photons with a continuous distribution
of energies, multiple monoenergetic gamma radiography (MMGR) utilizes monoenergetic photons
from nuclear reactions, specifically the 4.4 and 15.1 MeV photons from the $^{11}$B(d,n$\gamma$)$^{12}$C
reaction. By exploiting the $Z$-dependence of the photon interaction cross sections at these two
specific energies it is possible to simultaneously determine the areal density and the effective
atomic number as a function of location for a 2D projection of a scanned object. The additional information
gleaned from using and detecting photons of specific energies for radiography substantially increases
the resolving power between different materials. This paper presents results from the imaging
of mock cargo materials ranging from $Z\approx5$--$92$, demonstrating accurate reconstruction
of the effective atomic number and areal density of the materials over the full range. In particular,
the system is capable of distinguishing pure materials with $Z\gtrsim70$, such as lead and uranium
--- a critical requirement of a system designed to detect SNM. This methodology could be used to screen
commercial cargoes with high material specificity, to distinguish most benign materials from
SNM, such as uranium and plutonium.
