The study of historical great geomagnetic storms is crucial for assessing the possible risks to
the technological infrastructure of a modern society, caused by extreme space-weather events.
The normal benchmark has been the great geomagnetic storm of September 1859, the so-called "Carrington
Event". However, there are numerous records of another great geomagnetic storm in February 1872.
This storm, about 12 years after the Carrington Event, resulted in comparable magnetic disturbances
and auroral displays over large areas of the Earth. We have revisited this great geomagnetic storm
in terms of the auroral and sunspot records in the historical documents from East Asia. In particular,
we have surveyed the auroral records from East Asia and estimated the equatorward boundary of the
auroral oval to be near 24.3 deg invariant latitude (ILAT), on the basis that the aurora was seen near
the zenith at Shanghai (20 deg magnetic latitude, MLAT). These results confirm that this geomagnetic
storm of February 1872 was as extreme as the Carrington Event, at least in terms of the equatorward
motion of the auroral oval. Indeed, our results support the interpretation of the simultaneous
auroral observations made at Bombay (10 deg MLAT). The East Asian auroral records have indicated
extreme brightness, suggesting unusual precipitation of high-intensity, low-energy electrons
during this geomagnetic storm. We have compared the duration of the East Asian auroral displays
with magnetic observations in Bombay and found that the auroral displays occurred in the initial
phase, main phase, and early recovery phase of the magnetic storm.
