We explore the suitability of ultracold collisions between spin-polarized SrF($^2\Sigma^+$)
molecules and Rb($^2$S) atoms as elementary steps for the sympathetic cooling of SrF($^2\Sigma^+$)
molecules in a magnetic trap. To this end, we carry out quantum mechanical scattering calculations
on ultracold Rb+SrF collisions in a magnetic field based on an accurate potential energy surface
for the triplet electronic state of Rb-SrF developed ab initio using a spin-restricted coupler
cluster method with single, double and noniterative triple excitations [RCCSD(T)]. The Rb-SrF
interaction has a global minimum with a well depth of 3444 cm$^{-1}$ in a bent geometry and a shallow
local minimum in the linear geometry. Despite such a strong and anisotropic interaction, we find
that converged close-coupling scattering calculations on Rb+SrF collisions in a magnetic field
are still possible using rotational basis sets including up to 125 closed rotational channels in
the total angular momentum representation. Our calculations show that electronic spin relaxation
in fully spin-polarized Rb-SrF collisions occurs much more slowly than elastic scattering over
a wide range of magnetic fields (1-1000 G) and collision energies ($10^{-5}-10^{-3}$ K) suggesting
good prospects of sympathetic cooling of laser-cooled SrF($^2\Sigma^+$) molecules with spin-polarized
Rb($^2$S) atoms in a magnetic trap. We show that incoming $p$-wave scattering plays a significant
role in ultracold collisions due to the large reduced mass of the Rb-SrF collision pair. The calculated
magnetic field dependence of the inelastic cross sections at 1.4 $\mu$K displays a rich resonance
structure including a low-field $p$-wave resonance, which suggests that external magnetic fields
can be used to enhance the efficiency of sympathetic cooling in heavy atom-molecule mixtures.
