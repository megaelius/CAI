The Sun is a highly dynamic environment that exhibits dynamic behavior on many different timescales.
In particular, coronal holes exhibit temporal and spatial variability. Signatures of these coronal
dynamics are inherited by the coronal hole wind streams that originate in these regions and can effect
the Earth's magnetosphere. Both the cause of the observed variabilities and how these translate
to fluctuations in the in situ observed solar wind is not yet fully understood. During solar activity
minimum the structure of the magnetic field typically remains stable over several Carrington rotations
(CRs). But how stable is the solar magnetic field? Here, we address this question by analyzing the
evolution of a coronal hole structure and the corresponding coronal hole wind stream emitted from
this source region over 12 consecutive CRs in 2006. To this end, we link in situ observations of Solar
Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) onboard the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) with
synoptic maps of Michelson Doppler imager (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
at the photospheric level through a combination of ballistic back-mapping and a potential field
source surface (PFSS) approach. Together, these track the evolution of the open field line region
that is identified as the source region of a recurring coronal hole wind stream. We find that the shape
of the open field line region and to some extent also the solar wind properties are influenced by surrounding
more dynamic closed loop regions. We show that the freeze-in order can change within a coronal hole
wind stream on small timescales and illustrate a mechanism that can cause changes in the freeze-in
order. The inferred minimal temperature profile is variable even within coronal hole wind and is
in particular most variable in the outer corona.
