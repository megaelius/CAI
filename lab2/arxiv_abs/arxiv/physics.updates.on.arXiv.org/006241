Seismic anisotropy is often a combined effect of the intrinsic anisotropy and the anisotropy induced
by thin-layering. The Backus average, a useful mathematical tool, allows us to describe the latter
one quantitatively. The results are meaningful only if the underlying physical assumptions are
obeyed, such as the low frequency of the propagating wave. In this paper, however, we focus on the
only mathematical assumption of the Backus average, namely, product approximation. It states
that the average of the product of a varying function with nearly-constant function is approximately
equal to the product of the averages of those functions. We discuss particular, problematic case
for which the aforementioned assumption is inaccurate. Further, we examine numerically if this
inaccuracy affects the wave propagation in a homogenous medium---obtained using the Backus average---equivalent
to thin layers. We take into consideration various material symmetries, including orthotropic,
cubic, and others. We show that the problematic case of product approximation is strictly related
to the negative Poisson's ratio of constituent layers. Therefore, we discuss the laboratory and
well-log cases in which such a ratio has been noticed. Upon thorough literature review, it occurs
that examples of so-called auxetic rocks (rocks that have negative Poisson's ratio) are not extremely
rare exceptions as thought previously. The investigation and derivation of Poisson's ratio for
materials exhibiting symmetry classes up to monoclinic become a significant part of this paper.
Except for the main objectives of the paper, we additionally show that the averaging of cubic layers
results in an equivalent medium having tetragonal (not cubic) symmetry. Also, we present concise
formulations of stability conditions for low symmetry classes, such as trigonal, orthotropic,
and monoclinic.
