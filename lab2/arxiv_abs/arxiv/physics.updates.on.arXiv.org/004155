Gaussian process regression has recently emerged as a powerful, system-agnostic tool for building
global potential energy surfaces (PES) of polyatomic molecules. While the accuracy of GP models
of PES increases with the number of potential energy points, so does the numerical difficulty of
training and evaluating GP models. Here, we demonstrate an approach to improve the accuracy of global
PES without increasing the number of energy points. The present work reports four important results.
First, we show that the selection of the best kernel function for GP models of PES can be automated
using the Bayesian information criterion as a model selection metric. Second, we demonstrate that
GP models of PES trained by a small number of energy points can be significantly improved by iteratively
increasing the complexity of GP kernels. The composite kernels thus obtained maximize the accuracy
of GP models for a given distribution of potential energy points. Third, we show that the accuracy
of the GP models of PES with composite kernels can be further improved by varying the training point
distributions. Fourth, we show that GP models with composite kernels can be used for physical extrapolation
of PES. We illustrate the approach by constructing the six-dimensional PES for H$_3$O$^+$. For
the interpolation problem, we show that this algorithm produces a global six-dimensional PES for
H$_3$O$^+$ in the energy range between zero and $21,000$ cm$^{-1}$ with the root mean square error
$65.8$ cm$^{-1}$ using only 500 randomly selected {\it ab initio} points as input. To illustrate
extrapolation, we produce the PES at high energies using the energy points at low energies as input.
We show that one can obtain an accurate global fit of the PES extending to $21,000$ cm$^{-1}$ based
on 1500 potential energy points at energies below $10,000$ cm$^{-1}$.
