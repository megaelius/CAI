We study multistep networks whose steady-state occupancies achieve high sensitivity via thermodynamic
drive. This sensitivity allows the ratios of non-equilibrium steady states to depart far from their
equilibrium limit, known as discrimination. Discrimination is crucial for high fidelity information
processing at the molecular scale, where steady-state occupancies correspond to (competing)
products of biochemical reactions. We define an analytically tractable measure on network discrimination
schemes, termed orthogonality, which measures the extent to which discrimination is local. The
central proposition of our paper is that discrimination is fundamentally constrained by orthogonality.
We demonstrate that discrimination which amplifies binding energy differences requires low orthogonality,
whereas discrimination which amplifies activation energy differences requires high orthogonality.
Subject to orthogonality requirements, both types of discrimination are maximized by maximizing
dissipation. Dissipation itself can drive orthogonality up or down. When increasing thermodynamic
drive conflicts with orthogonality requirements, discrimination is non-monotonic. We find that,
due to its effect on orthogonality, modulating thermodynamic drive alone can sharply select between
products which are favored by different energy types, without network fine-tuning. Biologically,
this corresponds to the ability to select between products by driving a single reaction type. We
consider this possibility in the context of liquid-liquid phase separated collections of RNA and
protein known as granules, which appear to have precisely the structure required to tune orthogonality
via adjusting the rate of ATP hydrolysis.
