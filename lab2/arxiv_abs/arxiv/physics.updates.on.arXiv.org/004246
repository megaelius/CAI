The effects of the electric-field-assisted annealing on the bulk heterojunction nano-morphology
in the P3HT/PCBM active layer of the organic photovoltaic cells (OPVCs) are presented here. It was
widely accepted that the electric-field-assisted annealing will facilitate the P3HT, the polar
polymer, to be better crystalline to enhance the charge mobility, hence the improvement of the OPVC
performance. The influences on the nano-morphology of the electron donor and accepter domains
are not well understood. Here, using the cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy
(XSTM/S), the electric-field-assisted annealing treatment is found to influence the molecular
domains to be elongated with the orientation near the direction of the external electric field.
The elongation of the molecular domains is believed to facilitate the domain percolation, which
causes higher charge mobility, hence the higher short-circuit current density (Jsc). On the other
hand, it was also observed that the electronic properties of the P3HT-rich and PCBM-rich domains
in the electric-field-assisted annealed samples showed smaller energy band gaps and smaller molecular
orbital offset between the two domains, which is argued to decrease the open circuit voltage (Voc)
and negatively impact the OPVC performance. Based on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) results, the altered electronic properties are argued to be due to the molecular
intermixing induced doping effects. These results point out competing factors affecting the OPVC
performance with the electric-field-assisted annealing treatment.
