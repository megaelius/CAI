Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance have been long used to probe atomic distances between nearby
nuclear spins by virtue of the dipolar interaction. New technological advances have recently enabled
simultaneous tuning of the radio-frequency resonance circuits to nuclei with close Larmor frequencies,
bringing a great promise, among other experiments, also to distance measurements between such
nuclei, in particular for nuclei with a spin larger than one-half. However, this new possibility
has also required modifications of those experiments since the two nuclei cannot be irradiated
simultaneously. When measuring distances between a spin S=1/2 and a quadrupolar spin (S > 1/2),
this drawback can be overcome by splitting the continuous-wave recoupling pulse applied to the
quadrupolar nucleus. We show here that a similar adjustment to a highly-efficient phase-modulated
(PM) recoupling pulse enables distance measurements between nuclei with close Larmor frequencies,
where the coupled spin experiences a very large coupling. Such an experiment, split phase-modulated
RESPDOR, is demonstrated on a 13C-81Br system, where the difference in Larmor frequencies is only
11 MHz, and distances are extracted using an unscaled analytical formula. Since bromine usually
experiences particularly high quadrupolar couplings, as in the current case, we suggest that the
split-PM-RESPDOR experiment can be highly beneficial for the research of bromo-compounds, including
many pharmaceuticals, where carbon-bromine bonds are prevalent. We show that for Butyl triphenylphosphonium
bromide, solid-state NMR distances are in agreement with a low-hydration compound rather than
a water-caged semi-clathrate form. The split-PM-RESPDOR experiment is suitable for distance
measurement between any quadrupolar/spin-1/2 pair, in particular when the quadrupolar spin experiences
a significantly large coupling.
