In this paper the propagation of acoustic plane waves in turbulent, fully developed flow is studied
by means of an experimental investigation carried out in a straight, smooth-walled duct.The presence
of a coherent perturbation, such as an acoustic wave in a turbulent confined flow, generates the
oscillation of the wall shear stress. In this circumstance a shear wave is excited and superimposed
on the sound wave. The turbulent shear stress is modulated by the shear wave and the wall shear stress
is strongly affected by the turbulence. From the experimental point of view, it results in a measured
damping strictly connected to the ratio between the thickness of the acoustic sublayer, which is
frequency dependent, and the thickness of the viscous sublayer of the turbulent mean flow, the last
one being dependent on the Mach number. By reducing the turbulence, the viscous sublayer thickness
increases and the wave propagation is mainly dominated by convective effects. In the present work,
the damping and wall impedance have been extracted from the measured complex wavenumber, which
represents the most important parameter used to characterize the wave propagation. An experimental
approach, referred to as iterative plane wave decomposition, has been used in order to obtain the
results. The investigations have been carried out at low Mach number turbulent flows, low Helmholtz
numbers and low shear wavenumbers. The aim is to overcome a certain lack of experimental results
found by the authors of the most recent models for the plane wave propagation in turbulent flows,
such as Knutsson et al. (The effect of turbulence damping on acoustic wave propagation in tubes,
Journal of Sound and Vibration, Vol. 329, No. 22, 2010), and Weng et al. (The attenuation of sound
by turbulence in internal flows, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 133(6), 2013).
