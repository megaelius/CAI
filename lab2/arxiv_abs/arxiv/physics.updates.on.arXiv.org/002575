We present a general quantum optics theory, numerical calculations, and experiments of coupled
quantum dots in semiconductor nanowire waveguides. We first present an analytical Green function
theory to compute the emitted spectra of two coupled quantum dots, fully accounting for retardation
effects, and discuss the signatures of coherent and incoherent coupling through a pronounced splitting
of the uncoupled quantum dot resonances and modified broadening. The classical Green functions
used in models for the quantum emission spectra are verified and justified through full 3D solutions
of Maxwell equations for nanowire waveguides, specifically using finite-difference time-domain
techniques, showing how both waveguide modes and near-field evanescent mode coupling is important.
We then demonstrate how the dressed resonances (in the presence of coupling) take on the form of bright
and dark (or quasi-dark) resonances, and study how these depend on the excitation and detection
conditions. We also introduce a quantum master equation model to model the nonlinear spectra from
an increasing incoherent pump field, which shows the role of the pump field on the oscillator strengths
and broadening of the molecular resonances, with and without pure dephasing. Finally, we present
experimental photoluminescence spectra for spatially-separated quantum dot molecules (InAsP)
in InP nanowires, which show clear signatures of these pronounced splittings, though they also
highlight additional mechanisms that are not accounted for in the dipole coupling model. Two different
approaches are taken to control the spatial separation of the quantum dot molecules, and we discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of each.
