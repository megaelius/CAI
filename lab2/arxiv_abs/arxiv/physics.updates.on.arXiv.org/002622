We analyze large-scale patterns in three-dimensional turbulent convection in a horizontally
extended square convection cell by Lagrangian particle trajectories calculated in direct numerical
simulations. A simulation run at a Prandtl number Pr $=0.7$, a Rayleigh number Ra $=10^5$, and an
aspect ratio $\Gamma=16$ is therefore considered. These large-scale structures, which are denoted
as turbulent superstructures of convection, are detected by the spectrum of the graph Laplacian
matrix. Our investigation, which follows Hadjighasem {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 93}, 063107
(2016), builds a weighted and undirected graph from the trajectory points of Lagrangian particles.
Weights at the edges of the graph are determined by a mean dynamical distance between different particle
trajectories. It is demonstrated that the resulting trajectory clusters, which are obtained by
a subsequent $k$-means clustering, coincide with the superstructures in the Eulerian frame of
reference. Furthermore, the characteristic times $\tau^L$ and lengths $\lambda_U^L$ of the superstructures
in the Lagrangian frame of reference agree very well with their Eulerian counterparts, $\tau$ and
$\lambda_U$, respectively. This trajectory-based clustering is found to work for times $t\lesssim
\tau\approx\tau^L$. Longer time periods $t\gtrsim \tau^L$ require a change of the analysis method
to a density-based trajectory clustering by means of time-averaged Lagrangian pseudo-trajectories,
which is applied in this context for the first time. A small coherent subset of the pseudo-trajectories
is obtained in this way consisting of those Lagrangian particles that are trapped for long times
in the core of the superstructure circulation rolls and are thus not subject to ongoing turbulent
dispersion.
