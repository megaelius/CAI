Transport phenomena within crowded, complex environments is observed at many spatial and temporal
scales, from pedestrian traffic in cities and buildings to macromolecular motion within cells
and ion exchange in batteries. Geometric restrictions in an environment can hinder the motion of
individuals and, combined with crowding between the individuals, can have drastic effects on global
transport behaviour. However, in general, the interplay between crowding and geometry is poorly
understood. Existing techniques to predict the behaviour of crowded transport processes approximate
complex environments as high-dimensional meshes and use computationally expensive models that
lack the ability to reveal the functional influence of geometry and crowding on transport. Here,
we employ networked representations of complex environments and provide an efficient, foundational
framework within which the combined roles of geometry and crowding can be explored. Multiple models
of crowded, networked transport are derived that are capable of extracting detailed information
at both the level of the whole population or an individual within it. A combination of theoretical
and numerical analysis identifies critical topological features of environments that enable
accurate prediction of temporal and spatial transport statistics, as well as insight into the design
of optimal networks. Our approach is applicable to transport processes across a broad range of scientific
disciplines, bypasses traditional computational challenges of discretisation, and establishes
a unified connection between geometry, crowding and transport.
