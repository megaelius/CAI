In this work we introduce a new methodology to infer from gene expression data the complex interactions
associated with polygenetic diseases that remain a major frontier in understanding factors in
human health. In many cases disease may be related to the covariance of several genes, rather than
simply the variance of a single gene, making network inference crucial to the development of potential
treatments. Specifically we investigate the network of factors and associations involved in developing
breast cancer from gene expression data. Our approach is information theoretic, but a major obstacle
has been the discrete nature of such data that is well described as a multi-variate Poisson process.
In fact despite that mutual information is generally a well regarded approach for developing networks
of association in data science of complex systems across many disciplines, until now a good method
to accurately and efficiently compute entropies from such processes as been lacking. Nonparameteric
methods such as the popular k-nearest neighbors (KNN) methods are slow converging and thus require
unrealistic amounts of data. We will use the causation entropy (CSE) principle, together with the
associated greedy search algorithm optimal CSE (oCSE) as a network inference method to deduce the
actual structure, with our multi-variate Poisson estimator developed here as the core computational
engine. We show that the Poisson version of oCSE outperforms both the Kraskov-St\"ogbauer-Grassberger
(KSG) oCSE method (which is a KNN method for estimating the entropy) and the Gaussian oCSE method
on synthetic data. We present the results for a breast cancer gene expression data set.
