We investigate the dimension of the phase space attractor of a quantum chaotic many-body ratchet
in the mean-field limit. Specifically, we explore a driven Bose-Einstein condensate in three distinct
dynamical regimes - Rabi oscillations, chaos, and self-trapping regime, and for each of them we
calculate the correlation dimension. For the ground state of the ratchet formed by a system of field-free
non-interacting particles, we find four distinct pockets of chaotic dynamics throughout these
regimes. We show that a measurement of a local density in each of the dynamical regimes, has an attractor
characterized with a higher fractal dimension, $D_{R}=2.59\pm0.01$, $D_{C}=3.93\pm0.04$,
and $D_{S}=3.05\pm0.05$, as compared to the global measure of current, $D_{R}=2.07\pm0.02$,
$D_{C}=2.96\pm0.05$, and $D_{S}=2.30\pm0.02$. We find that the many-body case converges to mean-field
limit with strong sub-unity power laws in particle number $N$, namely $N^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha_{R}={0.28\pm0.01}$,
$\alpha_{C}={0.34\pm0.067}$ and $\alpha_{S}={0.90\pm0.24}$ for each of the dynamical regimes
mentioned above. The deviation between local and global measurement of the attractor's dimension
corresponds to an increase towards high condensate depletion which remains constant for long time
scales in both Rabi and chaotic regimes. The depletion is found to scale polynomially with particle
number as $N^{\beta}$ with $\beta_{R}={0.51\pm0.004}$ and $\beta_{C}={0.18\pm0.004}$ for
the two regimes. Thus, we find a strong deviation from the mean-field results, especially in the
chaotic regime of the quantum ratchet. The ratchet also reveals quantum revivals in the Rabi and
self-trapped regimes but not in the chaotic regime. Based on the obtained results we outline pathways
for the identification and characterization of the emergent phenomena in driven many-body systems.
