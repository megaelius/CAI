Optical properties of nanoparticles attract continuous attention owing to their high fundamental
and applied importance across many disciplines. Recently emerged field of all-dielectric nanophotonics
employs optically induced electric and magnetic Mie resonances in dielectric nanoparticles with
a high refractive index. This property allows obtaining additional valuable degrees of freedom
to control optical responses of nanophotonic structures. Here we propose a conceptually distinct
approach towards reaching optical resonances in dielectric nanoparticles. We show that lacking
conventional Mie resonances, low-index nanoparticles can exhibit a novel anisotropy-induced
family of non-Mie eigenmodes. Specifically, we investigate light interactions with calcite and
vaterite nanospheres and compare them with the Mie scattering by a fused silica sphere. Having close
permittivities and same dimensions, these particles exhibit significantly different scattering
behavior owing to their internal structure. While a fused silica sphere does not demonstrate any
spectral features, the uniaxial structure of the permittivity tensor for calcite and non-diagonal
permittivity tensor for vaterite result in a set of distinguishable peaks in scattering spectra.
Multipole decomposition and eigenmode analysis reveal that these peaks are associated with a new
family of electric and magnetic resonances. We identify magnetic dipole modes of ordinary, extraordinary
and hybrid polarization as well as complex electric dipole resonances, featuring a significant
toroidal electric dipole moment. As both vaterite and calcite are biominerals, naturally synthesized
and exploited by a variety of living organisms, our results provide an indispensable toolbox for
understanding and elucidation of mechanisms behind optical functionalities of true biological
systems.
