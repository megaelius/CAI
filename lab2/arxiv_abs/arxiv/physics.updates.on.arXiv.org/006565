We are exploring a scintillator-based detector with potential of high sensitivity, DOI capability
and timing resolution in a single-side readout configuration. Our concept combines: 1) A design
with 2+ crystal arrays stacked with relative offset, with inherent DOI information but good timing
performance has not been shown with conventional light sharing readout. 2) Single crystal array
with one-to-one coupling to the photodetector (PD) array, with good timing performance, but no
DOI. We believe the combination, where the first layer of a staggered design is coupled one-to-one
to a PD array may provide both DOI and timing. The concept is here evaluated through light transport
simulations. Results show that: 1) In terms of DOI one-to-one readout of the first layer allows for
accurate DOI extraction using a single threshold relative to the PD sum signal, for up to 4 layers.
The number of PD pixels exceeding the threshold corresponds to the layer of interaction. The corresponding
approach is not possible for the same geometries with a light sharing readout scheme. 2) When employing
a low threshold of 2 optical photons the layered approach with one-to-one readout of the first layer
improves timing close to the PD compared to single layer, due to reduced crystal thickness. Single
detector timing resolution values of 91, 127, 151 and 164 ps were seen in the 4-layer design with unpolished
pixels, compared to 148 ps for single array with one-to-one coupling. 3) For the layered design with
light sharing readout, timing improves with increased PD pixel size, with an apparent tradeoff
between spatial resolution and timing not observed for the one-to-one coupled counterpart. The
combination of straightforward and accurate DOI determination, good timing performance and relatively
simple design makes the proposed detector a promising candidate for brain dedicated DOI TOF-PET.
