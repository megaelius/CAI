We present a boundary integral formulation of electromagnetic scattering by homogeneous bodies
that are characterized by linear constitutive equations in the frequency domain. By working with
the Cartesian components of the electric, E and magnetic, H fields and with the scalar functions
(r*E) and (r*H), the problem is cast as solving a set of scalar Helmholtz equations for the field components
that are coupled by the usual electromagnetic boundary conditions at material boundaries. This
facilitates a direct solution for E and H rather than working with surface currents as intermediate
quantities in existing methods. Consequently, our formulation is free of the well-known numerical
instability that occurs in the zero frequency or long wavelength limit in traditional surface integral
solutions of Maxwell's equations and our numerical results converge uniformly to the static results
in the long wavelength limit. Furthermore, we use a formulation of the scalar Helmholtz equation
that is expressed as classically convergent integrals and does not require the evaluation of principal
value integrals or any knowledge of the solid angle. Therefore, standard quadrature and higher
order surface elements can readily be used to improve numerical precision. In addition, near and
far field values can be calculated with equal precision and multiscale problems in which the scatterers
possess characteristic length scales that are both large and small relative to the wavelength can
be easily accommodated. From this we obtain results for the scattering and transmission of electromagnetic
waves at dielectric boundaries that are valid for any ratio of the local surface curvature to the
wave number. This is a generalization of the familiar Fresnel formula and Snell's law, valid at planar
dielectric boundaries, for the scattering and transmission of electromagnetic waves at surfaces
of arbitrary curvature.
