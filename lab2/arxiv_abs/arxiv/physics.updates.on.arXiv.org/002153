The problem of scattering of harmonic plane acoustic waves by fluid spheroids (prolate and oblate)
is addressed from an analytical approach. Mathematically, it consists in solving the Helmholtz
equation in an unbounded domain with Sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity. The domain where
propagation takes place is characterised by density and sound speed values $\rho_0$ and $c_0$,
respectively, while $\rho_1$ and $c_1$ are the corresponding density and sound speed values of
an immersed object that is responsible of the scattered field. Since Helmholtz equation is separable
in prolate/oblate spheroidal coordinates, its exact solution for the scattered field can be expressed
as an expansion on prolate/oblate spheroidal functions multiplied by coefficients whose values
depend upon the boundary conditions verified at the medium-immersed fluid obstacle interface.
The general case ($c_0 \neq c_1$) is cumbersome because it requires to solve successive matrix systems
that are ill-conditioned when $c_1/c_0$ is far from unity. In this paper, a numerical implementation
of the general exact solution that is valid for any range of eccentricity values and for $c_0 \neq
c_1$, is provided. The high level solver code has been written in the Julia programming language
while a software package recently released in the literature has been used to compute the spheroidal
functions. Several limit cases (Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, spheroid tending
to sphere) have been satisfactorily verified using the implemented code. The corresponding example
scripts can be downloaded from the authors' web (GitHub) site. Additionally, the new code has been
used to extend results reported in the literature.
