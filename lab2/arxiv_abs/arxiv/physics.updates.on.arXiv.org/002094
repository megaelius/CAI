In this paper, the physics of flow instability and turbulent transition in shear flows is studied
by analyzing the energy variation of fluid particles under the interaction of base flow with a disturbance.
For the first time, a model derived strictly from physics is proposed to show that the flow instability
under finite amplitude disturbance leads to turbulent transition. The proposed model is named
as "energy gradient method." It is demonstrated that it is the transverse energy gradient that leads
to the disturbance amplification while the disturbance is damped by the energy loss due to viscosity
along the streamline. It is also shown that the threshold of disturbance amplitude obtained is scaled
with the Reynolds number by an exponent of -1, which exactly explains the recent modern experimental
results by Hof et al. for pipe flow. The mechanism for velocity inflection and hairpin vortex formation
are explained with reference to analytical results. Following from this analysis, it can be demonstrated
that the critical value of the so called energy gradient parameter Kmax is constant for turbulent
transition in wall bounded parallel flows, and this is confirmed by experiments and is about 370-389.
The location of instability initiation in the flow field accords well with the experiments for both
pipe Poiseuille flow (r/R=0.58) and plane Poiseuille flow (y/h=0.58). It is also inferred from
the proposed method that the transverse energy gradient can serve as the power for the self-sustaining
process of wall bounded turbulence. Finally, the relation of "energy gradient method" to the classical
"energy method" based on Rayleigh-Orr equation is discussed.
