Pentamode metamaterials are a type of extremal designer metamaterials which are able to demonstrate
high rigidity in one direction and extremely high compliance in other directions. Pentamodes can,
therefore, be considered as building blocks of exotic materials with any arbitrarily selected
thermodynamically admissible elasticity tensor. The pentamode lattices can then be envisioned
to be combined to construct intermediate extremal materials such as quadramodes, trimodes, and
bimodes. In this study, we constructed several primary types of anisotropic pentamode lattices
(with midpoint positioning of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, and 42% of the main unit cell diagonal)
and then combined them mutually to explore the dependence of elastic properties of hybrid pentamodes
on those of individual constructing lattices. Several anisotropic individual and hybrid pentamode
lattice structures were produced using MultiJet Additive Manufacturing technique and then mechanically
tested under compression. Finite element models were also created using COMSOL Multiphysics package.
Two-component hybrid pentamode lattices composed of individual lattices with extensively different
(as large as of 2 order of magnitudes) FOM ratios were constructed and analysed. It was demonstrated
that it is possible to design and construct composite intermediate extremal materials with arbitrary
eigen values in the elastic tensor. It is concluded that the elastic E, shear G, and bulk moduli B of
the hybrid structure are the superpositions of the corresponding moduli of the individual lattice
structures. The Poisson's ratio of the hybrid pentamode structure equals that of individual structure
with higher Poisson's ratio. The yield stress of the hybrid pentamode lattice structure depends
on the elastic moduli of the constructing lattice structures as well as yield stress of the weaker
lattice structure.
