A new automated method capable of accurately identifying bursting periods in single-point turbulent
velocity field records is presented. Manual selection of the method sensitivity and threshold
are necessary for effective discrimination between burst periods and the background turbulent
flow fluctuations (burst-free periods). The flow characteristic used for identification is the
normalized 'instantaneous' TKE dissipation rate levels, calculated using sliding window averaging.
Use of the record root mean square and average values for normalization eliminates the need for definition
of a physics-based flow-specific threshold. Instead, the suitable sensitivity range and the threshold
parameters are selected based on preliminary examination of the velocity records. This, potentially,
makes the method universally applicable for use across various flow fields, especially as it does
not require resolving the burst-generation mechanism. The method performance is examined using
a field obtained dataset of buoyancy driven turbulent boundary layer flow. Here, the selection
of a two-fold increase is used and the sensitivity of the method is examined. Spectral shapes of non-bursting
periods show distinguished similarity to those of the Kolmogorov theory, while the bursting period
spectral shapes vary significantly. Low resolution records of temperature fluctuations were
observed to exhibit a significant decrease in temperature (scalar) variance during bursting periods.
Based on this observation and additional processing, a statistical examination of temperature
(scalar) variance dissipation rate is presented along with a normalization procedure. Future
examination of additional scalar variations, i.e. particulate matter and/or gaseous pollutant
concentrations, in connection with turbulent bursting periods
