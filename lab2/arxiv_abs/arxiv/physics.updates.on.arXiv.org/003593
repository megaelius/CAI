The relation between thermal fluctuations and the mechanical response of a free membrane has been
explored in great detail, both theoretically and experimentally. However, understanding this
relationship for membranes, locally pinned by proteins, is significantly more challenging. Given
that the coupling of the membrane to the cell cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix and to other
internal structures is crucial for the regulation of a number of cellular processes, understanding
the role of the pinning is of great interest. In this manuscript we consider a single protein (elastic
spring of a finite rest length) pinning a membrane modelled in the Monge gauge. First, we determine
the Green$'$s function for the system and complement this approach by the calculation of the mode
coupling coefficients for the plane wave expansion, and the orthonormal fluctuation modes, in
turn building a set of tools for numerical and analytic studies of a pinned membrane. Furthermore,
we explore static correlations of the free and the pinned membrane, as well as the membrane shape,
showing that all three are mutually interdependent and have an identical long-range behaviour
characterised by the correlation length. Interestingly, the latter displays a non-monotonic
behaviour as a function of membrane tension. Importantly, exploiting these relations allows for
the experimental determination of the elastic parameters of the pinning. Last but not least, we
calculate the interaction potential between two pinning sites and show that, even in the absence
of the membrane deformation, the pinnings will be subject to an attractive force due to changes in
membrane fluctuations.
