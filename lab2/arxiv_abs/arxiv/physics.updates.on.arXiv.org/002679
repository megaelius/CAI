In order to realize the full potential of ion trap quantum computers, an improved understanding
is required of the motional heating that trapped ions experience. Experimental studies of the temperature-,
frequency-, and ion-electrode distance-dependence of the electric field noise responsible for
motional heating, as well as the noise before and after ion bombardment cleaning of trap electrodes,
suggest that fluctuations of adsorbate dipoles are a likely source of so-called "anomalous heating,"
or motional heating of the trapped ions at a rate much higher than the Johnson noise limit. Previous
computational studies have investigated how the fluctuation of model adsorbate dipoles affects
anomalous heating. However, the way in which specific adsorbates affect the electric field noise
has not yet been examined, and an electric dipole model employed in previous studies is only accurate
for a small subset of possible adsorbates. Here, we analyze the behavior of both in-plane and out-of-plane
vibrational modes of fifteen adsorbate-electrode combinations within the independent fluctuating
dipole model, utilizing accurate first principles computational methods to determine the surface-induced
dipole moments. We find the chemical specificity of the adsorbate can change the electric field
noise by seven orders of magnitude and specifically that soft in-plane modes of weakly-adsorbed
hydrocarbons produce the greatest noise and ion heating. We discuss the dynamics captured by the
independent fluctuating dipole model, namely the adsorbate dependent turn-on temperature and
electric field noise magnitude, and also discuss the model's failure to reproduce the 1/{\omega}
frequency scaling observed in measured noise spectra. Finally, we suggest future research directions
for improved, more quantitatively predictive models based on extensions of the present framework.
