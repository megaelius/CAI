In collisionless and weakly collisional plasmas, such as hot accretion flows onto compact objects,
the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can differ significantly from the standard (collisional)
MRI. In particular, pressure anisotropy with respect to the local magnetic-field direction can
both change the linear MRI dispersion relation and cause nonlinear modifications to the mode structure
and growth rate, even when the field and flow perturbations are small. This work studies these pressure-anisotropy-induced
nonlinearities in the weakly nonlinear, high-ion-beta regime, before the MRI saturates into strong
turbulence. Our goal is to better understand how the saturation of the MRI in a low collisionality
plasma might differ from that in the collisional regime. We focus on two key effects: (i) the direct
impact of self-induced pressure-anisotropy nonlinearities on the evolution of an MRI mode, and
(ii) the influence of pressure anisotropy on the "parasitic instabilities" that are suspected
to cause the mode to break up into turbulence. Our main conclusions are: (i) The mirror instability
regulates the pressure anisotropy in such a way that the linear MRI in a collisionless plasma is an
approximate nonlinear solution once the mode amplitude becomes larger than the background field
(just as in MHD). This implies that differences between the collisionless and collisional MRI become
unimportant at large amplitudes. (ii) The break up of large amplitude MRI modes into turbulence
via parasitic instabilities is similar in collisionless and collisional plasmas. Together, these
conclusions suggest that the route to magnetorotational turbulence in a collisionless plasma
may well be similar to that in a collisional plasma, as suggested by recent kinetic simulations.
As a supplement to these findings, we offer guidance for the design of future kinetic simulations
of magnetorotational turbulence.
