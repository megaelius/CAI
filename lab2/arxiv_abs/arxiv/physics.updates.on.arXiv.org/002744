Introduction: Topical intranasal drugs are widely prescribed for Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS),
although delivery can vary with device type and droplet size. The study objective was to compare
nebulized and sprayed droplet deposition in the paranasal sinuses and ostiomeatal complex (OMC)
across multiple droplet sizes in CRS patients using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Methods:
Three-dimensional models of sinonasal cavities were constructed from computed tomography (CT)
scans of three subjects with CRS refractory to medical therapy using imaging software. Assuming
steady-state inspiratory airflow at resting rate, CFD was used to simulate 1-120 {\mu}m sprayed
droplet deposition in the left and right sinuses and OMC with spray nozzle positioning as in current
nasal spray use instructions. Zero-velocity nebulization simulations were performed for 1-30
{\mu}m droplet sizes, maximal sinus and OMC deposition fractions (MSDF) were obtained, and sizes
that achieved at least 50% of MSDF were identified. Nebulized MSDF was compared to sprayed droplet
deposition. We also validated CFD framework through in vitro experiments. Results: Among nebulized
droplet sizes, 11-14 {\mu}m droplets achieved at least 50% of MSDF in all six sinonasal cavities.
Five of six sinonasal cavities had greater sinus and OMC deposition with nebulized droplets than
with sprayed droplets at optimal sizes. Conclusions: Nebulized droplets may target the sinuses
and OMC more effectively than sprayed particles at sizes achieving best deposition. Further studies
are needed to confirm our preliminary findings. Several commercial nasal nebulizers have average
particle sizes outside the optimal nebulized droplet size range found here, suggesting potential
for product enhancement.
