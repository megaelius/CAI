Most high order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for compressible flows are based on
Riemann solver for the flux evaluation and Runge-Kutta (RK) time stepping technique for temporal
accuracy. The main advantage of this kind of approach is the easy implementation and stability enhancement
by introducing more middle stages. However, the nth-order time accuracy needs no less than n stages
for the RK method, which is very time and memory consuming for a high order method. On the other hand,
the multi-stage multi-derivative (MSMD) method can be used to achieve the same order of time accuracy
using less middle stages, once the time derivatives of the flux function is used.The gas kinetic
scheme (GKS) provides such a time accurate evolution model. By combining the second-order or third-order
GKS flux functions with the MSMD technique, a family of high order gas kinetic methods can be constructed.
As an extension of the previous 2-stage 4th-order GKS, the 5th-order schemes with 2 and 3 stages will
be developed in this paper. Based on the same 5th-order WENO reconstruction, the performance of
gas kinetic schemes from the 2nd- to the 5th-order time accurate methods will be evaluated. The results
show that the 5th-order scheme can achieve the theoretical order of accuracy for the Euler equations,
and present accurate Navier-Stokes solutions as well due to the coupling of inviscid and viscous
terms in the GKS formulation. In comparison with Riemann solver based 5th-order RK method, the high
order GKS has advantages in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness, for all test cases. It
provides a promising direction for the development of high-order CFD methods for the computation
of complex flows, such as turbulence and acoustics with shock interactions.
