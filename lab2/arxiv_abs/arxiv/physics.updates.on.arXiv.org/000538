The dynamics of large scale plasma instabilities can strongly be influenced by the mutual interaction
with currents flowing in conducting vessel structures. Especially eddy currents caused by time-varying
magnetic perturbations and halo currents flowing directly from the plasma into the walls are important.
The relevance of a resistive wall model is directly evident for Resistive Wall Modes (RWMs) or Vertical
Displacement Events (VDEs). However, also the linear and non-linear properties of most other large-scale
instabilities may be influenced significantly by the interaction with currents in conducting
structures near the plasma. The understanding of halo currents arising during disruptions and
VDEs, which are a serious concern for ITER as they may lead to strong asymmetric forces on vessel structures,
could also benefit strongly from these non-linear modeling capabilities. Modeling the plasma
dynamics and its interaction with wall currents requires solving the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
equations in realistic toroidal X-point geometry consistently coupled with a model for the vacuum
region and the resistive conducting structures. With this in mind, the non-linear finite element
MHD code JOREK has been coupled with the resistive wall code STARWALL, which allows to include the
effects of eddy currents in 3D conducting structures in non-linear MHD simulations. This article
summarizes the capabilities of the coupled JOREK-STARWALL system and presents benchmark results
as well as first applications to non-linear simulations of RWMs, VDEs, disruptions triggered by
massive gas injection, and Quiescent H-Mode. As an outlook, the perspectives for extending the
model to halo currents are described.
