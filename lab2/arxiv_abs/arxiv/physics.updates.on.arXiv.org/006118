This paper aims at presenting the DropletSMOKE++ solver, a comprehensive multidimensional computational
framework for the evaporation of fuel droplets, under the influence of a gravity field and an external
fluid flow. The Volume Of Fluid (VOF) methodology is adopted to dynamically track the interface,
coupled with the solution of energy and species equations. The evaporation rate is directly evaluated
based on the vapor concentration gradient at the phase boundary, with no need of semi-empirical
evaporation sub-models. The strong surface tension forces often prevent to model small droplets
evaporation, because of the presence of parasitic currents. In this work we by-pass the problem,
eliminating surface tension and introducing a centripetal force toward the center of the droplet.
This expedient represents a major novelty of this work, which allows to numerically hang a droplet
on a fiber in normal gravity conditions without modeling surface tension. Parasitic currents are
completely suppressed, allowing to accurately model the evaporation process whatever the droplet
size. DropletSMOKE++ shows an excellent agreement with the experimental data in a wide range of
operating conditions, for various fuels and initial droplet diameters, both in natural and forced
convection. The comparison with the same cases modeled in microgravity conditions highlights
the impact of an external fluid flow on the evaporation mechanism, especially at high pressures.
Non-ideal thermodynamics for phase-equilibrium is included to correctly capture evaporation
rates at high pressures, otherwise not well predicted by an ideal gas assumption. Finally, the presence
of flow circulation in the liquid phase is discussed, as well as its influence on the internal temperature
field. DropletSMOKE++ will be released as an open-source code, open to contributions from the scientific
community.
