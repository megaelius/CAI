We consider viscous and heat conducting mixtures of molecularly miscible chemical species forming
a fluid in which the constituents can undergo chemical reactions. Assuming a common temperature
for all components, a first main aim is the derivation of a closed system of partial mass and partial
momentum balances plus a common balance of internal energy. This is achieved by careful exploitation
of the entropy principle which, in particular, requires appropriate definitions of absolute temperature
and chemical potentials based on an adequate definition of thermal energy that excludes diffusive
contributions. The latter is crucial in order to obtain a closure framework for the interaction
forces between the different species. The interaction forces split into a thermo-mechanical and
a chemical part, where the former turns out to be symmetric if binary interactions are assumed. In
the non-reactive case, this leads to a system of Navier-Stokes type sub-systems, coupled by interspecies
friction forces. For chemically reacting systems and as a new result, the chemical interaction
force is identified as a contribution which is non-symmetric, unless chemical equilibrium holds.
The theory also provides a rigorous derivation of the so-called generalized thermodynamic driving
forces, avoiding the use of approximate solutions to the Boltzmann equations which is common in
the engineering literature. Moreover, starting with a continuum thermodynamic field theory right
away, local versions of fundamental relations known from thermodynamics of homogeneous systems,
like the Gibbs-Duhem equation, are derived. Furthermore, using an appropriately extended version
of the entropy principle and introducing cross-effects already before closure as entropy invariant
couplings between principal dissipative mechanisms, the Onsager symmetry relations are a strict
consequence. With a classification ...
