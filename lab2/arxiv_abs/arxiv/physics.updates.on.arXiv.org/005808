In this paper, we discuss the basic ideas of Vibrodynamics and the two-timing method with the use
of Newton's equation containing a general time-periodic force. We deal with asymptotic solutions
in the high frequency limit. Accordingly, our small parameter is the dimensionless inverse frequency
or the amplitude of oscillations. Our treatment is simple but general. The central targets are to
analyse \emph{the distinguished limits} and to demonstrate the appearance of \emph{the universal
vibrogenic force}. The aim of the distinguished limit procedure is to identify how the small parameter
can appear in a given equation. This consideration leads to a \emph{valid procedure of successive
approximations}, and then to obtaining related systems of averaged equations. We show, that there
are at most two distinguished limits. This means that Newton's equation with periodic forcing has
not more than two types of asymptotic solutions. The key term in these solutions is the vibrogenic
force, which appears in the averaged equation for both distinguished limits. The current state-of-the-art
in this area is: a large number of particular examples are well-known, and complex general methods
(like the Krylov-Bogolyubov approach) are well developed. However, the presented general and
simple analysis, formulated as a compact practical guide, is novel. An advantage of our treatment
is the possibility of its straightforward use for various PDEs. This paper appears as a result of
many years of teaching PhD students. We have deliberately chosen the most known equation (Newton's),
and the most known example of high frequency forcing (a pendulum with oscillating pivot) for making
our presentation most instructive.
