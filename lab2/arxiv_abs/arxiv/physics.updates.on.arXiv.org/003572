The association of seismic wave arrivals with causative earthquakes becomes progressively more
challenging as arrival detection methods become more sensitive, and particularly when earthquake
rates are high. For instance, seismic waves arriving across a monitoring network from several sources
may overlap in time, false arrivals may be detected, and some arrivals may be of unknown phase (e.g.,
P- or S-waves). We propose an automated method to associate arrivals with earthquake sources and
obtain source locations applicable to such situations. To do so we use a pattern detection metric
based on the principle of backprojection to reveal candidate sources, followed by graph-theory-based
clustering and an integer linear optimization routine to associate arrivals with the minimum number
of sources necessary to explain the data. This method solves for all sources and phase assignments
simultaneously, rather than in a sequential greedy procedure as is common in other association
routines. We demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real data from the Integrated Plate Boundary
Observatory Chile (IPOC) seismic network of northern Chile. For the synthetic tests we report results
for cases with varying complexity, including rates of 500 earthquakes/day and 500 false arrivals/station/day,
for which we measure true positive detection accuracy of > 95%. For the real data we develop a new catalog
between January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2017 containing 817,548 earthquakes, with detection rates
on average 279 earthquakes/day, and a magnitude-of-completion of ~M1.8. A subset of detections
are identified as sources related to quarry and industrial site activity, and we also detect thousands
of foreshocks and aftershocks of the April 1, 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique earthquake. During the highest
rates of aftershock activity, > 600 earthquakes/day are detected in the vicinity of the Iquique
earthquake rupture zone.
