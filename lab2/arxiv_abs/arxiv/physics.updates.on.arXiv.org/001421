We have two basic methods of modeling matter. We can treat matter as a continuum and solve differential
equations or we can treat it discretely and solve massive N-body problems. The differential equations
produced by meaningful problems can be extremely difficult to formulate and much more difficult
to solve, if not impossible. Hence, in most cases, the resultant differential equation is discretized
and approximated numerically. We know that matter is discrete, so why all the circular work of taking
a discrete phenomenon, putting a continuous model on it, and then discretizing this continuous
model into something that is solvable? We do this because the sheer number of particles that make
up any meaningful amount of matter is daunting and impossible to handle even with todays largest
supercomputer. One discrete approach to deal with this problem is to group large numbers of particles
together and treat them as individual units called quasimolecules. Then pray that the bulk behavior
of this model behaves in a similar manner to the matter being studied. The mathematical skills needed
to set up such problems are much more attainable than those needed to set up the differential equation,
but the N-body problem that ensues usually requires a supercomputer to propagate it through time.
Until recently the cost of such machines made this approach out of the financial reach of all except
the privileged few. But, thanks to the gaming industry and recent advances in the ease to which one
can program modern graphics processing units (GPUs), this is no longer true. Supercomputing has
finally reached the masses. Here we use a simple example of a vibrating string to compare the continuous
and discrete approaches to modeling and show how GPUs can enhance an undergraduate modeling experience.
