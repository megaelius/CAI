Context. Detecting and characterizing circumstellar dust is a way to study the architecture and
evolution of planetary systems. Cold dust in debris disks only traces the outer regions. Warm and
hot exozodiacal dust needs to be studied in order to trace regions close to the habitable zone. Aims.
We aim to determine the prevalence and to constrain the properties of hot exozodiacal dust around
nearby main-sequence stars. Methods. We search a magnitude limited (H < 5) sample of 92 stars
for bright exozodiacal dust using our VLTI visitor instrument PIONIER in the H-band. We derive statistics
of the detection rate with respect to parameters such as the stellar spectral type and age or the presence
of a debris disk in the outer regions of the systems. We derive more robust statistics by combining
our sample with the results from our CHARA/FLUOR survey in the K-band. In addition, our spectrally
dispersed data allows us to put constraints on the emission mechanism and the dust properties in
the detected systems. Results. We find an over-all detection rate of bright exozodiacal dust in
the H-band of 11% (9 out of 85 targets) and three tentative detections. The detection rate decreases
from early type to late type stars and increases with the age of the host star. We do not confirm the
tentative correlation between the presence of cold and hot dust found in our earlier analysis of
the FLUOR sample alone. Our spectrally dispersed data suggest that either the dust is extremely
hot or the emission is dominated by the scattered light in most cases. The implications of our results
for the target selection of future terrestrial planet finding missions using direct imaging are
discussed.
