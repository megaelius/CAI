Purpose: Optoacoustic tomography (OAT) is inherently a three-dimensional (3D) inverse problem.
However, most studies of OAT image reconstruction still employ two-dimensional (2D) imaging models.
One important reason is because 3D image reconstruction is computationally burdensome. The aim
of this work is to accelerate existing image reconstruction algorithms for 3D OAT by use of parallel
programming techniques. Methods: Parallelization strategies are proposed to accelerate a filtered
backprojection (FBP) algorithm and two different pairs of projection/backprojection operations
that correspond to two different numerical imaging models. The algorithms are designed to fully
exploit the parallel computing power of graphic processing units (GPUs). In order to evaluate the
parallelization strategies for the projection/backprojection pairs, an iterative image reconstruction
algorithm is implemented. Computer-simulation and experimental studies are conducted to investigate
the computational efficiency and numerical accuracy of the developed algorithms. Results: The
GPU implementations improve the computational efficiency by factors of 1, 000, 125, and 250 for
the FBP algorithm and the two pairs of projection/backprojection operators, respectively. Accurate
images are reconstructed by use of the FBP and iterative image reconstruction algorithms from both
computer-simulated and experimental data. Conclusions: Parallelization strategies for 3D OAT
image reconstruction are proposed for the first time. These GPU-based implementations significantly
reduce the computational time for 3D image reconstruction, complementing our earlier work on 3D
OAT iterative image reconstruction.
