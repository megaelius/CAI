A hypothesis is tested and validated for predicting the vortex strength induced by a vortex generator
in wall-bounded flow by combining the knowledge of the Vortex Generator (VG) geometry and the approaching
boundary layer velocity distribution. In this paper, the spanwise distribution of bound circulation
on the vortex generator is computed from integrating the pressure force along the VG height calculated
using CFD. It is then assumed that all this bound circulation is shed into the wake to fulfill Helmholtz's
theorem and then curl up into one primary tip vortex. To validate this, the trailed circulation estimated
from the distribution of the bound circulation is compared to the one in the wake behind the vortex
generator determined directly from the wake velocities at some downstream distance. In practical
situations, the pressure distribution on the vane is unknown and consequently other estimates
of the spanwise force distribution on the VG must instead be applied, such as using 2D airfoil data
corresponding to the VG geometry at each wall-normal distance. Such models have previously been
proposed and used as an engineering tool to aid preliminary VG design and it is not the purpose of this
paper to refine such engineering models, but to validate their assumptions such as applying a lifting
line model on a VG that has a very low aspect ratio and placed in wall boundary layer. Herein, high Reynolds
number boundary layer measurements of VG induced flow were used to validate the Reynolds Averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) modeled circulation results and are used for further illustration and validation
of the hypothesis.
