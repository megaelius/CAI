Recent studies of rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection at high rotation rates and strong thermal
forcing have shown a significant discrepancy in total heat transport between experiments on a confined
cylindrical domain on the one hand and simulations on a laterally unconfined periodic domain on
the other. This paper addresses this discrepancy using direct numerical simulations on a cylindrical
domain. An analysis of the flow field reveals a region of enhanced convection near the wall, the sidewall
circulation. The sidewall circulation rotates slowly within the cylinder in anticyclonic direction.
It has a convoluted structure, illustrated by mean flow fields in horizontal cross-sections of
the flow where instantaneous snapshots are compensated for the orientation of the sidewall circulation
before averaging. Through separate analysis of the sidewall region and the inner bulk flow, we find
that for higher values of the thermal forcing the heat transport in the inner part of the cylindrical
domain, outside the sidewall circulation region, coincides with the heat transport on the unconfined
periodic domain. Thus the sidewall circulation accounts for the differences in heat transfer between
the two considered domains, while in the bulk the turbulent heat flux is the same as that of a laterally
unbounded periodic domain. Therefore, experiments, with their inherent confinement, can still
provide turbulence akin to the unbounded domains of simulations, and at more extreme values of the
governing parameters for thermal forcing and rotation. We also provide experimental evidence
for the existence of the sidewall circulation that is in close agreement with the simulation results.
