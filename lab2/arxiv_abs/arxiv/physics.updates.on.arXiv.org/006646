Photonic pseudospin-1/2 systems, which exhibit Dirac cone dispersion at Brillouin zone corners
in analogy to graphene, have been extensively studied in recent years. However, it is known that
a linear band crossing of two bands cannot emerge at the center of Brillouin zone in a two-dimensional
photonic system respecting time reversal symmetry. Using a square lattice of elliptical magneto-optical
cylinders, we constructed an unpaired Dirac point at the Brillouin zone center as the intersection
of the second and third bands corresponding to the monopole and dipole excitations. Effective medium
theory can be applied to the two linearly crossed bands with the effective constitutive parameters
numerically calculated using the boundary effective medium approach. It is shown that only the
effective permittivity approaches zero while the determinant of the nonzero effective permeability
vanishes at the Dirac point frequency, showing a different behavior from the double-zero index
metamaterials obtained from the pseudospin-1 triply degenerate points for time reversal symmetric
systems. Exotic phenomena, such as the Klein tunneling and Zitterbewegung, in the pseudospin-1/2
system can be well understood from the effective medium description. When the Dirac point is lifted,
the edge state dispersion near the $\Gamma$ point can be accurately predicted by the effective constitutive
parameters. We also further realized magneto-optical complex conjugate metamaterials for a wide
frequency range by introducing a particular type of non-Hermittian perturbations which make the
two linear bands coalescence to form exceptional points at the real frequency.
