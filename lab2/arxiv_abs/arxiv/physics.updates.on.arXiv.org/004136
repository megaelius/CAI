Aeroelastic phenomena are gaining significant attention from the perspective of energy harvesting
(EH) with promising applications in supplying low-power remote sensors. Besides the development
of individual EH devices, further issues are posed when considering multiple objects for realizing
arrays of devices and magnifying the extracted power. Due to nonlinear mutual interactions, the
resulting dynamics is generally different from that of single devices and the setup optimisation
turns out to be nontrivial. In this work, we investigate the problem focusing on a flutter-based
EH system consisting of a rigid plate anchored by elastic elements and invested by a uniform laminar
flow, undergoing regular limit-cycle oscillations and flapping motions of finite amplitude.
We consider a simplified, yet general, physical model and employ three-dimensional direct numerical
simulations based on a finite-difference Navier-Stokes solver combined with a moving-least-squares
immersed boundary method. Focusing on main kinematic and performance-related quantities, we
first report on the dynamics of the single device and then on multiple devices. A parametric exploration
is performed by varying the mutual distance between the devices. For the in-line arrangement, a
recovery in performance for downstream devices is achieved by tuning their elasticity. Moreover,
cooperative effects in the side-by-side arrangement are found to be substantially beneficial
in terms of resulting power, with increases (i.e. constructive interference) up to 100% with respect
to the single-device configuration. In order to confirm this numerical evidence, complementary
results from wind-tunnel experiments are presented. Finally, we describe the system behaviour
when increasing further the number of devices, outlining the ultimate goal of developing a high-performance
EH network of numerous aeroelastic energy harvesters.
