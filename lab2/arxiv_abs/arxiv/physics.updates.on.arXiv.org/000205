Stochastic Structural Stability Theory (SSST contracted to S3T) provides a framework for understanding
the emergence and equilibration of jets from turbulence in planetary atmospheres that is based
on the statistical mean state dynamics of the turbulence closed at second order. Predictions for
formation and equilibration of turbulent jets using S3T are critically compared with results of
simulations made using quasi-linear and nonlinear models. Spatial structures for the stochastic
forcing of the turbulence representative of those used in previous studies are chosen in order to
investigate the influence of forcing structure on jet formation. S3T accurately predicts the qualitative
bifurcation structure associated with the emergence of jets as well as the finite amplitude equilibrium
jets and their ultimate breakdown as a function of parameters. Quantitative differences in bifurcation
parameter values between predictions of S3T and results of nonlinear simulations are traced to
modification of the eddy spectrum which results from two processes: nonlinear eddy-eddy interactions
and formation of discrete non-zonal structures by S3T instability. Stability analysis using the
spectrum modified by these processes is shown to resolve the quantitative differences in jet emergence
bifurcation parameter values between S3T and nonlinear simulations. The physical mechanisms
associated with the formation as linear instabilities and coexistence at finite amplitude of multiple
S3T unstable jets and non-zonal structures is examined. The physical reality of the manifold of
S3T jets and non-zonal structures interaction modes is underscored by the existence in nonlinear
simulations of jet structure at subcritical S3T parameter values which are shown to be stochastically
excited stable counterparts of the S3T unstable jet modes.
