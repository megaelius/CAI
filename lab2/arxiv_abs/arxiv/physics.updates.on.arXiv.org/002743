Kerr microresonators generate interesting and useful fundamental states of electromagnetic
radiation through nonlinear interactions of continuous-wave (CW) laser light. Using photonic-integration
techniques, functional devices with low noise, small size, low-power consumption, scalable fabrication,
and heterogeneous combinations of photonics and electronics can be realized. Kerr solitons, which
stably circulate in a Kerr microresonator, have emerged as a source of coherent, ultrafast pulse
trains and ultra-broadband optical-frequency combs. Using the f-2f technique, Kerr combs support
carrier-envelope-offset phase stabilization for optical synthesis and metrology. In this paper,
we introduce a Kerr-microresonator optical clockwork based on optical-frequency division (OFD),
which is a powerful technique to transfer the fractional-frequency stability of an optical clock
to a lower frequency electronic clock signal. The clockwork presented here is based on a silicon-nitride
(Si$_3$N$_4$) microresonator that supports an optical-frequency comb composed of soliton pulses
at 1 THz repetition rate. By electro-optic phase modulation of the entire Si$_3$N$_4$ comb, we arbitrarily
generate additional CW modes between the Si$_3$N$_4$ comb modes; operationally, this reduces
the pulse train repetition frequency and can be used to implement OFD to the microwave domain. Our
experiments characterize the residual frequency noise of this Kerr-microresonator clockwork
to one part in $10^{17}$, which opens the possibility of using Kerr combs with high performance optical
clocks. In addition, the photonic integration and 1 THz resolution of the Si$_3$N$_4$ frequency
comb makes it appealing for broadband, low-resolution liquid-phase absorption spectroscopy,
which we demonstrate with near infrared measurements of water, lipids, and organic solvents.
