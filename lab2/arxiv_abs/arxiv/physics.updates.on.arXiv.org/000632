The ability of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to cause urinary tract infections is dependent
on their ability to colonize the uroepithelium. Infecting bacteria ascend the urethra to the bladder
and then kidneys by attaching to the uroepithelial cells via the differential expression of adhesins.
P pili are associated with pyelonephritis, the more severe infection of the kidneys. In order to
find means to treat pyelonephritis, it is therefore of interest to investigate the properties P
pili. The mechanical behavior of individual P pili of uropathogenic Escherichia coli has recently
been investigated using optical tweezers. P pili, whose main part constitutes the PapA rod, composed
of ~1000 PapA subunits in a helical arrangement, are distributed over the bacterial surface and
mediate adhesion to host cells. We have earlier studied P pili regarding its stretching/elongation
properties where we have found and characterized three different elongation regions, of which
one constitute an unfolding of the quaternary (helical) structure of the PapA rod. It was shown that
this unfolding takes place at an elongation independent force of 27 pN. We have also recently performed
studies on its folding properties and shown that the unfolding/folding of the PapA rod is completely
reversible. Here we present a study of the dynamical properties of the PapA rod. We show, among other
things, that the unfolding force increases and that the folding force decreases with the speed of
unfolding and folding respectively. Moreover, the PapA rod can be folded-unfolded a significant
number of times without loosing its characteristics, a phenomenon that is believed to be important
for the bacterium to keep close contact to the host tissue and consequently helps the bacterium to
colonize the host tissue.
