Free-space super-strong terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields offer multifaceted capabilities
for reaching extreme nonlinear THz optics, accelerating and manipulating charged particles,
and realizing other fascinating applications. However, the lack of powerful solid-state THz sources
with single pulse energy >1 mJ is impeding the proliferation of extreme THz applications. The fundamental
challenge lies in hard to achieve high efficiency due to high intensity pumping caused crystal damage,
linear absorption and nonlinear distortion induced short effective interaction length, and so
on. Here, through cryogenically cooling the crystals, delicately tailoring the pump laser spectra,
chirping the pump pulses, and magnifying the laser energies, we first successfully realized the
generation of 1.4-mJ THz pulses lithium niobates under the excitation of 214-mJ femtosecond laser
pulses via tilted pulse front technique. The 800 nm-to-THz energy conversion efficiency reached
0.7%, and a free-space THz peak electric and magnetic fields reached 6.3 MV/cm and 2.1 Tesla. Our
numerical simulations based on a frequencydomain second-order nonlinear wave equation under
slowly varying envelope approximation reproduced the experimental optimization processes.
To show the capability of this super-strong THz source, nonlinear absorption due to field-induced
intervalley scattering effect in high conductive silicon induced by strong THz electric field
was demonstrated. Such a high energy THz source with a relatively low peak frequency is very appropriate
not only for electron acceleration towards table-top X-ray sources but also for extreme THz science
and nonlinear applications.
