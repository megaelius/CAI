Droplet generation through spray breakup is an unsteady and non-linear process which produces
a relatively dense, highly polydisperse aerosol containing non-spherical droplets with sizes
spanning several orders of magnitude. Such variability in size and shape can lead to significant
sources of error for conventional measurements based on laser scattering. Although direct imaging
of droplets can potentially overcome these limitations, imaging suffers from a shallow depth of
field as well as occlusions, which prevents the complete spray from being analyzed. In comparison,
digital inline holography (DIH), a low-cost coherent imaging technique, can enable high-resolution
imaging of the sample over an extended depth of field, typically several orders of magnitude larger
than traditional imaging. In this study, we showcase an automated DIH imaging system for characterizing
monodisperse and polydisperse aerosol droplet size and shape distributions in the 20 um-3 mm diameter
range, over a large sample volume. The high accuracy of the technique is demonstrated by measurements
of monodisperse droplets generated by a vibrating orifice droplet generator, achieving a resolution
of ~14.2. Measurements of a polydisperse spray from a flat fan nozzle serve to establish the versatility
of DIH in extracting a two-dimensional size-eccentricity distribution function, which indicates
a strong semilogarithmic scaling between the two parameters that decays as the droplet migrates
away from the nozzle. Due to its low cost and compact setup as well as the high density of data obtained,
DIH can serve as a promising approach for future aerosol characterization.
