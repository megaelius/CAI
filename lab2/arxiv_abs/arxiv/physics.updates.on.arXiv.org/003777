Within the last decade microscopic multiphase flows have gained broad interest. An exact understanding
of the underlying hydrodynamic interrelations is the key for successful reactor layout and reaction
control. To examine the local hydrodynamic behavior, non-invasive optical measurements techniques
like particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) or (micro)particle image velocimetry ((\textmu)PIV)
are the method of choice, since they provide precise velocity measurement with excellent spatial
resolution. Such optical approaches require refractive index matching (RIM) of the involved flow
phases to prevent optical distortion due to light refraction and reflection at the interfaces.
Established RIM approaches often provide a single one degree of freedom which is sufficient to match
the RI of the flow phases solely. With that, the material properties ($Oh$ number) are fixed and the
relevant dimensionless numbers ($Ca$, $Re$) may only be altered hydrodynamically or geometrically.
To avoid expansive geometric scaling of the microchannels, we propose an approach using two binary
mixtures (double-binary mixtures) to introduce an additional degree of freedom. The approach
allows examining liquid-liquid two-phase flows at a distinct velocity while being able to change
the material combination ($Oh$-Number). Therefore $Ca$ and $Re$ can be chosen individually and
the RIM provides undisturbed optical access. We present 4 different binary mixtures to be used,
e.g. with Taylor droplets. The relevant material parameters are successfully correlated to measurement
data, which delivers a system of equations that determines the mass fractions and the velocities
to address $Re$ and $Ca$ individually. A proof-of-principle for the proposed double binary mixture
RIM-approach is successfully established using \textmu PIV raw images.
