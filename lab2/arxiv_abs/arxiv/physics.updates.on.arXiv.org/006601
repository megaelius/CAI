We present a new method for the numerical solution of the radiative-transfer equation (RTE) in multidimensional
scenarios commonly encountered in computational astrophysics. The method is based on the direct
solution of the Boltzmann equation via an extension of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods and allows
to model the evolution of the radiation field as it interacts with a background fluid, via absorption,
emission, and scattering. As a first application of this method, we restrict our attention to a frequency
independent (``grey'') formulation within a special-relativistic framework, which can be employed
also for classical computational astrophysics. For a number of standard tests that consider the
performance of the method in optically thin, optically thick and intermediate regimes with a static
fluid, we show the ability of the LB method to produce accurate and convergent results matching the
analytic solutions. We also contrast the LB method with commonly employed moment-based schemes
for the solution of the RTE, such as the M1 scheme. In this way, we are able to highlight that the LB method
provides the correct solution for both non-trivial free-streaming scenarios and the intermediate
optical-depth regime, for which the M1 method either fails or provides inaccurate solutions. When
coupling to a dynamical fluid, on the other hand, we present the first self-consistent solution
of the RTE with LB methods within a relativistic-hydrodynamic scenario. Finally, we show that besides
providing more accurate results in all regimes, the LB method features smaller or comparable computational
costs compared to the M1 scheme. We conclude that LB methods represent a competitive and promising
avenue to the solution of radiative transport, one of the most common and yet important problems
in computational astrophysics.
