Numerous quantum technologies make use of a microgravity environment e.g. in space. Operating
in this extreme environment makes high demands on the experiment and especially the laser system
regarding miniaturization and power consumption as well as mechanical and thermal stability.
In our systems, optical modules consisting of ZERODUR based optical benches with free-space optics
are combined with fiber components. Suitability of the technology has been demonstrated in the
successful sounding rocket missions FOKUS, KALEXUS and MAIUS-1. Here, we report on our toolkit
for stable optical benches including mounts, fixed and adjustable mirrors as well as polarization
maintaining fiber collimators and couplers made from ZERODUR. As an example, we present the optical
modules for the scientific rocket payload of MAIUS-2, a quantum gas experiment performing dual-species
atom interferometry with Bose-Einstein condensates. The modules are used on the one hand to stabilize
the laser frequencies and on the other hand to distribute, overlap and switch the laser beams. This
includes the overlap and joint fiber coupling of beams at 767nm and 780nm in the same polarization
state to cool and manipulate atoms of both species simultaneously. Future projects include the
development of a platform for experiments with cold atoms onboard the International Space Station.
The laser system again involves ZERODUR based optical benches in conjunction with fiber optical
components. The experiment is planned as multi-user facility and currently in the design phase.
The next step is to build the training, test and flight hardware.
