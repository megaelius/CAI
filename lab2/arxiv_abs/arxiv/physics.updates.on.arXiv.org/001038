Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria are described by the self-consistent solutions of the time-independent
Maxwell equations for the real-space dynamics of electromagnetic fields, and the Vlasov equation
for the phase-space dynamics of particle distributions in a collisionless plasma. These two systems
(macroscopic and microscopic) are coupled via the source terms in Maxwell's equations, which are
sums of velocity-space 'moment' integrals of the particle distribution function. This paper considers
'the inverse problem for collisionless equilibria' (IPCE), viz. "given information regarding
the real-space/macroscopic configuration of a specific collisionless plasma equilibrium, what
self-consistent equilibrium distributions exist?" We develop the constants of motion approach
to IPCE using the assumptions of a 'modified Maxwellian' distribution function, and a strictly
neutral and spatially one-dimensional plasma. In such circumstances, IPCE formally reduces to
the inversion of Weierstrass transformations (Bilodeau, 1962), such as those transformations
that feature in the initial value problem for the heat/diffusion equation. We discuss the various
mathematical conditions that a candidate solution of IPCE must satisfy. One method that can be used
to invert the Weierstrass transform is expansions in Hermite polynomials. Building on the results
of Allanson et al. (2016), we establish under what circumstances a solution obtained by these means
converges, and allows velocity moments of all orders. Ever since the seminal work by Bernstein et
al. (1957), on 'stationary' electrostatic plasma waves, the necessary quality of non-negativity
has been noted as a feature that any candidate solution of IPCE will not $\textit{a priori}$ satisfy.
We also discuss this problem in the context of for our formalism, for magnetised plasmas.
