We focus on the problem of optimal control of large-scale systems whose models are obtained by discretization
of partial differential equations using the Finite Element (FE) or Finite Difference (FD) methods.
The motivation for studying this pressing problem originates from the fact that the classical numerical
tools used to solve low-dimensional optimal control problems are computationally infeasible
for large-scale systems. Furthermore, although the matrices of large-scale FE or FD models are
usually sparse banded or highly structured, the optimal control solution computed using the classical
methods is dense and unstructured. Consequently, it is not suitable for efficient centralized
and distributed real-time implementations. We show that the a priori sparsity patterns of the exact
solutions of the generalized Lyapunov equations for FE and FD models are banded matrices. The a priori
sparsity pattern predicts the structure (non-zero entries) of the exact solution. We furthermore
show that for well-conditioned problems, the a priori sparsity patterns are not only banded but
also sparse matrices. On the basis of these results, we develop two computationally efficient methods
for computing sparse approximate solutions of generalized Lyapunov equations. Using these two
methods and the inexact Newton method, we show that the solution of the generalized Riccati equation
can be approximated by a banded matrix. This enables us to develop a novel computationally efficient
optimal control approach that is able to preserve the sparsity of the control law. We perform extensive
numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
