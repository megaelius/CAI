Turbulence in wall-bounded shear flow results from a synergistic interaction between linear non-normality
and nonlinearity in which non-normal growth of a subset of perturbations configured to transfer
energy from the externally forced component of the turbulent state to the perturbation component
maintains the perturbation energy, while the subset of energy-transferring perturbations is
replenished by nonlinearity. Although it is accepted that both linear non-normality mediated
energy transfer from the forced component of the mean flow and nonlinear interactions among perturbations
are required to maintain the turbulent state, the detailed physical mechanism by which these processes
interact in maintaining turbulence has not been determined. In this work a statistical state dynamics
based analysis is performed on turbulent Couette flow at $R=600$ and a comparison to DNS is used to
demonstrate that the perturbation component in Couette flow turbulence is replenished by a non-normality
mediated parametric growth process in which the fluctuating streamwise mean flow has been adjusted
to marginal Lyapunov stability. It is further shown that the alternative mechanism in which the
subspace of non-normally growing perturbations is maintained directly by perturbation-perturbation
nonlinearity does not contribute to maintaining the turbulent state. This work identifies parametric
interaction between the fluctuating streamwise mean flow and the streamwise varying perturbations
to be the mechanism of the nonlinear interaction maintaining the perturbation component of the
turbulent state, and identifies the associated Lyapunov vectors with positive energetics as the
structures of the perturbation subspace supporting the turbulence.
