Context. Wavelength, photon spin angular momentum (PSAM), and photon orbital angular momentum
(POAM), completely describe the state of a photon or an electric field (an ensemble of photons).
Wavelength relates directly to energy and linear momentum, the corresponding kinetic quantities.
PSAMand POAM, themselves kinetic quantities, are colloquially known as polarization and optical
vortices, respectively. Astrophysical sources emit photons that carry this information. Aims.
PSAM characteristics of an electric field (intensity) are compactly described by the Jones (Stokes/Mueller)
calculus. Similarly, I created calculi to represent POAM characteristics of electric fields and
intensities in an astrophysical context. Adding wavelength dependence to all of these calculi
is trivial. The next logical steps are to 1) form photon total angular momentum (PTAM = POAM + PSAM)
calculi; 2) prove their validity using operators and expectation values; and 3) show that instrumental
PSAM can affect measured POAM values for certain types electric fields. Methods. I derive the PTAM
calculi of electric fields and intensities by combining the POAM and PSAM calculi. I show how these
quantities propagate from celestial sphere to image plane. I also form the PTAMoperator (the sum
of the POAMand PSAMoperators), with and without instrumental PSAM, and calculate the corresponding
expectation values. Results. Apart from the vector, matrix, dot product, and direct product symbols,
the PTAM and POAM calculi appear superficially identical. I provide tables with all possible forms
of PTAM calculi. I prove that PTAM expectation values are correct for instruments with and without
instrumental PSAM. I also show that POAM measurements of "unfactored" PTAM electric fields passing
through non-zero instrumental circular PSAM can be biased. Conclusions. The combined PTAM calculi
provide insight into how to mathematically model PTAM sources and calibrate POAMand PSAM- induced
POAM measurement errors.
