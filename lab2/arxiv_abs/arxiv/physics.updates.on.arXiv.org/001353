This paper concerns feedback stabilization of point vortex equilibria above an inclined thin plate
and a three-plate configuration known as the Kasper Wing in the presence of an oncoming uniform flow.
The flow is assumed to be potential and is modeled by the 2D incompressible Euler equations. Actuation
has the form of blowing and suction localized on the main plate and is represented in terms of a sink-source
singularity, whereas measurement of pressure across the plate serves as system output. We focus
on point-vortex equilibria forming a one-parameter family with locus approaching the trailing
edge of the main plate and show that these equilibria are either unstable or neutrally stable. Using
methods of linear control theory we find that the system dynamics linearised around these equilibria
are both controllable and observable for almost all actuator and sensor locations. The design of
the feedback control is based on the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) compensator. Computational
results demonstrate the effectiveness of this control and the key finding is that Kasper Wing configurations
are in general more controllable than their single plate counterparts and also exhibit larger basins
of attraction under LQG feedback control. The feedback control is then applied to systems with additional
perturbations added to the flow in the form of random fluctuations of the angle of attack and a vorticity
shedding mechanism. Another important observation is that, in the presence of these additional
perturbations, the control remains robust, provided the system does not deviate too far from its
original state. Furthermore, introducing a vorticity shedding mechanism tends to enhance the
effectiveness of the control. Physical interpretation is provided for the results of the controllability
and observability analysis as well as the response of the feedback control to different perturbations.
