The efficient solution of sparse, linear systems resulting from the discretization of partial
differential equations is crucial to the performance of many physics-based simulations. The algorithmic
optimality of multilevel approaches for common discretizations makes them a good candidate for
an efficient parallel solver. Yet, modern architectures for high-performance computing systems
continue to challenge the parallel scalability of multilevel solvers. While algebraic multigrid
methods are robust for solving a variety of problems, the increasing importance of data locality
and cost of data movement in modern architectures motivates the need to carefully exploit structure
in the problem. Robust logically structured variational multigrid methods, such as Black Box Multigrid
(BoxMG), maintain structure throughout the multigrid hierarchy. This avoids indirection and
increased coarse-grid communication costs typical in parallel algebraic multigrid. Nevertheless,
the parallel scalability of structured multigrid is challenged by coarse-grid problems where
the overhead in communication dominates computation. In this paper, an algorithm is introduced
for redistributing coarse-grid problems through incremental agglomeration. Guided by a predictive
performance model, this algorithm provides robust redistribution decisions for structured multilevel
solvers. A two-dimensional diffusion problem is used to demonstrate the significant gain in performance
of this algorithm over the previous approach that used agglomeration to one processor. In addition,
the parallel scalability of this approach is demonstrated on two large-scale computing systems,
with solves on up to 500K+ cores.
