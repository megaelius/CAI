The leading order terms in a curvature expansion of the surface tension, the Tolman length (first
order), and rigidities (second order) have been shown to play an important role in the description
of nucleation processes. This work presents general and rigorous expressions to compute these
quantities for any non-local density functional theory (DFT). The expressions hold for pure fluids
and mixtures, and reduce to the known expressions from density gradient theory (DGT). The framework
is applied to a Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed chain polar statistical associating
fluid theory (PCP-SAFT) and is used for an extensive investigation of curvature corrections for
pure fluids and mixtures. Predictions from the full DFT are compared to two simpler theories: predictive
density gradient theory (pDGT), that has a density and temperature dependent influence matrix
derived from DFT, and DGT, where the influence parameter reproduces the surface tension as predicted
from DFT. All models are based on the same equation of state and predict similar Tolman lengths and
spherical rigidities for small molecules, but the deviations between DFT and DGT increase with
chain length for the alkanes. For all components except water, we find that DGT underpredicts the
value of the Tolman length, but overpredicts the value of the spherical rigidity. An important basis
for the calculation is an accurate prediction of the planar surface tension. Therefore, further
work is required to accurately extract Tolman lengths and rigidities of alkanols, because DFT with
PCP-SAFT does not accurately predict surface tensions of these fluids.
