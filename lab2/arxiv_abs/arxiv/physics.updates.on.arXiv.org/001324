We present a symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) for the interaction of two high-spin
open-shell molecules (described by their restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock determinants)
resulting in low-spin states of the complex. The previously available SAPT formalisms, except
for some system-specific studies for few-electron complexes, were restricted to the high-spin
state of the interacting system. Thus, the new approach provides, for the first time, a SAPT-based
estimate of the splittings between different spin states of the complex. We have derived and implemented
the lowest-order SAPT term responsible for these splittings, that is, the first-order exchange
energy. We show that within the so-called S2 approximation commonly used in SAPT (neglecting effects
that vanish as fourth or higher powers of intermolecular overlap integrals), the first-order exchange
energies for all multiplets are linear combinations of two matrix elements: a diagonal exchange
term that determines the spin-averaged effect and a {\em spin-flip term} responsible for the splittings
between the states. The numerical factors in this linear combination are determined solely by the
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: accordingly, the S2 approximation implies a Heisenberg Hamiltonian
picture with a single coupling strength parameter determining all the splittings. The new approach
is cast into both molecular-orbital and atomic-orbital expressions: the latter enable an efficient
density-fitted implementation. We test the newly developed formalism on several open-shell complexes
ranging from diatomic systems (Li+H, Mn+Mn,...) to the phenalenyl dimer.
