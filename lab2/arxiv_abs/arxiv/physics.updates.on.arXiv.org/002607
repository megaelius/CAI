High-temperature electrolysis (HTE) is a promising technology for achieving high-efficiency
power-to-gas, which mitigates the renewable curtailment by transforming wind or solar energy
into fuels. Different from low-temperature electrolysis, a considerable amount of the input energy
is consumed by auxiliaries in an HTE system for maintaining the temperature, so the studies on systematic
description and parameter optimization of HTE are essentially required. A few published studies
investigated HTE's systematic optimization based on simulation, yet there is not a commonly used
analytical optimization model which is more suitable for integration with power grid. To fill in
this blank, a concise analytical operation model is proposed in this paper to coordinate the necessary
power consumptions of auxiliaries under various loading conditions of an HTE system. First, this
paper develops a comprehensive energy flow model for an HTE system based on the fundamentals extracted
from the existing work, providing a quantitative description of the impacts of condition parameters,
including the temperature and the feedstock flow rates. A concise operation model is then analytically
proposed to search for the optimal operating states that maximize the hydrogen yield while meeting
the desired system loading power by coordinating the temperature, the feedstock flows and the electrolysis
current. The evaluation of system performance and the consideration of constraints caused by energy
balances and necessary stack requirements are both included. In addition, analytical optimality
conditions are obtained to locate the optimal states without performing nonlinear programming
by further investigating the optimization method. A numerical case of an HTE system is employed
to validate the proposed operation model, which proves to not only improve the conversion efficiency
but also enlarge the system load range.
