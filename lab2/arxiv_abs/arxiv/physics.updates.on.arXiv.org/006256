Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems are required to extract suitable information about retina and
its changes. In particular, identifying objects of interest such as lesions and anatomical structures
from the retinal images is a challenging and iterative process that is doable by image processing
approaches. Microaneurysm (MAs) are one set of these changes caused by diabetic retinopathy (DR).
In fact, MAs detection is the main step for the identification of DR in the retinal images analysis.
The objective of this study is to apply an automated method for the detection of MAs and compare the
results of detection with and without vessel segmentation and masking either in the normal or abnormal
image. The steps for detection and segmentation are as follows. In the first step, we did preprocessing,
by using top-hat transformation. Our main processing was included applying Radon transform, to
segment the vessels and masking them. At last, we did the MAs detection step using a combination of
Laplacian-of-Gaussian and Convolutional Neural Networks. To evaluate the accuracy of our proposed
method, we compare the output of our proposed method with the ground truth that collected by ophthalmologists.
With vessel segmentation, our algorithm found a sensitivity of more than 85% in the detection of
MAs with 11 false-positive rates per image for 100 color images in a local retinal database and 20
images of a public dataset (DRIVE). Also without vessel segmentation, our automated algorithm
finds a sensitivity of about 90% in the detection of MAs with 73 false positives per image for all 120
images of two databases. In conclusion, with vessel segmentation, we have acceptable sensitivity
and specificity, as a necessary step in some diagnostic algorithm for retinal pathology.
