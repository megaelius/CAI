In this paper, we study the nonlinear dynamics of an axisymmetric disturbance to the laminar state
in non-rotating Poiseuille pipe flows. In particular, we show that the associated Navier-Stokes
equations can be reduced to a set of coupled Camassa-Holm type equations. These support inviscid
and smooth localized travelling waves, which are numerically computed using the Petviashvili
method. In physical space they correspond to localized toroidal vortices that concentrate near
the pipe boundaries (wall vortexons) or wrap around the pipe axis (centre vortexons) in agreement
with the analytical soliton solutions derived by Fedele (2012) for small and long-wave disturbances.
Inviscid singular vortexons with discontinuous radial velocities are also numerically discovered
as associated to special traveling waves with a wedge-type singularity, viz. peakons. Their existence
is confirmed by an analytical solution of exponentially-shaped peakons that is obtained for the
particular case of the uncoupled Camassa-Holm equations. The evolution of a perturbation is also
investigated using an accurate Fourier-type spectral scheme. We observe that an initial vortical
patch splits into a centre vortexon radiating vorticity in the form of wall vortexons. These can
under go further splitting before viscosity dissipate them, leading to a slug of centre vortexons.
The splitting process originates from a radial flux of azimuthal vorticity from the wall to the pipe
axis in agreement with Eyink (2008). The inviscid and smooth vortexon is similar to the nonlinear
neutral structures derived by Walton (2011) and it may be a precursor to puffs and slugs observed
at transition, since most likely it is unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances.
