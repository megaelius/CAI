Almost universally, wealth is not distributed uniformly within societies or economies. Even though
wealth data have been collected in various forms for centuries, the origins for the observed wealth-disparity
and social inequality are not yet fully understood. Especially the impact and connections of human
behavior on wealth could so far not be inferred from data. Here we study wealth data from the virtual
economy of the massive multiplayer online game (MMOG) Pardus. This data not only contains every
player's wealth at every point in time, but also all actions of every player over a timespan of almost
a decade. We find that wealth distributions in the virtual world are very similar to those in western
countries. In particular we find an approximate exponential for low wealth and a power-law tail.
The Gini index is found to be $g=0.65$, which is close to the indices of many Western countries. We
find that wealth-increase rates depend on the time when players entered the game. Players that entered
the game early on tend to have remarkably higher wealth-increase rates than those who joined later.
Studying the players' positions within their social networks, we find that the local position in
the trade network is most relevant for wealth. Wealthy people have high in- and out-degree in the
trade network, relatively low nearest-neighbor degree and a low clustering coefficient. Wealthy
players have many mutual friendships and are socially well respected by others, but spend more time
on business than on socializing. We find that players that are not organized within social groups
with at least three members are significantly poorer on average. We observe that high `political'
status and high wealth go hand in hand. Wealthy players have few personal enemies, but show animosity
towards players that behave as public enemies.
