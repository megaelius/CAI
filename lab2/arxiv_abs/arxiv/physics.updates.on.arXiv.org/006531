On the base of logic discrete equations system mathematical modeling of COVID-19 epidemic spread
was carried out in the world and in the countries with the largest number of infected people such as
the USA, Brasil, Russia and India in the first half of 2020. It was shown that for the countries with
strong restrictive measures the spread of COVID-19 fit on a single wave with small capacity as for
a number of countries with violation of restrictive measures the spread of the epidemic fit on a waves
superposition. For countries with large population mixing, the spread of the epidemic today also
fits into a single wave, but with a huge capacity value (for Brazil - 80 million people, for India -
40 million people). We estimated that the epidemic spread in the world today fits into 5 waves. The
first two waves are caused by the epidemic spread in China (the first - in Wuhan), the third - by the
epidemic spread in European countries, the fourth mainly by the epidemic spread in Russia and the
USA, the fifth wave is mainly caused by the epidemic spread in Latin America and South Asia. It was
the fifth wave that led to the spread of the coronavirus epidemic COVID-19 entering a new phase, with
an increase in the number of infected more than 100 thousand inhabitants. For all the studied countries
and the world, for each of the superposition waves, the wave capacities and growth indicators were
calculated. The local peaks of the waves and their ending times are determined. It was the fifth wave
that led to the fact that COVID-19 spread is entering a new phase, with the increase in the number of
infected people being more than 100 thousand inhabitants. For all the countries being examined
and for the whole world, for each of the superposition waves we calculated the waves capacities and
index of infected people growth.
