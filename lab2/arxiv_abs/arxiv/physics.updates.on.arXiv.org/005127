In multicellular organisms, cells differentiate into several distinct types during early development.
Determination of each cellular state, along with the ratio of each cell type, as well as the developmental
course during cell differentiation are highly regulated processes that are robust to noise and
environmental perturbations throughout development. Waddington metaphorically depicted this
robustness as the epigenetic landscape in which the robustness of each cellular state is represented
by each valley in the landscape. This robustness is now conceptualized as an approach toward an attractor
in a gene-expression dynamical system. However, there is still an incomplete understanding of
the origin of landscape change, which is accompanied by branching of valleys that corresponds to
the differentiation process. Recent progress in developmental biology has unveiled the molecular
processes involved in epigenetic modification, which will be a key to understanding the nature
of slow landscape change. Nevertheless, the contribution of the interplay between gene expression
and epigenetic modification to robust landscape changes, known as homeorhesis, remains elusive.
Here, we introduce a theoretical model that combines epigenetic modification with gene expression
dynamics driven by a regulatory network. In this model, epigenetic modification changes the feasibility
of expression, i.e., the threshold for expression dynamics, and a slow positive-feedback process
from expression to the threshold level is introduced. Under such epigenetic feedback, several
fixed-point attractors with distinct expression patterns are generated hierarchically shaping
the epigenetic landscape with successive branching of valleys. This theory provides a quantitative
framework for explaining homeorhesis in development as postulated by Waddington, based on dynamical-system
theory with slow feedback reinforcement.
