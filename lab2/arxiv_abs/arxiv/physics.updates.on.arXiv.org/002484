We present a new method to accelerate real time-time dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT)
calculations with hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. For large basis set, the computational
bottleneck for large scale calculations is the application of the Fock exchange operator to the
time-dependent orbitals. Our main goal is to reduce the frequency of applying the Fock exchange
operator, without loss of accuracy. We achieve this by combining the recently developed parallel
transport (PT) gauge formalism and the adaptively compressed exchange operator (ACE) formalism.
The PT gauge yields the slowest possible dynamics among all choices of gauge. When coupled with implicit
time integrators such as the Crank-Nicolson (CN) scheme, the resulting PT-CN scheme can significantly
increase the time step from sub-attoseconds to 10-100 attoseconds. At each time step $t_{n}$, PT-CN
requires the self-consistent solution of the orbitals at time $t_{n+1}$. We use ACE to delay the
update of the Fock exchange operator in this nonlinear system, while maintaining the same self-consistent
solution. We verify the performance of the resulting PT-CN-ACE method by computing the absorption
spectrum of a benzene molecule and the response of bulk silicon systems to an ultrafast laser pulse,
using the planewave basis set and the HSE functional. We report the strong and weak scaling of the
PT-CN-ACE method for silicon systems ranging from 32 to 1024 atoms, with up to 2048 computational
cores. Compared to standard explicit time integrators such as the 4th order Runge-Kutta method
(RK4), the PT-CN-ACE can reduce the Fock exchange operator application by nearly 70 times, thus
reduce the overall wall clock time time by 46 times for the system with 1024 atoms. Hence our work enables
hybrid functional rt-TDDFT calculations to be routinely performed with a large basis set for the
first time.
