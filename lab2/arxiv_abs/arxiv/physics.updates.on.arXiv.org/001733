Characterizing large-scale organization in networks, including multilayer networks, is one
of the most prominent topics in network science and is important for many applications. One type
of mesoscale feature is community structure, in which sets of nodes are densely connected internally
but sparsely connected to other dense sets of nodes. Two of the most popular approaches for community
detection are maximizing an objective function called "modularity" and performing statistical
inference using stochastic block models. Generalizing work by Newman on monolayer networks (Physical
Review E 94, 052315), we show in multilayer networks that maximizing modularity is equivalent,
under certain conditions, to maximizing the posterior probability of community assignments under
suitably chosen stochastic block models. We derive versions of this equivalence for various types
of multilayer structure, including temporal, multiplex, and multilevel (i.e., hierarchical)
networks. We consider cases in which the key parameters are constant as well as ones in which they
vary across layers; in the latter case, this yields a novel, layer-weighted version of the modularity
function. Our results also help address a longstanding difficulty of multilayer modularity-maximization
algorithms, which require the specification of two sets of tuning parameters that have been difficult
to choose in practice. We show how to perform this parameter selection in a statistically-grounded
way, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several multilayer network benchmarks.
Finally, we apply our method to empirical data to identify multilayer communities without having
to tune parameters.
