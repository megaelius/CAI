Over the last decade, two-dimensional structures including graphene and transition metal dichalchogenides
have attracted major interest due to their unique electrical and optical properties arising from
their band structure, orbital coupling and crystal symmetry. Alongside, a large variety of physical
platforms have emerged that allow mimicking and simulating two-dimensional lattices, including
cold atoms in periodic traps, molecule-by-molecule assembly on metal surfaces, patterned electron
gases, and optical cavity arrangements. Recently, exciton-polaritons, bosonic quasi-particles
emerging from the strong coupling between an exciton and a cavity photon, have been added to the list
of promising candidates for the emulation of system Hamiltonians on a semiconductor platform.
The technologically well-developed semiconductor material system offers versatile tools to
engineer their potential landscape and techniques for direct current injection even in the nonlinear
regime. In this work, we combine the electrical injection scheme with a two-dimensional lattice
potential landscape of a square lattice as well as a honeycomb lattice to demonstrate the first electrically
driven photonic simulator. We observe the characteristic band structure of a square lattice potential
and of a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice in the electroluminescence spectrum of our polaritonic
structure. Laser-like emission from high-symmetry points is observed in our hexagonal lattice
structure under direct current injection assisted by a background optical illumination, which
strongly outlines its capability to act as an on-chip nonlinear simulator. Our established platform
can be adapted for the engineering of electrically driven polariton lasers with topologically
non-trivial properties.
