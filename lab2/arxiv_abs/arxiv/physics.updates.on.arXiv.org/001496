We report on the development and phase noise performance of a 9.1926 GHz microwave frequency synthesizer
to be used as the local oscillator for a Cs fountain clock. It is based on frequency multiplication
and synthesis from an ultralow phase noise 5 MHz Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO) and 100
MHz Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator (VCXO).The key component of the frequency multiplication
is a non-linear transmission-line (NLTL) used as a frequency comb generator. The phase noise of
the synthesizer is improved by carefully optimizing the input power, the input and output impedances
of the NLTL. The absolute phase noises of the 9.1926 GHz output signal are measured to be -64 dBc/Hz,
-83 dBc/Hz, -92 dBc/Hz, -117 dBc/Hz and -119 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz, 10Hz, 100Hz, 1 kHz and 10 kHz offset frequencies,
respectively. The residual phase noise of the synthesizer is measured to be -82 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset
frequency. The measurement result shows that the absolute phase noise at the frequency range of
1 - 100 Hz is mainly limited by the phase noise of the OCXO. The contribution of the absolute phase noise
to the fountain clock short-term frequency stability is calculated to be 7.0x10^(-14). The residual
frequency stability of the synthesizer is measured to be1.5x10^(-14), which is consistent with
the calculated frequency stability due to the residual phase noise of the synthesizer. Meanwhile
we designed and realized an interferometric microwave switch in the synthesizer to eliminate the
frequency shifts induced by the microwave leakage. The extinction ratio of the switch is measured
to be more than 50 dB. In the scheme, we use only commercially available components to build the microwave
frequency synthesizer with excellent phase noise performance for high-performance Cs fountain
clocks.
