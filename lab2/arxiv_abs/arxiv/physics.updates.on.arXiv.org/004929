This work deals with the problem of strongly correlated electrons in two-dimensions (2D). We give
a reduced density matrix (RDM) based tool through which the ground-state energy is given as a functional
of the natural orbitals and their occupation numbers. Specifically, the Piris Natural Orbital
Functional 7 (PNOF7) is used for studying the 2D Hubbard model and hydrogen square lattices. The
singlet ground-state is studied, as well as the doublet mixed quantum state obtained by extracting
an electron from the system. Our method satisfies two-index necessary N-representability conditions
of the two-particle RDM (2RDM) and guarantees the conservation of the total spin. We show the ability
of PNOF7 to describe strong correlation effects in these 2D systems by comparing our results with
exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and auxiliary-field quantum
Monte Carlo calculations. PNOF7 overcomes variational 2RDM methods with two- and three-index
positivity N-representability conditions, reducing computational cost to mean-field scaling.
Consistent results are obtained for small and large systems up to 144 electrons, weak and strong
correlation regimes, and many filling situations. Unlike other methods, there is no dependence
on dimensionality in the results obtained with PNOF7, and no particular difficulties have been
observed to converge PNOF7 away from half-filling. Smooth double occupancy of sites is obtained
regardless of the filling. Symmetric dissociation of 2D hydrogen lattices shows that long-range
nondynamic correlation drammatically affects electron detachment energies. PNOF7 compares
well with DMRG along the dissociation curve.
