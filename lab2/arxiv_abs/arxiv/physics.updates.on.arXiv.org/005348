We present a scheme for obtaining physical bounds on any electromagnetic scattering problem that
can be framed as a net emission, scattering or absorption process. The method requires only a high
level description of the design problem---the material the device will be made of, a boundary for
the volume the device may occupy, and a description of the incident field or excitation current source---to
simultaneously consider all structuring possibilities. Both surprising and anticipated characteristics
related to material and geometric properties are observed. For the canonical case of a propagating
planewave interacting with an arbitrarily designable object contained in a spherical bounding
domain of radius, the scattering cross sections in the small radii (quasi-static) limit display
a material dependence on the electric susceptibility for metals corresponding to a diluted (homogenized)
material response, achievable via nanostructuring, such that for the same material loss, the performance
of strong metals is found to be significantly weaker than that of resonant spherical nanoparticles
satisfying the localized plasmon-polariton condition. For large radii, achievable scattering
interactions asymptote to the geometric cross section of the ball, as predicted by ray optics. Bounds
on the maximum power radiated by a dipole located a distance above the spherical bounding domain
are also investigated and found to be reduced compared to prior analyses, with strong metals and
dielectrics exhibiting the expected scaling with respect to separation in the deep near field regime
but a more muted dependence on the real part of the susceptibility. The basis of the proposed method
rests entirely on the applicability of scattering theory, and can thus likely be applied to acoustics,
quantum mechanics, and other wave physics.
