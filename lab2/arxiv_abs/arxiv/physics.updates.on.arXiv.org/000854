The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description of plasmas with relativistic particles necessarily
includes an additional new field, the chiral chemical potential associated with the axial charge
(i.e., the number difference between right- and left-handed relativistic fermions). This chiral
chemical potential gives rise to a contribution to the electric current density of the plasma (\emph{chiral
magnetic effect}). We present a self-consistent treatment of the \emph{chiral MHD equations},
which include the back-reaction of the magnetic field on a chiral chemical potential and its interaction
with the plasma velocity field. A number of novel phenomena are exhibited. First, we show that the
chiral magnetic effect decreases the frequency of the Alfv\'{e}n wave for incompressible flows,
increases the frequencies of the Alfv\'{e}n wave and of the fast magnetosonic wave for compressible
flows, and decreases the frequency of the slow magnetosonic wave. Second, we show that, in addition
to the well-known laminar chiral dynamo effect, which is not related to fluid motions, there is a
dynamo caused by the joint action of velocity shear and chiral magnetic effect. In the presence of
turbulence with vanishing mean kinetic helicity, the derived mean-field chiral MHD equations
describe turbulent large-scale dynamos caused by the chiral alpha effect, which is dominant for
large fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers. The chiral alpha effect is due to an interaction of the
chiral magnetic effect and fluctuations of the small-scale current produced by tangling magnetic
fluctuations (which are generated by tangling of the large-scale magnetic field by sheared velocity
fluctuations). These dynamo effects may have interesting consequences in the dynamics of the early
Universe, neutron stars, and the quark-gluon plasma.
