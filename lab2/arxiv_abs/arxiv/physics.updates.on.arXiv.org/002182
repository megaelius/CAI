We present the extension of an efficient and highly parallelisable framework for incompressible
fluid flowsimulations to viscoplastic fluids. The system is governed by incompressible conservation
of mass, the Cauchy momentum equation and a generalised Newtonian constitutive law. In order to
simulate a wide range of viscoplastic fluids, we employ the Herschel-Bulkley model for yield-stress
fluids with nonlinear stress-strain dependency above the yield limit. We utilise Papanastasiou
regularisation in our algorithm to deal with the singularity in apparent viscosity. The resulting
system of partial differential equations is solved using the IAMR code (Incompressible Adaptive
Mesh Refinement), which uses second-order Godunov methodology for the advective terms and semi-implicit
diffusion in the context of an approximate projection method to solve on adaptively refined meshes.
By augmenting the IAMR code with the ability to simulate regularised Herschel-Bulkley fluids,
we obtain efficient numerical software for viscoplastic flow which can be used to investigate systems
previously considered too expensive computationally. We validate results from simulations using
this new capability against previously published data for Bingham plastics and power-law fluids
in the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity. In doing so, we expand the range of Bingham and Reynolds
numbers which have been considered in the benchmark tests. Moreover, extensions to time-dependent
flow of Herschel-Bulkley fluids and three spatial dimensions offer new insights into the flow of
viscoplastic fluids in this test case, and we provide missing benchmark results for these extensions.
