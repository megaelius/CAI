Coarse Grid Projection (CGP) methodology is used to accelerate the computations of sets of decoupled
nonlinear evolutionary and linear static equations. In CGP, the linear equations are solved on
a coarsened mesh compared to the nonlinear equations, leading to a reduction in central processing
unit (CPU) time. The accuracy of the CGP scheme has been assessed for the advection-diffusion equation
along with the pressure Poisson equation. Here we add another decoupled equation to this set: the
energy equation. In this article, we examine the influence of CGP methodology for the first time
on thermal fields. To this purpose, a semi-implicit-time-integration unstructured-triangular-finite-element
CGP version is selected. The CGP platform is validated with two different test cases: first, natural
convection induced by a hot circular cylinder located in the center of a cold square cylinder, and
second, the flow over a circular cylinder with the condition of constant cylinder temperature.
Regarding the first test case, the CGP and non-CGP simulations are carried out for different Rayleigh
numbers. The velocity and temperature fields as well as the local Nusselt number on the surface of
the inner hot cylinder calculated by CGP reveal good agreement with the non-CGP data. Concerning
the second test case, the temperature variable is used as the passive scalar. For different Prandtl
numbers, we compare the CGP and non-CGP configurations according to the Nusselt number and the spatial
structure of the scalar field obtained. The phase lag between the standard and CGP approaches is
transmitted from the velocity field into the temperature filed, and thus into the local transient
Nusselt number. For one and two levels of coarsening, the numerical predictions by CGP for the unsteady
local heat transfer coefficients agree well with available data in the literature.
