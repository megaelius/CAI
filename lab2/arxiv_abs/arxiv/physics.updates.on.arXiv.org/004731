A recently developed finite element approach for fully numerical atomic structure calculations
[S. Lehtola, Int. J. Quantum Chem. 119, e25945 (2019)] is extended to the description of atoms with
spherically symmetric densities via fractionally occupied orbitals. Specialized versions of
Hartree-Fock as well as local density and generalized gradient approximation density functionals
are developed, allowing extremely rapid calculations at the basis set limit on the ground and low-lying
excited states even for heavy atoms. The implementation of range-separation based on the Yukawa
or complementary error function (erfc) kernels is also described, allowing complete basis set
benchmarks of modern range-separated hybrid functionals with either integer or fractional occupation
numbers. Finally, computation of atomic effective potentials at the local density or generalized
gradient approximation levels for the superposition of atomic potentials (SAP) approach [S. Lehtola,
J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 1593 (2019)] that has been shown to be a simple and efficient way to initialize
electronic structure calculations is described. The present numerical approach is shown to afford
beyond microhartree accuracy with a small number of numerical basis functions, and to reproduce
literature results for the ground states of atoms and their cations for $1 \leq Z \leq 86 $. Our results
indicate that the literature values deviate by up to 10 {\mu}Eh from the complete basis set limit.
The numerical scheme for the erfc kernel is shown to work by comparison to results from large Gaussian
basis set calculations from the literature. Spin-restricted ground states are reported for Hartree-Fock
and Hartree-Fock-Slater calculations with fractional occupations for $1 \leq Z \leq 118$.
