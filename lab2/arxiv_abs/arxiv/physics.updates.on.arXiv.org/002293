We analytically demonstrate the emergence of surface non-Hermitian boundary contributions that
appear in an extended form of the quantum Ehrenfest theorem and are crucial (although so far overlooked)
in the calculation of optical matrix elements that govern the optical transitions in semiconductors,
e.g. solar cells. Their inevitable existence, strongly related to the boundary conditions of a
given quantum mechanical problem, is far-reaching in the sense that they play a crucial role in the
dynamics of solar absorption and the corresponding optical transitions that follow. Processes
like optical transitions in localized and delocalized states and probabilities of intermolecular
transitions can be investigated through this generalized off-diagonal Ehrenfest theorem, employed
in the present work for the first time. An explicit demonstration of bulk-boundary correspondence
is shown, as the extended Ehrenfest theorem can be separated into bulk and surface contributions,
each behaving separately from the other, but at the end collaborating to give the correct time-derivative
of the desired optical element; this paves the way for future application of the extended theorem
to optical transitions in topologically nontrivial quantum systems. It is also demonstrated through
two examples in the literature as well as through a new example (of a system exhibiting the Integer
Quantum Hall Effect) that non-Hermitian boundary terms (that have been designated "topological
anomalies" in the mathematical literature) may be expected to be quantized, especially in topologically
nontrivial quantum systems but also in certain conventional ones.
