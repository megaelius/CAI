This article discusses applications of Bayesian machine learning for quantum molecular dynamics.
One particular formulation of quantum dynamics advocated here is in the form of a machine learning
simulator of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. If combined with the Bayesian statistics, such a simulator
allows one to obtain not only the quantum predictions but also the error bars of the dynamical results
associated with uncertainties of inputs (such as the potential energy surface or non-adiabatic
couplings) into the nuclear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Instead of viewing atoms as undergoing
dynamics on a given potential energy surface, Bayesian machine learning allows one to formulate
the problem as the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a non-parametric distribution of potential energy
surfaces that becomes conditioned by the desired dynamical properties (such as the experimental
measurements). Machine learning models of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation solutions can identify
the sensitivity of the dynamical properties to different parts of the potential surface, the collision
energy, angular momentum, external field parameters and basis sets used for the calculations.
This can be used to inform the design of efficient quantum dynamics calculations. Machine learning
models can also be used to correlate rigorous results with approximate calculations, providing
accurate interpolation of exact results. Finally, there is evidence that it is possible to build
Bayesian machine learning models capable of physically extrapolating the solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation. This is particularly valuable as such models could complement common discovery tools
to explore physical properties at Hamiltonian parameters not accessible by rigorous quantum calculations
or experiments, and potentially be used to accelerate the numerical integration of the nuclear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
