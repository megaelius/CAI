Jumping take-off in birds is an explosive behaviour with the goal of providing a rapid transition
from ground to airborne locomotion. An effective jump is predicated on the need to maintain dynamic
stability through the acceleration phase. The present study concerns understanding how birds
retain control of body attitude and trajectory during take-off. Cursory observation suggests
that stability is achieved with relatively little cost. However, analysis of the problem shows
that the stability margins during jumping are actually very small and that stability considerations
play a significant role in selection of appropriate jumping kinematics. We use theoretical models
to understand stability in prehensile take-off (from a perch) and also in non-prehensile take-off
(from the ground). The primary instability is tipping, defined as rotation of the centre of gravity
about the ground contact point. Tipping occurs when the centre of pressure falls outside the functional
foot. A contribution of the paper is the development of graphical tipping stability margins for
both centre of gravity location and acceleration angle. We show that the nose-up angular acceleration
extends stability bounds forward and is hence helpful in achieving shallow take-offs. The stability
margins are used to interrogate simulated take-offs of real birds using published experimental
kinematic data from a guinea fowl (ground take-off) and a diamond dove (perch take-off). For the
guinea fowl the initial part of the jump is stable, however simulations exhibit a stuttering instability
not observed experimentally that is probably due to absence of compliance in the idealised joints.
The diamond dove model confirms that the foot provides an active torque reaction during take-off,
extending the range of stable jump angles by around 45{\deg}.
