The interaction between surface waves and sea ice involves many complex physical phenomena such
as viscous damping, wave diffraction, and nonlinear effects. The combination of these phenomena,
together with considerable variability in ice configuration, ranging from viscous grease ice
slicks to large icebergs through closed drift ice and landfast ice, makes it challenging to develop
robust and accurate waves in ice models. In this context, a reason for the challenges modellers are
facing may lie in the mismatch between the relative scarcity of waves in ice data available for testing
theories, and the wide diversity of phenomena happening at sea. This lack of experimental data may
be explained, at least in part, by the high cost of waves in ice instruments. Therefore, development
of open source, low-cost, high-performance instrumentation may be a critical factor in helping
advance this field of research. Here, we present recent developments of a new generation of open
source waves in ice instruments featuring a high accuracy Inertial Motion Unit as well as GPS, on-board
processing power, solar panel, and Iridium communications. Those instruments are now being used
by several groups, and their simple and modular design allows them to be customized for specific
needs quickly and at reduced cost. Therefore, they may be an important factor in allowing more data
to be gathered in a cost-effective way, providing much-needed data to the waves in ice community.
This approach is here validated by presenting recent sea ice drift and wave activity data, and comparing
these results with those obtained with commercially available buoys. In addition, our design may
be used as a general platform for cost-effective development of other in-situ instruments with
similar requirements of low-power data logging, on-board computational power, and satellite
communications.
