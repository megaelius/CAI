Lagrangian tracking of particle pairs is of fundamental interest in a large number of environmental
applications dealing with contaminant dispersion and passive scalar mixing. The aim of the present
study is to extend the observations available in the literature on relative dispersion of fluid
particle pairs to wall-bounded turbulent flows, by means of particle pair tracking in direct numerical
simulations (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow. The mean-square change of separation between particle
pairs follows a clear ballistic regime at short times for all wall distances. The Eulerian structure
functions governing this short-time separation are characterised in the channel, and allow to
define a characteristic time scale for the ballistic regime, as well as a suitable normalisation
of the mean-square separation leading to an overall collapse for different wall distances. Through
fluid particle pair tracking backwards and forwards in time, the temporal asymmetry of relative
dispersion is illustrated. At short times, this asymmetry is linked to the irreversibility of turbulence,
as in previous studies on homogeneous isotropic flows. The influence of the initial separation
(distance and orientation) as well as the influence of mean shear are addressed. By decomposing
the mean-square separation into the dispersion by the fluctuating velocity field and by the average
velocity, it is shown that the influence of mean shear becomes important at early stages of dispersion
close to the wall but also near the channel centre. The relative dispersion tensor $\Delta_{ij}$
is also presented and particularly the sign and time evolution of the cross-term $\Delta_{xy}$
are discussed. Finally, a ballistic cascade model previously proposed for homogeneous isotropic
turbulence is adapted here to turbulent channel flows. Preliminary results are given and compared
to the DNS.
