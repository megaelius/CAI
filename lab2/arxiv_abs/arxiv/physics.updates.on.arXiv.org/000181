The physical features of distribution of the small dispersive coal dust particles and the adsorbed
radioactive chemical elements and their isotopes in the absorber with the granular filtering medium
with the cylindrical coal granules were researched in the case of the intensive air dust aerosol
stream flow through the iodine air filter (IAF). It was shown that, at the certain aerodynamic conditions
in the IAF, the generation of the acoustic oscillations is possible. It was found that the acoustic
oscillations generation results in an appearance of the standing acoustic waves of the air pressure
(density) in the IAF. In the case of the intensive blow of the air dust aerosol, it was demonstrated
that the standing acoustic waves have some strong influences on both: 1) the dynamics of small dispersive
coal dust particles movement and their accumulation in the IAF; 2) the oversaturation of the cylindrical
coal granules by the adsorbed radioactive chemical elements and their isotopes in the regions,
where the antinodes of the acoustic waves are positioned. Finally, we completed the comparative
analysis of the theoretical calculations with the experimental results, obtained for the cases
of: 1) the experimental aerodynamic modeling of physical processes of the absorbed radioactive
chemical elements and their isotopes distribution in the IAF; and 2) the gamma-activation spectroscopy
analysis of the absorbed radioactive chemical elements and their isotopes distribution in the
IAF. We made the innovative propositions on the necessary technical modifications with the purpose
to improve the IAF technical characteristics and increase its operational time at the nuclear power
plant (NPP), going from the completed precise characterization of the IAF parameters at the long
term operation.
