Standard unit of information Bit generates any natural process through discrete (yes-no) interactions,
including interactive macro impulses in classical physics and elementary micro impulses of quantum
interactions. The elementary interaction of random impulses measures (yes-no) probability events
according to Kolmogorov 1-0 law for random process. In natural interactive process, each impulse
step-down action cuts correlations of the process prior interactive events. This cuts the process
entropy defined by its probability memorizing the cutting entropy as information hidden in the
correlation. Memory freezes information impulse bit in the cutting correlation. The interactive
impulse reveals information as phenomenon of interaction. The interacting actions curve impulse
whose curvature creates asymmetry lowering energy cost for encoding qubits in memorized bit. Each
Bit is naturally extracted or erased at the cost of minimal energy and encoding information in the
interacting physical state by the impulse step-up action. The impulse sequential natural encoding
merges memory with the time of memorizing information and compensates the cutting cost by running
time intervals of encoding. The information process, preserving invariant impulse cutting information,
binds the inner impulse reversible microprocess and multiple impulses irreversible macroprocess
in information dynamics. The encoding process unites the information path functional integrating
observer geometrical cellular information structure which composes rotating helix of the sequencing
cells Bits. This natural encoding satisfied Landauer principle and compensates for the cost of
Maxwell Demon. Energy of specific interaction limits the universal code length and density. These
conditions and results validate computer simulation, multiple experiments in coding genetic
information, experimental encoding by spiking neurons, others.
