Modern CW or pulsed superconducting accelerators of megawatts beams require efficient RF sources
controllable in phase and power. It is desirable to have an individual RF power source with power
up to hundreds of kW for each Superconductive RF (SRF) cavity. For pulsed accelerators the pulse
duration in millisecond range is required. The efficiency of the traditional RF sources (klystrons,
IOTs, solid-state amplifiers) in comparison to magnetrons is lower and the cost of unit of RF power
is significantly higher. Typically, the cost of RF sources and their operation is a significant
part of the total project cost and operation. The magnetron-based RF sources with a cost of power
unit of 1-3 dollars per Watt would significantly reduce the capital and operation costs in comparison
with the traditional RF sources. This arouses interest in magnetron RF sources for use in modern
accelerators. A recently developed kinetic model describing the principle of magnetron operation
and subsequent experiments resulted in an innovative technique producing the "stimulated" generation
of magnetrons powered below the self-excitation threshold voltage. The magnetron operation in
this regime is stable, low noise, controllable in phase and power, and provides higher efficiency
than other types of RF power sources. It allows operation in CW and pulse modes (at large duty factor).
For pulsed operation this technique does not require pulse modulators to form RF pulses. It also
looks as a promising opportunity to extend magnetron life time. The developed technique, its experimental
verification and a brief explanation of the kinetic model substantiating the technique are presented
and discussed in this article.
