Spin models arise in the microscopic description of magnetic materials, where the macroscopic
characteristics are governed by exchange interactions among the constituent magnetic moments.
Recently, there has been a growing interest in complex systems with spin Hamiltonians, largely
due to the rich behaviors exhibited by such interactions at the macroscale. Along these lines, it
has been shown that certain classes of optimization problems involving large degrees of freedom
can be effectively mapped into classical spin models. In this vein, the respective extremum can
be found by identifying the ground state of the associated spin Hamiltonian. Here, we show both theoretically
and experimentally, that the cooperative interplay among vectorial electromagnetic modes in
coupled metallic nanolasers can be utilized as a means to emulate certain types of spin-like systems.
The ensuing spin exchange interactions are in general anisotropic, in a way similar to that encountered
in magnetic materials involving spin-orbit coupling. For some topologies, we find that these active
nanophotonic structures are governed by a classical XY Hamiltonian that exhibits two phases akin
to those associated with ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) materials. In addition,
we show that in certain configurations, the electromagnetic field distribution can undergo geometrical
frustration, depending on the lattice shape and the transverse resonant modes supported by the
individual cavity elements. Our results could pave the way towards a new scalable nanophotonic
platform to study spin exchange interactions, that can in turn be potentially exploited to investigate
more large-scale networks, emulate some magnetic materials, or to address a variety of optimization
problems.
