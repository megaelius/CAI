Various nonclassical and quantum phase properties of photon added then subtracted displaced Fock
state have been examined systematically and rigorously. Higher-order moments of the relevant
bosonic operators are computed to test the nonclassicality of the state of interest, which reduces
to various quantum states (having applications in quantum optics, metrology and information processing)
in different limits ranging from the coherent (classical) state to the Fock (most nonclassical)
states. The nonclassical features are discussed using Klyshko's, Vogel's, and Agarwal-Tara's
criteria as well as the criteria of lower- and higher-order antibunching, sub-Poissonian photon
statistics and squeezing. In addition, phase distribution function and quantum phase fluctuation
have been studied. These properties are examined for various combinations of number of photon addition
and/or subtraction and Fock parameter. The examination has revealed that photon addition generally
improves nonclassicality, and this advantage enhances for the large (small) values of displacement
parameter using photon subtraction (Fock parameter). The higher-order sub-Poissonian photon
statistics is only observed for the odd orders. In general, higher-order nonclassicality criteria
are found to detect nonclassicality even in the cases when corresponding lower-order criteria
failed to do so. Photon subtraction is observed to induce squeezing, but only large number of photon
addition can be used to probe squeezing for large values of displacement parameter. Further, photon
subtraction is found to alter the phase properties more than photon addition, while Fock parameter
has an opposite effect of the photon addition/subtraction. Finally, nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity
is also established using $Q$ function.
