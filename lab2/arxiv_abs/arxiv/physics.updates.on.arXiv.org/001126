We study the settling of rigid oblates in quiescent fluid using interface-resolved Direct Numerical
Simulations. In particular, an immersed boundary method is used to account for the dispersed solid
phase together with lubrication correction and collision models to account for short-range particle-particle
interactions. We consider semi-dilute suspensions of oblate particles with aspect ratio AR=1/3
and solid volume fractions $\phi=0.5\%-10\%$. The solid-to-fluid density ratio $R=1.5$ and the
Galileo number (i.e. the ratio between buoyancy and viscous forces) based on the diameter of a sphere
with equivalent volume $Ga=60$. With this choice of parameters, an isolated oblate falls vertically
with a steady wake with its broad side perpendicular to the gravity direction. At this $Ga$, the mean
settling speed of spheres is a decreasing function of the volume $\phi$ and is always smaller than
the terminal velocity of the isolated particle, $V_t$. On the contrary, we show here that the mean
settling speed of oblate particles increases with $\phi$ in dilute conditions and is $33\%$ larger
than $V_t$. At higher concentrations, the mean settling speed decreases becoming smaller than
the terminal velocity $V_t$ between $\phi=5\%$ and $10\%$. The increase of the mean settling speed
is due to the formation of particle clusters that for $\phi=0.5\%-1\%$ appear as columnar-like
structures. From the pair-distribution function we observe that it is most probable to find particle-pairs
almost vertically aligned. However, the pair-distribution function is non-negligible all around
the reference particle indicating that there is a substantial amount of clustering at radial distances
between 2 and $6c$ (with $c$ the polar radius of the oblate).
