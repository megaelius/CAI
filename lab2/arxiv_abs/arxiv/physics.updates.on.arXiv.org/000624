We formulate a new model for transport in stochastic media with long-range spatial correlations
where exponential attenuation (controlling the propagation part of the transport) becomes power
law. Direct transmission over optical distance $\tau(s)$, for fixed physical distance $s$, thus
becomes $(1+\tau(s)/a)^{-a}$, with standard exponential decay recovered when $a\to\infty$.
Atmospheric turbulence phenomenology for fluctuating optical properties rationalizes this
switch. Foundational equations for this generalized transport model are stated in integral form
for $d=1,2,3$ spatial dimensions. A deterministic numerical solution is developed in $d=1$ using
Markov Chain formalism, verified with Monte Carlo, and used to investigate internal radiation
fields. Standard two-stream theory, where diffusion is exact, is recovered when $a=\infty$. Differential
diffusion equations are not presently known when $a<\infty$, nor is the integro-differential
form of the generalized transport equation. Monte Carlo simulations are performed in $d=2$, as
a model for transport on random surfaces, to explore scaling behavior of transmittance $T$ when
transport optical thickness $\tau_\text{t} \gg 1$. Random walk theory correctly predicts $T \propto
\tau_\text{t}^{-\min\{1,a/2\}}$ in the absence of absorption. Finally, single scattering theory
in $d=3$ highlights the model's violation of angular reciprocity when $a<\infty$, a desirable
property at least in atmospheric applications. This violation is traced back to a key trait of generalized
transport theory, namely, that we must distinguish more carefully between two kinds of propagation:
one that ends in a virtual or actual detection, the other in a transition from one position to another
in the medium.
