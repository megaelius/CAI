This work presents an analytical formalism for the modal series expansions of the acoustic radiation
force and radiation torque experienced by a fluid viscous cylindrical object of arbitrary geometrical
cross-section placed near a planar rigid wall. A plane progressive wave field with an arbitrary
angle of incidence propagating in an inviscid fluid is assumed. Initially, an effective field incident
on the particle (including the principal incident field, the reflected wave-field from the boundary
and the scattered field from the image object) is defined. Subsequently, the incident effective
field is utilized in conjunction with the scattered one from the object, to obtain closed-form expansions
for the longitudinal and transversal force components, in addition to the axial torque component,
based on the scattering in the far-field. The obtained solutions involve the angle of incidence,
the modal coefficients of the scatterer and its image, and the particle-wall distance. Computations
are considered, and calculations exemplify the analysis with emphasis on changing the particle
size, the particle-wall distance and the angle of incidence. It is found that the object experiences
either an attractive or repulsive force directed toward or away from the boundary. Moreover, it
reverses its rotation around its center of mass depending on its size, particle-wall distance and
angle of incidence. Furthermore, radiation force and torque singularities occur (i.e., zero force
and torque) such that the cylinder becomes irresponsive to the linear and angular momenta transfer
yielded by the effective field. The exact formalism presented here using the multipole expansion
method, which is valid for any frequency range, could be used to validate other approaches using
purely numerical methods, or frequency-limiting approximate models such as the Rayleigh and the
Kirchhoff regimes.
