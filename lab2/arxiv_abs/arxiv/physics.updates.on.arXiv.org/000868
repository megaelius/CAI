We explain the force balance in flowing marine ice sheets and the ice shelves they often feed. Treating
ice as a viscous shear-thinning power law fluid, we develop an asymptotic (late-time) theory in
two cases $-$ the presence or absence of contact with sidewalls. The solution without sidewalls
is a simple generalisation of that found by Robison (JFM, 648, 363), allowing us to obtain the equilibrium
grounding line thickness using a simple computer model and to get an analytic approximation. For
laterally confined shelves, we obtain an asymptotic theory valid for long shelves and define when
this is. Our theory is based on the velocity profile across the channel being a generalised version
of Poiseuille flow, which works when lateral shear dominates the force balance. We conducted experiments
using a laboratory model for ice. This was an aqueous suspension of $0.5\%$ mass concentration xanthan,
yielding $n \approx 3.8$ (similar to ice). Our theories agreed extremely well with our experiments
for all relevant parameters (front position, thickness profile, lateral velocity profile, longitudinal
velocity gradient and grounding line thickness). This strongly suggests that we have understood
the dominant force balance in both types of ice shelf. In the real world, ice tongues are unlikely
to rapidly disintegrate but can be shortened until they no longer exist, at which point the sheet
becomes unstable and ultimately the grounding line should retreat above sea level. Prior to that
point, the flow of ice into it should not be speeded up and the grounding line should also not retreat,
assuming that only oceanic conditions change. However, laterally confined ice shelves experience
significant buttressing. If removed, this leads to a rapid speedup of the sheet and a much smaller
equilibrium grounding line thickness. Something similar may have occurred to the Larsen B ice shelf.
