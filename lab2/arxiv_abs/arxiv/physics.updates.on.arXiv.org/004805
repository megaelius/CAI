We study mean-field dynamo action in a background shear flow by employing pulsed renewing flows
with fixed kinetic helicity and nonzero correlation time ($\tau$). Here we make use of plane shearing
waves, which are time-dependent exact solutions to the Navier-Stokesequation as derived by Singh
\& Sridhar (2017), in our renovating flow model. This allows us to self-consistently include the
anisotropic effects of shear on the flow itself, which in turn governs the evolution of magnetic
fields. We derive an expression for the response tensor determining the growth of mean magnetic
field, and perform numerical integrations to explore the properties of its eigenvalues. Non-axisymmetric
modes of the mean magnetic field decay and hence are deemed as unimportant. Some key findings related
to the axisymmetric mean field dynamo are: (i) the growth rate ($\gamma$) and the wavenumber ($k_\ast$)
corresponding to the fastest growing mode show a non-monotonic behaviour with shear rate $S$ when
$\tau$ is comparable to the eddy turnover time $T$, in which case, we also find quenching of dynamo
when shear becomes too strong; (ii) at fixed $S$ and $\tau$, the growth rate first increases from
zero, reaches a maximum, and then decreases to turn negative at much larger wavenumbers, thus exhibiting
a high wavenumber cutoff; (iii) when $\tau/T\sim{\cal O}(1)$, the cycle period ($P_{\rm cyc}$)
of growing dynamo wave scales with shear as $P_{\rm cyc} \propto |S|^{-1}$ at small shear, and it
becomes nearly independent of shear when shear becomes too strong. This asymptotic behaviour at
weak and strong shear has implications for magnetic activity cycles of stars in recent observations.
Our study thus essentially generalizes the standard $\alpha \Omega$ (or $\alpha^2\Omega$) dynamo
as also the $\alpha$ effect is affected by shear and the modelled random flow has a finite memory.
