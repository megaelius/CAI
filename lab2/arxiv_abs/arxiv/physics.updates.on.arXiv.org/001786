We present the precision calibration of 35 Hamamatsu R11410-22 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with
xenon scintillation light centred near 175 nm. This particular PMT variant was developed specifically
for the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter experiment. A room-temperature xenon scintillation cell coupled
to a vacuum cryostat was used to study the full-face PMT response at both room and low temperature
$\textrm{($\sim$ -100$^\circ$C)}$, in particular to determine the quantum efficiency (QE) and
double photoelectron emission (DPE) probability in LZ operating conditions. For our sample with
an average QE of $\textrm{(32.4$\pm$2.9)%}$ at room temperature, we find a relative improvement
of $\textrm{(17.9$\pm$5.2)%}$ upon cooling (where uncertainty values refer to the sample standard
deviation). The mean DPE probability in response to single vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons is
$\textrm{(22.6$\pm$2.0)%}$ at low temperature; the DPE increase relative to room temperature,
measured here for the first time, was $\textrm{(12.2$\pm$3.9)%}$. Evidence of a small triple photoelectron
emission probability $\textrm{($\sim$0.6%)}$ has also been observed. Useful correlations are
established between these parameters and the QE as measured by the manufacturer. The single VUV
photon response is also measured for one ETEL D730/9829QB, a PMT with a more standard bialkali photocathode
used in the ZEPLIN-III experiment, for which we obtained a cold DPE fraction of $\textrm{(9.1$\pm$0.1)%}$.
Hence, we confirm that this effect is not restricted to the low-temperature bialkali photocathode
technology employed by Hamamatsu. This highlights the importance of considering this phenomenon
in the interpretation of data from liquid xenon scintillation and electroluminescence detectors,
and from many other optical measurements in this wavelength region.
