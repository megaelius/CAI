Runaways are suprathermal electrons having sufficiently high energy to be continuously accelerated
up to tens of MeV by a driving electric field [1]. Highly energetic runaway electron (RE) beams capable
of damaging the tokamak first wall can be observed after a plasma disruption [2]. Therefore, it is
of primary importance to fully understand their generation mechanisms in order to design mitigation
systems able to guarantee safe tokamak operations. In a previous work, [3], a test particle tracker
was introduced in the JOREK 3D non-linear MHD code and used for studying the electron confinement
during a simulated JET-like disruption. It was found in [3] that relativistic electrons are not
completely deconfined by the stochastic magnetic field taking place during the disruption thermal
quench (TQ). This is due to the reformation of closed magnetic surfaces at the beginning of the current
quench (CQ). This result was obtained neglecting the inductive electric field in order to avoid
the unrealistic particle acceleration which otherwise would have happened due to the absence of
collision effects. The present paper extends [3] analysing test electron dynamics in the same simulated
JET-like disruption using the complete electric field. For doing so, a simplified collision model
is introduced in the particle tracker guiding center equations. We show that electrons at thermal
energies can become RE during or promptly after the TQ due to a combination of three phenomena: a first
REs acceleration during the TQ due to the presence of a complex MHD-induced electric field, particle
reconfinement caused by the fast reformation of closed magnetic surfaces after the TQ and a secondary
acceleration induced by the CQ electric field.
