The purpose of this work is to develop viable procedures for verifying the applicability of personalized
dosimetry in computed tomography (CT) using Monte Carlo-based simulations. Mobile equipment
together with customized software was developed and used for rapid, non-invasive determination
of equivalent source models of CT scanners under clinical conditions. Standard and anthropomorphic
CT dose phantoms equipped with real-time CT dose probes at five representative positions were scanned.
The accumulated dose was measured during the scan at the five positions. ImpactMC, a Monte Carlo-based
CT dose software program, was used to simulate the scan. The necessary inputs were obtained from
the scan parameters, from the equivalent source models and from the material-segmented CT images
of the phantoms. Post-scan 3D dose distributions in the phantoms were simulated and the dose values
calculated at the five positions inside the phantom were compared to measured dose values. Initial
results were obtained by means of a General Electric Optima CT 660 and a Toshiba (Canon) Aquilion
ONE. In general, the measured and calculated dose values were within relative uncertainties that
had been estimated to be less than 10%. The procedures developed, which allow the post-CT scan dose
to be measured and calculated at five points inside anthropomorphic phantoms, were found to be viable
and rapid. The procedures are applicable to any scanner type under clinical conditions. Results
show that the procedures are well suited for verifying the applicability of personalized CT dosimetry
based on post-scan Monte Carlo calculations.
