This study compares equity in 112 first-semester college physics courses from 17 institutions
using three different operationalizations of equity. The courses used a mix of traditional and
collaborative learning pedagogies. We disaggregated the collaborative-learning courses by
those that use Learning Assistants (LA) to support small-group activities and those that do not.
To create a more complete picture of whether these classroom contexts supported equity, we compared
student outcomes using three different operationalizations of equity (Equity of Outcomes, Equity
of Learning, and Equity of Individuality). The analysis focused on student's scores on concept
inventories administered as pretests and posttests using hierarchical linear models. The multilevel
data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes (LASSO) database and includes student-level
data (demographics, pretest, and posttest scores) from 5,959 students and course-level data (use
of collaborative learning and LAs) from 112 courses. Findings indicate that more learning occurs
in courses that use collaborative learning with and without LAs than in traditional courses but
that the gaps in absolute gains remained constant across the different types of instruction. These
two findings lead to mixed equity results in which some operationalizations of equity are achieved
and others are not. We discuss the implications of these mixed findings and the potential for misdirection
and confusion that they create. Our conclusion is that researchers should identify their goals
and operationalize equity prior to analyzing their data and they should clearly communicate these
ideas in their publications.
