We consider plasmonic metasurfaces constituted by an arbitrary periodic arrangement of spherical
metallic nanoparticles. Each nanoparticle supports three degenerate dipolar localized surface
plasmon (LSP) resonances. In the regime where the interparticle distance is much smaller than the
optical or near-infrared wavelength associated with the LSPs, the latter couple through the dipole-dipole
interaction and form collective plasmonic modes which extend over the whole metasurface. Within
a Hamiltonian model which we solve exactly, we derive general expressions which enable us to extract
analytically the quasistatic plasmonic dispersion for collective modes polarized within the
plane and perpendicular to the plane of the metasurface. Importantly, our approach allows us not
only to consider arbitrary Bravais lattices, but also non-Bravais two-dimensional metacrystals
featuring nontrivial topological properties, such as, e.g., the honeycomb or Lieb lattices. Additionally,
using an open quantum system approach, we consider perturbatively the coupling of the collective
plasmons to both photonic and particle-hole environments, which lead, respectively, to radiative
and nonradiative frequency shifts and damping rates, for which we provide closed-form expressions.
The radiative frequency shift, when added to the quasistatic dispersion relation, provides an
approximate analytical description of the fully retarded band structure of the collective plasmons.
While it is tempting to make a direct analogy between the various systems which we consider and their
electronic tight-binding equivalents, we critically examine how the long-range retarded and
anisotropic nature of the dipole--dipole interaction may quantitatively and qualitatively modify
the underlying band structures and discuss their experimental observability.
