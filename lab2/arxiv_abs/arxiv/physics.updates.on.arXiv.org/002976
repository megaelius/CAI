The predictability of eight southern European tropical-like cyclones, seven of which Medicanes,
is studied evaluating ECMWF operational ensemble forecasts against operational analysis data.
Forecast cyclone trajectories are compared to the cyclone trajectory in the analysis by means of
a dynamic time warping technique, which allows to find a match in terms of their overall spatio-temporal
similarity. Each storm is treated as an object and its forecasts are analysed using metrics that
describe intensity, symmetry, compactness, and upper-level thermal structure. This object-based
approach allows to focus on specific storm features, while tolerating their shifts in time and space
to some extent. The compactness and symmetry of the storms are generally underpredicted, especially
at long lead times. However, forecast accuracy tends to strongly improve at short lead times, indicating
that the ECMWF ensemble forecast model can adequately reproduce Medicanes, albeit only few days
in advance. In particular, late forecasts which have been initialised when the cyclone has already
developed are distinctly more accurate than earlier forecasts in predicting its kinematic and
thermal structure, confirming previous findings of high sensitivity of Medicane simulations
to initial conditions. Findings reveal a markedly non-gradual evolution of ensemble forecasts
with lead time. Specifically, a rapid increase in the probability of cyclone occurrence ("forecast
jump") is seen in most cases, generally between 5 and 7 days lead time. Jumps are also found for ensemble
median and/or spread for storm thermal structure forecasts. This behaviour is compatible with
the existence of predictability barriers. On the other hand, storm position forecasts often exhibit
a consistent spatial distribution of storm position uncertainty and bias between consecutive
forecasts.
