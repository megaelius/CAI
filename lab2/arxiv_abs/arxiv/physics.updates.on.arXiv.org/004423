This work explored an element-wise approach to model transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound
(TcMRgFUS) thermal ablation, a noninvasive approach to neurosurgery. Each element of the phased
array transducer was simulated individually and could be simultaneously loaded into computer
memory, allowing for rapid calculation of the pressure field for different phase offsets used for
beam steering and aberration correction. We simulated the pressure distribution for 431 sonications
in 32 patients, applied the phase and magnitude values used during treatment, and estimated the
resulting temperature rise. We systematically varied the relationship between CT-derived skull
density and the acoustic attenuation and sound speed to obtain the best agreement between the predictions
and MR temperature imaging (MRTI). The optimization was validated with simulations of 396 sonications
from 40 additional treatments. After optimization, the predicted and measured heating agreed
well (R2: 0.74 patients 1-32; 0.71 patients 33-72). The dimensions and obliquity of the heating
in the simulated temperature maps correlated well with the MRTI (R2: 0.62, 0.74 respectively),
but the measured heating was more spatially diffuse. The energy needed to achieve ablation varied
by an order of magnitude (3.3-36.1 kJ). While this element-wise approach requires more computation
time up front, it can be performed in parallel. It allows for rapid calculation of the three-dimensional
heating at the focus for different phase and magnitude values on the array. We also show how this approach
can be used to optimize the relationship between CT-derived skull density and acoustic properties.
While the relationships found here need further validation in a larger patient population, these
results demonstrate the promise of this approach to model TcMRgFUS.
