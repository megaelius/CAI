Although the many forms of modern social media have become major channels for the dissemination
of information, they are becoming overloaded because of the rapidly-expanding number of information
feeds. We analyze the expanding user-generated content in Sina Weibo, the largest micro-blog site
in China, and find evidence that popular messages often follow a mechanism that differs from that
found in the spread of disease, in contrast to common believe. In this mechanism, an individual with
more friends needs more repeated exposures to spread further the information. Moreover, our data
suggest that in contrast to epidemics, for certain messages the chance of an individual to share
the message is proportional to the fraction of its neighbours who shared it with him/her. Thus the
greater the number of friends an individual has the greater the number of repeated contacts needed
to spread the message, which is a result of competition for attention. We model this process using
a fractional susceptible infected recovered (FSIR) model, where the infection probability of
a node is proportional to its fraction of infected neighbors. Our findings have dramatic implications
for information contagion. For example, using the FSIR model we find that real-world social networks
have a finite epidemic threshold. This is in contrast to the zero threshold that conventional wisdom
derives from disease epidemic models. This means that when individuals are overloaded with excess
information feeds, the information either reaches out the population if it is above the critical
epidemic threshold, or it would never be well received, leading to only a handful of information
contents that can be widely spread throughout the population.
