Optical metasurfaces have emerged as a new generation of building blocks for multi-functional
optics. Design and realization of metasurface elements place ever-increasing demands on accurate
assessment of phase alterations introduced by complex nanoantenna arrays, a process referred
to as quantitative phase imaging. Despite considerable effort, the widefield (non-scanning)
phase imaging that would approach resolution limits of optical microscopy and indicate the response
of a single nanoantenna still remains a challenge. Here, we report on a new strategy in incoherent
holographic imaging of metasurfaces, in which unprecedented spatial resolution and light sensitivity
are achieved by taking full advantage of the polarization selective control of light through the
geometric (Pancharatnam-Berry) phase. The measurement is carried out in an inherently stable
common-path setup composed of a standard optical microscope and an add-on imaging module. Phase
information is acquired from the mutual coherence function attainable in records created in broadband
spatially incoherent light by the self-interference of scattered and leakage light coming from
the metasurface. In calibration measurements, the phase was mapped with the precision and spatial
background noise better than 0.01 rad and 0.05 rad, respectively. The imaging excels at the high
spatial resolution that was demonstrated experimentally by the precise amplitude and phase restoration
of vortex metalenses and a metasurface grating with 833 lines/mm. Thanks to superior light sensitivity
of the method, we demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, the widefield measurement of
the phase altered by a single nanoantenna, while maintaining the precision well below 0.15 rad.
