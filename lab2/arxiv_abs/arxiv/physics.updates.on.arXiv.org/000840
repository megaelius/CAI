Integrated-photonics microchips now enable a range of advanced functionalities for high-coherence
applications such as data transmission, highly optimized physical sensors, and harnessing quantum
states, but with cost, efficiency, and portability much beyond tabletop experiments. Through
high-volume semiconductor processing built around advanced materials there exists an opportunity
for integrated devices to impact applications cutting across disciplines of basic science and
technology. Here we show how to synthesize the absolute frequency of a lightwave signal, using integrated
photonics to implement lasers, system interconnects, and nonlinear frequency comb generation.
The laser frequency output of our synthesizer is programmed by a microwave clock across 4 THz near
1550 nm with 1 Hz resolution and traceability to the SI second. This is accomplished with a heterogeneously
integrated III/V-Si tunable laser, which is guided by dual dissipative-Kerr-soliton frequency
combs fabricated on silicon chips. Through out-of-loop measurements of the phase-coherent, microwave-to-optical
link, we verify that the fractional-frequency instability of the integrated photonics synthesizer
matches the $7.0*10^{-13}$ reference-clock instability for a 1 second acquisition, and constrain
any synthesis error to $7.7*10^{-15}$ while stepping the synthesizer across the telecommunication
C band. Any application of an optical frequency source would be enabled by the precision optical
synthesis presented here. Building on the ubiquitous capability in the microwave domain, our results
demonstrate a first path to synthesis with integrated photonics, leveraging low-cost, low-power,
and compact features that will be critical for its widespread use.
