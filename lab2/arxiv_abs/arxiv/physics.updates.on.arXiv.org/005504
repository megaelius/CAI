The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic,
sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting
an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large
reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland
China, the scaling law $t^{\mu}$ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents $\mu=2.1\pm0.3$.
The universality of this behavior indicates that despite social, regional, demographical, geographical,
and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated
by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that
the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete
the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine
of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation
policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed
scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical
data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic,
unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction
number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature
of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial
fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment
strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future
outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.
