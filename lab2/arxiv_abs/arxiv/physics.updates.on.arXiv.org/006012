Hyperpolarized water can be a valuable aid in protein NMR, leading to amide group 1H polarizations
that are orders of magnitude larger than their thermal counterparts. Suitable procedures can exploit
this to deliver 2D 1H-15N correlations with good resolution and enhanced sensitivity. These enhancements
depend on the exchange rates between the amides and the water, thereby yielding diagnostic information
about solvent accessibility. This study applied this HyperW method to four proteins exhibiting
a gamut of exchange behaviors: PhoA4, an unfolded 122-residue fragment; barstar, a fully folded
ribonuclease inhibitor; R17, a 13.3 kDa system possessing folded and unfolded forms under slow
interconversion; and drkN SH3, a protein domain whose folded and unfolded forms interchange rapidly
and with temperature-dependent population ratios. For PhoA4 HyperW sensitivity enhancements
were larger than 300-fold, as expected for an unfolded protein sequence. Though fully folded barstar
also exhibited substantial enhancements; these, however, were not uniform, and according to CLEANEX
experiments reflected the solvent-exposed residues. R17 showed the expected superposition of
100-fold enhancements for its unfolded form, coexisting with more modest folded counterparts.
Unexpected, however, was the behavior of drkN SH3, for which HyperW enhanced the unfolded but even
more certain folded protein sites. These preferential enhancements were repeatedly and reproducibly
observed; a number of explanations including three-site exchange magnetization transfers between
water, unfolded and folded states; cross-correlated relaxation processes from hyperpolarized
structural waters and labile sidechain protons; and the possibility that faster solvent exchange
rates characterize certain folded sites over their unfolded counterparts are considered to account
for them.
