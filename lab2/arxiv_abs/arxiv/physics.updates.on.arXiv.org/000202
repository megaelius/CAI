We present an efficient computational approach to perform real-space electronic structure calculations
using an adaptive higher-order finite-element discretization of Kohn-Sham density-functional
theory (DFT). To this end, we develop an a-priori mesh adaption technique to construct a close to
optimal finite-element discretization of the problem. We further propose an efficient solution
strategy for solving the discrete eigenvalue problem by using spectral finite-elements in conjunction
with Gauss-Lobatto quadrature, and a Chebyshev acceleration technique for computing the occupied
eigenspace. The proposed approach has been observed to provide a staggering 100-200 fold computational
advantage over the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. Using the proposed solution procedure,
we investigate the computational efficiency afforded by higher-order finite-element discretization
of the Kohn-Sham DFT problem. Our studies suggest that staggering computational savings of the
order of 1000 fold relative to linear finite-elements can be realized, for both all-electron and
local pseudopotential calculations. On all the benchmark systems studied, we observe diminishing
returns in computational savings beyond the sixth-order for accuracies commensurate with chemical
accuracy. A comparative study of the computational efficiency of the proposed higher-order finite-element
discretizations suggests that the performance of finite-element basis is competing with the plane-wave
discretization for non-periodic local pseudopotential calculations, and compares to the Gaussian
basis for all-electron calculations within an order of magnitude. Further, we demonstrate the
capability of the proposed approach to compute the electronic structure of a metallic system containing
1688 atoms using modest computational resources, and good scalability of the present implementation
up to 192 processors.
