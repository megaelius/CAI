We consider the Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning (EBC) in the cerebellum via repeated presentation
of paired conditioned stimulus (tone) and unconditioned stimulus (airpuff), and investigate
the effect of diverse temporal recoding of granule (GR) cells on the EBC by varying the connection
probability $p_c$ from Golgi to GR cells. For an optimal value of $p_c^*~(=0.029)$, individual
GR cells exhibit diverse spiking patterns which are well- or ill-matched with the unconditioned
stimulus. Then, these diversely-recoded signals via parallel-fibers (PFs) from the GR cells are
effectively depressed by the error-teaching signals via climbing fibers (CFs) from the inferior
olive. Synaptic weights at well-matched PF-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses of active GR cells are strongly
depressed via strong long-term depression (LTD), while practically no LTD occurs at ill-matched
PF-PC synapses. This kind of "effective" depression at PF-PC synapses coordinates firings of PCs
effectively, which then exert effective inhibitory coordination on cerebellar nucleus neuron
[which evokes conditioned response (CR; eyeblink)]. When the learning trial passes a threshold,
acquisition of CR begins. In this case, the timing degree ${\cal T}_d$ of CR becomes good due to presence
of ill-matched spiking group which plays a role of protection barrier for the timing. With further
increase in the trial, strength $\cal S$ of CR increases due to strong LTD in the well-matched spiking
group. Thus, the learning efficiency degree ${\cal L}_e$ (taking into consideration both timing
and strength of CR) for the CR increases with learning trial, and eventually it becomes saturated.
By changing $p_c$ from $p_c^*$, we also investigate the effect of diverse spiking patterns of GR
cells on the EBC. It is this found that, the more diverse in temporal recoding of GR cells, the more
effective in motor learning for the Pavlovian EBC.
