We consider the accuracy of slender body theory in approximating the force exerted by a thin fiber
on the surrounding viscous fluid when the fiber velocity is prescribed. We term this the slender
body inverse problem, as it is known that slender body theory converges to a well-posed PDE solution
when the force is prescribed and the fiber velocity is unknown. From a PDE perspective, the slender
body inverse problem is simply the Dirichlet problem for the Stokes equations, but from an approximation
perspective, nonlocal slender body theory exhibits high wavenumber instabilities which complicate
analysis. Here we consider two methods for regularizing the slender body approximation: spectral
truncation and the $\delta$-regularization of Tornberg and Shelley (2004). For a straight, periodic
fiber with constant radius $\epsilon>0$, we explicitly calculate the spectrum of the operator
mapping fiber velocity to force for both the PDE and the approximations. We show that the spectrum
of the original slender body approximation agrees closely with the PDE solution at low wavenumbers
but differs at high frequencies, allowing us to define a truncated approximation with a wavenumber
cutoff $\sim1/\epsilon$. For both the truncated and $\delta$-regularized approximations, we
obtain similar convergence results to the PDE solution as $\epsilon\to0$: a fiber velocity with
$H^1$ regularity gives $O(\epsilon)$ convergence, while a fiber velocity with at least $H^2$ regularity
yields $O(\epsilon^2)$ convergence. Moreover, we determine the dependence of the $\delta$-regularized
error estimate on the regularization parameter $\delta$.
