Illumination of colloid sphere monolayers by circularly polarized beams enables the fabrication
of concave patterns consisting of circular nanohole miniarrays that can be transferred into convex
metal nanoparticle patterns via a lift-off procedure. Unique spectral and near-field properties
are achievable by tuning the geometry of the central nanoring and quadrumer of slightly rotated
satellite nanocrescents and by selecting those azimuthal orientations that promote localized
plasmon resonances. The spectral and near-field effects of hexagonal patterns made of uniform
gold nanorings and nanocrescents, that can be prepared by transferring masks fabricated by a perpendicularly
and obliquely incident single homogeneous circularly polarized beam, were studied to uncover
the supported localized plasmonic modes. Artificial rectangular patterns made of a singlet nanoring
and singlet nanocrescent as well as quadrumer of four nanocrescents were investigated to analyze
the role of nano-object interactions and lattice type. It was proven that all nanophotonical phenomena
are governed by the azimuthal orientation independent localized resonance on the nanorings and
by the C2, C1 and U resonances on the nanocrescents in case of $\bar{E}$-field oscillation direction
perpendicular and parallel to their symmetry axes. The interaction between localized surface
plasmon resonances on individual nano-objects is weak, whereas scattered photonic modes have
a perturbative role at the Rayleigh anomaly only on the larger periodic rectangular pattern of miniarrays.
Considerable fluorescence enhancement of dipolar emitters is achievable at spectral locations
promoting the C and U resonances on the composing nano-objects.
