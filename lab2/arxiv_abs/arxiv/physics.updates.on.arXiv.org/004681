The determination of the neutrino mass is an open issue in modern particle physics and astrophysics.
The direct mass measurement is the only theory-unrelated experimental tool capable to probe such
quantity. The HOLMES experiment aims to measure the end-point energy of the electron capture (EC)
decay of $^{163}$Ho with a statistical sensitivity on the neutrino mass as low as $\sim 1$ eV/c$^2$.
In order to acquire the large needed statistics, by keeping the pile-up contribution as low as possible,
1024 transition edge sensors (TESs) with high energy and time resolutions will be employed. Microcalorimeter
and bolometer arrays based on transition edge sensor with thousands of pixels are under development
for several space-based and ground-based applications, including astrophysics, nuclear and
particle physics, and materials science. The common necessary challenge is to develop pratical
multiplexing techniques in order to simplify the cryogenics and readout systems. Despite the various
multiplexing variants which are being developed have been successful, new approaches are needed
to enable scaling to larger pixel counts and faster sensors, as requested for HOLMES, reducing also
the cost and complexity of readout. A very novel technique that meets all of these requirements is
based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled to radio-frequency Superconducting Quantum
Interference Devices, in which the the changes in the TES input current is tranduced to a change in
phase of a microwave signal. In this work we introduce the basics of this technique, the design and
development of the first two-channel read out system and its performances with the first TES detectors
specifically designed for HOLMES. In the last part we explain how to extend this approach scaling
to 1024 pixels.
