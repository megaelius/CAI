The self-gravitational correction to a localized spherically symmetric static energy distribution
is obtained from an upgraded Newtonian model which is energetically self-consistent, and is also
obtained from the Birkhoff-theorem extension of the unique "Newtonian" form of the free-space
Schwarzschild metric into the interior region of its self-gravitationally corrected source.
The two approaches yield identical results, which include a strict prohibition on the gravitational
redshift factor ever being other than finite, real and positive. Consequently, the self-gravitationally
corrected energy within a sphere of radius r is bounded by r times the "Planck force", namely the fourth
power of c divided by G. Even in the absence of spherical symmetry, the same bound, to within a factor
of two, is shown to apply. That energy bound rules out any physical singularity at the Schwarzschild
radius, and it also cuts off the mass deviation of any interacting quantum virtual particle at the
Planck mass. Because quantum uncertainty makes the minimum energy of a quantum field infinite,
such a field's self-gravitationally corrected energy essentially attains the Planck force times
that field's boundary radius r. Roughly estimating r as c times the age of the universe yields a "dark
energy" density of 1.7 joules per cubic kilometer. But if r is put to the Planck length appropriate
to the birth of the universe, that energy density changes to the enormous Planck unit value, which
could quite conceivably drive primordial "inflation". The density of "dark energy" decreases
as the universe expands, but more slowly than the density of ordinary matter decreases. Its evolution
suggests "dark energy" has inhomogeneities, which may be "dark matter".
