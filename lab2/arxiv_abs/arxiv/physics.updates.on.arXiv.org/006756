We present a deep learning approach to produce highly accurate predictions of macroscopic physical
properties of solid crystals. Since the distribution function of the total energy would enable
a thorough understanding of the macroscopic properties for alloys and magnetic systems, surrogate
deep learning models can replace first principle calculations to speed up each sample from the total
energy distribution function. However, neural network models lose accuracy with respect to first
principle calculations and this affects the reliability of the estimate. Here, we focus on reducing
the uncertainty of multitasking neural network models to simultaneously predict physical properties
of alloys. The uncertainty is reduced relying on the physical correlation of the magnetic moment
with total energy and charge density. These physical quantities mutually serve as constraints
during the training of the multitasking deep learning model, which leads to more reliable deep learning
models because the physics is also learned correctly. We present numerical experiments for two
types of binary alloys: copper-gold and iron-platinum. The dataset comprises information about
total energy, charge density and magnetic moment (for magnetizable materials) computed via first
principle codes for 32,000 configurations which differ per composition to properly span the entire
state space. Results show that multitasking neural networks estimate the material properties
for a specific state space hundreds of times faster than the first principle codes used as a reference.
Moreover, the inclusion of the magnetic moment as a physical constraint for iron-platinum significantly
reduces the uncertainty of the predictions by damping the fluctuations of the predictive performance
with respect to different validation splittings of the dataset.
