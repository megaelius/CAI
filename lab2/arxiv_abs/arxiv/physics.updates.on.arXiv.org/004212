We investigate the Sun-Earth dynamics of a set of 38 well-observed Coronal Mass Ejections(CMEs)
using data from the STEREO, SOHO missions and WIND instrument. We seek to quantify the relative contributions
of Lorentz force and aerodynamic drag on their propagation. The CMEs are 3D reconstructed using
the Graduated Cylindrical Shell(GCS) model to derive observed CME parameters.Using a microphysical
prescription of the drag coefficient,we find that solar wind aerodynamic drag adequately accounts
for the dynamics of the fastest CMEs from as low as 3.5 Rs. For relatively slower CMEs, however, we
find that when the drag-based model is initiated below the distances ranging from 12 to 50 Rs,the
observed CME trajectories cannot be accounted for.This suggests that aerodynamic drag force dominates
the dynamics of slower CMEs only above these heights.To investigate CME dynamics below the heights
where aerodynamic drag dominates, we consider the Torus Instability model for the driving Lorentz
force. We find that for fast CMEs,Lorentz forces become negligible in comparison to aerodynamic
drag as early as 3.5-4 Rs.For slow CMEs, however, they become negligible only by 12-50 Rs.This justifies
the success of the drag-only model for fast CMEs. In case of slow CMEs, the Lorentz force is only slightly
smaller than the drag force even beyond 12-50 Rs.For these slow events,our results suggest that
some of the magnetic flux carried by CMEs might be expended in expansion or heating. These dissipation
effects might be important in describing the propagation of slower CMEs. To the best of our knowledge,this
is the first systematic study in this regard using a diverse CME sample. A physical understanding
of the forces that affect CME propagation and how they compare with each other at various heliocentric
distances is an important ingredient in building tools for describing and predicting CME trajectories.
