Despite their well-known limitations, RANS models remain the most commonly employed tool for modeling
turbulent flows in engineering practice. RANS models are predicated on the solution of the RANS
equations, but these equations involve an unclosed term, the Reynolds stress tensor, which must
be modeled. The Reynolds stress tensor is often modeled as an algebraic function of mean flow field
variables and turbulence variables. This introduces a discrepancy between the Reynolds stress
tensor predicted by the model and the exact Reynolds stress tensor. This discrepancy can result
in inaccurate mean flow field predictions. In this paper, we introduce a data-informed approach
for arriving at Reynolds stress models with improved predictive performance. Our approach relies
on learning the components of the Reynolds stress discrepancy tensor associated with a given Reynolds
stress model in the mean strain-rate tensor eigenframe. These components are typically smooth
and hence simple to learn using state-of-the-art machine learning strategies and regression techniques.
Our approach automatically yields Reynolds stress models that are symmetric, and it yields Reynolds
stress models that are both Galilean and frame invariant provided the inputs are themselves Galilean
and frame invariant. To arrive at computable models of the discrepancy tensor, we employ feed-forward
neural networks and an input space spanning the integrity basis of the mean strain-rate tensor,
the mean rotation-rate tensor, the mean pressure gradient, and the turbulent kinetic energy gradient,
and we introduce a framework for dimensional reduction of the input space to further reduce computational
cost. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for data-informed
Reynolds stress closure for a suite of turbulent flow problems of increasing complexity.
