The purpose of this work is to propose a framework for the benchmarking of EEG amplifiers, headsets,
and electrodes providing objective recommendation for a given application. The framework covers:
data collection paradigm, data analysis, and statistical framework. To illustrate, data was collected
from 12 different devices totaling up to 6 subjects per device. Two data acquisition protocols were
implemented: a resting-state protocol eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC), and an Auditory Evoked
Potential (AEP) protocol. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on alpha band (EO/EC) and Event Related
Potential (ERP) were extracted as objective quantification of physiologically meaningful information.
Then, visual representation, univariate statistical analysis, and multivariate model were performed
to increase results interpretability. Objective criteria show that the spectral SNR in alpha does
not provide much discrimination between systems, suggesting that the acquisition quality might
not be of primary importance for spectral and specifically alpha-based applications. On the contrary,
AEP SNR proved much more variable stressing the importance of the acquisition setting for ERP experiments.
The multivariate analysis identified some individuals and some systems as independent statistically
significant contributors to the SNR. It highlights the importance of inter-individual differences
in neurophysiological experiments (sample size) and suggests some device might objectively be
superior to others when it comes to ERP recordings. However, the illustration of the proposed benchmarking
framework suffers from severe limitations including small sample size and sound card jitter in
the auditory stimulations. While these limitations hinders a definite ranking of the evaluated
hardware, we believe the proposed benchmarking framework to be a modest yet valuable contribution
to the field.
