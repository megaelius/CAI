High-brightness electron beams provided by modern accelerators require several measures to preserve
their high quality and to avoid instabilities. The mitigation of the impact of residual ions is one
of these measures. It is particularly important if high bunch charges in combination with high repetition
rates are aimed for. This is because ions can be trapped in the strong negative electrical potential
of the electron beam causing emittance blow-up, increased beam halo and longitudinal and transverse
instabilities. Over the last decades three ion-clearing strategies have been applied to counteract
the degrading impact of the ions on the electron beam. These strategies are installation of clearing
electrodes, introduction of gaps in filling pattern and beam shaking. Currently, their merit as
clearing strategies for the next generation of high brightness accelerators such as energy recovery
linacs (ERLs) are under intensive investigations by means of numerical and experimental studies.
Of particular interest in this context is the performance of multi-purpose electrodes, which are
designed such that they allow for a simultaneous ion-clearing and beam-position monitoring. Such
electrodes will be installed in the bERLinPro facility. In this paper, we present numerical studies
for the behavior of ions generated by electron bunches while passing through the field of clearing
electrodes. The objective is to investigate the ion motion towards the electrodes and to study under
which circumstances and up to which ratio an equilibrium between ion-generation and ion-clearing
is established. Hereby, several ion species and configurations of electrodes are considered in
combination with typical beam parameters of high-brightness electron accelerators. Furthermore,
we present detailed numerical studies of the performance of multi-purpose clearing electrodes
planned for bERLinPro.
