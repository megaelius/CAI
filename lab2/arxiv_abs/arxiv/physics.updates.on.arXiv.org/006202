OH airglow is an important nocturnal emission of the Earth's mesopause region. As it is chemiluminescent
radiation in a thin medium, the population distribution over the various roto-vibrational OH energy
levels of the electronic ground state is not in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In order
to better understand these non-LTE effects, we studied hundreds of OH lines in a high-quality mean
spectrum based on observations with the high-resolution Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph
at Cerro Paranal in Chile. Our derived populations cover vibrational levels between v = 3 and 9, rotational
levels up to N = 24, and individual $\Lambda$-doublet components when resolved. As the reliability
of these results critically depends on the Einstein-A coefficients used, we tested six different
sets and found clear systematic errors in all of them, especially for Q-branch lines and individual
$\Lambda$-doublet components. In order to minimise the deviations in the populations for the same
upper level, we used the most promising coefficients from Brooke et al. (2016) and further improved
them with an empirical correction approach. The resulting rotational level populations show a
clear bimodality for each v, which is characterised by a probably fully thermalised cold component
and a hot population with rotational temperatures between about 700 (v = 9) and 7,000 K (v = 4). The
latter causes non-LTE contributions at low N, which can be estimated quite robustly based on the
two-temperature model. The bimodality is also clearly indicated by the different dependence of
the populations on changes in the effective height of the OH emission layer.
