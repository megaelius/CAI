Designing a thin film structure often begins with choosing a film deposition method that employs
a specific primary process by which chemical species are formed and transported. In other words,
a film deposition system in which two complementary deposition methods are hybridized should lead
to new ways of designing thin film structures with structural complexity tailored at a level that
has never been envisioned.This premise inspired us to uniquely combine atomic layer deposition
(ALD) and magnetron sputtering (SPU) within a single deposition chamber; the combined film deposition
system is referred to as sputtering atomic layer augmented deposition (SALAD). SALAD allows us
to take full advantages of both ALDs precise and accurate precursor delivery and SPUs versatility
in choices of chemical elements. A SALAD system was designed based on knowledge obtained by computational
fluid dynamics with the goal of conceiving a film deposition system that satisfied deposition conditions
distinctive for both ALD and SPU, and a prototype SALAD system was assembled by employing off-the-shelf
vacuum components.A s a demonstration, the SALAD system was utilized to deposit a unique nanocomposite
made of a stack of aluminum oxide thin films by ALD and copper thin films by SPU, AlOx-Cu dielectric-metal
(ACDM) nanocomposite thin films, on Si and glass substrates. Spectroscopic reflectivity collected
on ACDM nanocomposite thin films shows unique dispersion features to which conventional effective
medium theories used for describing optical properties of composites made of a dielectric host
that contains metallic inclusions do not seem to simply apply.
