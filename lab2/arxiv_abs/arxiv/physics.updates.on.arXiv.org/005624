With the emergence of new photonic and plasmonic materials with optimized properties as well as
advanced nanofabrication techniques, nanophotonic devices are now capable of providing solutions
to global challenges in energy conversion, information technologies, chemical/biological sensing,
space exploration, quantum computing, and secure communication. Addressing grand challenges
poses inherently complex, multi-disciplinary problems with a manifold of stringent constraints
in conjunction with the required system's performance. Conventional optimization techniques
have long been utilized as powerful tools to address multi-constrained design tasks. One example
is so-called topology optimization that has emerged as a highly successful architect for the advanced
design of non-intuitive photonic structures. Despite many advantages, this technique requires
substantial computational resources and thus has very limited applicability to highly constrained
optimization problems within high-dimensions parametric space. In our approach, we merge the
topology optimization method with machine learning algorithms such as adversarial autoencoders
and show substantial improvement of the optimization process by providing unparalleled control
of the compact design space representations. By enabling efficient, global optimization searches
within complex landscapes, the proposed compact hyperparametric representations could become
crucial for multi-constrained problems. The proposed approach could enable a much broader scope
of the optimal designs and data-driven materials synthesis that goes beyond photonic and optoelectronic
applications.
