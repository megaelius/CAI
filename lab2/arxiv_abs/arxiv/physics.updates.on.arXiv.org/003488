Purpose: Microscopic fractional anisotropy ({\mu}FA) can disentangle microstructural information
from orientation dispersion. While double diffusion encoding (DDE) MRI methods are widely used
to extract accurate {\mu}FA, it has only recently been proposed that powder-averaged single diffusion
encoding (SDE) signals, when coupled with the diffusion standard model (SM) and a set of constraints,
could be used for {\mu}FA estimation. This study aims to evaluate {\mu}FA as derived from the spherical
mean technique (SMT) set of constraints, as well as more generally for powder-averaged SM signals.
Methods: SDE experiments were performed at 16.4 T on an ex vivo mouse brain ({\Delta}/{\delta} =
12/1.5 ms). The {\mu}FA maps obtained from powder-averaged SDE signals were then compared to maps
obtained from DDE-MRI experiments ({\Delta}/{\tau}/{\delta} = 12/12/1.5 ms), which allow a model-free
estimation of {\mu}FA. Theory and simulations that consider different types of heterogeneity
are presented for corroborating the experimental findings. Results: {\mu}FA, as well as other
estimates derived from powder-averaged SDE signals produced large deviations from the ground
truth in both gray and white matter. Simulations revealed that these misestimations are likely
a consequence of factors not considered by the underlying microstructural models (such as intercomponent
and intracompartmental kurtosis). Conclusion: Powder-averaged SMT and (2-component) SM are
unable to accurately report {\mu}FA and other microstructural parameters in ex vivo tissues. Improper
model assumptions and constraints can significantly compromise parameter specificity. Further
developments and validations are required prior to implementation of these models in clinical
or preclinical research.
