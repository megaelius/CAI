We derive and assess two new classes of regularizers that cope with offending denominators in the
single-reference second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). In particular,
we discuss the use of two types of orbital energy dependent regularizers, $\kappa$ and $\sigma$,
in conjunction with orbital-optimized MP2 (OOMP2). The resulting fifth-order scaling methods,
$\kappa$-OOMP2 and $\sigma$-OOMP2, have been examined for bond-breaking, thermochemistry,
and biradical problems. Both methods with strong enough regularization restore restricted to
unrestricted instability (i.e. Coulson-Fischer points) that unregularized OOMP2 lacks when
breaking bonds in $\text{H}_{2}$, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$, and $\text{C}_2\text{H}_2$.
The training of the $\kappa$ and $\sigma$ regularization parameters was performed with the W4-11
set. We further developed scaled correlation energy variants, $\kappa$-S-OOMP2 and $\sigma$-S-OOMP2,
by training on the TAE140 subset of the W4-11 set. Those new OOMP2 methods were tested on the RSE43
set and the TA14 set where unmodified OOMP2 itself performs very well. The modifications we made
were found insignificant in these data sets. Furthermore, we tested the new OOMP2 methods on singlet
biradicaloids using Yamaguchi's approximate spin-projection. Unlike the unregularized OOMP2,
which fails to converge these systems due to the singularity, we show that regularized OOMP2 methods
successfully capture strong biradicaloid characters. While further assessment on larger datasets
is desirable, $\kappa$-OOMP2 with $\kappa$ = 1.45 $E_{h}^{-1}$ appears to combine favorable recovery
of Coulson-Fischer points with good numerical performance.
