Eukarya and Bacteria are the most evolutionarily distant domains of life, which is reflected by
differences in their cellular structure and physiology. For example, Eukarya feature membrane-bound
organelles such as nuclei and mitochondria, whereas Bacteria have none. The greater complexity
of Eukarya renders them difficult to study from both an experimental and theoretical perspective.
However, encouraged by a recent experimental result showing that budding yeast (a unicellular
eukaryote) obeys the same proportionality between ribosomal proteome fractions and cellular
growth rates as Bacteria, we derive a set of relations describing eukaryotic growth from first principles
of ribosome biogenesis. We recover the observed ribosomal protein proportionality, and then continue
to obtain two growth-laws for the number of RNA polymerases synthesizing ribosomal RNA per ribosome
in the cell. These growth-laws, in turn, reveal two invariants of eukaryotic growth, i.e. quantities
predicted to be conserved by Eukarya regardless of growth conditions. The invariants, which are
the first of their kind for Eukarya, clarify the coordination of transcription and translation
kinetics as required by ribosome biogenesis, and link these kinetic parameters to cellular physiology.
We demonstrate application of the relations to the yeast S. cerevisiae and find the predictions
to be in good agreement with currently available data. We then outline methods to quantitatively
deduce several unknown kinetic and physiological parameters. The analysis is not specific to S.
cerevisiae and can be extended to other lower (unicellular) Eukarya when data become available.
The relations may also have relevance to certain cancer cells which, like bacteria and yeast, exhibit
rapid cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis.
