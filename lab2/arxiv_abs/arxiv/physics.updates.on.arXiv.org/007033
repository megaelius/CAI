Two-dimensional semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides embedded in optical microcavities
in the strong exciton-photon coupling regime may lead to promising applications in spin and valley
addressable polaritonic logic gates and circuits. One significant obstacle for their realization
is the inherent lack of scalability associated with the mechanical exfoliation commonly used for
fabrication of two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures. Chemical vapor deposition
offers an alternative scalable fabrication method for both monolayer semiconductors and other
two-dimensional materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride. Observation of the strong light-matter
coupling in chemical vapor grown transition metal dichalcogenides has been demonstrated so far
in a handful of experiments with monolayer molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide. Here we
instead demonstrate the strong exciton-photon coupling in microcavities comprising large area
transition metal dichalcogenide / hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures made from chemical
vapor deposition grown molybdenum diselenide and tungsten diselenide encapsulated on one or both
sides in continuous few-layer boron nitride films also grown by chemical vapor deposition. These
transition metal dichalcogenide / hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures show high optical
quality comparable with mechanically exfoliated samples, allowing operation in the strong coupling
regime in a wide range of temperatures down to 4 Kelvin in tunable and monolithic microcavities,
and demonstrating the possibility to successfully develop large area transition metal dichalcogenide
based polariton devices.
