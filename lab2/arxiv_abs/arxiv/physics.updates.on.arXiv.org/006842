What is the best quantum chemical approach to decipher the energy components of the total interaction
energy: Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory or Supermolecular Energy Decomposition Analysis?
This is a very common question that force fields (FF) developers ask themselves when designing new
classical intermolecular potentials. With the rise of physically motivated polarizable FFs able
to include various type of physical effects within simulations, the need to answer such an interrogation
becomes stringent.In this paper, we perform a systematic & detailed assessment of three variants
of SAPT:SAPT(2), SAPT(2+3) & SAPT(DFT) & three supermolecular EDAs approaches : ALMO, CSOV & RVS
on a set of challenging, strongly bouded water complexes with cations and anions.Using a regularization
scheme within SAPT(DFT), RegSAPT(DFT), to partition the second-order induction energy into its
polarization and charge delocalization contributions, we show how the single-exchange (S2) approximation
has a large effect on these energies, and provide additional evidence for not using the initial Stone--Misquitta
definition for charge delocalization.Alternatively,we obtain more satisfactory results for
the evaluation of the polarization & charge-delocalization energies using an infinite order strategy.As
we compute these quantities using SAPT(DFT), RegSAPT(DFT) & classical polarization models, we
show a convergence with EDAs, despite the observation of sizable residual differences. Overall,
for strongly polar systems, when separable physically motivated energies are needed, we recommend
the use of SAPT(DFT) without the S2 approximation, the supermolecular EDA ALMO WB97X-D being our
second choice. As neither SAPT(2) nor SAPT(2+3) can be fully freed from the S2 approximation,we
do not recommend either of these methods for a separable, physically motivated decomposition of
the interaction energy.
