Chirality refers to a geometric phenomenon in which objects are not superimposable on their mirror
image. Structures made of nano-scale chiral elements can display chiroptical effects, such as
dichroism for left- and right- handed circularly polarized light, which makes them of high interest
for applications ranging from quantum information processing and quantum optics to circular dichroism
spectroscopy and molecular recognition. At the same time, strong effects have been challenging
to achieve even in synthetic optical media and chiroptical effects for light with normal incidence
has been speculated to be prohibited in lossless, thin, quasi-two-dimensional structures. Here,
we report on our experimental realization of a giant chiroptical effect in a thin monolithic photonic
crystal mirror. Unlike conventional mirrors, our structure selectively reflects only one spin
state of light, while preserving its handedness, with a near unity level of circular dichroism.
The operational principle of the photonic-crystal mirror relies on Guided Mode Resonance (GMR)
with simultaneous excitation of leaky TE and TM Bloch modes in the photonic crystal slab. Such modes
are not reliant on the suppression of their radiative losses through the long-range destructive
interference and even small areas of the photonic-crystal exhibit robust circular dichroism.
Despite its simplicity, the mirror strongly surpasses the performance of earlier reported structures
and, contrary to a prevailed notion, demonstrates that near unity reflectivity contrast for the
opposite helicities is achievable in a quasi-two-dimensional structure.
