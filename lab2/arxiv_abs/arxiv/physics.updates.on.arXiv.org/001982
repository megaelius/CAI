The physical processes at the interface of a low-temperature plasma and a solid are extremely complex.
They involve a huge number of elementary processes in the plasma, in the solid as well as charge, momentum
and energy transfer across the interface. In the majority of plasma simulations these surface processes
are either neglected or treated via phenomenological parameters. However, those parameters are
known only in some cases, so such an approach is very inaccurate and does not have predictive capability.
Therefore, improvements are highly needed. In this paper we briefly summarize relevant theoretical
methods from solid state and surface physics that are able to contribute to an improved simulation
of plasma-surface interaction in the near future. Full \textit{ab initio} quantum simulations
are feasible only for extremely short times and/or small system sizes. A substantial simplification
is achieved when electronic quantum effects are not treated explicitly. Then one arrives at semi-classical
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the heavy particles that have become the main workhorse
in surface science simulations. Using microscopically founded potentials and force fields as
an input, these MD simulations approach the quality of \textit{ab initio} simulations, in many
cases. However, despite their simplified nature, these simulations require a time step that is
of the order or below one femtosecond making it prohibitive to reach experimentally relevant scales
of minutes. To bridge this gap in length and time scales without compromising the first principles
character of the simulations, many physical and computational strategies have been put forward
in surface science. This paper presents a brief overview on different methods and their underlying
physical ideas, and we compare their strengths and weaknesses.
