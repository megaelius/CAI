There is currently growing interest in modeling the information diffusion on social networks across
multi-disciplines. The majority of the corresponding research has focused on information diffusion
independently, ignoring the network evolution in the diffusion process. Therefore, it is more
reasonable to describe the real diffusion systems by the co-evolution between network topologies
and information states. In this work, we propose a mechanism considering the coevolution between
information states and network topology simultaneously, in which the information diffusion was
executed as an SIS process and network topology evolved based on the adaptive assumption. The theoretical
analyses based on the Markov approach were very consistent with simulation. Both simulation results
and theoretical analyses indicated that the adaptive process, in which informed individuals would
rewire the links between the informed neighbors to a random non-neighbor node, can enhance information
diffusion (leading to much broader spreading). In addition, we obtained that two threshold values
exist for the information diffusion on adaptive networks, i.e., if the information propagation
probability is less than the first threshold, information cannot diffuse and dies out immediately;
if the propagation probability is between the first and second threshold, information will spread
to a finite range and die out gradually; and if the propagation probability is larger than the second
threshold, information will diffuse to a certain size of population in the network. These results
may shed some light on understanding the co-evolution between information diffusion and network
topology.
