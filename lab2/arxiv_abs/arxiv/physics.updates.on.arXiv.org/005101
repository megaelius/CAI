Blood flow in sickle cell disease (SCD) can substantially differ from the normal due to alterations
in the physical properties of sickle red blood cells (RBCs). Chronic complications, such as inflammation
of endothelial cells lining blood vessels, are associated with SCD, for reasons that are unclear.
In this work, boundary integral simulations are performed to investigate the dynamics of a binary
suspension of flexible biconcave discoidal capsules and stiff curved prolate capsules that represent
healthy and sickle RBCs, respectively, subjected to pressure-driven flow confined in a planar
slit. The stiff component is dilute in the binary suspension. This system serves as an idealized
model for blood flow in SCD. The key observation is that, unlike healthy RBCs that concentrate around
the center of the channel and form a cell-free layer next to the walls, sickle cells are largely drained
from the bulk of the suspension and aggregate inside the cell-free layer, displaying strong margination.
The marginated sickle cells approximate a rigid-body-like rolling orbit near the walls. Additionally,
by considering a mixture of flexible and stiff biconcave discoids, we reveal that rigidity difference
by itself is sufficient to induce the segregation behavior in a binary suspension. Furthermore,
the additional shear stress on the walls induced by the presence of capsules is computed for different
suspensions. Compared to the small fluctuations in wall shear stress for the case with purely healthy
RBCs, large local peaks in wall shear stress are observed for the binary suspensions due to the marginated
stiff cells. As endothelial cells are known to mechanotransduce physical forces such as aberrations
in shear stress and convert them to physiological processes such as activation of inflammatory
signals, these results may aid in understanding mechanisms for endothelial dysfunction associated
with SCD.
