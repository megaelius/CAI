Programmable metasurfaces incorporated with tunable materials controlled by external stimuli
can provide an unprecedented degree of freedom in dynamical wave manipulation in real-time. Beyond
the scope of isotropic reconfigurable metasurfaces that only support unique tunable responses
for excitation with a certain single-polarization, here, for the first time a new generation of
ultrafast reprogrammable multi-functional anisotropic metasurface is reported to enable interchangeable
missions independently for two orthogonal linearly polarized THz wavefront excitations. The
reconfigurability of the proposed anisotropic meta-device was guaranteed by elaborately designed
meta-particle composed of two perpendicular VO2 microwires whose operational statuses can be
arbitrarily and dynamically tuned among two digital states of 0 and 1 independent for dual-polarization
channels by mere changing the biasing voltage via two independent computer-programmed multichannel
DC network. Capitalizing on such meta-particle design, single/multiple focused THz beam into
a pre-determined focal spot and single/multiple focused vortex beams with interchangeable OAM
modes satisfactorily generated by encoding a metasurface with different parabola and spiral-parabola-like
coding sequences respectively. Besides controlling the near field behaviors, the versatility
and flexibility of the proposed anisotropic metasurface also can furnish an inspiring platform
to manipulate the far-field scattering patterns in each desired polarization channel. Anisotropic
meta-device bringing new degrees of freedom in achieving versatile tunable control of differently
polarized electromagnetic waves which will significantly enhance storage density and data capacities
and has the potential for complicated wave manipulation such as ultrafast THz communication and
dynamic holography.
