Adhesion between a T cell and an antigen presenting cell is achieved by TCR-pMHC and LFA1-ICAM1 protein
complexes. These segregate to form a special pattern, known as the immunological synapse (IS),
consisting of a central quasi-circular domain of TCR-pMHC bonds surrounded by a peripheral domain
of LFA1-ICAM1 complexes. Insights gained from imaging studies had led to the conclusion that the
formation of the central adhesion domain in the IS is driven by active (ATP-driven) mechanisms.
Recent studies, however, suggested that passive (thermodynamic) mechanisms may also play an important
role in this process. Here, we present a simple physical model, taking into account the membrane-mediated
thermodynamic attraction between the TCR-pMHC bonds and the effective forces that they experience
due to ATP-driven actin retrograde flow and transport by dynein motor proteins. Monte Carlo simulations
of the model exhibit a good spatio-temporal agreement with the experimentally observed pattern
evolution of the TCR-pMHC microclusters. The agreement is lost when one of the aggregation mechanisms
is "muted", which helps to identify the respective roles in the process. We conclude that actin retrograde
flow drives the centripetal motion of TCR-pMHC bonds, while the membrane-mediated interactions
facilitate microcluster formation and growth. In the absence of dynein motors, the system evolves
into a ring-shaped pattern, which highlights the role of dynein motors in the formation of the final
concentric pattern. The interplay between the passive and active mechanisms regulates the rate
of the accumulation process, which in the absence of one them proceeds either too quickly or slowly.
