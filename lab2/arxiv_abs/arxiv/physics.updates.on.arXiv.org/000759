In low-collisionality scenarios exhibiting mitigation of edge localized modes (ELMs), stable
ideal kink modes at the edge are excited by externally applied magnetic perturbation (MP)-fields.
In ASDEX Upgrade these modes can cause three-dimensional (3D) boundary displacements up to the
centimeter range. These displacements have been measured using toroidally localized high resolution
diagnostics and rigidly rotating n = 2 MP-fields with various applied poloidal mode spectra. These
measurements are compared to non-linear 3D ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equilibria calculated
by VMEC. Comprehensive comparisons have been conducted, which consider for instance plasma movements
due to the position control system, attenuation due to internal conductors and changes in the edge
pressure profiles. VMEC accurately reproduces the amplitude of the displacement and its dependencies
on the applied poloidal mode spectra. Quantitative agreement is found around the low field side
(LFS) midplane. The response at the plasma top is qualitatively compared. The measured and predicted
displacements at the plasma top maximize when the applied spectra is optimized for ELM-mitigation.
The predictions from the vacuum modeling generally fails to describe the displacement at the LFS
midplane as well as at the plasma top. When the applied mode spectra is set to maximize the displacement,
VMEC and the measurements clearly surpass the predictions from the vacuum modeling by a factor of
four. Minor disagreements between VMEC and the measurements are discussed. This study underlines
the importance of the stable ideal kink modes at the edge for the 3D boundary displacement in scenarios
relevant for ELM-mitigation.
