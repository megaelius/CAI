X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is an important tool in medical imaging to obtain a direct visualization
of patient anatomy. However, the x-ray radiation exposure leads to the concern of lifetime cancer
risk. Low-dose CT scan can reduce the radiation exposure to patient while the image quality is usually
degraded due to the appearance of noise and artifacts. Numerous studies have been conducted to regularize
CT image for better image quality. Yet, exploring the underlying manifold where real CT images residing
on is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a fully data-driven manifold learning approach
by incorporating the emerging deep-learning technology. An encoder-decoder convolutional neural
network has been established to map a CT image to the inherent low-dimensional manifold, as well
as to restore the CT image from its corresponding manifold representation. A novel reconstruction
algorithm assisted by the leant manifold prior has been developed to achieve high quality low-dose
CT reconstruction. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, network
training, testing, and comprehensive simulation study have been performed using patient abdomen
CT images. The trained encoder-decoder CNN is capable of restoring high-quality CT images with
average error of ~20 HU. Furthermore, the proposed manifold prior assisted reconstruction scheme
achieves high-quality low-dose CT reconstruction, with average reconstruction error of < 30 HU,
more than five times and two times lower than that of filtered back projection method and total-variation
based iterative reconstruction method, respectively.
