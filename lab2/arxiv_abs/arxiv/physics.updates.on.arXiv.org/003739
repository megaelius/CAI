We present a numerical analysis of the rheology of a suspension of red blood cells (RBCs) in a wall-bounded
shear flow. The flow is assumed as almost inertialess. The suspension of RBCs, modeled as biconcave
capsules whose membrane follows the Skalak constitutive law, is simulated for a wide range of viscosity
ratios between the cytoplasm and plasma: $\lambda$ = 0.1-10, for volume fractions up to $\phi$ =
0.41 and for different capillary numbers ($Ca$). Our numerical results show that an RBC at low $Ca$
tends to orient to the shear plane and exhibits the so-called rolling motion, a stable mode with higher
intrinsic viscosity than the so-called tumbling motion. As $Ca$ increases, the mode shifts from
the rolling to the swinging motion. Hydrodynamic interactions (higher volume fraction) also allows
RBCs to exhibit both tumbling or swinging motions resulting in a drop of the intrinsic viscosity
for dilute and semi-dilute suspensions. Because of this mode change, conventional ways of modeling
the relative viscosity as a polynomial function of $\phi$ cannot be simply applied in suspensions
of RBCs at low volume fractions. The relative viscosity for high volume fractions, however, can
be well described as a function of an effective volume fraction, defined by the volume of spheres
of radius equal to the semi-middle axis of the deformed RBC. We find that the relative viscosity successfully
collapses on a single non-linear curve independently of $\lambda$ except for the case with $Ca \geq$
0.4, where the fit works only in the case of low/moderate volume fraction, and fails in the case of
a fully dense suspension.
