We conduct an in-depth analysis of statistical flow properties calculated from the reference high-resolution
Saturn simulation obtained by global climate modelling in Part II. In the steady state of this reference
simulation, strongly energetic, zonally dominated, large-scale structures emerge, which scale
with the Rhines scale. Spectral analysis reveals a strong anisotropy in the kinetic energy spectra,
consistent with the zonostrophic turbulent flow regime. By computing spectral energy and enstrophy
fluxes we confirm the existence of a double cascade scenario related to 2D-turbulent theory. To
diagnose the relevant 3D dynamical mechanisms in Saturn's turbulent atmosphere, we run a set of
four simulations using an idealized version of our Global Climate Model devoid of radiative transfer,
with a well-defined Taylor-Green forcing and over several rotation rates (4, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 times
Saturn's rotation rate). This allows us to identify dynamics in three distinctive inertial ranges:
(1) a ``residual-dominated'' range, in which non-axisymmetric structures dominate with a -5/3
spectral slope; (2) a ``zonostrophic inertial'' range, dominated by axisymmetric jets and characterized
by the pile-up of strong zonal modes with a steeper, nearly -3, spectral slope; and (3) a ``large-scale''
range, beyond Rhines' typical length scale, in which the reference Saturn simulation and our idealized
simulations differ. In the latter range, the dynamics is dominated by long-lived zonal modes 2 and
3 when a Saturn-like seasonal forcing is considered (reference simulation), and a steep energetic
decrease with the idealized Taylor-Green forcing. Finally, instantaneous spectral fluxes show
the coexistence of upscale and downscale enstrophy/energy transfers at large scales, specific
to the regime of zonostrophic turbulence in a 3D atmosphere.
