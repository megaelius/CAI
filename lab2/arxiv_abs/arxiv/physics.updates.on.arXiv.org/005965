Cosmic rays (CRs) have been studied extensively in the last century to understand the processes
in the universe as well as in the solar system. In today's satellite era, although many observations
are made from space, CR observations from the ground are still viewed as an important tool. These
observations, however, mostly detect the secondary cosmic rays (SCRs) such as neutron, muon, and
gamma. It is well known that the atmospheric pressure plays an important role in the SCR flux observed
on the ground. Barometric pressure correction is standard practice for neutron monitor (NM) data.
However, no such correction is applied to gamma-ray, being massless. But the pressure affects the
particles such as $e^{\pm}$, $\mu^{\pm}$, which produce gamma rays in the cascade. Subsequently,
the indirect pressure dependence of the gamma-ray flux can be anticipated. We examine this aspect
in detail by studying the gamma-ray counts detected by the NaI (Tl) detector. The present study confirms
that there is no correlation between the atmospheric pressure and the total gamma-ray counts collected
from all energies. However, the scenario differs when the gamma-ray fluxes of different energies
are investigated separately. The gamma rays of energy below $\sim$3 MeV are primarily due to the
radioactivity originating from the ground, whereas gamma rays above 3 MeV are mainly produced in
the CR cascade. It is observed that the counts of energy above 3 MeV are well anti-correlated with
the atmospheric pressure and hence need to be corrected. It is demonstrated that applying the barometric
correction formula successfully removes the pressure dependence in the gamma-ray flux above 3
MeV. Therefore, we suggest that the gamma-ray data above 3 MeV needs to be corrected for the local
atmospheric pressure variations.
