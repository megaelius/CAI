An overexpanded jet in a truncated ideally contoured nozzle is found to feature a tonal behavior.
The flow field is investigated to understand its origin and show how it modifies side-load properties.
The temporal and spatial organization of wall pressure and jet velocity field are first experimentally
characterized based on synchronized acquisition of both wall-pressure along rings of pressure
probes located within the nozzle and high-rate time-resolved PIV velocity fields measured in a
plane section crossing the jet downstream of the nozzle exit. The external jet aerodynamics and
internal wall pressure field are first shown to be clearly linked, but only at this frequency peak
for which a significant coherence emerges between first azimuthal mode of fluctuating wall pressure
and first azimuthal mode of fluctuating external velocity field. A Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation
is carried out and validated against experimental results in order to reproduce this tonal flow
dynamics. The analysis of simulation data shows that the tonal flow behaviour of first azimuthal
mode is indeed more largely felt within the whole flow structure where both upstream and downstream
propagating waves are shown to co-exist, even far downstream of the nozzle exit. The analysis shows
that both waves possess support in the jet core and have a non negligible pressure signature in the
separated region. The Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of fluctuating pressure field
at this tonal frequency reveals that the nature and intensity of lateral pressure forces is directed
by the resonance related to the upstream- and downstream-propagating coherent structures, which
imposes the shock-waves network to respond and modulate the pressure levels on the nozzle internal
surface.
