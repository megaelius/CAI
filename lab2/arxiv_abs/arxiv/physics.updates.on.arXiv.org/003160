Plasmonic metamaterials and metasurfaces offer new opportunities in developing high performance
terahertz emitters and detectors beyond the limitations of conventional nonlinear materials.
However, simple meta-atoms for second-order nonlinear applications encounter fundamental trade-offs
in the necessary symmetry breaking and local-field enhancement due to radiation damping that is
inherent to the operating resonant mode and cannot be controlled separately. Here we present a novel
concept that eliminates this restriction obstructing the improvement of terahertz generation
efficiency in nonlinear metasurfaces based on metallic nanoresonators. This is achieved by combining
a resonant dark-state metasurface, which locally drives nonlinear nanoresonators in the near
field, with a specific spatial symmetry that enables destructive interference of the radiating
linear moments of the nanoresonators, and perfect absorption via simultaneous electric and magnetic
critical coupling of the pump radiation to the dark mode. Our proposal allows eliminating linear
radiation damping, while maintaining constructive interference and effective radiation of the
nonlinear components. We numerically demonstrate a giant second-order nonlinear susceptibility
around Hundred-Billionth m/V, a one order improvement compared with the previously reported split-ring-resonator
metasurface, and correspondingly, a 2 orders of magnitude enhanced terahertz energy extraction
should be expected with our configuration under the same conditions. Our study offers a paradigm
of high efficiency tunable nonlinear metadevices and paves the way to revolutionary terahertz
technologies and optoelectronic nanocircuitry.
