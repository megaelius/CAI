The extended boundary condition method can be used to study planewave scattering by an ellipsoid
composed of an orthorhombic dielectric-magnetic material whose relative permittivity dyadic
is a scalar multiple of its relative permeability dyadic. The scattered and internal field phasors
can be expanded in terms of appropriate vector spherical wavefunctions with unknown expansion
coefficients, whereas the incident field phasors can be similarly expanded but with known expansion
coefficients. The scattered-field coefficients are related to the incident-field coefficients
through a matrix. The scattering, absorption, and extinction efficiencies were calculated thereby
in relation to the propagation direction and the polarization state of the incident plane wave,
the constitutive-anisotropy parameters, and the nonsphericity parameters of the ellipsoid,
when the eigenvectors of the real permittivity dyadic are aligned along the three semi-axes of the
ellipsoid. As the electrical size of the ellipsoid increases, multiple lobes appear in the scattering
pattern. The total scattering efficiency can be smaller than the absorption efficiency for some
configurations of the incident plane wave but not necessarily for others. The nonsphericity of
the object has a stronger influence on the total scattering efficiency than on the absorption efficiency.
The forward-scattering efficiency increases monotonically with the electrical size for all configurations
of the incident plane wave, and so does the backscattering efficiency for some configurations.
For other configurations, the backscattering efficiency has an undulating behavior with increase
in electrical size, and is highly affected by the shape and the constitutive anisotropy of the ellipsoid.
