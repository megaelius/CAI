Hot flow anomalies (HFAs) were first discovered in the early 1980s at the bow shock of the Earth. In
the 1990s these features were studied, observed and simulated very intensively and many new missions
focused the attention to this phenomenon again. Many basic features and the HFA formation mechanism
were clarified observationally and using hybrid simulation techniques. We described previous
observational, theoretical and simulation results in the research field of HFAs. We introduced
HFA observations performed at the Earth, Mars, Venus and Saturn in this paper. We share different
observation results of space mission to give an overview to the reader. Cluster multi-spacecraft
measurements gave us more observed HFA events and finer, more sophisticated methods to understand
them better. In this study, HFAs were studied using observations of the Cluster magnetometer and
the Cluster plasma detector aboard the four Cluster spacecraft. Energetic particle measurements
(28.2-68.9 keV) were also used to detect and select HFAs. We studied several specific features of
tangential discontinuities generating HFAs on the basis of Cluster measurements in the period
February-April 2003, December 2005-April 2006 and January-April, 2007, when the separation of
spacecraft was large and the Cluster fleet reached the bow shock. We have confirmed the condition
for forming HFAs, that the solar wind speed is higher than the average. This condition was also confirmed
by simultaneous ACE magnetic field and solar wind plasma observations at the L1 point 1.4 million
km upstream of the Earth. The measured and calculated features of HFA events were compared with the
results of different previous hybrid simulations. During the whole spring season of 2003, the solar
wind speed was higher than the average. Here we checked whether the higher solar wind speed is a real
condition of HFA formation also in 2006 and 2007.
