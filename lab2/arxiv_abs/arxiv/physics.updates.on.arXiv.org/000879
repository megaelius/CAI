Data assimilation is widely used to improve flood forecasting capability, especially through
parameter inference requiring statistical information on the uncertain input parameters (upstream
discharge, friction coefficient) as well as on the variability of the water level and its sensitivity
with respect to the inputs. For particle filter or ensemble Kalman filter, stochastically estimating
probability density function and covariance matrices from a Monte Carlo random sampling requires
a large ensemble of model evaluations, limiting their use in real-time application. To tackle this
issue, fast surrogate models based on Polynomial Chaos and Gaussian Process can be used to represent
the spatially distributed water level in place of solving the shallow water equations. This study
investigates the use of these surrogates to estimate probability density functions and covariance
matrices at a reduced computational cost and without the loss of accuracy, in the perspective of
ensemble-based data assimilation. This study focuses on 1-D steady state flow simulated with MASCARET
over the Garonne River (South-West France). Results show that both surrogates feature similar
performance to the Monte-Carlo random sampling, but for a much smaller computational budget; a
few MASCARET simulations (on the order of 10-100) are sufficient to accurately retrieve covariance
matrices and probability density functions all along the river, even where the flow dynamic is more
complex due to heterogeneous bathymetry. This paves the way for the design of surrogate strategies
suitable for representing unsteady open-channel flows in data assimilation.
