Disruptions to transportation networks are inevitable. Currently, most mandated development-related
transportation planning is intended to prepare for frequently occurring and observable disruptions
while low probability events that have not yet materialized attract less attention. When road networks
are not resilient, these unpredictable events can cause significant delays that may not be proportional
to the extent of the disruption. Enhancing resilience can help in mitigating consequences of disruptions
but requires financial investment that is difficult to justify given that low probability event
may not have materialized. This paper highlights economic implications of unmitigated random
disruptions in urban road systems and makes the case for investment in transportation network resilience.
We utilized a model of urban transportation network performance that quantifies resilience and
demonstrated its integration with microeconomic transportation planning model REMI TranSight.
The model was applied to 10 cities in the USA to calculate several economic indicators under baseline
scenario where economic impact was assumed to be proportional to the magnitude of disruptive events
and under a test scenario where the magnitude of disruption was used to calculate additional delays
in transportation networks and these additional delays were explicitly integrated in REMI model.
Results show that GDP losses suffered as a result of disruption may be far more significant in the
case scenario and economic output is not necessarily back to normal in the year the following disruptive
event. We thus conclude that support for investment decisions on network efficiency and resilience
management should be based on a framework that utilizes resilience, quantified in terms that are
compatible with standard practice, and scenarios to test the implications of topological attributes.
