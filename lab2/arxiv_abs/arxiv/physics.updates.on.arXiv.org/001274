We present a centennial review of the history of the term known as the cosmological constant. First
introduced to the general theory of relativity by Einstein in 1917 in order to describe a universe
that was assumed to be static, the term fell from favour in the wake of the discovery of the expanding
universe, only to make a dramatic return in recent times. We consider historical and philosophical
aspects of the cosmological constant over four main epochs: (i) the use of the term in static cosmologies
(both Newtonian and relativistic); (ii) the marginalization of the term following the discovery
of cosmic expansion; (iii) the use of the term to address specific cosmic puzzles such as the timespan
of expansion, the formation of galaxies and the redshifts of the quasars; (iv) the re-emergence
of the term in today's Lamda-CDM cosmology. We find that the cosmological constant was never truly
banished from theoretical models of the universe, but was sidelined by astronomers for reasons
of convenience. We also find that the return of the term to the forefront of modern cosmology did not
occur as an abrupt paradigm shift due to one particular set of observations, but as the result of a
number of empirical advances such as the measurement of present cosmic expansion using the Hubble
Space Telescope, the measurement of past expansion using type SN 1a supernovae as standard candles,
and the measurement of perturbations in the cosmic microwave background by balloon and satellite.
We give a brief overview of contemporary interpretations of the physics underlying the cosmic constant
and conclude with a synopsis of the famous cosmological constant problem.
