We have calculated by using CARI-7A the effective and ambient radiation doses absorbed by a reference
human phantom inside aircrafts with cruise speed, and averaged ascent/descent rates as presented
by real airplanes such as: Airbus 380, Boeing 777, 787, Hercules C-130 and Twin Otter DHC-6, in a sample
of flight aerial routes. The sample is composed of sixteen flight aerial routes and two special cases
of one route. From the routes sample fifteen are between the longest non-stop flight routes around
the world, where four flights pass over the Arctic and we have considered one air route involving
the Antarctica with two additional special cases. The Earth curvature was taking into account for
points in the constructed flight routes, by using the INVERSE3D software, which is based on the model
WGS84. We also have constructed radiation dose charts according to the ICRP-103, by using the radiometric
results for one flight in each flight aerial route coming from CARI-7A simulations. These charts
present the effective absorbed radiation dose as a function of the flight level and the flight time
in a year of normal operations of the crew as recommended by FAA. We have characterized geographically
and kinematically the cosmic effective radiation absorption rates at Earth atmosphere in terms
of the structure and order of polynomials in the altitude. We discuss about the threshold values
for absorption of radiation, the flight hours per year, and the model of statistical radiation and
tissue weights established by the ICRP-103 and its relation with the radiation charts for aviation
shown in this work. From the flight with the leading rate of irradiation we found a thumb rule to estimate
the effective absorbed radiation dose and the ambient equivalent dose that gives a superior threshold
for any flight of the sample and perhaps on Earth, valid in interval [20000, 50000] ft.
