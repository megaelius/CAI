This paper aims to numerically verify the large Reynolds number asymptotic theory of magneto-hydrodynamic
flows proposed in part 1 (Deguchi 2018). In order to avoid complexity associated with chaotic nature
of turbulence and flow geometry, nonlinear steady solutions of the viscous-resistive magneto-hydrodynamic
equations in plane Couette flow are concerned. Two classes of dynamo states, which convert kinematic
energy to magnetic energy effectively, are found. The first class of dynamos can be obtained when
a small spanwise uniform magnetic field is applied to the known hydrodynamic solution branch of
plane Couette flow. The dynamos are characterised by the hydrodynamic/magnetic roll-streak and
the resonant layer at which strong vorticity and current sheets are observed. Those flow features,
and the induced strong streamwise magnetic field, are fully consistent with the vortex/Alfv\'en
wave interaction theory proposed in part 1. When the spanwise uniform magnetic field is switched
off, the solutions become purely hydrodynamic. However, it turns out that dynamos can actually
be found at the zero-external magnetic field limit using different form of external field. That
second class of `self-sustained shear driven dynamos' can be found by the homotopy via the forced
states subject to a spanwise uniform current field. The discovery of purely shear driven dynamos
motivated the corresponding matched asymptotic analysis in part 1. Here the reduced equations
due to the asymptotic theory are solved numerically. The asymptotic solution is found to give remarkably
good predictions for the finite Reynolds number dynamo solutions.
