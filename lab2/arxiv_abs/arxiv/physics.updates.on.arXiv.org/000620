There are many controversial and challenging discussions about quantum effects in microscopic
structures in neurons of the human brain. The challenge is mainly because of quick decoherence of
quantum states due to hot, wet and noisy environment of the brain which forbids long life coherence
for brain processing. Despite these critical discussions, there are only a few number of published
papers about numerical aspects of decoherence in neurons. Perhaps the most important issue is offered
by Max Tegmark who has calculated decoherence times for the systems of "ions" and "microtubules"
in neurons of the brain. In fact, Tegmark did not consider ion channels which are responsible for
ions displacement through the membrane and are the building blocks of electrical membrane signals
in the nervous system. Here, we would like to re-investigate decoherence times for ionic superposition
states by using the data obtained via molecular dynamics simulations. Our main approach is according
to what Tegmark has used before. In fact, Tegmark didn't consider the ion channel structure and his
estimates are only simple approximations. In this paper, we focus on the small nano-scale part of
KcsA ion channels which is called "selectivity filter" and has a key role in the operation of an ion
channel. Our results for superposition states of potassium ions indicate that decoherence times
are in the order of picoseconds which are 10-100 million times bigger than the order calculated by
Tegmark. This decoherence time is still not enough for cognitive processing in the brain, however
it can be adequate for quantum states of cooled ions in the filter to leave their quantum traces on
the filter and action potentials.
