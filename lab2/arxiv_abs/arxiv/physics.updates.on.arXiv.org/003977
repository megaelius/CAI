The cascaded or central-moments-based lattice Boltzmann method (CM-LBM) is a robust alternative
to the more conventional BGK-LBM for the simulation of high-Reynolds number flows. Unfortunately,
its original formulation makes its extension to a broader range of physics quite difficult. To tackle
this issue, a recent work [A. De Rosis, Phys. Rev. E 95, 013310 (2017)] proposed a more generic way
to derive concise and efficient three-dimensional CM-LBMs. Knowing the original model also relies
on central moments that are derived in an adhoc manner, i.e., by mimicking those of the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution to ensure their Galilean invariance a posteriori, a very recent effort [A. De Rosis
and K. H. Luo, Phys. Rev. E 99, 013301 (2019)] was proposed to further generalize their derivation.
The latter has shown that one could derive Galilean invariant CMs in a systematic and a priori manner
by taking into account high-order Hermite polynomials in the derivation of the discrete equilibrium
state. Combining these two approaches, a compact and mathematically sound formulation of the CM-LBM
with external forcing is proposed. More specifically, the proposed formalism fully takes advantage
of the D3Q27 discretization by relying on the corresponding set of 27 Hermite polynomials (up to
the sixth order) for the derivation of both the discrete equilibrium state and the forcing term.
The present methodology is more consistent than previous approaches, as it properly explains how
to derive Galilean invariant CMs of the forcing term in an a priori manner. Furthermore, while keeping
the numerical properties of the original CM-LBM, the present work leads to a compact and simple algorithm,
representing a universal methodology based on CMs and external forcing within the lattice Boltzmann
framework.
