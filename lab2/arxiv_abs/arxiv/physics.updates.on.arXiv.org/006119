Hypothesis Understanding wetting behavior is of great importance for natural systems and technological
applications. The traditional concept of contact angle, a purely geometrical measure related
to curvature, is often used for characterizing the wetting state of a system. It can be determined
from Young's equation by applying equilibrium thermodynamics. However, whether contact angle
is a representative measure of wetting for systems with significant complexity is unclear. Herein,
we hypothesize that topological principles based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem could yield a robust
measure to characterize wetting. Theory and Experiments We introduce a macroscopic contact angle
based on the deficit curvature of the fluid interfaces that are imposed by contacts with other immiscible
phases. We perform sessile droplet simulations followed by multiphase experiments for porous
sintered glass and Bentheimer sandstone to assess the sensitivity and robustness of the topological
approach and compare the results to other traditional approaches. Findings We show that the presented
topological principle is consistent with thermodynamics under the simplest conditions through
a variational analysis. Furthermore, we elucidate that at sufficiently high image resolution
the proposed topological approach and local contact angle measurements are comparable. While
at lower resolutions, the proposed approach provides more accurate results being robust to resolution-based
effects. Overall, the presented concepts open new pathways to characterize the wetting state of
complex systems and theoretical developments to study multiphase systems.
