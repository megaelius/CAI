The recent progress in laser propulsion research has advanced substantially the prospects to realize
interstellar spaceflight within a few decades. Here we examine passive deceleration via momentum
breaking from ionized interstellar media. The very large area to mass relations needed as a consequence
of the low interstellar densities, of the order of 0.1 particles per $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, or lower,
are potentially realizable with magnetic sails generated by superconducting coils. Integrating
the equations of motion for interstellar protons hitting a Biot Savart loop we evaluate the effective
reflection area $A(v)$ in terms of the velocity $v$ of the craft. We find that the numerical data is
fitted over two orders of magnitude by the scaling relation $A(v)\ =\ 0.081A_R\log^3(I/(\beta
I_c))$, where $A_R=\pi R^2$ is the bare sail area, $I$ the current and $\beta=v/c$. The critical
current $I_c$ is $1.55\cdot10^6$ Ampere. The resulting universal deceleration profile can be
evaluated analytically and mission parameters optimized for a minimal craft mass. For the case
of a sample high speed transit to Proxima Centauri we find that magnetic momentum breaking would
involve daunting mass requirements of the order of $10^3$ tons. A low speed mission to the Trappist-1
system could be realized on the other side already with a 1.5 ton spacecraft, which would be furthermore
compatible with the specifications of currently envisioned directed energy launch systems. The
extended cruising times of the order of $10^4$ years imply however that a mission to the Trappist-1
system would be viable only for mission concepts for which time constrains are not relevant.
