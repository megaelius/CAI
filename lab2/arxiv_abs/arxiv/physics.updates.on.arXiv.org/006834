Shock related unsteadiness over axisymmetric spiked body configurations is experimentally investigated
at a freestream supersonic Mach number of 2.0 at 0$^\circ$ angle of attack. Three different forebody
configurations mounted with a sharp spike-tip ranging from blunt to streamlined (flat-face, hemispherical,
and elliptical) are considered. Steady and unsteady pressure measurements, short-exposure high-speed
shadowgraphy, shock footprint analysis from $x-t$ plots, and identification of dominant spatiotemporal
modes through modal analysis are carried out to explain the unsteady flow physics. The present investigation
tools are validated against the well-known events of `pulsation' associated with the flat-face
case. The hemispherical case is characterized by the formation of a separated free shear layer and
associated localized shock oscillations. The cycle of charging and ejection of fluid mass from
the recirculation zone, confined between the separated shear layer and the spiked body, is identified
to drive the flow unsteadiness. Such an event triggers the out-of-phase motion between the separated
and reattachment shocks. In the elliptical case, the overall flow field resembles that of the hemispherical
case, except with dampened unsteadiness. The value of the cone angle ($\lambda$) associated with
the recirculation region is found to be responsible for the fluctuations from the charging and ejection
of fluid mass. Thereby it controls the extent of out-of-shock phase motion. In the elliptical case,
$\lambda$ is observed to be smaller and exhibits a reduction in shock unsteadiness. \hlt{Based
on the gathered results and understanding, the reduction in unsteadiness associated with the aerodisk
mounted on the hemispherical forebody is explained via the almost complete elimination of the out-of-phase
shock motion.
