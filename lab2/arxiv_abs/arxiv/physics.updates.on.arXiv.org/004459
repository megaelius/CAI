A common strategy in the numerical solution of partial differential equations is to define a uniform
discretization of a tensor-product multi-dimensional logical domain, which is mapped to a physical
domain through a given coordinate transformation. By extending this concept to a multi-patch setting,
simple and efficient numerical algorithms can be employed on relatively complex geometries. The
main drawback of such an approach is the inherent difficulty in dealing with singularities of the
coordinate transformation. This work suggests a comprehensive numerical strategy for the common
situation of disk-like domains with a singularity at a unique pole, where one edge of the rectangular
logical domain collapses to one point of the physical domain (for example, a circle). We present
robust numerical methods for the solution of Vlasov-like hyperbolic equations coupled to Poisson-like
elliptic equations in such geometries. We describe a semi-Lagrangian advection solver that employs
a novel set of coordinates, named pseudo-Cartesian coordinates, to integrate the characteristic
equations in the whole domain, including the pole, and a finite element elliptic solver based on
globally $C^1$ smooth splines (Toshniwal et al., 2017). The two solvers are tested both independently
and on a coupled model, namely the 2D guiding-center model for magnetized plasmas, equivalent to
a vorticity model for incompressible inviscid Euler fluids. The numerical methods presented show
high-order convergence in the space discretization parameters, uniformly across the computational
domain, without effects of order reduction due to the singularity. Dedicated tests show that the
numerical techniques described can be applied straightforwardly also in the presence of point
charges (equivalently, point-like vortices), within the context of particle-in-cell methods.
