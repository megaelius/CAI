Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) investigates structures in samples that generally range from approximately
0.5 nm to a few 100 nm. This can both be done for isotropic samples such as blends and liquids, as well
as anisotropic samples such as quasi-crystals. In order to obtain data about that size regime scattered
intensity, mostly of x-rays or neutrons, is investigated at angles from close to zero, still in the
region of the primary beam up to 10\deg , depending on the wavelength of the incoming radiation. The
two primary sources for SAS experiments are x-ray (small-angle x-ray scattering, SAXS) sources
and neutron (small-angle neutron scattering, SANS) sources, which shall be the two cases discussed
here. Also scattering with electrons or other particle waves is possible, but not the main use case
for the purpose of this manuscript. For most small-angle scattering instruments, both SAXS and
SANS, the science case covers the investigation of self-assembled polymeric and biological systems,
multi-scale systems with large size distribution of the contained particles, solutions of (nano-)particles
and soft-matter systems, protein solutions, and material science investigations. In the case
of SANS this is augmented by the possibility to also investigate the spin state of the sample and hence
perform investigations of the magnetic structure of the sample. In the following sections the general
setup of both SAXS and SANS instruments shall be discussed, as well as data acquisition and evaluation
and preparation of the sample and the experiment in general. The information contained herein should
provide sufficient information for planning and performing a SAS experiment and evaluate the gathered
data.
