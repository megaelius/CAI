The transport of low-energy electrons through the coating of a radiosensitizing metallic nanoparticle
under fast ion irradiation is analyzed theoretically and numerically. As a case study, we consider
a poly(ethylene glycol)-coated gold nanoparticle of diameter 1.6 nm excited by a carbon ion in the
Bragg peak region as well as by more energetic carbon ions. The diffusion equation for low-energy
electrons emitted from a finite-size spherical source representing the surface of the metal core
is solved to obtain the electron number density as a function of radial distance and time. Information
on the atomistic structure and composition of the coating is obtained from molecular dynamics simulations
performed with the MBN Explorer software package. Two mechanisms of low-energy electron production
by the metallic core are considered: the relaxation of plasmon excitations and collective excitations
of valence $d$ electrons in individual atoms of gold. Diffusion coefficients and characteristic
lifetimes of electrons propagating in gold, water, and poly(ethylene glycol) are obtained from
the dielectric formalism and relativistic partial wave analysis, respectively. On this basis,
the number of electrons released through the organic coating into the surrounding aqueous medium
and the number of hydroxyl radicals produced are evaluated. The largest increase of the radical
yield is observed when the nanoparticle is excited by an ion with energy significantly exceeding
that in the Bragg peak region. It is also shown that the water content of the coating, especially near
the surface of the metal core, is crucial for the production of hydroxyl radicals.
