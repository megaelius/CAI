The key feature of online social networks (OSN) is the ability of users to become active, make friends
and interact via comments, videos or messages with those around them. This social interaction is
typically perceived as critical to the proper functioning of these platforms; therefore, a significant
share of OSN research in the recent past has investigated the characteristics and importance of
these social links, studying the networks' friendship relations through their topological properties,
the structure of the resulting communities and identifying the role and importance of individual
members within these networks. In this paper, we present results from a multi-year study of the online
social network Digg.com, indicating that the importance of friends and the friend network in the
propagation of information is less than originally perceived. While we do note that users form and
maintain a social structure along which information is exchanged, the importance of these links
and their contribution is very low: Users with even a nearly identical overlap in interests react
on average only with a probability of 2% to information propagated and received from friends. Furthermore,
in only about 50% of stories that became popular from the entire body of 10 million news we find evidence
that the social ties among users were a critical ingredient to the successful spread. Our findings
indicate the presence of previously unconsidered factors, the temporal alignment between user
activities and the existence of additional logical relationships beyond the topology of the social
graph, that are able to drive and steer the dynamics of such OSNs.
