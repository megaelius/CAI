Coupling hemodynamics with vessel wall growth and remodeling (G&R) is crucial for understanding
pathology at distal vasculature to study progression of incurable vascular diseases, such as pulmonary
arterial hypertension. The present study is the first modeling attempt that focuses on defining
homeostatic baseline values in distal pulmonary vascular bed via, a so-called, homeostatic optimization.
To define the vascular homeostasis and total hemodynamics in the vascular tree, we consider two
time-scales: a cardiac cycle and a longer period of vascular adaptations. An iterative homeostatic
optimization is performed at the slow-time scale and incorporates: an extended Murray's law, wall
metabolic cost function, stress equilibrium, and hemodynamics. The pulmonary arterial network
of small vessels is represented by a fractal bifurcating tree. The pulsatile blood flow is described
by a Womersley's deformable wall analytical solution. A vessel wall mechanical response is described
by the constrained mixture theory for an orthotropic membrane and then linearized around mean pressure.
Wall material parameters are characterized by using available porcine pulmonary artery experiments
and human data from literature. Illustrative examples for symmetric and asymmetric fractal trees
are presented to provide homeostatic values in normal subjects. We also outline the key ideas for
the derivation of a temporal multiscale formalism to justify the proposed one-way coupled system
of governing equations and identify the inherent assumptions. The developed framework demonstrates
a potential for advanced parametric studies and future G&R and hemodynamics modeling in pulmonary
arterial hypertension.
