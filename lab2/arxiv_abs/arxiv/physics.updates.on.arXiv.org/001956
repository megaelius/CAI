In the present study, we have studied the electro-hydrodynamic of a physical system where a Newtonian
dielectric liquid column or droplet suspended in another Newtonian dielectric liquid medium in
presence of a simple shear flow. Taking both the phases as leaky dielectric and perfect dielectric
in to consideration, we have performed 2D numerical solution for capturing the essential features
of droplet deformation in between the parallel plate configuration. For a perfect dielectric system,
this study shows that the deformation characteristic follows a monotonic as well as non-monotonic
variation with domain confinement depending on the values of electrical permittivity ratio of
the droplet and the surrounding fluid. For a leaky-dielectric system, presence of small conductivity
further alters the deformation characteristic and it is happened that, at low electric field strength,
the deformation increases with confinement monotonically. On contrary, deformation parameter
shows non-monotonic variation with the domain confinement at higher electric field strength.
Furthermore, in confined domain, the transient evolution of the deformation parameter is also
markedly altered by the electric field strength in terms of steady state value of the deformation
parameter and steady state time. Finally, the present analysis shows that the domain confinement
significantly augment the deformation parameter in presence of electric field that leads to possible
droplet break up phenomenon. From the present study, it is worthy to mention that domain confinement
can be used to modulate the droplet morphology that has potential applications in modern-days droplet-based
micro-fluidic devices.
