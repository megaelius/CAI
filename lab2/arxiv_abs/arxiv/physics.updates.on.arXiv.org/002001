While it is widely acknowledged that quantum theory is strange, and that the world view it implies
is elusive, there is considerably less consensus as to why this is the case. This article will explore
the possibility that the theory may be opaque because the mathematical language it employs is inarticulate.
To address this possibility, three interconnected mathematical theories will be developed, each
specifically designed to handle aspects of quantum theory's subject matter. The first will describe
dynamic systems in terms that are general enough to be applicable to any kind dynamics, including
both classical and quantum. That description will then be used to construct a theory of experiments,
with the aim of understanding what types of experiments scientific methodology allows. Finally,
the theory of experiments will found a theory of experimental probabilities applicable to any collection
of experiments, so long as their probabilities are internally consistent. The resulting over-arching
mathematical language will then be applied to quantum physics. In the initial application, it will
be used to explain the core nature and structure of quantum measurement and probability. Following
that, it will be used to construct a large class of conceptually simple systems that are capable of
displaying the full range of quantum behavior. The properties that define this class of systems
will be in accord with experimental results, leaving open the possibility that the physical universe
may be describable as such a system. The more immediate conclusion, however, will be the that systems
that posses quantum behavior may be neither strange nor elusive.
