We study numerically the properties of (statistically) homogeneous soliton gas depending on soliton
density (proportional to number of solitons per unit length) and soliton velocities, in the framework
of the focusing one-dimensional Nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger (NLS) equation. In order to model such
gas we use N-soliton solutions (N-SS) with $N\sim 100$, which we generate with specific implementation
of the dressing method combined with 100-digits arithmetics. We examine the major statistical
characteristics, in particular the kinetic and potential energies, the kurtosis, the wave-action
spectrum and the probability density function (PDF) of wave intensity. We show that in the case of
small soliton density the kinetic and potential energies, as well as the kurtosis, are very well
described by the analytical relations derived without taking into account soliton interactions.
With increasing soliton density and velocities, soliton interactions enhance, and we observe
increasing deviations from these relations leading to increased absolute values for all of these
three characteristics. The wave-action spectrum is smooth, decays close to exponentially at large
wavenumbers and widens with increasing soliton density and velocities. The PDF of wave intensity
deviates from the exponential (Rayleigh) PDF drastically for rarefied soliton gas, transforming
much closer to it at densities corresponding to essential interaction between the solitons. Rogue
waves emerging in soliton gas are multi-soliton collisions, and yet some of them have spatial profiles
very similar to those of the Peregrine solutions of different orders. We present example of three-soliton
collision, for which even the temporal behavior of the maximal amplitude is very well approximated
by the Peregrine solution of the second order.
