A summary of photo- and electrochemical surface modifications applied on single-crystalline
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond films is given. The covalently bonded formation of amine-
and phenyl-linker molecule layers are characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), cyclic voltammetry and field-effect transistor characterization
experiments. Amine- and phenyl-layers are very different with respect to formation, growth, thickness
and molecule arrangement. We detect a single molecular layer of amine linker-molecules on diamond
with a density of about 1014 cm-2 (10 % of carbon bonds). Amine molecules are bonded only on initially
H-terminated surface areas to carbon. In case of electrochemical deposition of phenyl-layers,
multi-layer formation is detected due to three dimensional (3D) growths. This gives rise to the
formation of typically 25 {\AA} thick layers. The electrochemical grafting of boron doped diamond
works on H-terminated and oxidized surfaces. After reacting of such films with heterobifunctional
crosslinker-molecules, thiol-modified ss-DNA markers are bonded to the organic system. Application
of fluorescence and atomic force microscopy on hybridized DNA films show dense arrangements with
densities up to 1013 cm-2. The DNA is tilted by an angle of about 35o with respect to the diamond surface.
Shortening the bonding time of thiol-modified ss-DNA to 10 minutes cause a decrease of DNA density
to about 1012 cm-2. Application of AFM scratching experiments show threshold removal forces around
75 nN for DNA bonded on phenyl linker-molecules and of about 45 nN for DNA bonded to amine linker-molecules.
DNA sensor applications using Fe(CN6)3-/4- mediator redox-molecules, impedance spectroscopy
and DNA-field effect transistor devices performances are introduced and discussed.
