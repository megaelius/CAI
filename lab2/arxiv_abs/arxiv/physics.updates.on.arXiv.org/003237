Semi-local density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy of a many-electron system
cannot be exact for all one-electron densities. In 1981, Perdew and Zunger (PZ) subtracted the fully-nonlocal
self-interaction error orbital-by-orbital, making the corrected functional exact for all collections
of separated one-electron densities, and making no correction to the exact functional. Although
the PZ self-interaction correction (SIC) eliminates many errors of semi-local functionals, it
is often worse for equilibrium properties of sp-bonded molecules and solids. Non-empirical semi-local
functionals are usually designed to be exact for electron gases of uniform density, and thus also
make 0% error for neutral atoms in the limit of large atomic number Z, but PZ SIC is not so designed.
For localized SIC orbitals, we show analytically that the SIC correlation energy per electron of
the uniform gas in the high-density limit makes an error of -50% in the spin-unpolarized case, and
-100% in the fully-spin-polarized case. Then we extrapolate from the Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms to estimate
the relative errors of the PZ SIC exchange-correlation energies (with localized SIC orbitals)
in the limit of large atomic number: +5.5% for the local spin density approximation (LSDA-SIC),
and -3.5% for nonempirical generalized gradient (PBE-SIC) and meta-generalized gradient (SCAN-SIC)
approximations. The SIC errors are considerably larger than those that have been estimated for
LSDA-SIC by approximating the localized SIC orbitals for the uniform gas, and may explain the errors
of PZ SIC for equilibrium properties, opening the door to a generalized SIC that is more widely accurate.
