We conducted direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of turbulent flow over three-dimensional sinusoidal
roughness in a channel. A passive scalar is present in the flow with Prandtl number $Pr=0.7$, to study
heat transfer by forced convection over this rough surface. The minimal channel is used to circumvent
the high cost of simulating high Reynolds number flows, which enables a range of rough surfaces to
be efficiently simulated. The near-wall temperature profile in the minimal channel agrees well
with that of the conventional full-span channel, indicating it can be readily used for heat-transfer
studies at a much reduced cost compared to conventional DNS. As the roughness Reynolds number, $k^+$,
is increased, the Hama roughness function, $\Delta U^+$, increases in the transitionally rough
regime before tending towards the fully rough asymptote of $\kappa_m^{-1}\log(k^+)+C$, where
$C$ is a constant that depends on the particular roughness geometry and $\kappa_m\approx0.4$ is
the von K\'arm\'an constant. In this fully rough regime, the skin-friction coefficient is constant
with bulk Reynolds number, $Re_b$. Meanwhile, the temperature difference between smooth- and
rough-wall flows, $\Delta\Theta^+$, appears to tend towards a constant value, $\Delta\Theta^+_{FR}$.
This corresponds to the Stanton number (the temperature analogue of the skin-friction coefficient)
monotonically decreasing with $Re_b$ in the fully rough regime. Using shifted logarithmic velocity
and temperature profiles, the heat transfer law as described by the Stanton number in the fully rough
regime can be derived once both the equivalent sand-grain roughness $k_s/k$ and the temperature
difference $\Delta \Theta^+_{FR}$ are known. In meteorology, this corresponds to the ratio of
momentum and heat transfer roughness lengths, $z_{0m}/z_{0h}$, being linearly proportional
to $z_{0m}^+$, the momentum roughness length [continued]...
