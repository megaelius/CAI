When an elastic object is dragged through a viscous fluid tangent to a rigid boundary, it experiences
a lift force perpendicular to its direction of motion. An analogous lift mechanism occurs when a
rigid symmetric object translates parallel to an elastic interface or a soft substrate. The induced
lift force is attributed to an elastohydrodynamic coupling that arises from the breaking of the
flow reversal symmetry induced by the elastic deformation of the translating object or the interface.
Here we derive explicit analytical expressions for the quasi-steady state lift force exerted on
a rigid spherical particle translating parallel to a finite-sized membrane exhibiting a resistance
toward both shear and bending. Our analytical approach proceeds through the application of the
Lorentz reciprocal theorem so as to obtain the solution of the flow problem using a perturbation
technique for small deformations of the membrane. We find that the shear-related contribution
to the normal force leads to an attractive interaction between the particle and the membrane. This
emerging attractive force decreases quadratically with the system size to eventually vanish in
the limit of an infinitely-extended membrane. In contrast, membrane bending leads to a repulsive
interaction whose effect becomes more pronounced upon increasing the system size, where the lift
force is found to diverge logarithmically for an infinitely-large membrane. The unphysical divergence
of the bending-induced lift force can be rendered finite by regularizing the solution with a cut-off
length beyond which the bending forces become subdominant to an external body force.
