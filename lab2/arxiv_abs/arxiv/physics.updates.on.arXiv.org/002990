The recent update of dosimetric key data by the `International Commission on Radiation Units and
Measurements' impacts the computation of beam quality correction factors $k_Q$ via changes of
several key data, such as the the mean excitation energies, $I$, which enters the stopping power
computation for water and air, the computation procedure itself, the average energy expended in
the production of an ion pair in air, $W/e$, and the chamber perturbation factors. An accurate assessment
of water-to-air stopping-power ratio, $s_{\rm w,air}$, in reference conditions with new recommendation
is necessary to update the dosimetry protocols for carbon ion beams. The new ICRU90 key data were
considered for computation of $s_{\rm w,air}$ for carbon ion beams using different reference conditions
using Monte Carlo transport simulations, namely, monoenergetic carbon ion beams with range in
water from 3 to 30\,cm and Spread-Out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) of different widths and depths in water.
New recommendations for $s_{\rm w,air}$ are presented, namely 1.1247 for the reference condition
of 1\,g\,cm$^{-2}$ depth for monoenergetic carbon ion beams and 1.1274 at the center of physically-optimized
SOBPs. The recommendation of a constant value (1.126) represents the stopping-power ratio within
a variation of $s_{\rm w,air}$ for the different reference conditions within 0.3\,\%. The impact
of these new $s_{\rm w,air}$ values and the updated key data on the $k_Q$ for carbon ion beams was evaluated
in a second step. The changes were found to agree very well with experimental data for the case of cylindrical
chambers, but large discrepancies are observed for plate-parallel chamber.
