Ultrafast fiber lasers play important roles in many aspects of our life for their various applications
in fields ranging from fundamental sciences to industrial purposes. Passive mode-locking technique
is a key step to realize the ultrafast soliton fiber lasers. However, the booting dynamics of the
soliton fiber lasers have not yet been well understood. Herein, we reveal the soliton buildup dynamics
of ultrafast fiber lasers operating both in anomalous and net-normal dispersion regimes. Based
on the advanced experimental methodologies of spatio-temporal reconstruction and dispersive
Fourier transform (DFT), the soliton booting dynamics are analyzed in the time and spectral domains.
It was found that the booting dynamics of conventional and dissipative solitons operating in the
anomalous and net-normal dispersion regimes, respectively, are different from each other due
to the different pulse shaping mechanisms. In particular, the spectral interference pattern with
strong relaxation oscillation behavior was observed near the mode-locking transition for conventional
soliton, while no relaxation oscillation of spectral pattern was obtained for dissipative soliton.
We firstly revealed that the spectral pattern distributions are induced by the transient structured
soliton formation during the pulse shaping from the noise background. The experimental results
were verified by the theoretical simulations. The obtained results would provide a general guideline
for understanding the soliton booting dynamics in ultrafast fiber lasers, and will prove to be fruitful
to the various communities interested in solitons and fiber lasers.
