The fields of astronomy and astrophysics are currently engaged in an unprecedented era of discovery
as recent missions have revealed thousands of exoplanets orbiting other stars. While the Kepler
Space Telescope mission has enabled most of these exoplanets to be detected by identifying transiting
events, exoplanets often exhibit additional photometric effects that can be used to improve the
characterization of exoplanets. The EXONEST Exoplanetary Explorer is a Bayesian exoplanet inference
engine based on nested sampling and originally designed to analyze archived Kepler Space Telescope
and CoRoT (Convection Rotation et Transits plan\'etaires) exoplanet mission data. We discuss
the EXONEST software package and describe how it accommodates plug-and-play models of exoplanet-associated
photometric effects for the purpose of exoplanet detection, characterization and scientific
hypothesis testing. The current suite of models allows for both circular and eccentric orbits in
conjunction with photometric effects, such as the primary transit and secondary eclipse, reflected
light, thermal emissions, ellipsoidal variations, Doppler beaming and superrotation. We discuss
our new efforts to expand the capabilities of the software to include more subtle photometric effects
involving reflected and refracted light. We discuss the EXONEST inference engine design and introduce
our plans to port the current MATLAB-based EXONEST software package over to the next generation
Exoplanetary Explorer, which will be a Python-based open source project with the capability to
employ third-party plug-and-play models of exoplanet-related photometric effects.
