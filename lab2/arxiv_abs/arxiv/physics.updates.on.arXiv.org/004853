We investigate the role played by the bidispersity of polymer chains on the local structure and the
potential of mean force (PMF) between silica nanoparticles (NPs) in a polystyrene melt. We use the
hybrid particle-field molecular dynamics technique which allows to efficiently relax polymer
nanocomposites even with high molecular weights.The NPs we investigate are either bare or grafted
with polystyrene chains immersed in a melt of free polystyrene chains, whereas the grafted and the
free polystyrene chains are either monodisperse or bidisperse. The two-body PMF shows that a bidisperse
distribution of free polymer chains increases the strength of attraction between a pair of ungrafted
NPs. If the NPs are grafted by polymer chains, the effective interaction crucially depends on bidispersity
and grafting density of the polymer chains: for low grafting densities, the bidispersity of both
free and grafted chains increases the repulsion between the NPs, whereas for high grafting densities
we observe two different effects. An increase of bidispersity in free chains causes the rise of the
repulsion between the NPs, while an increase of bidispersity in grafted chains promotes the rise
of attraction. Additionally, a proper treatment of multi-body interactions improves the simpler
two-body PMF calculations, in both unimodal and bimodal cases. We found that, by properly tuning
the bidispersity of both free and grafted chains, we can control the structure of the composite materials,
which can be confirmed by experimental observations. As a result, the hybrid particle-field approach
is confirmed to be a valid tool for reproducing and predicting microscopic interactions, which
determine the stability of the microscopic structure of the composite in a wide range of conditions.
