A novel 5th-order shock capturing scheme is presented in this paper. The scheme, so-called P4-THINC-BVD
(4th degree polynomial and THINC reconstruction based on BVD algorithm), is formulated as a two-stage
cascade BVD (Boundary Variation Diminishing) algorithm following the BVD principle that minimizes
the jumps of reconstructed values at cell boundaries. In the P4-THINC-BVD scheme, polynomial of
degree four and THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing) functions with adaptive steepness
are used as the candidate reconstruction functions. The final reconstruction function is selected
from the candidate functions by a two-stage cascade BVD algorithm so as to effectively control numerical
oscillation and dissipation. Spectral analysis and numerical verifications show that the P4-THINC-BVD
scheme possesses the following desirable properties: 1) it effectively suppresses spurious numerical
oscillation in the presence of strong shock or discontinuity; 2) it substantially reduces numerical
dissipation errors; 3) it automatically retrieves the underlying linear 5th-order upwind scheme
for smooth solution over all wave numbers; 4) it is able to resolve both smooth and discontinuous
flow structures of all scales with substantially improved solution quality in comparison to other
existing methods; and 5) it faithfully maintains the free-mode solutions in long term computation.
P4-THINC-BVD, as well as the underlying idea presented in this paper, provides an innovative and
practical approach to design high-fidelity numerical schemes for compressible flows involving
strong discontinuities and flow structures of wide range scales.
