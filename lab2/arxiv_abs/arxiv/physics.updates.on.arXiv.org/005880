Depleted oil fields in the Gulf of Suez (Egypt) can serve as geothermal reservoirs for power generation
using a CO2-Plume Geothermal (CPG) system, while geologically sequestering CO2. This entails
the injection of a substantial amount of CO2 into the highly permeable brine-saturated Nubian Sandstone.
Numerical models of two-phase flow processes are indispensable for predicting the CO2-plume migration
at a representative geological scale. Such models require reliable constitutive relationships,
including relative permeability and capillary pressure curves. In this study, quasi-static pore-network
modelling has been used to simulate the equilibrium positions of fluid-fluid interfaces, and thus
determine the capillary pressure and relative permeability curves. Three-dimensional images
with a voxel size of 0.65 micro m3 of a Nubian Sandstone rock sample have been obtained using Synchrotron
Radiation X-ray Tomographic Microscopy. From the images, topological properties of pores/throats
were constructed. Using a pore-network model, we performed a sequential primary drainage-main
imbibition cycle of quasi-static invasion in order to quantify (1) the CO2 and brine relative permeability
curves, (2) the effect of initial wetting-phase saturation (i.e. the saturation at the point of
reversal from drainage to imbibition) on the residual-trapping potential, and (3) study the relative
permeability-saturation hysteresis. The results improve our understanding of the potential
magnitude of capillary trapping in Nubian Sandstone, essential for future field-scale simulations.
Further, an initial basin-scale assessment of CO2 storage capacity, which incorporates capillary
trapping, yields a range of 14-49 GtCO2 in Nubian Sandstone, Gulf of Suez Basin.
