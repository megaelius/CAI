Tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle can reveal a new, composition dependent, force of nature
or disprove many models of new physics. For the first time such a test is successfully carried out
in space by the MICROSCOPE satellite. Early results show no violation sourced by the Earth for Pt
and Ti test masses with random errors (after 8.26d of integration time) of about 1 part in 1e14, and
similar systematic errors.It improves by 10 times over the best ground tests with rotating torsion
balances despite 70 times less sensitivity to differential accelerations, thanks to the much stronger
driving signal in orbit. The test is limited by thermal noise from internal damping in the gold wires
used for electrical grounding. This noise was shown to decrease when the s/c was set to rotate faster
than planned. The result will improve by the end of the mission, as thermal noise decreases with more
data. Not so systematic errors. We investigate major non-gravitational effects and find that the
Pt-Pt sensor does not allow their separation from the signal. The early test reports an upper limit
of systematic errors in the Pt-Ti sensor which are not detected in the Pt-Pt one, hence would not be
distinguished from a violation. Once all the integration time is used to reduce random noise there
will be no time left to check systematics. MICROSCOPE demonstrates the huge potential of space for
WEP tests of very high precision and indicates how to reach it. To realize the potential, a new experiment
needs the spacecraft to be in rapid, stable rotation around the symmetry axis, needs high quality
state-of-the-art mechanical suspensions, and must allow systematic checks. The design of the
"Galileo Galilei" (GG) experiment, aiming to test the WEP to 1 part in 1e17 unites all the needed features,
indicating that a quantum leap in space is possible provided the new experiment heeds the lessons
of MICROSCOPE.
