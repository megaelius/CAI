Extracting actionable insight from complex unlabeled scientific data is an open challenge and
key to unlocking data-driven discovery in science. Complementary and alternative to supervised
machine learning approaches, unsupervised physics-based methods based on behavior-driven theories
hold great promise. Due to computational limitations, practical application on real-world domain
science problems has lagged far behind theoretical development. We present our first step towards
bridging this divide - DisCo - a high-performance distributed workflow for the behavior-driven
local causal state theory. DisCo provides a scalable unsupervised physics-based representation
learning method that decomposes spatiotemporal systems into their structurally relevant components,
which are captured by the latent local causal state variables. Complex spatiotemporal systems
are generally highly structured and organize around a lower-dimensional skeleton of coherent
structures, and in several firsts we demonstrate the efficacy of DisCo in capturing such structures
from observational and simulated scientific data. To the best of our knowledge, DisCo is also the
first application software developed entirely in Python to scale to over 1000 machine nodes, providing
good performance along with ensuring domain scientists' productivity. We developed scalable,
performant methods optimized for Intel many-core processors that will be upstreamed to open-source
Python library packages. Our capstone experiment, using newly developed DisCo workflow and libraries,
performs unsupervised spacetime segmentation analysis of CAM5.1 climate simulation data, processing
an unprecedented 89.5 TB in 6.6 minutes end-to-end using 1024 Intel Haswell nodes on the Cori supercomputer
obtaining 91% weak-scaling and 64% strong-scaling efficiency.
