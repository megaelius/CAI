We propose and theoretically analyze a new vibrational spectroscopy, termed "electron- and light-induced
stimulated Raman" (ELISR) scattering, that combines the high spatial resolution of electron microscopy
with the molecular sensitivity of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. With ELISR, electron-beam
excitation of plasmonic nanoparticles is utilized as a spectrally-broadband but spatially-confined
Stokes beam, while a diffraction-limited laser is used as the pump beam. To characterize this technique,
we develop a numerical model and conduct full-field electromagnetic simulations to investigate
two different nanoparticle geometries, nanorods and nanospheres, coated with a Raman-active
material. We show that with dual electron and optical excitation of nanorods, Raman gain exceeding
10$\%$ can be achieved with an optical pump intensity of 1 mW/$\mu$m$^2$. The stimulated Raman enhancement
is maximized when the electron beam is positioned at the tip of nanoparticle, where the plasmon excitation
is most efficient, and drops to half its value within 5 nm of the nanoparticle tip. Moreover, the stimulated
Raman enhancement is maximized when the wavelength of the Raman shift matches the resonant wavelength
of the nanoparticle. The spatial resolution of this vibrational spectroscopy for electron microscopy
is solely determined by the nanoparticle geometry and mode volume. Our results show the promise
of ELISR for simultaneous high-resolution electron microscopy with sub-diffraction-limited
Raman spectroscopy, complementing advances in superresolution microscopy, correlated light
and electron microscopy, and vibrational electron energy loss spectroscopy.
