The driving force behind the origin and evolution of life has been the thermodynamic imperative
of increasing the entropy production of the biosphere through increasing the global solar photon
dissipation rate. In the upper atmosphere of today, oxygen and ozone derived from life processes
are performing the short wavelength UVC and UVB dissipation. On Earth's surface, water and organic
pigments in water facilitate the near UV and visible photon dissipation. The first organic pigments
probably formed, absorbed, and dissipated at those photochemically active wavelengths in the
UVC that could have reached Earth's surface during the Archean. Proliferation of these pigments
can be understood as an autocatalytic photochemical process obeying non-equilibrium thermodynamic
directives related to increasing solar photon dissipation rate. Under these directives, organic
pigments would have evolved over time to increase the global photon dissipation rate by; 1) increasing
the ratio of their effective photon cross sections to their physical size, 2) decreasing their electronic
excited state life times, 3) quenching non-radiative de-excitation channels (e.g. fluorescence),
4) covering ever more completely the solar spectrum, and 5) dispersing into an ever greater surface
area of Earth. From knowledge of the evolution of the spectrum of G-type stars, and considering the
most probable history of the transparency of Earths atmosphere, we construct the most probable
surface solar spectrum as a function of time and compare this with the history of molecular absorption
maxima obtained from the available data in the literature. This comparison supports the thermodynamic
dissipation theory for the origin of life, constrains models for Earth's early atmosphere, and
sheds some new light on the origin of photosynthesis.
