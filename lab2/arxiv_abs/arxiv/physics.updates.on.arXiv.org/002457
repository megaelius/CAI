Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as an alternative way of solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) without the need of building elaborate grids, instead,
using a straightforward implementation. In particular, in addition to the deep neural network
(DNN) for the solution, a second DNN is considered that represents the residual of the PDE. The residual
is then combined with the mismatch in the given data of the solution in order to formulate the loss
function. This framework is effective but is lacking uncertainty quantification of the solution
due to the inherent randomness in the data or due to the approximation limitations of the DNN architecture.
Here, we propose a new method with the objective of endowing the DNN with uncertainty quantification
for both sources of uncertainty, i.e., the parametric uncertainty and the approximation uncertainty.
We first account for the parametric uncertainty when the parameter in the differential equation
is represented as a stochastic process. Multiple DNNs are designed to learn the modal functions
of the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) expansion of its solution by using stochastic data from
sparse sensors. We can then make predictions from new sensor measurements very efficiently with
the trained DNNs. Moreover, we employ dropout to correct the over-fitting and also to quantify the
uncertainty of DNNs in approximating the modal functions. We then design an active learning strategy
based on the dropout uncertainty to place new sensors in the domain to improve the predictions of
DNNs. Several numerical tests are conducted for both the forward and the inverse problems to quantify
the effectiveness of PINNs combined with uncertainty quantification. This NN-aPC new paradigm
of physics-informed deep learning with uncertainty quantification can be readily applied to other
types of stochastic PDEs in multi-dimensions.
