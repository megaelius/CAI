In this paper, a unified gas kinetic scheme with adaptive velocity space (AUGKS) for multiscale
flow transport will be developed. In near-equilibrium flow regions, particle distribution function
is close to the Chapman-Enskog expansion and can be formulated with a continuous velocity space,
where only macroscopic conservative variables are updated. With the emerging of non-equilibrium
effects, the AUGKS automatically switches to a discrete velocity space to follow the evolution
of particle distribution function. Based on the Chapman-Enskog expansion, a criterion is proposed
in this paper to quantify the intensity of non-equilibrium effects and is used for the continuous-discrete
velocity space transformation. Following the scale-dependent local evolution solution, the
AUGKS presents the discretized gas dynamic equations directly on the cell size and time step scales,
i.e., the so-called direct modeling method. As a result, the scheme is able to capture the cross-scale
flow physics from particle transport to hydrodynamic wave propagation, and provides a continuous
variation of solutions from the Boltzmann to the Navier-Stokes. Under the unified framework, different
from conventional DSMC-NS hybrid method, the AUGKS does not need a buffer zone to match up kinetic
and hydrodynamic solutions. Instead, a continuous and discrete particle velocity space is naturally
connected, which is feasible for the numerical simulations with unsteadiness or complex geometries.
Compared with the asymptotic preserving (AP) methods which solves kinetic equations uniformly
over the entire flow field with discretized velocity space, the current velocity-space adaptive
unified scheme speeds up the computation and reduces the memory requirement in multiscale flow
problems, and maintains the equivalent accuracy. The AUGKS provides an effective tool for non-equilibrium
flow simulations.
