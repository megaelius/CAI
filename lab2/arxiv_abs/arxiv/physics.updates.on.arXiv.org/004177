During the 2017 record-breaking burning season in Canada / United States, intense wild fires raged
during the first week of September in the Pacific northwestern region (British Columbia, Alberta,
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and northern California) burning mostly temperate coniferous
forests. The heavy loads of smoke particles emitted in the atmosphere reached the Iberian Peninsula
(IP) a few days later on 7 and 8 September. Satellite imagery allows to identify two main smoke clouds
emitted during two different periods that were injected and transported in the atmosphere at several
altitude levels. Columnar properties on 7 and 8 September at two Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)
mid-altitude, background sites in northern and southern Spain are: aerosol optical depth (AOD)
at 440 nm up to 0.62, Angstrom exponent of 1.6-1.7, large dominance of small particles (fine mode
fraction > 0.88), low absorption AOD at 440 nm (<0.008) and large single scattering albedo at 440
nm (>0.98). Profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) show
the presence of smoke particles in the stratosphere during the transport, whereas the smoke is only
observed in the troposphere at its arrival over the IP. Portuguese and Spanish ground lidar stations
from the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network / Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure
Network (EARLINET/ACTRIS) and the Micro-Pulse Lidar NETwork (MPLNET) reveal smoke plumes with
different properties: particle depolarization ratio and color ratio, respectively, of 0.05 and
2.5 in the mid troposphere (5-9 km) and of 0.10 and 3.0 in the upper troposphere (10-13 km). In the mid
troposphere the particle depolarization ratio does not seem time-dependent during the transport
whereas the color ratio seems to increase (larger particles sediment first).
