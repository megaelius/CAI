In this work, we examine a spherically symmetric compact body with isotropic pressure profile,
in this context we obtain a new class of exact solutions of Einstein's-Maxwell field equation for
compact stars with uniform charged distributions on the basis of Pseudo-spheroidal space-time
with a particular form of electric field intensity and the metric potential g_rr. Indicating these
two parameters takes into account further examination to be done in deciding unknown constants
and depicts the compact strange star candidates likes PSR J1614-2230, 4U 1608-52, SAX J1808.4-3658,
4U 1538-52, SMC X-1, Her X-1, and Cen X-3. By the isotropic Tolman-Oppenhimer-Volkoff(TOV)equation,
We explore the equilibrium among hydrostatic, gravitational and electric forces. Then, we analyze
the stability of the model through the adiabatic index(gamma) and velocity of sound (0 <dp/c^2dr<
1). we additionally talk about other physical features of this model like, for example, the pressure,
redshift, density, energy conditions and mass-radius of the stars in detail and demonstrate that
our results are satisfying all the basic prerequisites of a physically legitimate stellar model.
We have seen the measurement of basic physical parameter such as pressure, density, energy and redshift
are satisfied the reality condition. All the physical quantities such as density, pressure pressure-density
ratio and speed of sound is monotonically decreasing. The outcomes acquired are valuable in exploring
the strength of other compact objects like white dwarfs, gravastars and neutron stars. Finally,
we have shown that the obtained solutions are compatible with observational data for compact objects.
