Quantitative evaluation of tunable diode laser induced fluorescence (TDLIF) measurements in
magnetized plasma take into account Zeeman splitting of energetic levels and intra-multiplet
mixing defining the density distribution (alignment) of excited $\mathrm{2p_8}$ multiplet is
discussed in this paper. TDLIF measurements were used to evaluate light-transport properties
in a strongly magnetized optically thick argon plasma under different pressure conditions. Therefore,
a coupled system of rate balance equations were constructed to describe laser pumping of individual
magnetic sub-levels of $\mathrm{2p_8}$ state through frequency separated sub-transitions originating
from $\mathrm{1s_4}$ magnetic sub-levels. The density distribution of $\mathrm{2p_8}$ multiplet
was described by balancing laser pumping with losses including radiative decay, transfer of excitation
between the neighboring multiplets driven by neutral collisions and quenching due to electron
and neutral collisions. Resulting $\mathrm{2p_8}$ magnetic sub-level densities were then used
to model polarization dependent fluorescence, consider self-absorption, which could be directly
compared with measured polarization resolved TDLIF measurements. This enables to obtain unique
solutions for the $\mathrm{1s_4}$ and $\mathrm{1s_5}$ magnetic sub-level densities which were
in good agreement with the densities obtained by laser absorption measurements. It is shown that
LIF measurements in magnetized plasma conditions have strong pressure dependence that should
be corrected consider effective disalignment rate. The presented measurement method and model
can help further understanding and improve description of optical emission of argon in magnetized
conditions.
