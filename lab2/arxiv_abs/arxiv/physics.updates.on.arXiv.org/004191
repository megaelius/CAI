The propagation and transformation of water waves over varying bathymetries is a subject of fundamental
interest to ocean, coastal and harbor engineers. The specific bathymetry considered in this paper
consists of one or two, naturally formed or man-made, trenches. The problem we focus on is the transformation
of an incoming solitary wave by the trench(es), and the impact of the resulting wave system on a vertical
wall located after the trench(es). The maximum run-up and the maximum force exerted on the wall are
calculated for various lengths and heights of the trench(es), and are compared with the corresponding
quantities in the absence of them. The calculations have been performed by using the fully nonlinear
water-wave equations, in the form of the Hamiltonian coupled-mode theory, recently developed
in Papoutsellis et al (Eur. J. Mech. B/Fluids, Vol. 72, 2018, pp. 199-224). Comparisons of the calculated
free-surface elevation with existing experimental results indicate that the effect of the vortical
flow, inevitably developed within and near the trench(es) but not captured by any potential theory,
is not important concerning the frontal wave flow regime. This suggests that the predictions of
the run-up and the force on the wall by nonlinear potential theory are expected to be nearly realistic.
The main conclusion of our investigation is that the presence of two tandem trenches in front of the
wall may reduce the run-up from (about) 20% to 45% and the force from 15% to 38%, depending on the trench
dimensions and the wave amplitude. The percentage reduction is greater for higher waves. The presence
of only one trench leads to reductions 1.4 - 1.7 times smaller.
