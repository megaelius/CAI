The Inner Tracking System (ITS) of the ALICE experiment will be upgraded during the second long LHC
shutdown in $\mathrm{2019}-\mathrm{2020}$. The main goal of the ALICE ITS Upgrade is to enable
high precision measurements of low - momentum particles (< 1 GeV/c) by acquiring a large sample of
events, benefiting from the increase of the LHC instantaneous luminosity of $\mathrm{Pb}-\mathrm{Pb}$
collisions to $\mathcal{L} = 6 \cdot 10^{27} cm^{-2} s^{-1} $ during Run 3. Working in this direction
the ITS upgrade project is focusing on the increase of the readout rate, on the improvement of the
impact parameter resolution, as well as on the improvement of the tracking efficiency and the position
resolution. The major setup modification is the substitution of the current ITS with seven layers
of silicon pixel detectors. The ALPIDE chip, a CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS), was developed
for this purpose and offers a spatial resolution of 5 $\mu$m. The use of MAPS together with a stringent
mechanical design allows for the reduction of the material budget down to 0.35% $X_0$ for the innermost
layers and 1% $X_0$ for the outer layers. The detector design was validated during the research and
development period through a variety of tests ensuring the proper operation for the full lifetime
inside ALICE. The production phase is close to completion with all the new assembled components
undergoing different tests that aim to characterize the modules and staves and determine their
qualification level. This contribution describes the detector design, the measurements performed
during the research and development phase, as well as the production status.
