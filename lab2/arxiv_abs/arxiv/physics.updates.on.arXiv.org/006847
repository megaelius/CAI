Reflection seismic imaging usually suffers from a loss of resolution and contrast because of the
fluctuations of the wave velocities in the Earth's crust. In the literature, phase distortion issues
are generally circumvented by means of a background wave velocity model. However, it requires a
prior tomography of the wave velocity distribution in the medium, which is often not possible, especially
in depth. In this paper, a matrix approach of seismic imaging is developed to retrieve a three-dimensional
image of the subsoil, despite a rough knowledge of the background wave velocity. To do so, passive
noise cross-correlations between geophones of a seismic array are investigated under a matrix
formalism. More precisely, the detrimental effect of wave velocity fluctuations on imaging is
overcome by introducing a novel mathematical object: The distortion matrix. This operator essentially
connects any virtual source inside the medium with the distortion that a wavefront, emitted from
that point, experiences due to heterogeneities. A time reversal analysis of the distortion matrix
enables the estimation of the transmission matrix that links each real geophone at the surface and
each virtual geophone in depth. Phase distortions can then be compensated for any point of the underground.
Applied to seismic data recorded along the Clark branch of the San Jacinto fault zone, the present
method is shown to provide an image of the fault until a depth of 4 km with a transverse resolution of
80 m. Strikingly, this resolution is almost one eighth below the diffraction limit imposed by the
geophone array aperture. The heterogeneities of the subsoil play the role of a scattering lens and
of a transverse wave guide which increase drastically the array aperture.
