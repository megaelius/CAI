In an earlier paper, Oruba, Soward & Dormy (J.Fluid Mech., vol.818, 2017, pp.205-240) considered
the primary quasi-steady geostrophic (QG) motion of a constant density fluid of viscosity $\nu$
that occurs during linear spin-down in a cylindrical container of radius $L$ and height $H$, rotating
rapidly (angular velocity $\Omega$) about its axis of symmetry subject to mixed rigid and stress-free
boundary conditions for the case $L=H$. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) at large $L= 10 H$ and
Ekman number $E=\nu/H^2\Omega=10^{-3}$ by Oruba, Soward & Dormy (J.Fluid Mech., sub judice and
referred to as Part I) reveals significant inertial wave activity on the spin-down time-scale.
The analytic study in Part I, based on $E\ll 1$, builds on the results of Greenspan & Howard (J.Fluid
Mech., vol.17, 1963, pp.385-404) for an infinite plane layer $L\to\infty$. At large but finite
distance $r^\dag$ from the symmetry axis, the meridional (QG-)flow, that causes the QG-spin down,
is blocked by the lateral boundary $r^\dag=L$, which provides the primary QG-trigger for the inertial
waves studied in Part I. For the laterally unbounded layer, Greenspan & Howard also identified inertial
waves of maximum frequency (MF), which are a manifestation of the transient Ekman layer. The blocking
of the MF-waves by the lateral boundary provides a secondary MF-trigger for yet more inertial waves.
Here we obtain analytic results for the wave activity caused by the combined-trigger (QG+MF) that
faithfully captures the character of the laterally unbounded base flow including its transients.
The results are compared with the inertial wave part of the DNS (the so called "filtered DNS" or simply
"FNS"), for which the agreement is excellent and accounts for minor discrepancies evident in the
Part I results for the QG-trigger.
