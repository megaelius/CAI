Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are now clearly a promising candidate in addressing the environmental
problems associated with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). However,
BEVs, unlike ICEVs, are still not widely accepted in the automobile market but continuing technological
change could overcome this barrier. The aim of this study is to assess and forecast whether and when
design changes and technological improvements related to major challenges in driving range and
battery cost will make the user value of BEVs greater than the user value of ICEVs. Specifically,
we estimate the relative user value of BEVs and ICEVs resulting after design modifications to achieve
different driving ranges by considering the engineering trade-offs based on a vehicle simulation.
Then, we analyze when the relative user value of BEVs is expected to exceed ICEVs as the energy density
and cost of batteries improve because of ongoing technological change. Our analysis demonstrates
that the relative value of BEVs is lower than that of ICEVs because BEVs have high battery cost and
high cost of time spent recharging despite high torque, high fuel efficiency, and low fuel cost.
Moreover, we found the relative value differences between BEVs and ICEVs are found to be less in high
performance large cars than in low performance compact cars because BEVs can achieve high acceleration
performance more easily than ICEVs. In addition, this study predicts that in approximately 2050,
high performance large BEVs could have higher relative value than high performance large ICEVs
because of technological improvements in batteries; however low performance compact BEVs are
still very likely to have significantly lower user value than comparable ICEVs until well beyond
2050.
