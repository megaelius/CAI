This paper discovers geometric unification theory of the grand unification and gravitational
interactions and their new physics according to the general fiber bundle theory, symmetry and so
on. Consequently, the research of this paper is based on the exact scientific bases of mathematics
and physics. The Lagrangians of the grand unification and gravitational interactions are unifiedly
deduced from quantitative causal principle (QCP) and satisfy the gauge invariant principle of
general gauge fields interacting with Fermion and/or boson fields. The geometry and physics meanings
of gauge invariant property of different physical systems are revealed, and it is discovered that
all the Lagrangians of the four fundamental physics interactions are composed of the invariant
quantities in corresponding spacetime structures. The difficulties that fundamental physics
interactions and Noether theorem are not able to be unifiedly given and investigated are overcome,
the geometric unification theory and origins of the four fundamental physics interactions and
Noether theorem are shown by QCP, their two-order general Euler-Lagrange Equations and corresponding
Noether conservation currents are derived in general curved spacetime. This paper further deduces
QCP from symmetric principle. Consequently, geometric unification theory of the grand unification
and gravitation theories and Noether theorem based on symmetric principle and the new physics are
given in this paper. This paper further gives the unification of QCP and symmetric principle. Thus,
this paper opens a door to both study and give new developments of geometric unification theory of
physics laws, and using the new geometric unification theory, a lot of research works about different
branches of physics can be anew done and expressed simpler with different symmetric characters.
