We develop a knowledge-based automated planning (KBAP) pipeline that generates treatment plans
using deep neural network architectures for predicting 3D doses. Our pipeline consisted of a generative
adversarial network (GAN) to predict dose from a CT image followed by two optimization models to
learn objective function weights and generate fluence-based plans, respectively. We investigated
three different GAN models. The first two models predicted dose for each axial slice independently.
One predicted dose as a RGB color map, while the other predicted a scalar value for dose directly.
The third GAN model predicted scalar doses for the full 3D CT image at once, considering correlations
between adjacent CT slices. For all models, we also investigated the impact of scaling the GAN predictions
before optimization. Each GAN model was trained on 130 previously delivered oropharyngeal treatment
plans. Performance was tested on 87 out-of-sample plans, by evaluating using clinical planning
criteria and compared to their corresponding clinical plans. The best performing KBAP plans were
generated with the 3D GAN, which predicted dose values followed by scaling. These plans satisfied
close to 77% of all clinical criteria, compared to the clinical plans, which satisfied 64% of all
criteria. Additionally, these KBAP plans satisfied the same criteria as the clinical plans 84%
more frequently compared to the 2D GAN model using RGB dose prediction. The 3D GAN predictions were
also more similar to the final plan compared to the other approaches, as it better captured the vertical
dosimetric relationship between adjacent axial slices. The deliverable plans better captured
implicit constraints associated with physical deliverability. Overall, our final plans had superior
performance in satisfying clinical criteria and generated more realistic predictions compared
to the previous state-of-the-art.
