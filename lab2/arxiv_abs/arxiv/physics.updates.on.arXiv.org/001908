Large continental earthquakes activate multiple faults in a complex fault system, dynamically
inducing co-seismic damage around them. The 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake in the northern South
Island of New Zealand has been reported as one of the most complex continental earthquakes ever documented1,
which resulted in a distinctive on and off-fault deformation pattern. Previous geophysical studies
confirm that the rupture globally propagated northward from epicenter. However, the exact rupture-
propagation path is still not well understood because of the geometrical complexity, partly at
sea, and the possibility of a blind thrust. Here we use a combination of state-of- the-art observation
of surface deformation, provided by optical image correlation, and first principle physics-based
numerical modeling to determine the most likely rupture path. We quantify in detail the observed
horizontal co-seismic deformation and identify specific off-fault damage zones in the area of
the triple junction between the Jordan, the Kekerengu and the Papatea fault segments. We also model
dynamic rupture propagation, including the activation of off-fault damage, for two alternative
rupture scenarios through the fault triple junction. Comparing our observations with the results
from the above two modeled scenarios we show that only one of the scenarios best explains both the
on and off-fault deformation fields. Our results provide a unique insight into the rupture pathway,
by observing, and modeling, both on and off-fault deformation. We propose this combined approach
here to narrow down the possible rupture scenarios for large continental earthquakes accompanied
by co-seismic off-fault damage.
