Deep learning holds great promise in the reconstruction of undersampled Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) data, providing new opportunities to escalate the performance of rapid MRI. In existing deep
learning-based reconstruction methods, supervised training is performed using artifact-free
reference images and their corresponding undersampled pairs. The undersampled images are generated
by a fixed undersampling pattern in the training, and the trained network is then applied to reconstruct
new images acquired with the same pattern in the inference. While such a training strategy can maintain
a favorable reconstruction for a pre-selected undersampling pattern, the robustness of the trained
network against any discrepancy of undersampling schemes is typically poor. We developed a novel
deep learning-based reconstruction framework called SANTIS for efficient MR image reconstruction
with improved robustness against sampling pattern discrepancy. SANTIS uses a data cycle-consistent
adversarial network combining efficient end-to-end convolutional neural network mapping, data
fidelity enforcement and adversarial training for reconstructing accelerated MR images more
faithfully. A training strategy employing sampling augmentation with extensive variation of
undersampling patterns was further introduced to promote the robustness of the trained network.
Compared to conventional reconstruction and standard deep learning methods, SANTIS achieved
consistent better reconstruction performance, with lower errors, greater image sharpness and
higher similarity with respect to the reference regardless of the undersampling patterns during
inference. This novel concept behind SANTIS can particularly be useful towards improving the robustness
of deep learning-based image reconstruction against discrepancy between training and evaluation,
which is currently an important but less studied open question.
