Long pulse operation of present and future magnetic fusion devices requires sophisticated methods
for protection of plasma facing components from overheating. Typically, thermographic systems
are being used to fulfill this task. Steady state operation requires, however, autonomous operation
of the system and fully automatic detection of abnormal events. At Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), a large
advanced stellarator, which aims at demonstrating the capabilities of the stellarator line as
a future fusion power plant, significant efforts are being undertaken to develop a fully automatic
system based on thermographic diagnostics. In October 2018, the first divertor-based experimental
campaign has been finished. One of the goals of this operation phase (named OP1.2) was to study the
capabilities of the island divertor concept using an uncooled test divertor made of fine-grain
graphite tiles. Throughout this campaign, it was possible to test the infrared imaging diagnostic
system, which will be used to protect the actively water-cooled plasma facing components (PFCs)
during the steady-state operation in the next experimental campaign. An overview of the most relevant
thermal events on the PFCs that were detected in OP1.2 using this system are presented. This includes
events that limited operation during the campaign, like baffe hot spots and divertor overloads,
events that are potentially critical in steady state operation like leading edges, events caused
by the ECRH and NBI heating systems and other events which are a common source of false alarms like
surface layers. The detected thermal events are now part of an important and extensive image database
which will be used to further automate the system by means of computer vision and machine learning
techniques in preparation for steady-state operation, when the system must be able to detect dangerous
events and protect the machine in real-time.
