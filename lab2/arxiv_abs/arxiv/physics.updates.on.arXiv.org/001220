When two liquids of different surface tensions come into contact, the liquid with lower surface
tension spreads over the other as this configuration minimizes the total free energy. This Marangoni-driven
spreading has been studied for various geometries and surfactants, but the dynamics of the binary
geometry (drop-drop) has hardly been quantitatively investigated, despite its relevance for
droplet encapsulation applications. It is furthermore unclear whether these different situations
possess universal dynamics. Here we use laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to observe the dynamics
of binary droplets as a function of surface tension difference between the liquids $\Delta\sigma$
and viscosity $\eta$. The distance $L$ over which the low-surface-tension liquid has covered the
high-surface-tension droplet is measured. The early-stage spreading dynamics is described by
the power-law $L(t)\sim t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = 3/4$, as expected based on scaling arguments
for viscosity-limited spreading on a deep bath. This exponent decreases in a later stage, when the
boundary layer thickness becomes comparable to the droplet diameter $D$. Spreading is dissipation-inhibited
for viscosities corresponding to Ohnesorge numbers Oh $= \eta/\sqrt{\rho \Delta\sigma D}\gtrsim
0.2$ where $\rho$ is the density. Finally, we show that our results collapse onto a single curve of
rescaled distance $\tilde{L}(\tilde{t})$ as a function of rescaled time $\tilde{t}$, which also
captures previous results for different geometries, surface tension modifiers (both solvents
and surfactants), and miscibility. As this curve spans 7 orders of magnitude, we conclude that Marangoni-induced
spreading is a universal phenomenon for most practically encountered liquid-liquid systems.
