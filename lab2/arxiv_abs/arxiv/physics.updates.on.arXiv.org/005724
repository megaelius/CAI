Four results associated with the diffuse-interface model (DIM) for contact lines are reported
in this paper. $\underline{First}$, a boundary condition is derived, which states that the fluid
near a solid wall must have a certain density $\rho_{0}$ depending on the solid's properties. Unlike
previous derivations, the one presented here is based on the same physics as the DIM itself and does
not require additional assumptions. $\underline{Second}$, asymptotic estimates are used to
check a conjecture lying at the foundation of the DIM, as well as all other models of contact lines:
that liquid--vapor interfaces are nearly isothermal. It turns out that, for water, they are not
-- although, for a more viscous fluid, they can be. The non-isothermaility occurs locally, near
the interface, but can still affect the contact-line dynamics. $\underline{Third}$, the DIM coupled
with a realistic equation of state for water is used to compute the dependence of the surface tension
$\sigma$ on the temperature $T$, which agrees well with the empiric $\sigma(T)$. $\underline{Fourth}$,
the same framework is used to compute the static contact angle of a water--vapor interface. It is
shown that, with increasing temperature, the contact angle becomes either $180^{\circ}$ (perfect
hydrophobicity) or $0^{\circ}$ (perfect hydrophilicity), depending on whether $\rho_{0}$ matches
the density of saturated vapor or liquid, respectively. Such behavior presumably occurs in all
fluids, not just water, and for all sufficiently strong variations of parameters, not just that
of the temperature -- as corroborated by existing observations of drops under variable electric
field.
