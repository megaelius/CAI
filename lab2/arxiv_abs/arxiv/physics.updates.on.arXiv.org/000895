Modern geodesy is subject to a dramatic change from the Newtonian paradigm to Einstein's theory
of general relativity. This is motivated by the ongoing advance in development of quantum sensors
for applications in geodesy including quantum gravimeters and gradientometers, atomic clocks
and fiber optics for making ultra-precise measurements of the geoid and multipolar structure of
the Earth's gravitational field. At the same time, VLBI, SLR, and GNSS have achieved an unprecedented
level of accuracy in measuring coordinates of the reference points of the ITRF and the world height
system. The main geodetic reference standard is a normal gravity field represented in the Newtonian
gravity by the field of a Maclaurin ellipsoid. The present paper extends the concept of the normal
gravity field to the realm of general relativity. We focus our attention on the calculation of the
first post-Newtonian approximation of the normal field that is sufficient for applications. We
show that in general relativity the level surface of the uniformly rotating fluid is no longer described
by the Maclaurin ellipsoid but is an axisymmetric spheroid of the forth order. We parametrize the
mass density distribution and derive the post-Newtonian normal gravity field of the rotating spheroid
which is given in a closed form by a finite number of the ellipsoidal harmonics. We employ transformation
from the ellipsoidal to spherical coordinates to deduce the post-Newtonian multipolar expansion
of the metric tensor given in terms of scalar and vector gravitational potentials of the rotating
spheroid. We compare these expansions with that of the normal gravity field generated by the Kerr
metric and demonstrate that the Kerr metric has a fairly limited application in relativistic geodesy.
Finally, we derive the post-Newtonian generalization of the Somigliana formula for the gravity
field on the reference ellipsoid.
