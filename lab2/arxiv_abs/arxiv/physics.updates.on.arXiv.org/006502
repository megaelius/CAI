One novel family of two-dimensional IV-V compounds have been proposed, whose dynamical stabilities
and electronic properties have been systematically investigated using the density functional
theory. Extending from our previous work, two phases of carbon phosphorus bilayers \alpha-C$_{2}$P$_{2}$
and \beta-C$_{2}$P$_{2}$ have been proposed. The results indicate both of them are dynamically
stable, and are broad band gap insulators with intrinsic HSE gaps of 2.70 eV and 2.67 eV, respectively.
More similar \alpha- and \beta- C$_{2}$Y$_{2}$ (Y= As, Sb, and Bi) can be obtained if the phosphorus
atoms in the \alpha- and \beta-C$_{2}$P$_{2}$ replaced by other pnictogens, respectively. If
the C atoms in the \alpha- and \beta-C$_{2}$Y$_{2}$ (Y= P, As, Sb, and Bi) bilayers are further replaced
by other group IV elements X (X=Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb), respectively, more derivatives of \alpha- and
\beta-X$_{2}$Y$_{2}$ (X=Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb; Y=N, P, As, Sb, and Bi) also can be obtained. The dynamical
stabilities and the electronic properties of all the proposed bilayers have been systematically
investigated. It was found that the majority of the two-dimensional IV-V compounds are dynamically
stable due to the absence of imaginary modes in their Brillouin zone. The proposed bilayers range
from metal to broad gap insulators depending on their constitutions. All insulated bilayers can
undergo a transition from insulator to metal under the biaxial strain. Amazingly, some of them can
undergo a transition from indirect bandgap to direct bandgap. These new IV-V compounds can become
candidates as photovoltaic device, thermoelectric material field as well as lamellated superconductors.
