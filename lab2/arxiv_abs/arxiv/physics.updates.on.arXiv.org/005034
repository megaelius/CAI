The separated flow response to single and multiple burst mode actuation over a 2-D airfoil at $12^o$
angle of attack was studied experimentally. For the single-burst actuation case, surface pressure
signals were correlated with the flowfield observations of the roll-up and convection of a large-scale
vortex structure that follows the actuator burst input. A spatially localized region of high pressure
occurs below and slightly upstream of a "kink" that forms in the shear layer, which is responsible
for the lift reversal that occurs within $2.0t^+$ after the burst signal was triggered. Proper orthogonal
decomposition of the single-burst flow field shows that the time-varying coefficients of the first
two modes correlate with the negative of the lift coefficient and pitching moment coefficient.
The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of the single-burst flow field data identified the modes related
to the kinetic energy growth of the disturbance. The mode with the largest growth rate had a Strouhal
number close to that associated with the separation bubble dynamics. However, when multiple bursts
are used to control the separation, the interactions between the bursts were observed which depend
on the time intervals between the bursts. The convolution integral and DMD were performed on the
multi-burst flow field datasets. The results indicate that the nonlinear burst-burst interaction
only affects the reverse flow strength within the separation bubble, which is related to the main
trend of the lift. On the other hand, the linear burst-burst interaction contributes to the high-frequency
lift variation associated with the bursts.
