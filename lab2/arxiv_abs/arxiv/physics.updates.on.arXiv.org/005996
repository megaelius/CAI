There is a strong motivation to develop high-power output nuclear fission reactors (around 1 MWe)
for space applications, such as high-payload missions and long-duration missions beyond Mars,
where the reduced solar flux makes using alternative energy sources challenging. Many published
gas-cooled reactor designs for space applications deliver outputs in the 100 kWe regime, with typical
power densities of around 4 MW/m$^3$. Here we present a gas-cooled reactor design - referred to as
JANUS - employing He-Xe coolant and operating on a direct Brayton cycle, that can achieve a high power
output (around 0.8 MWe) and higher power density (24 MW/m$^3$) than previously published designs.
The core employs a coated particle fuel form with uranium nitride kernels in a graphite matrix and
with a high packing fraction (45%). Starting from the CEA's published OPUS space reactor design,
a variety of approaches were considered for achieving high power densities in a gas-cooled reactor,
including changing the core aspect ratio. Our JANUS design uses a decreased coolant channel diameter
and fuel element pitch, whilst increasing the number of fuel elements and employing radial enrichment
zoning. The design achieves a significant increase in power density whilst obeying core-life limits
of 2000 Effective Full Power Days and a peak fuel operating temperature of 1900 K. The core has been
modelled neutronically with the ERANOS and SERPENT codes, with a simple yet robust thermal dimensioning
tool developed by us to study peak fuel temperatures, to ensure the fuel operates within its design
limitations and to aid optimisation.
