Numerical climate- and weather-prediction models require the fast solution of the equations of
fluid dynamics. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisations have several advantageous properties.
They can be used for arbitrary domains and support a structured data layout, which is particularly
important on modern chip architectures. For smooth solutions, higher order approximations can
be particularly efficient since errors decrease exponentially in the polynomial degree. Due to
the wide separation of timescales in atmospheric dynamics, semi-implicit time integrators are
highly efficient, since the implicit treatment of fast waves avoids tight constraints on the time
step size, and can therefore improve overall efficiency. However, if implicit-explicit (IMEX)
integrators are used, a large linear system of equations has to be solved in every time step. A particular
problem for DG discretisations of velocity-pressure systems is that the normal Schur-complement
reduction to an elliptic system for the pressure is not possible since the numerical fluxes introduce
artificial diffusion terms. For the shallow water equations, which form an important model system,
hybridized DG methods have been shown to overcome this issue. However, no attention has been paid
to the efficient solution of the resulting linear system of equations. In this paper we show that
the elliptic system for the flux unknowns can be solved efficiently by using a non-nested multigrid
algorithm. The method is implemented in the Firedrake library and we demonstrate the superior performance
of the algorithm for a representative model problem.
