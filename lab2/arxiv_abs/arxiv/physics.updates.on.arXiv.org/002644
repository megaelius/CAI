Monte Carlo simulations show similarity on radial distributions of power and isotopic concentrations
at any effective full power depletion time among five kinds of fuel-cladding combinations with
the same cycle length, including the normal UO2-zircaloy combination, the candidate Accident
Tolerant Fuel (ATF) UO2/U3Si2-FeCrAl combination, and three kinds of candidate ATF U3Si2-FeCrAl
combinations. An analytical formula f(x,s) including the fuel exposure (s) and the relative radial
(x) is proposed to describe the radial properties for all five kinds of fuel-cladding combinations.
f(x,s) has the form of the second order polynomial term of s with the exponential type of coefficients
depending on x. It is shown that the suggested function f(x,s) gives a nice description on the simulation
data with rather small deviations and can immediately provide radial distribution of power, burnup,
and isotopic concentrations of 235U, 238U, 239Pu, and 241Pu at any fuel exposure and relative radius.
It is useful to discuss the fuel temperature through the present analytical formula. The realistic
radial power distribution gives flatter radial temperature distribution compared with the uniform
power distribution. Because of the different thermal conductivities of fuels and claddings and
the different thicknesses of claddings, the present discussed five kinds of fuel-cladding combinations
have different radial temperature distributions, although their radial power distributions
are quite similar. The present work provides an analytical formula to describe the radial properties
of the ATF which is expected to be helpful for further neutronic and multi-physics coupling studies.
