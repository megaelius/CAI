A theory of special inconstancy, in which some fundamental physical constants such as the fine-structure
and gravitational constants may vary, is proposed in pregeometry. In the special theory of inconstancy,
the \alpha-G relation of \alpha=3\pi/[16ln(4\pi/5GM_W^2)] between the varying fine-structure
and gravitaional constants (where M_W is the charged weak boson mass) is derived from the hypothesis
that both of these constants are related to the same fundamental length scale in nature. Furthermore,
it leads to the prediction of dot{{\alpha}}/\alpha=(-0.8\pm2.5)\times10^{-14}yr^{-1} from
the most precise limit of dot{G}/G=(-0.6\pm2.0)\times10^{-12}yr^{-1} by Thorsett, which is
not only consistent with the recent observation of dot{{\alpha}}/\alpha=(0.5\pm0.5)\times10^{-14}yr^{-1}
by Webb et al. but also feasible for future experimental tests. Also a theory of general inconstancy,
in which any fundamental physical constants may vary, is proposed in "more general relativity",
by assuming that the space-time is "environment-dependent". In the general theory of inconstancy,
the G-\Lambda\ relation between the varying gravitational and cosmological constants is derived
from the hypothesis that the space-time metric is a function of \tau, the "environment-coodinate",
in addition to x^{\mu}, the ordinary space-time coodinates. Furthermore, it leads to the prediction
of the varying cosmological constant, which is consistent with the present observations. In addition,
the latest observation of spatial variation in the fine-structure constant from VLT/UVES of (1.1\pm
0.2)\times 10^{-6}GLyr^{-1} by King et al. is suggested to be taken as a clear evidence for environment-dependent
fundamental physical constants
