The two-fluid plasma equations for a single ion species, with full transport terms, including temperature
and magnetic field dependent ion and electron viscous stresses and heat fluxes, frictional drag
force, and ohmic heating term have been implemented in the CFDNS code and solved by using sixth-order
non-dissipative compact finite differences for plasma flows in several different regimes. In
order to be able to fully resolve all the dynamically relevant time and length scales, while maintaining
computational feasibility, the assumptions of infinite speed of light and negligible electron
inertia have been made. Non-dimensional analysis of the two-fluid plasma equations shows that,
by varying the characteristic/background number density, length scale, temperature, and magnetic
strength, the corresponding Hall, resistive, and ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations
can be recovered as limiting cases. The accuracy and robustness of this two-fluid plasma solver
in handling plasma flows in different regimes have been validated against four canonical problems:
Alfven and whistler dispersion relations, electromagnetic plasma shock, and magnetic reconnection.
For all test cases, by using physical dissipation and diffusion, with negligible numerical dissipation/diffusion,
fully converged Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS)-like solutions are obtained when the ion Reynolds
number based on grid size is smaller than a threshold value which is about 2.3 in this study. For the
magnetic reconnection problem, the results show that the magnetic flux saturation time and value
converge when the ion and magnetic Reynolds numbers are large enough. Thus, the DNS-like results
become relevant to practical problems with much larger Reynolds numbers.
