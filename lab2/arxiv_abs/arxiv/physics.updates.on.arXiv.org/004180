Two aspects of homogeneous rotating turbulence are quantified through forced Direct Numerical
Simulations in an elongated domain, which is in the direction of rotation about $340$ times larger
than the typical initial eddy size. First, by following the time evolution of the integral length-scale
along the axis of rotation $\ell_{\|}$, the growth rate of the columnar eddies and its dependency
on the Rossby number $ Ro_{\varepsilon}$ is determined as $\gamma =4 \exp(-17 Ro_{\varepsilon})$,
where $\gamma$ is the non-dimensional growth rate. Second, a scaling law for the energy dissipation
rate $\varepsilon$ is sought. Comparison with current available scaling laws shows that the relation
proposed by Baqui & Davidson (2015), i.e., $\varepsilon\sim u'^3/\ell_{\|}$, where $u's$ is the
r.m.s. velocity, approximates well part of our data, more specifically the range $0.39\le Ro_{\varepsilon}
\le 1.54$. However, relations proposed in the literature fail to model the data for the second and
most interesting range, i.e., $0.06\le Ro_{\varepsilon} \le 0.31$, which is marked by the formation
of columnar eddies. To find a similarity relation for the latter, we exploit the concept of a spectral
transfer time introduced by Kraichnan (1965). Within this framework, the energy dissipation rate
is considered to depend on both the non-linear time-scale and the relaxation time-scale. Thus,
by analyzing our data, expressions for these different time-scales are obtained that results in~$\varepsilon\sim
u'^4/(\ell_{\bot}^2 Ro_{\varepsilon}^{0.62} \tau_{nl})$, where $\ell_{\bot}$ is the integral
length-scale in the direction normal to the axis of rotation and $\tau_{nl}$ is the non-liner time-scale
of the initial homogeneous isotropic field.
