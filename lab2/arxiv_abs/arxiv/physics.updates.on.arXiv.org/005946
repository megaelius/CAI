Electron and x-ray microscopes allow one to image the entire, unlabeled structure of hydrated materials
at a resolution well beyond what visible light microscopes can achieve. However, both approaches
involve ionizing radiation, so that radiation damage must be considered as one of the limits to imaging.
Drawing upon earlier work, we describe here a unified approach to estimating the image contrast
(and thus the required exposure and corresponding radiation dose) in both x-ray and electron microscopy.
This approach accounts for factors such as plural and inelastic scattering, and (in electron microscopy)
the use of energy filters to obtain so-called "zero loss" images. As expected, it shows that electron
microscopy offers lower dose for specimens thinner than about 1 micron (such as for studies of macromolecules,
viruses, bacteria and archaebacteria, and thin sectioned material), while x-ray microscopy offers
superior characteristics for imaging thicker specimen such as whole eukaryotic cells, thick-sectioned
tissues, and organs. The required radiation dose scales strongly as a function of the desired spatial
resolution, allowing one to understand the limits of live and frozen hydrated specimen imaging.
Finally, we consider the factors limiting x-ray microscopy of thicker materials, suggesting that
specimens as thick as a whole mouse brain can be imaged with x-ray microscopes without significant
image degradation should appropriate image reconstruction methods be identified. The as-published
article [Ultramicroscopy 184, 293--309 (2018); doi:10.1016/j.ultramic.2017.10.003] had some
minor mistakes that we correct here, with all changes from the as-published article shown in blue.
