A new technique for on-line high resolution isotopic analysis of liquid water, tailored for ice
core studies is presented. We built an interface between a Wavelength Scanned Cavity Ring Down Spectrometer
(WS-CRDS) purchased from Picarro Inc. and a Continuous Flow Analysis (CFA) system. The system offers
the possibility to perform simultaneous water isotopic analysis of $\delta^{18}$O and $\delta$D
on a continuous stream of liquid water as generated from a continuously melted ice rod. Injection
of sub ${\mu}$l amounts of liquid water is achieved by pumping sample through a fused silica capillary
and instantaneously vaporizing it with 100% efficiency in a home made oven. A calibration procedure
allows for proper reporting of the data on the VSMOW--SLAP scale. Application of spectral methods
yields the combined uncertainty of the system at below 0.1 permil and 0.5 permil for $\delta^{18}$O
and $\delta$D, respectively. This performance is comparable to that achieved with mass spectrometry.
Dispersion of the sample in the transfer lines limits the temporal resolution of the technique.
By using an optimal filtering method we show how the measured profiles can be corrected for the smoothing
effects resulting from the sample dispersion. Considering the significant advantages the technique
offers, i.e. simultaneous measurement of $\delta^{18}$O and $\delta$D, potentially in combination
with chemical components that are traditionally measured on CFA systems, notable reduction on
analysis time and power consumption, we consider it as an alternative to traditional isotope ratio
mass spectrometry with the possibility to be deployed for field ice core studies. We present data
acquired in the field during the 2010 season as part of the NEEM deep ice core drilling project in North
Greenland.
