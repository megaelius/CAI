This paper presents novel insights about the influence of soluble surfactants on bubble flows obtained
by Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). Surfactants are amphiphilic compounds which accumulate
at fluid interfaces and significantly modify the respective interfacial properties, influencing
also the overall dynamics of the flow. With the aid of DNS local quantities like the surfactant distribution
on the bubble surface can be accessed for a better understanding of the physical phenomena occurring
close to the interface. The core part of the physical model consists in the description of the surfactant
transport in the bulk and on the deformable interface. The solution procedure is based on an Arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) Interface-Tracking method. The existing methodology was enhanced
to describe a wider range of physical phenomena. A subgrid-scale (SGS) model is employed in the cases
where a fully resolved DNS for the species transport is not feasible due to high mesh resolution requirements
and, therefore, high computational costs. After an exhaustive validation of the latest numerical
developments, the DNS of single rising bubbles in contaminated solutions is compared to experimental
results. The full velocity transients of the rising bubbles, especially the contaminated ones,
are correctly reproduced by the DNS. The simulation results are then studied to gain a better understanding
of the local bubble dynamics under the effect of soluble surfactant. One of the main insights is that
the quasi-steady state of the rise velocity is reached without ad- and desorption being necessarily
in local equilibrium.
