We examine the formulation of the Standard Model under the color-electroweak gauge group $SU_C(3)\times
U_{EW}(2)$ subject to the condition $u_{EW}(2)\not\cong su_I(2)\oplus u_Y(1)$. Physically,
the condition means that all electroweak gauge bosons mix with each other prior to symmetry breaking
--- as one might expect from $U(2)$ symmetry. This represents a crucial shift in the notion of physical
gauge bosons that requires some modification of the matter field sector of the Standard Model. Since
our electroweak symmetry is $U_{EW}(2)$, the inner product on the Lie algebra automatically renders
the same lepton doublet representation of the Standard Model so there is no change in the lepton sector.
However, careful attention to the product group structure calls for color-electroweak degrees
of freedom in the $(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2})$ and the $(\mathbf{3},\overline{\mathbf{2}})$
of $SU_C(3)\times U_{EW}(2)$ that possess integer electric charge just like leptons. This leads
to a modified Lagrangian kinetic term for quarks that nevertheless reproduces the same strong and
electroweak currents of the Standard Model if one is willing to identify the pair $(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2}),\,(\mathbf{3},\overline{\mathbf{2}})$
with a single quark doublet in the Standard Model. The close resemblance between quark and lepton
electroweak doublets in this picture encourages us to propose a mechanism for a phase transition
between quarks and leptons that stems from the product structure of the symmetry group. Our hypothesis
is that the strong and electroweak bosons see each other as a source of decoherence. This mechanism
allows possible extensions of the Standard Model that don't require large multiplets of matter
fields. In particular, we investigate a model based on $U(4)\rightarrow U(3)\times U(2)$ that
has some promising cosmological implications.
