Many models of shallow water waves, such as the Camassa-Holm equation, admit peaked solitary waves.
However, it is an open question whether or not the well-known peaked solitary waves can be derived
from the fully nonlinear wave equations. In this paper, a generalized wave model based on the symmetry
and the fully nonlinear wave equations is put forward to investigate the progressive waves with
permanent form in finite water depth. Different from traditional wave models, the flow at crest
is not necessarily irrotational. Mathematically, the generalized wave model admits not only the
traditional progressive waves with smooth crest, but also a new kind of solitary waves with peaked
crest that includes the famous peaked solitary waves given by the Camassa-Holm equation. Besides,
it is proved that Kelvin's theorem still holds for the newly found peaked solitary waves. Therefore,
in theory, the generalized wave model is consistent with the traditional theories of waves with
smooth crest, but is more general. It is found that the peaked solitary waves have some unusual and
unique characteristics. First of all, the peaked solitary waves have a peaked crest with a discontinuous
vertical velocity at crest. Especially, unlike the traditional waves with smooth crest, they are
non-dispersive, i.e. the phase speed of the peaked solitary waves has nothing to do with wave height.
In addition, their horizontal velocity on bed is larger than that on free surface. Theoretically
speaking, all of these unusual properties show the novelty of the peaked solitary waves, although
it is still an open question whether or not they are reasonable in physics if the viscosity of fluid
and the surface tension are considered.
