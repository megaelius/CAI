Microscopic diffusion anisotropy ({\mu}A) has been recently gaining increasing attention for
its ability to decouple the average compartment anisotropy from orientation dispersion. Advanced
diffusion MRI sequences, such as double diffusion encoding (DDE) and double oscillating diffusion
encoding (DODE) have been used for mapping {\mu}A. However, the time-dependence of {\mu}A has not
been investigated insofar, and furthermore, the accuracy of {\mu}A estimation vis-\`a-vis different
b-values was not assessed. Here, we investigate both these concepts using theory, simulation,
and experiments in the mouse brain. In the first part, simulations and experimental results show
that the conventional estimation of microscopic anisotropy from the difference of D(O)DE sequences
with parallel and orthogonal gradient directions yields values that highly depend on the choice
of b-value. To mitigate this undesirable bias, we propose a multi-shell approach that harnesses
a polynomial fit of the signal difference up to third order terms in b-value. In simulations, this
approach yields more accurate {\mu}A metrics, which are similar to the ground truth values. The
second part of this work uses the proposed multi-shell method to estimate the time/frequency dependence
of {\mu}A. The data shows either an increase or no change in {\mu}A with frequency depending on the
region of interest, both in white and gray matter. When comparing the experimental results with
simulations, it emerges that simple geometric models such as infinite cylinders with either negligible
or finite radii cannot replicate the measured trend, and more complex models, which, for example,
incorporate structure along the fibre direction are required. Thus, measuring the time dependence
of microscopic anisotropy can provide valuable information for characterizing tissue microstructure.
