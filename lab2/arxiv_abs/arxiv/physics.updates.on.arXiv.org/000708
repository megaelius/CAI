We review numerical studies of quantum turbulence. Quantum turbulence is currently one of the most
important problems in low temperature physics and is actively studied for superfluid helium and
atomic Bose--Einstein condensates. A key aspect of quantum turbulence is the dynamics of condensates
and quantized vortices. The dynamics of quantized vortices in superfluid helium are described
by the vortex filament model, while the dynamics of condensates are described by the Gross--Pitaevskii
model. Both of these models are nonlinear, and the quantum turbulent states of interest are far from
equilibrium. Hence, numerical studies have been indispensable for studying quantum turbulence.
In fact, numerical studies have contributed in revealing the various problems of quantum turbulence.
This article reviews the recent developments in numerical studies of quantum turbulence. We start
with the motivation and the basics of quantum turbulence and invite readers to the frontier of this
research. Though there are many important topics in the quantum turbulence of superfluid helium,
this article focuses on inhomogeneous quantum turbulence in a channel, which has been motivated
by recent visualization experiments. Atomic Bose--Einstein condensates are a modern issue in
quantum turbulence, and this article reviews a variety of topics in the quantum turbulence of condensates
e.g. two-dimensional quantum turbulence, weak wave turbulence, turbulence in a spinor condensate,
$etc.$, some of which has not been addressed in superfluid helium and paves the novel way for quantum
turbulence researches. Finally we discuss open problems.
