We propose a triply-resonant electro-optic modulator architecture which maximizes modulation
efficiency using simultaneous resonant enhancement of the RF drive signal, the optical pump, and
the generated optical sideband. Optical enhancement of the optical pump and the sideband is achieved
using resonant supermodes of two coupled optical resonators, and the RF enhancement is achieved
with LC circuits formed by the capacitances of the optical resonators and inductors which can be
implemented using CMOS technology. In the proposed configuration, the photon lifetime determines
the bandwidth of the RF response but not its center frequency, which is set by the coupling strength
between the two resonators and is not subject to the photon lifetime constraint inherent to conventional
single-mode resonant modulators. This enables efficient operation at high RF carrier frequencies
without a reduction in efficiency commonly associated with the photon lifetime limit. Two optical
configurations of the modulator are proposed: a "basic" configuration with equal Q-factors in
both supermodes, most suitable for narrowband RF signals, and a "generalized" configuration with
independently tailored Q-factors of the two supermodes, which makes it possible to broaden the
RF bandwidth without sacrificing the resonant enhancement of the optical pump and paying a penalty
in modulation efficiency associated with doing so. Additionally, a significant gain in modulation
efficiency is expected from RF signal enhancement by LC resonant matching. This results in a modulator
which is compact, efficient, and capable of modulation at high RF carrier frequencies. The proposed
modulator architecture optimally engineers the interaction of the device with each of the three
signals and between them, can be applied to any modulator cavity design or modulation mechanism
and promises to enable complex RF-photonic systems on chip.
