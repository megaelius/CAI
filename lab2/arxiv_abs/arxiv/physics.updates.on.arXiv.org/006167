The goal of this work is to train a neural network which approximates solutions to the Navier-Stokes
equations across a region of parameter space, in which the parameters define physical properties
such as domain shape and boundary conditions. The contributions of this work are threefold: 1) To
demonstrate that neural networks can be efficient aggregators of whole families of parameteric
solutions to physical problems, trained using data created with traditional, trusted numerical
methods such as finite elements. Advantages include extremely fast evaluation of pressure and
velocity at any point in physical and parameter space (asymptotically, ~3 $\mu s$ / query), and data
compression (the network requires 99\% less storage space compared to its own training data). 2)
To demonstrate that the neural networks can accurately interpolate between finite element solutions
in parameter space, allowing them to be instantly queried for pressure and velocity field solutions
to problems for which traditional simulations have never been performed. 3) To introduce an active
learning algorithm, so that during training, a finite element solver can automatically be queried
to obtain additional training data in locations where the neural network's predictions are in most
need of improvement, thus autonomously acquiring and efficiently distributing training data
throughout parameter space. In addition to the obvious utility of Item 2, above, we demonstrate
an application of the network in rapid parameter sweeping, very precisely predicting the degree
of narrowing in a tube which would result in a 50\% increase in end-to-end pressure difference at
a given flow rate. This capability could have applications in both medical diagnosis of arterial
disease, and in computer-aided design.
