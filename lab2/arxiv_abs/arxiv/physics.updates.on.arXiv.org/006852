Epitaxially integrated III-V semiconductor lasers for silicon photonics have the potential to
dramatically transform information networks, but currently, dislocations limit performance
and reliability even in defect tolerant InAs quantum dot (QD) based lasers. Despite being below
critical thickness, QD layers in these devices contain previously unexplained misfit dislocations,
which facilitate non-radiative recombination. We demonstrate here that these misfit dislocations
form during post-growth cooldown due to the combined effects of (1) thermal-expansion mismatch
between the III-V layers and silicon and (2) precipitate and alloy hardening in the active region.
By incorporating an additional sub-critical thickness, indium-alloyed misfit dislocation trapping
layer, we leverage these mechanical hardening effects to our advantage, successfully displacing
95% of misfit dislocations from the QD layer in model structures. Unlike conventional dislocation
mitigation strategies, the trapping layer reduces neither the number of threading dislocations
nor the number of misfit dislocations. It simply shifts the position of misfit dislocations away
from the QD layer, reducing the defects' impact on luminescence. In full lasers, adding a misfit
dislocation trapping layer both above and below the QD active region displaces misfit dislocations
and substantially improves performance: we measure a twofold reduction in lasing threshold currents
and a greater than threefold increase in output power. Our results suggest that devices employing
both traditional threading dislocation reduction techniques and optimized misfit dislocation
trapping layers may finally lead to fully integrated, commercially viable silicon-based photonic
integrated circuits.
