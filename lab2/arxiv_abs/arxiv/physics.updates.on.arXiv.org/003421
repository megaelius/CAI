Diffusion MRI may enable non-invasive mapping of axonal microstructure. Most approaches infer
axon diameters from effects of time-dependent diffusion on the diffusion-weighted MR signal by
modelling axons as straight cylinders. Axons do not, however, run in straight trajectories and
so far, the impact of the axonal trajectory on diameter estimation has not been systematically investigated.
Here, we employ a toy-model of axons, which we refer to as undulating thin-fiber model, to analyze
the impact of undulating trajectories on the diffusion-time dependence represented by the diffusion
spectrum. We analyze the spectrum by its height (diffusivity at high frequencies), width (half
width at half maximum), and low-frequency behavior (power law exponent). Results show that microscopic
orientation dispersion of the thin-fibers is the main parameter that determines the characteristics
of the diffusion spectra. Straight cylinders and undulating thin-fibers have virtually identical
spectra at lower frequencies. If the straight-cylinder assumption is used to interpret data from
undulating thin axons, the diameter is overestimated by an amount proportional to the undulation
amplitude and the microscopic orientation dispersion. At high frequencies (short diffusion times),
spectra from cylinders and undulating thin-fibers differ. The spectra from the undulating thin-fibers
can also differ from that of cylinders by exhibiting power law behaviors with exponents below two.
In conclusion, we argue that the non-straight nature of axonal trajectories should not be ignored
when analyzing dMRI data and that careful experiments may enable separation of diffusion within
straight cylinders and diffusion in undulating thin-fibers.
