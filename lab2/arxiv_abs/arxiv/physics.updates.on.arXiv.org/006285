We are currently living in a state of uncertainty due to the pandemic caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus.
There are several factors involved in the epidemic spreading such as the individual characteristics
of each city/country. The true shape of the epidemic dynamics is a large, complex system such as most
of the social systems. In this context, Complex networks are a great candidate to analyze these systems
due to their ability to tackle structural and dynamical properties. Therefore this study presents
a new approach to model the COVID-19 epidemic using a multi-layer complex network, where nodes represent
people, edges are social contacts, and layers represent different social activities. The model
improves the traditional SIR and it is applied to study the Brazilian epidemic by analyzing possible
future actions and their consequences. The network is characterized using statistics of infection,
death, and hospitalization time. To simulate isolation, social distancing, or precautionary
measures we remove layers and/or reduce the intensity of social contacts. Results show that even
taking various optimistic assumptions, the current isolation levels in Brazil still may lead to
a critical scenario for the healthcare system and a considerable death toll (average of 149,000).
If all activities return to normal, the epidemic growth may suffer a steep increase, and the demand
for ICU beds may surpass 3 times the country's capacity. This would surely lead to a catastrophic
scenario, as our estimation reaches an average of 212,000 deaths even considering that all cases
are effectively treated. The increase of isolation (up to a lockdown) shows to be the best option
to keep the situation under the healthcare system capacity, aside from ensuring a faster decrease
of new case occurrences (months of difference), and a significantly smaller death toll (average
of 87,000).
