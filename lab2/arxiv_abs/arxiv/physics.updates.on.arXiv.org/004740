A novel method performing 3D PTV from double frame multi-camera images is introduced. Particle
velocities are estimated by following three steps. Firstly, separate particle reconstructions
with a sparsity-based algorithm are performed on a fine grid. Secondly, they are expanded on a coarser
grid on which 3D correlation is performed, yielding a predictor displacement field that allows
to efficiently match particles at the two time instants. As these particles are still located on
a voxel grid, the third, final step achieves particle position refinement to their actual subvoxel
position by a global optimization process, also accounting for their intensities. As it strongly
leverages on principles from tomographic reconstruction, the technique is termed Double-Frame
Tomo-PTV (DF-TPTV). Synthetic tests on a complex turbulent flow show that the method achieves high
particle and vector detection efficiency, up to seeding densities of around 0.08 particles per
pixel (ppp), while its root-mean-square error of velocity estimation is lower to that of state-of-the-art
similar methods. Results from an experimental campaign on a transitional round air jet at Reynolds
number 4600 are also presented. During the tests, seeding density varies from 0.06 to 0.03 ppp on
average. Associated to an outlier rejection scheme based on temporal statistics, DF-TPTV vector
fields truthfully correspond to the instantaneous jet dynamics. Quantitative performance assessment
is provided by introducing statistics performed by bin averaging, upon assuming statistical axisymmetry
of the jet. Mean and fluctuating axial velocity components in the jet near-field are compared with
reference results obtained from planar PIV at higher seeding density.
