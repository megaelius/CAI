Classical simulation of quantum computers will continue to play an essential role in the progress
of quantum information science, both for numerical studies of quantum algorithms and for modeling
noise and errors. Here we introduce the latest release of Intel Quantum Simulator (IQS), formerly
known as qHiPSTER. The high-performance computing (HPC) capability of the software allows users
to leverage the available hardware resources provided by supercomputers, as well as available
public cloud computing infrastructure. To take advantage of the latter platform, together with
the distributed simulation of each separate quantum state, IQS allows to subdivide the computational
resources to simulate a pool of related circuits in parallel. We highlight the technical implementation
of the distributed algorithm and details about the new pool functionality. We also include some
basic benchmarks (up to 42 qubits) and performance results obtained using HPC infrastructure.
Finally, we use IQS to emulate a scenario in which many quantum devices are running in parallel to
implement the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, using particle swarm optimization
as the classical subroutine. The results demonstrate that the hyperparameters of this classical
optimization algorithm depends on the total number of quantum circuit simulations one has the bandwidth
to perform. Intel Quantum Simulator has been released open-source with permissive licensing and
is designed to simulate a large number of qubits, to emulate multiple quantum devices running in
parallel, and/or to study the effects of decoherence and other hardware errors on calculation results.
