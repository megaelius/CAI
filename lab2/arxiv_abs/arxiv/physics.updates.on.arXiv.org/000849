Quantum information science and quantum information technology have seen a virtual explosion
world-wide. It is all based on the observation that fundamental quantum phenomena on the individual
particle or system-level lead to completely novel ways of encoding, processing and transmitting
information. Quantum mechanics, a child of the first third of the 20th century, has found numerous
realizations and technical applications, much more than was thought at the beginning. Decades
later, it became possible to do experiments with individual quantum particles and quantum systems.
This was due to technological progress, and for light in particular, the development of the laser.
Hitherto, nearly all experiments and also nearly all realizations in the fields have been performed
with qubits, which are two-level quantum systems. We suggest that this limitation is again mainly
a technological one, because it is very difficult to create, manipulate and measure more complex
quantum systems. Here, we provide a specific overview of some recent developments with higher-dimensional
quantum systems. We mainly focus on Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) states of photons and possible
applications in quantum information protocols. Such states form discrete higher-dimensional
quantum systems, also called qudits. Specifically, we will first address the question what kind
of new fundamental properties exist and the quantum information applications which are opened
up by such novel systems. Then we give an overview of recent developments in the field by discussing
several notable experiments over the past 2-3 years. Finally, we conclude with several important
open questions which will be interesting for investigations in the future.
