Magnetic drug delivery is a promising therapeutic because of magnetic fields' ability to permeate
unperturbed in human tissue. One of the long-standing challenges in magnetic drug delivery is the
inability to generate 3D aggregation non-invasively within the interior of the body. Earnshaw's
theorem, which proves the impossibility of creating an energetic minimum in a curl-free and divergence-free
field such as a magnetic field. However, one of the assumptions of Earnshaw's theorem is a static
field. Here we show that it is possible to utilize a dynamically changing field and a dissipative
force such as the drag, which is generally present, to create a stable aggregation point for magnetic
particles. We also introduce a theoretical framework for designing the suitable magnetic fields
for controlling a given magnetic particle in a particular fluid. This framework enables accurate
determination of the necessary parameters for aggregation across a wide variety of magnetic particles
and across multiple biologically-relevant fluids. By coating magnetic particles with desired
therapeutic agents or attaching them to cells, a new class of treatment methodologies can be created
in therapies such as targeted drug delivery and cell-based therapies. By dynamically changing
the aggregation point, agents can also be guided along a particular path in the body. This technique
of using dissipative forces to create a stable 3D aggregation point for particles could possibly
be extended to a broad range of applications such as microscopic and macroscopic manipulation,
robotics, guided self-assembly, magnetic plasma confinement, tissue engineering, and ion traps
for quantum computers.
