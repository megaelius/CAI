The guiding-center reduction is studied using gyro-gauge-independent coordinates. The Lagrangian
1-form of charged particle dynamics is Lie transformed without introducing a gyro-gauge, but using
directly the unit vector of the component of the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field as
the coordinate corresponding to Larmor gyration. The reduction is shown to provide a maximal reduction
for the Lagrangian and to work to all orders in the Larmor radius, following exactly the same procedure
as when working with the standard gauge-dependent coordinate. The gauge-dependence is removed
from the coordinate system by using a constrained variable for the gyro-angle. The closed 1-form
d teta is replaced by a more general non-closed 1-form, which is equal to d theta in the gauge-dependent
case. The gauge vector is replaced by a more general connection in the definition of the gradient,
which behaves as a covariant derivative, in perfect agreement with the circle-bundle picture.
This explains some results of previous works, whose gauge-independent expressions did not correspond
to a gauge fixing but indeed correspond to a connection fixing. In addition, some general results
are obtained for the guiding-center reduction. The expansion is polynomial in the cotangent of
the pitch-angle as an effect of the structure of the Lagrangian, preserved by Lie derivatives. The
induction for the reduction is shown to rely on the inversion of a matrix which is the same for all orders
higher than three. It is inverted and explicit induction relations are obtained to go to arbitrary
order in the perturbation expansion. The Hamiltonian and symplectic representations of the guiding-center
reduction are recovered, but conditions for the symplectic representation at each order are emphasized.
