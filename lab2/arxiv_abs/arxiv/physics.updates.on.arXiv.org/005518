The Gillespie algorithm provides statistically exact methods for simulating stochastic dynamics
modelled as interacting sequences of discrete events including systems of biochemical reactions
or earthquake occurrences, networks of queuing processes or spiking neurons, and epidemic and
opinion formation processes on social networks. Empirically, the inter-event times of various
phenomena obey long-tailed distributions. The Gillespie algorithm and its variants either assume
Poisson processes (i.e., exponentially distributed inter-event times), use particular functions
for time courses of the event rate, or work for non-Poissonian renewal processes, including the
case of long-tailed distributions of inter-event times, but at a high computational cost. In the
present study, we propose an innovative Gillespie algorithm for renewal processes on the basis
of the Laplace transform. The algorithm makes use of the fact that a class of point processes is represented
as a mixture of Poisson processes with different event rates. The method is applicable to multivariate
renewal processes whose survival function of inter-event times is completely monotone. It is an
exact algorithm and works faster than a recently proposed Gillespie algorithm for general renewal
processes, which is exact only in the limit of infinitely many processes. We also propose a method
to generate sequences of event times with a tunable amount of positive correlation between inter-event
times. We demonstrate our algorithm with exact simulations of epidemic processes on networks,
finding that a realistic amount of positive correlation in inter-event times only slightly affects
the epidemic dynamics.
