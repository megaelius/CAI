We present a theoretical and numerical framework -- which we dub the Direct Integration Method (DIM)
-- for simple, efficient and accurate evaluation of surface wave models allowing presence of a current
of arbitrary depth dependence, and where bathymetry and ambient currents may vary slowly in horizontal
directions. On horizontally constant water depth and shear current the DIM numerically evaluates
the dispersion relation of linear surface waves to arbitrary accuracy, and we argue that for this
purpose it is superior to two existing numerical procedures: the piecewise-linear approximation
and a method due to \textit{Dong \& Kirby} [2012]. The DIM moreover yields the full linearized flow
field at little extra cost. We implement the DIM numerically with iterations of standard numerical
methods. The wide applicability of the DIM in an oceanographic setting in four aspects is shown.
Firstly, we show how the DIM allows practical implementation of the wave action conservation equation
recently derived by \textit{Quinn et al.} [2017]. Secondly, we demonstrate how the DIM handles
with ease cases where existing methods struggle, i.e.\ velocity profiles $\mathbf{U}(z)$ changing
direction with vertical coordinate $z$, and strongly sheared profiles. Thirdly, we use the DIM
to calculate and analyse the full linear flow field beneath a 2D ring wave upon a near--surface wind--driven
exponential shear current, revealing striking qualitative differences compared to no shear.
Finally we demonstrate that the DIM can be a real competitor to analytical dispersion relation approximations
such as that of \textit{Kirby \& Chen} [1989] even for wave/ocean modelling.
