Controlling the polarization state of electromagnetic radiation enables the investigation of
fundamental symmetry properties of matter through chiroptical processes. Many strategies have
been developed to reveal structural or dynamical information about chiral molecules, from the
microwave to the extreme ultraviolet range. Most schemes employ circularly or elliptically polarized
radiation, and more sophisticated configurations involve, for instance, light pulses with time-varying
polarization states. In all these schemes, the polarization state of light is always considered
as constant over one optical cycle. In this study, we zoom into the optical cycle in order to resolve
and control a subcyle chiroptical process. We engineer an electric field whose instantaneous chirality
can be controlled within the optical cycle, by combining two phase-locked orthogonally polarized
fundamental and second harmonic fields. While the composite field has zero net ellipticity, it
shows an instantaneous optical chirality which can be controlled via the two-color delay. We theoretically
and experimentally investigate the photoionization of chiral molecules with this controlled
chiral field. We find that electrons are preferentially ejected forward or backward relative to
the laser propagation direction depending on the molecular handedness, similarly to the well-established
photoelectron circular dichroism process. However, since the instantaneous chirality switches
sign from one half cycle to the next, electrons ionized from two consecutive half cycles of the laser
show opposite forward/backward asymmetries. This chiral signal provides a unique insight into
the influence of instantaneous chirality in the dynamical photoionization process. Our results
demonstrate the important role of sub-cycle polarization shaping of electric fields, as a new route
to study and manipulate chiroptical processes.
