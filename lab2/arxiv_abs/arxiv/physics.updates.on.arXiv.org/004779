The control of nanostructuration of graphene and graphene related materials (GRM) into self-assembled
structures is strictly related to the nanoflakes chemical functionalization, which may be obtained
via covalent grafting of non-covalent interactions, mostly exploiting {\pi}-stacking. As the
non-covalent functionalization does not affect the sp2 carbon structure, this is often exploited
to preserve the thermal and electrical properties of the GRM and it is a well-known route to tailor
the interaction between GRM and organic media. In this work, non-covalent functionalization of
graphite nanoplatelets (GnP) was carried out with ad-hoc synthesized pyrene-terminated oligomers
of polylactic acid (PLA), aiming at the modification of GnP nanopapers thermal properties. PLA
was selected based on the possibility to self-assemble in crystalline domains via stereocomplexation
of complementary poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(D-lactide) (PDLA) enantiomers. Pyrene-initiated
PLLA and PDLA were indeed demonstrated to anchor to the GnP surface. Calorimetric and X-ray diffraction
investigations highlighted the enantiomeric PLAs adsorbed on the surface of the nanoplatelets
self-organize to produce highly crystalline stereocomplex domains. Most importantly, PLLA/PDLA
stereocomplexation delivered a significantly higher efficiency in nanopapers heat transfer,
in particular through the thickness of the nanopaper. This is explained by a thermal bridging effect
of crystalline domains between overlapped GnP, promoting heat transfer across the nanoparticles
contacts. This work demonstrates the possibility to enhance the physical properties of contacts
within a percolating network of GRM via the self-assembly of macromolecules and opens a new way for
the engineering of GRM-based nanostructures.
