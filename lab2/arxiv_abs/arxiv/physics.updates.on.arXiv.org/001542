We present a numerical investigation of three-dimensional, short-wavelength linear instabilities
in Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortices in homogeneous and stratified environments. The base flow,
generated using two-dimensional numerical simulations, is characterized by the Reynolds number
and the Richardson number defined based on the initial one-dimensional velocity and buoyancy profiles.
The local stability equations are then solved on closed streamlines in the vortical base flow, which
is assumed quasi-steady. For the unstratified case, the elliptic instability at the vortex core
dominates at early times, before being taken over by the hyperbolic instability at the vortex edge.
For the stratified case, the early time instabilities comprise a dominant elliptic instability
at the core and a hyperbolic instability strongly influenced by stratification at the vortex edge.
At intermediate times, the local approach shows a new branch of instability (convective branch)
that emerges at the vortex core and subsequently moves towards the vortex edge. A few more convective
instability branches appear at the vortex core and move away, before coalescing to form the most
unstable region inside the vortex periphery at large times. The dominant instability characteristics
from the local approach are shown to be in good qualitative agreement with results from global instability
studies for both homogeneous and stratified cases. Compartmentalized analyses are then used to
elucidate the role of shear and stratification on the identified instabilities. The role of buoyancy
is shown to be critical after the primary KH instability saturates, with the dominant convective
instability shown to occur in regions with the strongest statically unstable layering. We conclude
by highlighting the potentially insightful role that the local approach may offer in understanding
the secondary instabilities in other flows.
