Today, the near-Earth space is facing a paradigm change as the number of new spacecraft is literally
sky-rocketing. Increasing numbers of small satellites threaten the sustainable use of space,
as without removal, space debris will eventually make certain critical orbits unusable. A central
factor affecting small spacecraft health and leading to debris is the radiation environment, which
is unpredictable due to an incomplete understanding of the near-Earth radiation environment itself
and its variability driven by the solar wind and outer magnetosphere. This paper presents the FORESAIL-1
nanosatellite mission, having two scientific and one technological objectives. The first scientific
objective is to measure the energy and flux of energetic particle loss to the atmosphere with a representative
energy and pitch angle resolution over a wide range of magnetic local times. To pave the way to novel
model - in situ data comparisons, we also show preliminary results on precipitating electron fluxes
obtained with the new global hybrid-Vlasov simulation Vlasiator. The second scientific objective
of the FORESAIL-1 mission is to measure energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) of solar origin. The solar
ENA flux has the potential to contribute importantly to the knowledge of solar eruption energy budget
estimations. The technological objective is to demonstrate a satellite de-orbiting technology,
and for the first time, make an orbit manoeuvre with a propellantless nanosatellite. FORESAIL-1
will demonstrate the potential for nanosatellites to make important scientific contributions
as well as promote the sustainable utilisation of space by using a cost-efficient de-orbiting technology.
