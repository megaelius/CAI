A detailed mechanism for the four-component gasoline surrogate developed by Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory has shown good agreement with experiments in engine-relevant conditions.
However, with 1388 species and 5933 reversible reactions, this detailed mechanism is far too large
to use in practical engine simulations. Therefore, reduction of the detailed mechanism was performed
using a multi-stage approach consisting of the DRGEPSA method, unimportant reaction elimination,
isomer lumping, and analytic QSS reduction based on CSP analysis. A new greedy sensitivity analysis
algorithm was developed and demonstrated to be capable of removing more species for the same error
limit compared to the conventional sensitivity analysis used in DRG-based skeletal reduction
methods. Using this new greedy algorithm, several skeletal and reduced mechanisms were developed
at varying levels of complexity and for different target condition ranges. The final skeletal and
reduced mechanisms consisted of 213 and 148 species, respectively, for a lean, low-temperature
HCCI-like range of conditions. For a lean-to-rich, high-temperature, SI/CI-like range of conditions,
skeletal and reduced mechanisms were developed with 97 and 79 species, respectively. The skeletal
and reduced mechanisms in this study were produced using an error limit of 10% and validated using
homogeneous autoignition simulations over engine-relevant conditions---all showed good agreement
in predicting ignition delay. Furthermore, extended validation was performed, including comparison
of autoignition temperature profiles, PSR temperature response curves and extinction turning
points, and laminar flame speed calculations.
