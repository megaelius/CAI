How evolution favors cooperation is a fundamental issue in social and economic systems. In the business
world, actively selecting a suitable project is usually helpful for a businessman to be in an advantageous
position. By incorporating project selection mechanism into the threshold public goods game,
we have investigated the coupling effect of mutation and imitation in updating one's preferred
project scale on the evolution of cooperation. Compared with the situation where there is no project
selection mechanism, the existence of project selection may suppress or promote cooperation depending
upon different updating rules. There exists a critical ratio of the imitators in the population,
below which cooperation is suppressed while above which cooperation is promoted. With the coevolving
of individual strategies and preferred project scales, a higher level of cooperation corresponds
to a larger average value of the preferred project scales. A theoretical analysis indicates that,
as most of the individuals are mutants, the coevolving process is governed by the mutation process,
which leads to a smaller average value of the preferred project scales and a lower level of cooperation.
As most of the individuals are imitators, the coevolving process is governed by the coupling of the
mutation and imitation processes, which leads to a larger average value of the preferred project
scales and a higher level of cooperation. As all the individuals are imitators, the coevolving process
is governed by the imitation process, which leads to an intermediate average value of the preferred
project scales and an intermediate level of cooperation.
