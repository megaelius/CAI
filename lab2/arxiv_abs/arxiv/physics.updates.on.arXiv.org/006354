The emergence of macroscopic order and patterns is a central paradigm in systems of (self-)propelled
agents, and a key component in the structuring of many biological systems.The relationships between
the ordering process and the underlying microscopic interactions have been extensively explored
both experimentally and theoretically. While emerging patterns often show one specific symmetry
(e.g. nematic lane patterns or polarized traveling flocks), depending on the symmetry of the alignment
interactions patterns with different symmetries can apparently coexist. Indeed, recent experiments
with an actomysin motility assay suggest that polar and nematic patterns of actin filaments can
interact and dynamically transform into each other. However, theoretical understanding of the
mechanism responsible remains elusive. Here, we present a kinetic approach complemented by a hydrodynamic
theory for agents with mixed alignment symmetries, which captures the experimentally observed
phenomenology and provides a theoretical explanation for the coexistence and interaction of patterns
with different symmetries. We show that local, pattern-induced symmetry breaking can account
for dynamically coexisting patterns with different symmetries. Specifically, in a regime with
moderate densities and a weak polar bias in the alignment interaction, nematic bands show a local
symmetry-breaking instability within their high-density core region, which induces the formation
of polar waves along the bands. These instabilities eventually result in a self-organized system
of nematic bands and polar waves that dynamically transform into each other. Our study reveals a
mutual feedback mechanism between pattern formation and local symmetry breaking in active matter
that has interesting consequences for structure formation in biological systems.
