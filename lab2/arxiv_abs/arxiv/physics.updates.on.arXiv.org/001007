Complex networks are usually characterized in terms of their topological, spatial, or information-theoretic
properties and combinations of the associated metrics are used to discriminate networks into different
classes or categories. However, even with the present variety of characteristics at hand it still
remains a subject of current research to appropriately quantify a network's complexity and correspondingly
discriminate between different types of complex networks, like infrastructure or social networks,
on such a basis. Here, we explore the possibility to classify complex networks by means of a statistical
complexity measure that has formerly been successfully applied to distinguish different types
of chaotic and stochastic time series. It is composed of a network's averaged per-node entropic
measure characterizing the network's information content and the associated Jenson-Shannon
divergence as a measure of disequilibrium. We study 29 real world networks and show that networks
of the same category tend to cluster in distinct areas of the resulting complexity-entropy plane.
We demonstrate that within our framework, connectome networks exhibit among the highest complexity
while, e.g, transportation and infrastructure networks display significantly lower values.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to families of random scale-free
and Watts-Strogatz model networks. We then show in a second application that the proposed framework
is useful to objectively construct threshold-based networks, such as functional climate networks
or recurrence networks, by choosing the threshold such that the statistical network complexity
is maximized.
