We present an investigation into the nonlinear evolution of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF)
instability using axisymmetric and three-dimensional simulations near the equator of a differentially
rotating radiation zone. This instability may provide an important contribution to angular momentum
transport in stars and planets. We adopt a local Boussinesq Cartesian shearing box model, which
represents a small patch of a differentially rotating stellar radiation zone. Complementary simulations
are also performed with stress-free, impenetrable boundaries in the local radial direction. The
linear and nonlinear evolution of the equatorial axisymmetric instability is formally equivalent
to the salt fingering instability. This is no longer the case in 3D, but we find that the instability
behaves nonlinearly in a similar way to salt fingering. Axisymmetric simulations -- and those in
3D with short dimensions along the local azimuthal direction -- quickly develop strong jets along
the rotation axis, which inhibit the instability and lead to predator-prey-like temporal dynamics.
In 3D, the instability initially produces homogeneous turbulence and enhanced momentum transport,
though in some cases jets form on a much longer timescale. We propose and validate numerically a simple
theory for nonlinear saturation of the GSF instability and its resulting angular momentum transport.
This theory is straightforward to implement in stellar evolution codes incorporating rotation.
We estimate that the GSF instability could contribute towards explaining the missing angular momentum
transport required in red giant stars, and play a role in the long-term evolution of the solar tachocline.
