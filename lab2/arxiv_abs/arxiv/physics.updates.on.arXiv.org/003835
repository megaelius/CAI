We propose a numerical methodology for the simultaneous numerical simulation of four states of
matter; gas, liquid, elastoplastic solids and plasma. The distinct, interacting physical processes
are described by a combination of compressible, inert and reactive forms of the Euler equations,
multiphase equations, elastoplastic equations and resistive MHD equations. Combinations of
systems of equations are usually solved by coupling finite element for solid modelling and CFD models
for fluid modelling or including material effects through boundary conditions rather than full
material discretisation. Our simultaneous solution methodology lies on the recasting of all the
equations in the same, hyperbolic form allowing their solution on the same grid with the same finite-volume
numerical schemes. We use a combination of sharp and diffuse interface methods to track or capture
material interfaces, depending on the application. The communication between the distinct systems
of equations (i.e., materials separated by sharp interfaces) is facilitated by means of mixed-material
Riemann solvers at the boundaries of the systems, which represent physical material boundaries.
To this end we derive approximate mixed Riemann solvers for each pair of the above models based on
characteristic equations. To demonstrate the applicability of the new methodology we consider
a case study where we investigate the possibility of ignition of a combustible gas that lies over
a liquid in a metal container that is struck by a plasma-arc akin to a lightning strike. We study the
effect on the ignition of the metal container material and conductivity, of the presence of a dielectric
coating, of insensitive combustible gases and sealed and pre-damaged metal surfaces.
