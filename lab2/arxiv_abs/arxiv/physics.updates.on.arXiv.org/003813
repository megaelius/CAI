Many optimization problems can be cast into the maximum satisfiability (MAX-SAT) form, and many
solvers have been developed for tackling such problems. To evaluate the performance of a MAX-SAT
solver, it is convenient to generate difficult MAX-SAT instances with solutions known in advance.
Here, we propose a method of generating weighted MAX-2-SAT instances inspired by the frustrated-loop
algorithm used by the quantum annealing community to generate Ising spin-glass instances with
nearest-neighbor coupling. Our algorithm is extended to instances whose underlying coupling
graph is general, though we focus here on the case of bipartite coupling, with the associated energy
being the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) energy. It is shown that any MAX-2-SAT problem can
be reduced to the problem of minimizing an RBM energy over the nodal values. The algorithm is designed
such that the difficulty of the generated instances can be tuned through a central parameter known
as the frustration index. Two versions of the algorithm are presented: the random- and structured-loop
algorithms. For the random-loop algorithm, we provide a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis
on its mathematical properties from the perspective of frustration, and observe empirically,
using simulated annealing, a double phase transition behavior in the difficulty scaling behavior
driven by the frustration index. For the structured-loop algorithm, we show that it offers an improvement
in difficulty of the generated instances over the random-loop algorithm, with the improvement
factor scaling super-exponentially with respect to the frustration index for instances at high
loop density. At the end of the paper, we provide a brief discussion of the relevance of this work to
the pre-training of RBMs.
