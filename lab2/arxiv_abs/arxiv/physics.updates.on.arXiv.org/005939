A new implicit BGK collision model using a semi-Lagrangian approach is proposed in this paper. Unlike
existing models, in which the implicit BGK collision is resolved either by a temporal extrapolation
or by a variable transformation, the new model removes the implicitness by tracing the particle
distribution functions (PDFs) back in time along their characteristic paths during the collision
process. An interpolation scheme is needed to evaluate the PDFs at the traced-back locations. By
using the first-order interpolation, the resulting model allows for the straightforward replacement
of ${f_{\alpha}}^{eq,n+1}$ by ${f_{\alpha}}^{eq,n}$ no matter where it appears. After comparing
the new model with the existing models under different numerical conditions (e.g. different flux
schemes and time marching schemes) and using the new model to successfully modify the variable transformation
technique, three conclusions can be drawn. First, the new model can improve the accuracy by almost
an order of magnitude. Second, it can slightly reduce the computational cost. Therefore, the new
scheme improves accuracy without extra cost. Finally, the new model can significantly improve
the ${\Delta}t/{\tau}$ limit compared to the temporal interpolation model while having the same
${\Delta}t/{\tau}$ limit as the variable transformation approach. The new scheme with a second-order
interpolation is also developed and tested; however, that technique displays no advantage over
the simple first-order interpolation approach. Both numerical and theoretical analyses are also
provided to explain why the new implicit scheme with simple first-order interpolation can outperform
the same scheme with second-order interpolation, as well as the existing temporal extrapolation
and variable transformation schemes.
