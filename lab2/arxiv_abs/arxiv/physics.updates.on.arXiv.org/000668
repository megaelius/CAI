Directed links arise naturally in many social networks (and other complex networks), giving rise
to directed graphs as basic topological models for these networks. Reciprocity is a key metric that
has been used in the literature to compare different directed networks and provide "hints" about
their structural properties. For example, by comparing the reciprocity of an observed social network
with that of a random digraph generated with certain matching statistics, one can test whether reciprocated
links in the observed social networks are likely produced via a random process or not. In this paper
we argue that it is imperative to capture what is maximally achievable reciprocity, for an ensemble
of digraphs satisfying the same set of constraints. In particular we study the problem of maximizing
achievable reciprocity of digraphs with prescribed node in-degree and out-degree sequences,
and show that the maximum reciprocity hinges crucially on the prescribed degree sequences, which
may intuitively be interpreted as constraints on node "social bandwidth" capacities, thus impose
fundamental limits on the achievable reciprocities. We present a partial characterization of
digraphs that achieve maximum reciprocity. We also provide a simple upper bound on the maximum reciprocity
and sufficient conditions for achieving the bound. We demonstrate that many real networks exhibit
surprisingly high reciprocities that are fairly close to the upper bound. Our results imply that
many users in these social networks are in a sense more "social" than as suggested by the (average)
reciprocity metric in that they are more willing to reciprocate, subject to their "social bandwidth"
constraints.
