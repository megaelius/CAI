We calculate the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectra, strong-field ionization, and time-dependent
dipole-moment of Ne using explicitly time-dependent optimized second-order many-body perturbation
method (TD-OMP2) where both orbitals and amplitudes are time-dependent. We consider near-infrared
(800 nm) and mid-infrared (1200 nm) laser pulses with very high intensities ($5\times10^{14}$,
$8\times10^{14}$ , and $1\times10^{15}$ W/cm$^2$), required for strong-field experiments with
the high-ionization potential (21.6 eV) atom. We compare the result of the TD-OMP2 method with the
time-dependent complete-active-space self-consistent field method and the time-dependent
Hartree-Fock method. Further, we report the implementation of the TD-CC2 method within the chosen
active space, which is also a second-order approximation to the TD-CCSD method, and present results
of time-dependent dipole-moment and HHG spectra with an intensity of $5\times10^{13}$ W/cm$^2$
at a wavelength of 800 nm. It is found that the TD-CC2 method is not stable in the case with a higher laser
intensity, and it does not provide a gauge-invariant description of the physical properties, which
makes TD-OMP2 a superior choice to reach out to larger chemical systems, especially for the study
of strong-field dynamics. The obtained results indicate that the TD-OMP2 method shows moderate
performance, overestimating the response of Ne, while TDHF underestimates it. Nevertheless,
it is remarkable that stable computation of such highly nonlinear nonperturbative phenomena is
possible within the framework of time-dependent perturbation method, by virtue of the nonperturbative
inclusion of the laser-electron interaction and time-dependent optimization of orbitals.
