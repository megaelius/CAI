The ability to use concepts learned in one context to solve problems in a different context (i.e.,
transfer of learning) is a hallmark of expertise in physics. The majority of the studies on transfer
of learning in physics have focused on introductory students. However, compared to advanced students,
introductory students have significantly less prior relevant knowledge and skills which may be
crucial for promoting effective transfer. Here, we examine upper-level undergraduate and graduate
students' ability to transfer their learning about the concept of "which-path" information and
its relation to whether or not interference is observed from the context of the Mach Zehnder Interferometer
(MZI) to a new context of the double-slit experiment (DSE). Students worked through a tutorial on
the MZI in which they learned to use the concept of "which-path" information to reason about interference
of single photons when polarizers with various orientations are placed in one or both paths of the
MZI. After working on the MZI tutorial, students were asked similar questions in the isomorphic
context of the DSE before any instruction about the DSE and we examined the extent to which transfer
of learning about "which-path" information occurred from the MZI to the DSE context. We find evidence
suggesting that positive transfer of learning from the MZI to the DSE occurred despite the lack of
an instructional intervention designed to help students recognize the similarity between the
two contexts. The effectiveness of the MZI tutorial in promoting positive transfer of learning
from one context to another in quantum mechanics sheds light on the expertise of the advanced physics
students. Instructors of advanced physics courses can take advantage of the findings presented
here which shows the difference between introductory and advanced students' ability to transfer
from one context to another.
