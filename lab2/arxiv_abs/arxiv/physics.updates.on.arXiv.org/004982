A series of solar energetic particle (SEP) events were observed at Parker Solar Probe (PSP) by the
Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (\ISOIS) during the period from April 18, 2019 through
April 24, 2019. The PSP spacecraft was located near 0.48 au from the Sun on Parker spiral field lines
that projected out to 1 au within $\sim 25^\circ$ of near Earth spacecraft. These SEP events, though
small compared to historically large SEP events, were amongst the largest observed thus far in the
PSP mission and provide critical information about the space environment inside 1 au during SEP
events. During this period the Sun released multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs). One of these
CMEs observed was initiated on April 20, 2019 at 01:25 UTC, and the interplanetary CME (ICME) propagated
out and passed over the PSP spacecraft. Observations by the Electromagnetic Fields Investigation
(FIELDS) show that the magnetic field structure was mostly radial throughout the passage of the
compression region and the plasma that followed, indicating that PSP did not directly observe a
flux rope internal to the ICME, consistent with the location of PSP on the ICME flank. Analysis using
relativistic electrons observed near Earth by the Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor (EPAM) on
the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) demonstrates the presence of electron seed populations
(40--300 keV) during the events observed. The energy spectrum of the \ISOIS~ observed proton seed
population below 1 MeV is close to the limit of possible stationary state plasma distributions out
of equilibrium. \ISOIS~ observations reveal the \revise{enhancement} of seed populations during
the passage of the ICME, which \revise{likely indicates a key part} of the pre-acceleration process
that occurs close to the Sun.
