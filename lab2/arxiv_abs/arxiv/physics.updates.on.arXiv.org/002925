New geometric and analytic methods for generating exact and parametric solutions in generalized
Einstein-Finsler like gravity theories and nonholonomic Ricci soliton models are reviewed and
developed. We show how generalizations of the Schwarzschild - (anti) de Sitter metric can be constructed
for modified gravity theories with arbitrarily modified dispersion relations, MDRs, and Lorentz
invariance violations, LIVs. Such theories can be geometrized on cotangent Lorentz bundles (phase
spaces) as models of relativistic Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton spaces. There are considered two
general classes of solutions for gravitational stationary vacuum phase space configurations
and nontrivial (effective) matter sources or cosmological constants. Such solutions describe
nonholonomic deformations of conventional higher dimension black hole, BH, solutions with general
dependence on effective four-dimensional, 4-d, momentum type variables. For the first class,
we study physical properties of Tangherlini like BHs in phase spaces with generic dependence on
an energy coordinate/ parameter. We investigate also BH configurations on base spacetime and in
curved cofiber spaces when the BH mass and the maximal speed of light determine naturally a cofiber
horizon. For the second class, the solutions are constructed with Killing symmetry on an energy
type coordinate. There are analysed the conditions when generalizations of Beckenstein-Hawking
entropy (for solutions with conventional horizons) and/or Grigory Perelman's W-entropy (for
more general generic off-diagonal solutions) can be defined for phase space stationary configurations.
