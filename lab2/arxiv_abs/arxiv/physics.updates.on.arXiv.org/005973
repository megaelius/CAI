The recent coronavirus pandemic follows in its early stages an almost exponential growth, with
the number of cases quite well fit in time by $N(t)\propto e^{\alpha t}$, in many countries. We analyze
the rate $\alpha$ for each country, starting from a threshold of 30 total cases and using the next
12 days, capturing thus the early growth homogeneously. We look for a link between $\alpha$ and the
average temperature $T$ of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. We analyze a {\it base}
set of 42 countries, which developed the epidemic earlier, an {\it intermediate} set of 88 countries
and an {\it extended} set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently. Applying
a linear fit $\alpha(T)$, we find increasing evidence for a decreasing $\alpha$ as a function of
$T$, at $99.66\%$C.L., $99.86\%$C.L. and $99.99995 \%$ C.L. ($p$-value $5 \cdot 10^{-7}$, or 5$\sigma$
detection) in the {\it base}, {\it intermediate} and {\it extended} dataset, respectively. The
doubling time is expected to increase by $40\%\sim 50\%$, going from $5^\circ$ C to $25^\circ$ C.
In the {\it base} set, going beyond a linear model, a peak at $(7.7\pm 3.6)^\circ C$ seems to be present,
but its evidence disappears for the larger datasets. We also analyzed a possible bias: poor countries,
often located in warm regions, might have less intense testing. By excluding countries below a given
GDP per capita, we find that our conclusions are only slightly affected and only for the {\it extended}
dataset. The significance remains high, with a $p$-value of $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ or less. Our findings
give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease
as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully
stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the cold season.
