Despite recent advances driven by machine learning algorithms, experts agree that such algorithms
are still often unable to match the experience-based and intuitive problem solving skills of humans
in highly complex settings. Recent studies have demonstrated how the intuition of lay people in
citizen science games [1] and the experience of fusion-scientists [2] have assisted automated
search algorithms by restricting the size of the active search space leading to optimized results.
Humans, thus, have an uncanny ability to detect patterns and solution strategies based on observations,
calculations, or physical insight. Here we explore the fundamental question: Are these strategies
truly distinct or merely labels we attach to different points in a high dimensional continuum of
solutions? In the latter case, our human desire to identify patterns may lead us to terminate search
too early. We demonstrate that this is the case in a theoretical study of single atom transport in
an optical tweezer, where more than 200,000 citizen scientists helped probe the Quantum Speed Limit
[1]. With this insight, we develop a novel global entirely deterministic search methodology yielding
dramatically improved results. We demonstrate that this "bridging" of solution strategies can
also be applied to closed-loop optimization of the production of Bose-Einstein condensates. Here
we find improved solutions using two implementations of a novel remote interface. First, a team
of theoretical optimal control researchers employ a Remote version of their dCRAB optimization
algorithm (RedCRAB), and secondly a gamified interface allowed 600 citizen scientists from around
the world to participate in the optimization. Finally, the "real world" nature of such problems
allow for an entirely novel approach to the study of human problem solving, enabling us to run a hypothesis-driven
social science experiment "in the wild".
