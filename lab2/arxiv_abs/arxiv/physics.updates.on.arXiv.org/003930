"How much of the Solar System should we reserve as wilderness, off-limits to human development?"
We argue that, as a matter of policy, development should be limited to one eighth, with the remainder
set aside. We argue that adopting a "1/8 principle" is far less restrictive, overall, than it might
seem. One eighth of the iron in the asteroid belt is more than a million times greater than all of the
Earth's estimated iron reserves and may suffice for centuries. A limit of some sort is needed because
of the problems associated with exponential growth. Humans are poor at estimating the pace of such
growth, so the limitations of a resource are hard to recognize before the final three doubling times
which take utilization successively from 1/8 to 1/4 to 1/2, and then to the point of exhaustion. Population
growth and climate change are instances of unchecked exponential growth. Each places strains upon
ouru available resources. Each is a problem we would like to control but attempts to do so at this comparatively
late stage have not been encouraging. Our limited ability to see ahead suggests that we should set
ourselves a 'tripwire' that gives us at least 3 doubling times as leeway, i.e. when 1/8 of Solar System
resources are close to being exploited. At a 3.5 percent growth rate for the space economy, comparable
to that of the iron use from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution until now, the 1/8 point would
be reached after 400 years. At that point the 20 year doubling time of a 3.5 percent growth rate means
that only 60 years would remain to transition the economic system to new "steady state" conditions.
The rationale for adopting the 1/8 principle now is that it may be far easier to implement in principle
restrictions at an early stage, rather than later, when vested and competing interests have come
into existence.
