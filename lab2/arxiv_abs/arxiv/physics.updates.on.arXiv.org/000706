Using a large number of numerical simulations we examine the steady state of rotating turbulent
flows in triple periodic domains, varying the Rossby number $Ro$ (that measures the inverse rotation
rate) and the Reynolds number $Re$ (that measures the strength of turbulence). The examined flows
are sustained by either a helical or a non-helical Roberts force, that is invariant along the axis
of rotation. The forcing acts at a wavenumber $k_f$ such that $k_fL=4$, where $2\pi L$ is the size
of the domain. Different flow behaviours were obtained as the parameters are varied. Above a critical
rotation rate the flow becomes quasi two dimensional and transfers energy to the largest scales
of the system forming large coherent structures known as condensates. We examine the behaviour
of these condensates and their scaling properties close and away from this critical rotation rate.
Close to the the critical rotation rate the system transitions super-critically to the condensate
state displaying a bimodal behaviour oscillating randomly between an incoherent-turbulent state
and a condensate state. Away from the critical rotation rate, it is shown that two distinct mechanisms
can saturate the growth of the large scale energy. The first mechanism is due to viscous forces and
is similar to the saturation mechanism observed for the inverse cascade in two-dimensional flows.
The second mechanism is independent of viscosity and relies on the breaking of the two-dimensionalization
condition of the rotating flow. The two mechanisms predict different scaling with respect to the
control parameters of the system (Rossby and Reynolds), which are tested with the present results
of the numerical simulations. A phase space diagram in the $Re,Ro$ parameter plane is sketched.
