In this experimental study on a laboratory-scale turbulent annular combustor with sixteen swirl-stabilized
burners, we study the flame-flame and flame-acoustic interactions during different dynamical
states associated with the longitudinal mode of the combustor. We simultaneously measure the acoustic
pressure and CH* chemiluminescence emission of the flame using a high-speed camera. Upon increasing
the equivalence ratio, the combustor undergoes the following sequence of transition: combustion
noise (CN) to low amplitude longitudinal thermoacoustic instability (TAI) through the state of
intermittency (INT), and from low amplitude to high amplitude longitudinal TAI through a secondary
bifurcation. We report the first evidence of secondary bifurcation from low amplitude TAI to high
amplitude TAI for a turbulent thermoacoustic system which allows us to test the flame response at
two different amplitude of perturbation in a natural setting. We find a significant difference
in the dynamics of the flame interactions during the periodic part of intermittency and low and high
amplitude TAI. Specifically, during the periodic part of intermittency, the phase difference
between the local heat release rate (HRR) measured from various burners show significant phase
slips in time. During low amplitude TAI, there are fewer phase slips among the HRR response of the
burners, which result in a state of weak synchronization among the flames. During high amplitude
TAI, we find that the flames are in perfect synchrony amongst themselves and with the pressure fluctuations.
We then quantify the degree of temporal and spatial synchronization between different flames,
and flames and pressure fluctuations using the Kuramoto order parameter and the phase-locking
value. We show that synchronization theory can be conveniently used to characterize and quantify
flame-acoustic interactions in an annular combustor.
