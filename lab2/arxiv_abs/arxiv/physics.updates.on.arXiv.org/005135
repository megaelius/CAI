Newtonian physics is based on Newtonian calculus applied to Newtonian dynamics. New paradigms
such as MOND change the dynamics, but do not alter the calculus. Calculus is dependent on arithmetic,
e.g. in special relativity we add and subtract velocities by means of addition $\beta_1\oplus \beta_2=\tanh\big(\tanh^{-1}(\beta_1)+\tanh^{-1}(\beta_2)\big)$,
although multiplication $\beta_1\odot \beta_2=\tanh\big(\tanh^{-1}(\beta_1)\cdot\tanh^{-1}(\beta_2)\big)$
does not seem to appear in the literature. The map $f_\mathbb{X}(\beta)=\tanh^{-1}(\beta)$ defines
an isomorphism of the arithmetic in $\mathbb{X}=(-1,1)$ with the standard one in $\mathbb{R}$.
The new arithmetic is non-Diophantine in the sense of Burgin. Velocity of light plays a role of non-Diophantine
infinity. The new arithmetic allows us to define the corresponding derivative and integral, and
thus a new calculus which is non-Newtonian in the sense of Grossman and Katz. Treating he above example
as a paradigm, we ask what can be said about the set $\mathbb{X}$ and the isomorphism $f_{\mathbb{X}}:\mathbb{X}\to
\mathbb{R}$, if we assume the standard form of Newtonian mechanics and general relativity (formulated
by means of the new calculus) but demand agreement with astrophysical observations. It turns out
that for $f_\mathbb{X}(t/t_H)\approx 0.8\sinh (t-t_1)/(0.8\, t_H)$ the resulting non-Newtonian
Friedman equation with $\Omega_\Lambda=0$ is exactly quivalent to the standard Newtonian one
with $\Omega_\Lambda=0.7$, $\Omega_M=0.3$. Asymptotically flat rotation curves are obtained
if `zero', the neutral element of addition, is nonzero from the point of view of the standard arithmetic
of $\mathbb{R}$. We do not yet know if the proposed generalization ultimately removes any need of
dark matter, but it will certainly change estimates of its parameters.
