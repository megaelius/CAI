The low-frequency range of vibrational spectra is sensitive to collective vibrations of the lattice.
In molecular crystals, it can be decisive to identify the structure of different polymorphs, and
in addition, it plays an important role on the magnitude of the temperature-dependent component
of vibrational free energy differences between these crystals. In this work we study the vibrational
Raman spectra and vibrational density of states of different polymorphs of the flexible Aspirin
and Paracetamol crystals based on dispersion-corrected density-functional theory, density-functional
perturbation theory, and $ab\,initio$ molecular dynamics. We examine the effect of quasi-harmonic
lattice expansion and compare the results of harmonic theory and the time correlation formalism
for vibrational spectra. Lattice expansion and thermal nuclear motion strongly affect the collective
vibrations below 300 cm$^{-1}$, but both are significantly less important at higher frequencies.
We also observe that the inclusion or neglect of many-body van der Waals dispersion interactions
do not cause large differences in the low-frequency range of anharmonic Raman spectra or vibrational
density of states, provided the lattice constants are fixed. We obtain quantitative agreement
with experimental room-temperature Raman spectra below 300 cm$^{-1}$ for all polymorphs studied,
highlighting the necessity of going beyond the harmonic approximation for a better assignment
of different polymorphs based on this technique. Examining the two-dimensional correlations
between different vibrations, we find which modes show a larger degree of anharmonic coupling to
others, providing a possible route to assess the accuracy of harmonic free energy evaluations in
different cases.
