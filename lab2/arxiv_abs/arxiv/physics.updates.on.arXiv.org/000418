We discuss the application of Complex-Plane Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature (CGLQ) to efficiently
evaluate two-dimensional Fourier integrals arising as the solution to electromagnetic fields
radiated by elementary dipole antennas embedded within planar-layered media with arbitrary material
parameters. More specifically, we apply CGLQ to the long-standing problem of rapidly and efficiently
evaluating the semi-infinite length "tails" of the Fourier integral path while simultaneously
and robustly guaranteeing absolute, exponential convergence of the field solution despite diversity
in the doubly anisotropic layer parameters, source type (i.e., electric or equivalent magnetic
dipole), source orientation, observed field type (magnetic or electric), (non-zero) frequency,
and (non-zero) source-observer separation geometry. The proposed algorithm exhibits robustness
despite unique challenges arising for the fast evaluation of such two-dimensional integrals.
Herein, we (1) develop the mathematical treatment to rigorously evaluate the tail integrals using
CGLQ and (2) discuss and address the specific issues posed to the CGLQ method when anisotropic, layered
media are present. To empirically demonstrate the CGLQ algorithm's computational efficiency,
versatility, and accuracy, we perform a convergence analysis along with two case studies related
to (a) modeling of electromagnetic resistivity tools employed in geophysical prospection of layered,
anisotropic Earth media and (b) validating the ability of isoimpedance substrates to enhance the
radiation performance of planar antennas placed in close proximity to metallic ground planes.
