Tunable optical material properties enable novel applications in both versatile metamaterials
and photonic components including optical sources and modulators. Transparent conductive oxides
(TCOs) are able to highly tune their optical properties with applied bias via altering their free
carrier concentration and hence plasma dispersion. The TCO material indium tin oxide (ITO) exhibits
unity-strong index changes, and epsilon-near-zero behavior. However, with such tuning the corresponding
high optical losses, originating from the fundamental Kramers-Kronig relations, result in low
cavity finesse. However, achieving efficient tuning in ITO-cavities without using light matter
interaction enhancement techniques such as polaritonic modes, which are inherently lossy, is
a challenge. Here we discuss a novel one-dimensional photonic crystal nanobeam cavity to deliver
a cavity system offering a wide range of resonance tuning range, while preserving physical compact
footprints. We show that a vertical Silicon-slot waveguide incorporating an actively gated-ITO
layer delivers ~3.4 nm of tuning. By deploying distributed feedback, we are able to keep the Q-factor
moderately high with tuning. Combining this with the sub-diffraction limited mode volume (0.1
({\lambda}/2n)3) from the photonic (non-plasmonic) slot waveguide, facilitates a high Purcell
factor exceeding one thousand. This strong light-matter-interaction shows that reducing the
mode volume of a cavity outweighs reducing the losses in diffraction limited modal cavities such
as those from bulk Si3N4. These tunable cavities enable future modulators and optical sources such
as tunable lasers.
