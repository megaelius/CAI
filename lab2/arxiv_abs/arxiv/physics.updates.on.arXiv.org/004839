Magnetic reconnection provides the primary source for explosive energy release, plasma heating
and particle acceleration in many astrophysical environments. The last years witnessed a revival
of interest in the MHD tearing instability as a driver for efficient reconnection. It has been established
that, provided the current sheet aspect ratio becomes small enough ($a/L \sim S^{-1/3}$ for a given
Lundquist number $S\gg 1$), reconnection occurs on ideal Alfv\'en timescales and becomes independent
on $S$. Here we investigate, by means of two-dimensional simulations, the \emph{ideal} tearing
instability in the Hall-MHD regime, which is appropriate when the width of the resistive layer $\delta$
becomes comparable to the ion inertial length $d_i$. Moreover, we study in detail the spontaneous
development and reconnection of secondary current sheets, which for high $S$ naturally adjust
to the ideal aspect ratio and hence their evolution proceeds very rapidly. For moderate low $S$,
the aspect ratio tends to the Sweet-Parker scaling ($a/L \sim S^{-1/2}$), in order to fulfill the
condition $\delta \ll a$ necessary for the onset of a tearing instability. When the Hall term is included,
the reconnection rate of this secondary nonlinear phase is enhanced and, depending on the ratio
$d_i/\delta$, can be twice with respect to the pure MHD case, and up to ten times larger than the linear
phase. Therefore, the evolution of the tearing instability in thin current sheets in the Hall-MHD
regime naturally leads to an explosive disruption of the reconnecting site and to energy release
on super-Alfv\'enic timescales, as required to explain astrophysical observations.
