When a low-energy positron (the antiparticle of the electron) annihilates in a gas of polyatomic
molecules, the annihilation rates are found to be several orders of magnitude greater than in a free-electron
gas with the same number density. The annihilation rates also display a very strong dependence on
the molecular size and remarkable chemical sensitivity. These data remained largely unexplained
until a concerted effort of theory and experiment showed that this phenomenon is due to resonant
annihilation, in which the positron is captured by the molecule, its excess energy being transferred
into molecular vibrations. Key to this process is the existence of positron-molecule bound states.
Binding energies ranging from few to few hundred of meV, have now been determined for over seventy
molecular species, by measuring energy-resolved annihilation with a trap-based positron beam.
By contrast, quantum-chemistry calculations have so far failed to predict positron binding for
most of these molecules. Here we construct a simple physical model that allows calculations of positron
binding to large polyatomic species and has predictive capability. We find good agreement with
experiment, which shows that the positron-molecule potential is largely 'additive' and distributed
over the molecule, and its short-range part is just as important as the long-range behaviour determined
by the molecular polarizability. This short-range part is very difficult to describe ab initio
with the required accuracy, but we parametrize it in a reliable way. This opens the way for calculating
positron binding energies, annihilation rates, and gamma spectra for all molecules that have been
studied experimentally and for making predictions for other molecules.
