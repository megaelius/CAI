Transistors are the cornerstone of modern electronics. Yet, their relatively complex characteristics,
allied with often observed great parameter variation, remain a challenge for discrete and integrated
electronics. Much of transistor research and applications have relied on transistor models, as
well as respective equivalent circuits, to be employed for circuit analysis and simulations. Here,
a simple and yet accurate transistor equivalent circuit is derived, based on the Early effect, which
involves only the voltage $V_a$ and a companion parameter $s$. Equations are obtained for currents
and voltages in a common-emitter circuit, allowing the derivation of respective gain functions.
These functions are found to exhibit interesting mathematical structure, with gain values varying
almost linearly with the base current, allowing the gains to be well characterized in terms of their
average and variation values. These results are applied to deriving a prototypic Early space summarizing
the characteristics of transistors, enriched with recently experimentally obtained prototypes
of NPN and PNP silicon BJTs and alloy germanium transistors. Though a trade-off between gain and
linearity is revealed, a band characterized by small values of $V_a$ stands out when aiming at both
high gain and low distortion. The Early equivalent model was used also for studying the stability
of circuits under voltage supply oscillations, as well as parallel combinations of transistors.
In the former case, it was verified that more traditional approaches assuming constant current
gain can yield stability factors that deviate substantially from those derived for the more accurate
Early approach. The equivalent circuit obtained for parallel combinations of transistors was
shown also to closely follow the Early formulation.
