The physics leading to the decrease of the divertor ion current ($I_t$), or 'roll-over' during detachment
for divertor power exhaust in tokamaks is experimentally explored on the TCV tokamak through characterization
of the location, magnitude and role of the various divertor ion sinks and sources including a complete
measure of particle and power balance. These first measurements of the profiles of divertor ionisation
and hydrogenic radiation along the divertor leg are enabled through novel spectroscopic techniques
which are introduced. Over a range in TCV plasma conditions (plasma current, impurity-seeding,
density) the $I_t$ roll-over is caused by a drop in the divertor ion source; recombination remains
either small or negligible until later in the detachment process. In agreement with simple analytical
predictions, this ion source reduction is driven by a reduction in the power available for ionization,
Precl, sometimes characterised as 'power starvation'. The concurrent increase in the energy required
per ionisation, $E_{ion}$, further reduces the number of ionizations. The measured divertor profile
evolution through detachment of the various ion sources/sinks as well as power losses and charge
exchange are quantitatively reproduced through full 2D SOLPS modelling of a ramp of core plasma
density through the detachment process. The detachment threshold is found experimentally (in
agreement with analytic model predictions) to be $\sim P_{recl}/I_t E_{ion} \sim 2$, which corresponds
to the target electron temperature, $T_t \propto E_{ion}/{\gamma}$ where ${\gamma}$ is the sheath
transmission coefficient. The loss in target pressure, required for target ion current loss, is
driven not by just volumetric momentum loss as typically assumed but also due to a drop of upstream
pressure.
