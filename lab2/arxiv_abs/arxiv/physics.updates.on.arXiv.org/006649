We study the flow dynamics inside a high-speed rotating cylinder after introducing strong symmetry-breaking
disturbance factors at cylinder wall motion. We propose and formulate a mathematically robust
stochastic model for the rotational motion of cylinder wall alongside the stochastic representation
of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We employ a comprehensive stochastic computational
fluid dynamics framework combining spectral/$hp$ element method and probabilistic collocation
method to obtain high-fidelity realizations of our mathematical model in order to quantify the
propagation of parametric uncertainty for dynamics-representative quantities of interests.
We observe that the modeled symmetry-breaking disturbances cause a flow instability arising from
the wall. Utilizing global sensitivity analysis approaches, we identify the dominant source of
uncertainty in our proposed model. We next perform a qualitative and quantitative statistical
analysis on the fluctuating fields characterizing the fingerprints and measures of intense and
rapidly evolving non-Gaussian behavior through space and time. We claim that such non-Gaussian
statistics essentially emerge and evolve due to an intensified presence of coherent vortical motions
initially triggered by the flow instability due to symmetry-breaking rotation of the cylinder.
We show that this mechanism causes memory effects in the flow dynamics in a way that noticeable anomaly
in the time-scaling of enstrophy record is observed in the long run apart from the onset of instability.
Our findings suggest an effective strategy to exploit controlled flow instabilities in order to
enhance the turbulent mixing in engineering applications.
