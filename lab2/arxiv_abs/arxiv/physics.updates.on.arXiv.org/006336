SARS-CoV-2 has a long survive time on different surfaces and can remain viable under different environments
as reported in recent studies. However, it is still unclear how the viruses survive for such a long
time and why their survivability varies between different surfaces. To address these questions,
we conducted systematic experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer
and human-exhaled gas on different surfaces. We found that these droplets do not disappear immediately
with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers (referred to as residues) which
can stay on a surface for more than 24 hours. The evaporation characteristics of these residues change
significantly with surface types. Specifically, the surfaces with high thermal conductivity
like copper do not leave any resolvable residues, while stainless steel, plastic and glass surfaces
form residues that remain stable for extended durations. Lowering humidity can significantly
suppress the formation of residues. Such trends are well correlated with SARS-CoV-2 survivability
measurements in the literature. Our results suggest that these microscale residues can potentially
insulate the virus against environmental changes, allowing them to survive inhospitable environments
and remain infectious for prolonged durations after deposition. Our findings are also applicable
for other viruses that are transmitted through respiratory droplets (e.g., SARS-CoV-1, flu viruses,
etc.), and can lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces of different types and other
prevention measures (e.g., humidity control) for limiting virus infection.
