We derive here Lagrangian fluctuation-dissipation relations for advected scalars in wall-bounded
flows. The relations equate the dissipation rate for either passive or active scalars to the variance
of scalar inputs from the initial values, boundary values, and internal sources, as those are sampled
backward in time by stochastic Lagrangian trajectories. New probabilistic concepts are required
to represent scalar boundary conditions at the walls: the boundary local-time density at points
on the wall where scalar fluxes are imposed and the boundary first hitting-time at points where scalar
values are imposed. These concepts are illustrated both by analytical results for the problem of
pure heat conduction and by numerical results from a database of channel-flow flow turbulence,
which also demonstrate the scalar mixing properties of near-wall turbulence. As an application
of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, we examine for wall-bounded flows the relation between
anomalous scalar dissipation and Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity, i.e. the persistent
non-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity.
In the first paper of this series, we showed that spontaneous stochasticity is the only possible
mechanism for anomalous dissipation of passive or active scalars, away from walls. Here it is shown
that this remains true when there are no scalar fluxes through walls. Simple examples show, on the
other hand, that a distinct mechanism of non-vanishing scalar dissipation can be thin scalar boundary
layers near the walls. Nevertheless, we prove for general wall-bounded flows that spontaneous
stochasticity is another possible mechanism of anomalous scalar dissipation.
