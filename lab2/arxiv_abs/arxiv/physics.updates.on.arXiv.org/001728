Equations are about more than computing physical quantities or constructing formal models; they
are also about understanding. The conceptual systems physicists use to think about nature are made
from many different resources, formal and not, working together and inextricably linked. By blending
mathematical forms and physical intuition, physicists breathe meaning into the equations they
use. In contrast, in physics class, novice students often treat mathematics as only a calculational
tool, isolating it from their rich knowledge of the physical world. We are interested in cases where
students break that pattern by reading, manipulating, and building equations meaningfully rather
than purely formally. To find examples of this and explore the diversity of ways students combine
formal and intuitive resources, we conducted problem-solving interviews with students in an introductory
physics for life sciences class. During the interviews, we scaffolded student use of strategies
which call for both formal and intuitive reasoning, such as "examine the extreme cases". We use the
analytic framework of epistemic games to model how students used the strategies and how they accessed
problem-solving resources, and we present evidence that novice students using these strategies
accessed more expert-like conceptual systems than those typically described in problem-solving
literature. They blended physical intuition with mathematical symbolic templates, reconceptualized
the nature of equations, and distinguished similar functional forms. Once introduced to a strategy,
students applied it to new scenarios and found new types of uses for it, acknowledging it as a useful,
general purpose problem-solving technique. Our data suggests that these strategies can potentially
help novice students learn to develop and apply their physical intuition more effectively.
