Theoretical calculations are contributing a significantly higher proportion of data to contemporary
spectroscopic databases, which have traditionally relied on experimental observations and semi-empirical
models. It is now a common procedure to extend calculated line lists to include ro-vibrational transitions
between all bound states of the ground electronic state up to the dissociation limit. Advanced ab
initio methods are utilized to calculate the potential energy and dipole moment surfaces (PESs
and DMSs), and semi-empirical PESs are then obtained by combining ab initio and experimental data.
The objective is to reach high accuracy in the calculated transition intensities for all parts of
spectrum, i.e. to increase the predictive power of the model. We show that in order to perform this
task, one needs, in addition to the standard improvements of the PES and DMS in the spectroscopically
accessible regions, to extend the ab initio calculations of the PES towards the united-atom limit
along the stretching coordinates. The argument is based on the correlation between the intensities
of high-overtone transitions and the repulsive potential wall that has previously been theoretically
established for diatomic molecules and is empirically extended here to linear and nonlinear triatomic
molecules. We generate partial line lists for water and ozone, and together with an already available
line list for carbon dioxide, we derive the normal intensity distribution, which is a direct consequence
of this correlation. The normal distribution is not an instrument to compute highly accurate intensities,
rather it is a means to analyze the intensities computed by the traditional methods.
