Realization of on-chip scalable quantum optical circuits comprising single photon source array
with each source integrated with light manipulating units to enable photon interference from distinct
sources is a key goal towards photonic quantum information processing. To this end we have proposed
a new approach that exploits the recently demonstrated spatially-regular and spectrally uniform
array of mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) as on-chip single photon sources integrated with
subwavelength-sized dielectric building block (DBB) based light manipulating units (LMUs) that
exploit a single collective Mie resonance to implement the needed light manipulating functions
[1]. In this work we present simulations of the performance of light manipulating units (LMUs) that
provide all five required functions: enhancement of the quantum dot spontaneous emission rate
and directing the emission (a local nanoantenna effect) into a waveguide for state-preserving
propagation, bifurcating the propagating photon path (beam-splitting), and combining photons
from differing sources to enable and control on-chip photon interference. As all the functions
are provided by the same spectral mode in differing spatial regions of the LMU, there is no issue of
impedance matching, unlike approaches that view each function arising from a distinct entity (cavity,
waveguide, beam-splitter, etc.). We present the findings of a systematic investigation of such
optical circuit and discuss the single photon interference from distinct SQDs underlying quantum
information processing. The approach is equally applicable to any class of solid-state single
photon source array.
