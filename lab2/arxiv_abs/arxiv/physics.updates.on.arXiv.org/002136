Lattice Boltzmann (LB) models used for the computation of fluid flows represented by the Navier-Stokes
(NS) equations on standard lattices can lead to non-Galilean invariant (GI) viscous stress involving
cubic velocity errors. This arises from the dependence of their third order diagonal moments on
the first order moments for standard lattices, and strategies have recently been introduced to
restore GI without such errors using a modified collision operator involving either corrections
to the relaxation times or to the moment equilibria. Convergence acceleration in the simulation
of steady flows can be achieved by solving the preconditioned NS equations, which contain a preconditioning
parameter that alleviates the numerical stiffness. In the present study, we present a GI formulation
of the preconditioned cascaded central moment LB method used to solve the preconditioned NS equations,
which is free of cubic velocity errors on a standard lattice. A Chapman-Enskog analysis reveals
the structure of the spurious non-GI defect terms and it is demonstrated that the anisotropy of the
resulting viscous stress is dependent on the preconditioning parameter, in addition to the fluid
velocity. It is shown that partial correction to eliminate the cubic velocity defects is achieved
by scaling the cubic velocity terms in the off-diagonal third-order moment equilibria with the
square of the preconditioning parameter. Furthermore, we develop additional corrections based
on the extended moment equilibria involving gradient terms with coefficients dependent locally
on the fluid velocity and the preconditioning parameter. Several conclusions are drawn from the
analysis of the structure of the non-GI errors and the associated corrections, with particular
emphasis on their dependence on the preconditioning parameter. Improvements in accuracy and convergence
acceleration are demonstrated.
