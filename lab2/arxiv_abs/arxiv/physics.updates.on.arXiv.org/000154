In this paper, we study numerically the linear damped second-order hyperbolic partial differential
equation (PDE) with affine parameter dependence using a goal-oriented approach by finite element
(FE) and reduced basis (RB) methods. The main contribution of this paper is the "goal-oriented"
proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Greedy sampling procedure within the RB approximation
context. This proposed procedure makes use of the information of the solution of the associated
dual (or adjoint) problem and the primal residual similarly to the well-known dual-weighted residual
(DWR) technique developed earlier. First, we introduce the RB recipe: Galerkin projection onto
a space $Y_N$ spanned by solutions of the governing PDE at $N$ selected points in parameter space.
This set of $N$ parameter points is constructed very optimally by the proposed goal-oriented POD-Greedy
sampling procedure. Second, based on the affine parameter dependence, we make use of the offline-online
computational procedures: in the offline stage, we generate the RB space; in the online stage, given
a new parameter value, we calculate rapidly the RB output of interest. We then, in turn, test this
new goal-oriented and the standard POD-Greedy sampling procedures on a three-dimensional dental
implant model problem. Numerical results show that the new goal-oriented POD-Greedy sampling
procedure improves significantly the accuracy of the output computation in comparison with the
standard POD-Greedy one; and the method is thus ideally suited for repeated, rapid, reliable evaluation
of input-output relationships in the many-query or real-time contexts.
