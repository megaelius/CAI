The effect of the laser ray incidence angle on the mass ablation rate and ablation pressure of planar
inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets is explored using an idealized model. Polar direct drive
(PDD) on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) requires the repointing of its 192 beams clustered
within 50 degrees of the poles to minimize the imparted polar varying payload kinetic energy of the
target. Due to this repointing, non-normal incidence angles of the beam centerlines are encountered
in any PDD design. The formulation of a PDD scheme that minimizes non-uniformity is a significant
challenge that requires an understanding of the induced differences in ablation including those
of incidence angle. In this work, a modified version of the textbook model of laser ablation [Manheimer
et al. Phys. Fluids 25, 1644 (1982)] is used to demonstrate that the mass ablation rate and ablation
pressure scale with the 4/3 and 2/3 power of the cosine of the laser ray incidence angle for the planar
case during the beginning portion of the laser ablation. This result is considered with an idealized
1-D two segment planar model using rays at different incidence angles for each segment. Within the
model, the segments cannot have equal mass and velocity simultaneously without tailoring the ray's
time-dependent intensity for each segment. However, with the correct segment-to-segment time-independent
ray intensities, equal velocity and dynamic pressure can be achieved approximately without tailoring.
Additionally, an analytic prediction for the conduction zone width as a function of incidence angle
is provided. It is predicted that this width increases with incidence angle, resulting in a decrease
in laser imprint, an effect which has been previously observed in experiments. These results, when
generalized to spherical geometry, may provide insight into the implosion dynamics encountered
in PDD.
