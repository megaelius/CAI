In this work, the coupled dynamics of the gap flow and the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) on a side-by-side
(SBS) arrangement of two circular cylinders is numerically investigated at moderate Reynolds
number 100 < Re < 800. Of particular interest is to establish a relationship between the VIV, the gap
flow and the near-wake instability behind bluff bodies. We find that the kinematics of the VIV regulates
the streamwise vorticity concentration, which accompanies with a recovery of two-dimensional
hydrodynamic responses at the peak lock-in stage. On the other hand, the near-wake instability
may develop around an in-determinant two-dimensional streamline saddle point along the interfaces
of a pair of imbalanced counter-signed vorticity clusters. The vorticity concentration difference
of adjacent vorticity clusters and the fluid momentum are closely interlinked with the prominence
of streamwise vortical structures. In both SSBS and VSBS arrangements, the flip-flopping frequency
is significantly low for the three-dimensional flow, except at the VIV lock-in stage for the VSBS
arrangement. A quasi-stable deflected gap flow regime with negligible spanwise hydrodynamic
(i.e., two-dimensional) response is found at the peak lock-in stage of VSBS arrangements. Owing
to the gap-flow proximity interference, a high streamwise vorticity concentration is observed
in its narrow near-wake region. The increase of the gap-flow proximity interference tends to stabilize
the VIV lock-in, which eventually amplifies the spanwise correlation length and weakens the streamwise
vortical structures. We employ the dynamic mode decomposition procedure to characterize the space-time
evolution of the primary vortex wake.
