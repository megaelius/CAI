Inferring flow properties from geometry alone is of practical importance in a range of systems,
including biological tissues and particulate materials. In the latter case, a key and hard-to-measure
quantity controlling plasticity is the density $P(x)$ of weak spots, where $x$ is the additional
stress required for local failure. In the thermodynamic limit $P(x)$ is singular at $x= 0$ in the
entire solid phase below the yield stress $\Sigma_c$, and marks the presence of avalanches of plastic
events that become smaller only for stresses $\Sigma>\Sigma_c$. We first show that the vertex model
of epithelial tissues has a similar phenomenology: in the absence of noise, it presents a yield stress
$\Sigma_c$ above which a stationary flow rate $\dot\gamma>0$ is sustainable. The avalanches size
$S$ and their duration $\tau$ diverge as $S \sim \dot{\gamma}^{-a}$ and $\tau \sim \dot{\gamma}^{-c}$
respectively, with $a \approx1/4$ and $c \approx 2/3$. Yet, we argue quite generally and test in
that model that for energy functionals that depend on topology, the stability $x$ of weak spots (called
T1 transitions in that context) is proportional to the length $L$ of the bond that vanishes in this
event. This implies that for this class of models $P(x)$ is readily measurable from geometry alone.
We find that $P(L)$ exhibits a power law in the developing fruit fly wing with exponents similar to
that of the vertex model in its solid phase. It raises the possibility that collective and non-linear
effects are important during development, and suggests a new route to study outstanding questions
associated with the yielding transition.
