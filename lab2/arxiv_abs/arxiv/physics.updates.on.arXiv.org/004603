The two only species of isolatable, smallest, or unit charges +e and -e present in nature interact
with the universal vacuum in a polarisable dielectric representation through two uniquely defined
vacuum potential functions. All of the non-composite subatomic particles containing one-unit
charges, +e or -e, are therefore formed in terms of the IED model of the respective charges, of zero
rest masses, oscillating in either of the two unique vacuum potential fields, together with the
radiation waves of their own charges. In this paper we give a first principles treatment of the dynamics
of charge in a dielectric vacuum, based on which, combined with solutions for the radiation waves
obtained previously, we subsequently derive the vacuum potential function for a given charge q,
which we show to be quadratic and consist each of quantised potential levels, giving therefore rise
to quantised characteristic oscillation frequencies of the charge and accordingly quantised,
sharply-defined masses of the IED particles. By further combining with relevant experimental
properties as input information, we determine the IED particles built from the charges +e,-e at
their first excited states in the respective vacuum potential wells to be the proton and the electron,
the observationally two only stable (permanently lived) and "free" particles containing one-unit
charges. Their antiparticles as produced in pair productions can be accordingly determined. The
characteristics of all of the other more energetic non-composite subatomic particles can also
be recognised. We finally discuss the energy condition for pair production, which requires two
successive energy supplies to (1) first disintegrate the bound pair of vaculeon charges +e,-e composing
a vacuuon of the vacuum and (2) impart masses to the disintegrated charges.
