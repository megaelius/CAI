Pseudoscalar or pseudovector cosmic fields, that serve as a source of parity ($\mathcal{P}$) violation,
are invoked in different models for cold dark matter or in the standard model extension that allows
for Lorentz invariance violation. A direct detection of the timelike-component of such fields
requires a direct measurement of $\mathcal{P}$-odd potentials or their evolution over time. Herein,
advantageous properties of chiral molecules, in which $\mathcal{P}$-odd potentials lead to resonance
frequency differences between enantiomers, for direct detection of such $\mathcal{P}$-odd cosmic
fields are demonstrated. Scaling behavior of electronic structure enhancements of such interactions
with respect to nuclear charge number and the fine-structure constant is derived analytically.
This allows a simple estimate of the effect sizes for arbitrary molecules. The analytical derivation
is supported by quasi-relativistic numerical calculations in the molecules H$_2$X$_2$ and H$_2$XO
with X $=$ O, S, Se, Te, Po. Parity violating effects due to cosmic fields on the C--F stretching mode
in CHBrClF are compared to electroweak parity violation and influences of non-separable anharmonic
vibrational corrections are discussed. On this basis it was estimated from a twenty year old experiment
with CHBrClF that bounds on Lorentz invariance violation as characterized by the parameter $|b^\mathrm{e}_0|$
can be pushed down to the order of $10^{-17}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ in modern experiments with suitably
selected molecular system, which will be an improvement of the current best limits by at least two
orders of magnitude. This serves to highlight the particular opportunities that precision spectroscopy
of chiral molecules provides in the search for new physics beyond the standard model.
