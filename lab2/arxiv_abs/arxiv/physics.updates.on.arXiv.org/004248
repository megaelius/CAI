Ultrasound Computed Tomography (USCT) has great potential for 3D quantitative imaging of acoustic
breast tissue properties. Typical devices include high-frequency transducers, which makes tomography
techniques based on numerical wave propagation simulations computationally challenging, especially
in 3D. Therefore, despite the finite-frequency nature of ultrasonic waves, ray-theoretical approaches
to transmission tomography are still widely used. This work introduces finite-frequency traveltime
tomography to medical ultrasound. In addition to being computationally tractable for 3D imaging
at high frequencies, the method has two main advantages: (1) It correctly accounts for the frequency
dependence and volumetric sensitivity of traveltime measurements, which are related to off-ray-path
scattering and diffraction. (2) It naturally enables out-of-plane imaging and the construction
of 3D images from 2D slice-by-slice acquisition systems. Our method rests on the availability of
calibration data in water, used to linearize the forward problem and to provide analytical expressions
of cross-correlation traveltime sensitivity. As a consequence of the finite frequency content,
sensitivity is distributed in multiple Fresnel volumes, thereby providing out-of-plane sensitivity.
To improve computational efficiency, we develop a memory-efficient implementation by encoding
the Jacobian operator with a 1D parameterization, which allows us to extend the method to large-scale
domains. We validate our tomographic approach using lab measurements collected with a 2D setup
of transducers and using a cylindrically symmetric phantom. We then demonstrate its applicability
for 3D reconstructions by simulating a slice-by-slice acquisition systems using the same dataset.
