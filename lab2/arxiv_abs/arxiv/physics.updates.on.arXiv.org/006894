There is mounting evidence that lipid bilayers display conductive properties. However, when interpreting
the electrical response of biological membranes to voltage changes, they are commonly considered
as inert insulators. However, lipid bilayers under voltage-clamp conditions do not only display
current traces with discrete conduction-steps indistinguishable from those attributed to the
presence of protein channels. In current-voltage (I-V) plots they may also display outward rectification,
i.e., voltage-gating. Surprisingly, this has even been observed in chemically symmetric lipid
bilayers. Here, we investigate this phenomenon using a theoretical framework that models the electrostrictive
effect of voltage on lipid membranes in the presence of a spontaneous polarization, which can be
recognized by a voltage offset in electrical measurements. It can arise from an asymmetry of the
membrane, for example from a nonzero spontaneous curvature of the membrane. This curvature can
be caused by voltage via the flexoelectric effect, or by hydrostatic pressure differences across
the membrane. Here, we describe I-V relations for lipid membranes formed at the tip of patch pipettes
situated close to an aqueous surface. We measured at different depths relative to air/water surface,
resulting in different pressure gradients across the membrane. Both linear and nonlinear I-V profiles
were observed. Nonlinear conduction consistently takes the form of outward rectified currents.
We explain the conductance properties by two mechanisms: One leak current with constant conductance
without pores, and a second process that is due to voltage-gated pore opening correlating with the
appearance of channel-like conduction steps. In some instances, these nonlinear I-V relations
display a voltage regime in which dI/dV is negative. This has also been previously observed in the
presence of sodium channels. ...
