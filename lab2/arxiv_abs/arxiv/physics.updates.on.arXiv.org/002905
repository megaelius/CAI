For several years, attempts have been made to interface Geant4 and other software packages with
the aim of simulating the complete response of a gaseous particle detector. In such a simulation,
Geant4 is always responsible for the primary particle generation and the interactions that occur
in the non-gaseous detector material. Garfield++ on the hand always deals with the drift of ions
and electrons, amplification via electron avalanches and finally signal generation and readout
of the signal. For the ionizing interaction of particles with the gas, different options and physics
models exist. The present paper focuses on how to use Geant4, Garfield++ (including its Heed and
SRIM interfaces) and Degrad to create the ionization electron-ion pairs in the gas. Software wise,
the proposed idea is to use the Geant4 physics parameterization feature, and to implement a Garfield++
or Degrad based detector simulation as an external model. With a Degrad model, detailed simulations
of the X-ray interaction in gaseous detectors, including shell absorption by photoelectric effect,
subsequent Auger cascade, shake-off, and fluorescence emission, become possible. A simple Garfield++
model can be used for photons (Heed), ions (SRIM) and relativistic charged particles (Heed). For
non-relativistic charged particles, more effort is required, and a combined Geant4/Garfield++
model (the Geant4/Heed PAI model interface) must be used. Parameters, such as the lower production
cut of the Geant4 PAI model and the lowest electron energy limit of the physics list have to be set correctly.
The paper demonstrates how to determine these parameters for certain values of the W parameter and
Fano factor of the gas mixture. The simulation results of this Geant4/Heed PAI model interface are
then verified against the results obtained with the stand-alone software packages.
