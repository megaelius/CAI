Autocatalytic networks have been used to model the emergence of self-organizing structure capable
of sustaining life and undergoing biological evolution. Here, we model the emergence of cognitive
structure capable of undergoing cultural evolution. Mental representations of knowledge and
experiences play the role of catalytic molecules, and interactions amongst them (e.g., the forging
of new associations) play the role of reactions, and result in representational redescription.
The approach tags mental representations with their source, i.e., whether they were acquired through
social learning, individual learning (of pre-existing information), or creative thought (resulting
in the generation of new information). This makes it possible to model how cognitive structure emerges,
and to trace lineages of cumulative culture step by step. We develop a formal representation of the
cultural transition from Oldowan to Acheulean tool technology using Reflexively Autocatalytifc
and Food set generated (RAF) networks. Unlike more primitive Oldowan stone tools, the Acheulean
hand axe required not only the capacity to envision and bring into being something that did not yet
exist, but hierarchically structured thought and action, and the generation of new mental representations:
the concepts EDGING, THINNING, SHAPING, and a meta-concept, HAND AXE. We show how this constituted
a key transition towards the emergence of semantic networks that were self-organizing, self-sustaining,
and autocatalytic, and discuss how such networks replicated through social interaction. The model
provides a promising approach to unraveling one of the greatest anthropological mysteries: that
of why development of the Acheulean hand axe was followed by over a million years of cultural stasis.
