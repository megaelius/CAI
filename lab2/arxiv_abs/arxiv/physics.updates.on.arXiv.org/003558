Geothermal energy is the key to drive the plate tectonics and interior thermodynamics of the Earth.
The surface heat flux, as measured in boreholes, provide limited insights into the relative contributions
of primordial versus radiogenic sources of the heat budget of the mantle. Geoneutrinos, electron
antineutrinos that produced from the radioactive decay of the heat producing elements, are unique
probes that bring direct information about the amount and distribution of heat producing elements
in the crust and mantle. Cosmochemical, geochemical, and geodynamic compositional models of the
Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) individually predicts different mantle neutrino fluxes, and therefore
can be distinguished by the direct measurement of geoneutrinos. The 20 kton detector of the Jiangmen
Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), currently under construction in the Guangdong Province
(China), is expected to provide an exciting opportunity to obtain a high statistics measurement,
which will produce sufficient data to address several key questions of geological importance.
To test different compositional models of the mantle, an accurate estimation of the crust geoneutrino
flux based on a three-dimensional (3-D) crust model in advance is important. This paper presents
a 3-D crust model over a surface area of 10-degrees-times-10-degrees grid surrounding the JUNO
detector and a depth down to the Moho discontinuity, based on the geological, geophysical and geochemistry
properties. The 3-D model provides a distinction of the volumes of the different geological layers
together with the corresponding Th and U abundances. We also present our predicted local contribution
to the total geoneutrino flux and the corresponding radiogenic heat.
