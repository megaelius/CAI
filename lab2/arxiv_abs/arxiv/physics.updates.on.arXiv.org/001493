During electrostatic bonding, also known as anodic bonding, silicon is bonded to glass by applying
an external voltage and simultaneous heating to temperatures of 200...450 $\deg$C. While cooling
to working temperature after bonding happened pieces are mutually deformed. Due to linear thermal
expansion coefficients mismatch of anodically bonded glass and silicon samples an internal stress
state is generated. Such stresses are called thermal mismatch stresses. The aim of this paper is
a determination of technological and design solutions to achieve minimal thermal mismatch stresses
in resulting bond. The nonlinear dependence of linear thermal expansion coefficients of bonded
samples' materials on temperature makes it difficult to minimize thermal mismatch stresses by
chosing materials with close average thermal expansion coefficients in particular temperature
range. To assess means of lowering thermal mismatch stress in this paper two different ways to describe
assembly are used: two thin bonded layers and multilayered composite material. Based on properties
of two brands of glass (LK5, Borofloat 33) and silicon used with described mathematical models thermal
mismatch stresses at temperature $T_w$ in samples bonded at several different temperatures $T_b$
are evaluated. Bonded silicon surface stress dependence of glass to silicon wafer thickness ratio
is evaluated. Based on such evaluations one can say that by varying thickness of glass bonded to silicon
one can obtain zero thermal mismatch stress at a particular depth of material or obtain stress of
some defined value at this depth. Models of assembly description used in this paper can be used to
optimize anodic bonding process parameters. Such usage aimed to minimize thermal mismatch stresses
at device working temperatures is presented in this paper.
