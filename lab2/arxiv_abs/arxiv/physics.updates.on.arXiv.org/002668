Tunable narrowband spectral filters with high light throughput and wide dynamic range have remarkable
applications such as in optical communications, optical spectroscopy and spectral imaging. However,
a cost is usually associated with the filter narrowing either in the dynamic range, in the throughput
or the manufacturability. Here we report on a resonating planar multilayered structure that exhibits
transparency window in reflection with a controllable full width at half maximum (sub-Angstroms
till tens of nm) and tunability over wide spectral range (>500nm in the visible and near infrared).
The phenomenon is observed in TE and TM polarizations with much higher contrast in TE. Fano type resonance
originating from coupling between waveguide modes and lossy surface electromagnetic waves supported
by field distribution calculations explains the phenomenon. The wide tuning range with high contrast
is mainly achieved using an absorptive layer with high imaginary to real part ratio of the dielectric
constant that enables excitation of lossy surface waves known to exist over a wide spectral band
in thin films. To avoid large losses, it is found that the lossy layer should be ultrathin (6nm Cr layer
for example). The tuning is achieved by small angular scan of less than 2 degrees or by modulating
the refractive index or thickness of the submicron thick waveguide layer from the visible till the
near infrared range and in principle it can be designed to operate in any spectral range. Such a thin
variable index or thickness layer can allow tuning at ultrahigh speed using conventional electrooptic,
magnetooptic, piezoelectric or thermooptic materials at relatively low external fields.
