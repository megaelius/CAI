In a previous paper, Oruba, Soward & Dormy (J.Fluid Mech., vol.818, 2017, pp.205-240) considered
the primary quasi-steady geostrophic (QG) motion of a constant density fluid of viscosity $\nu$
that occurs during linear spin-down in a cylindrical container of radius $L$ and height $H$, rotating
rapidly (angular velocity $\Omega$) about its axis of symmetry subject to mixed rigid and stress-free
boundary conditions for the case $L=H$. Here, Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) at large $L= 10
H$ and Ekman number $E=\nu/H^2\Omega=10^{-3}$ reveals structured inertial wave activity on the
spin-down time-scale. The analytic study, based on $E\ll 1$, builds on the results of Greenspan
& Howard (J.Fluid Mech., vol.17, 1963, pp.385-404) for an infinite plane layer $L\to\infty$. At
large but finite distance $r^\dag$ from the symmetry axis, the meridional (QG-)flow, that causes
the QG-spin down, is blocked by the lateral boundary $r^\dag=L$, which provides a QG-trigger for
inertial waves. The true situation in the unbounded layer is complicated further by the existence
of a secondary set of maximum frequency (MF) inertial waves (a manifestation of the transient Ekman
layer) identified by Greenspan & Howard. Their blocking at $r^\dag=L$ provides a secondary MF-trigger
for yet more inertial waves that we consider in a sequel (Part II). Here, for the QG-trigger, we solve
a linear initial value problem by Laplace transform methods. The ensuing complicated inertial
wave structure is explained analytically on approximating our cylindrical geometry at large radius
by rectangular Cartesian geometry, valid for $L-r^\star=O(H)$ ($L\gg H$). Other than identifying
small scale structure near $r^\star=L$, our main finding is that inertial waves radiated away from
the outer boundary (but propagating towards it) reach a distance determined by the group velocity.
