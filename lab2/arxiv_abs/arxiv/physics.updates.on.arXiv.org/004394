In this paper, we propose novel practicable GLHUA invisible cloak, our cloak absorbs the incident
wave and creates outgoing wave that make it to be invisible cloak and analytical electromagnetic
wave without exceeding light speed propagation. Ten more discoveries and creations are reported.
1. New GLHUA annular layer electromagnetic (EM) invisible cloak with relative parameter not less
than 1. 2. Analytical EM wave solution of EM full wave equation with the GLHUA 1-3 cloak materials
is found, In annular layer cloak,$R_1 \le r \le R_2 $, $R_1>0$,$R_2>R_1$, $\varepsilon_r = \mu_r
= \frac{{R_2 ^2 }}{{r^2 }}$, $\varepsilon_\theta = \varepsilon_\phi = \mu_\theta = \mu_\phi =
\frac{{R_2 - R_1 }}{{r - R_1 }}$. 3. A GLHUA expansion method to find an exact analytical EM wave propagation
in the GLHUA double cloak is propsed. 4.Novel negative space is proposed.5. GLHUANP transformation
is proposed, which maps negative infinity,$ - \infty $ to $R_1$ and $-R_2$ to $R_2$. 6. The GLHUANP
transformation creates GLHUA 2 and GLHUA3 cloaks. the 7.We find analytical EM wave without exceeding
light speed propagation in the cloak. 8. GLHUA 1 and GLHUA 2 and GLHUA3 cloaks absorb the incident
wave and create outgoing wave that make them invisible cloak and analytical electromagnetic wave
through them. 9. GLHUAF transformation and .GLHUAF invisible cloak with double negative materials
is created. 11. The relative parameters of the GLHUA1 are large than 1, radial parameter in GLHUA
3 cloak is large than zero, refractive index of the GLHUA 1-3 cloak is large than 1. 12. The wave front
and ray tracing in GLHUA cloak are discontinuous, the ray redirection can not be used for GLHUA invisible
cloak. In my arXiv:1612.02857, I refer my this paper,that is not overlap. The arXiv admin note is
