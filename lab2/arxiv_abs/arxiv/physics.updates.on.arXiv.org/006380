We present analytic expressions for the electronic contributions to the linear conductivity $\sigma^{(1)}_{3d}(\omega)$
and the third order optical conductivity $\sigma^{(3)}_{3d}(\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3)$
of three dimensional massless Dirac fermions, the quasi-particles relevant for the low energy
excitation of topological Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals. Although there is no gap for massless
Dirac fermions, a finite chemical potential $\mu$ can lead to an effective gap parameter, which
plays an important role in the qualitative features of interband optical transitions. For gapless
linear dispersion in three dimension, the imaginary part of the linear conductivity diverges as
a logarithmic function of the cutoff energy, while the real part is linear with photon frequency
$\omega$ as $\hbar\omega>2|\mu|$. The third order conductivity exhibits features very similar
to those of two dimensional Dirac fermions, i.e., graphene, but with the amplitude for a single Dirac
cone generally two orders of magnitude smaller in three dimension than in two dimension. There are
many resonances associated with the chemical potential induced gap parameters, and divergences
associated with the intraband transitions. The details of the third order conductivity are discussed
for third harmonic generation, the Kerr effect and two-photon carrier injection, parametric frequency
conversion, and two-color coherent current injection. Although the expressions we derive are
limited to the clean limit at zero temperature, the generalization to include phenomenological
relaxation processes at finite temperature is straightforward and is presented.
