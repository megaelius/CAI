Cities are stable multi-scale complex systems. Their complexity essentially reflects an intense
competition for space from bottom-up. This competition is apparent in the organization of their
streets. Urban street networks of spontaneously growing cities typically reproduces astonishing
scale-free patterns. The scale-freeness of these self-organized urban street networks can be
shown, within the maximum entropy formalism, as the manifestation of a fluctuating system that
preserves some amount of information on average. However, Monte Carlo methods for generating "experimental"
data to support further this perspective are cruelly missing. Here we show how to adapt to self-organized
urban street networks the Metropolis algorithm. The "coming to equilibrium" distribution is established,
within the maximum entropy formalism, by taking scale-freeness as prior hypothesis along with
some symmetry-conservation arguments. The equilibrium parameter is the scaling exponent; its
concomitant extensive quantity is, given our lack of knowledge, an amount of information. To design
an ergodic dynamics, we disentangle the state-of-the-art street-generating paradigms from a
street-oriented approach into a junction-oriented one. Our adaptation of the Metropolis algorithm
to self-organized urban street networks reminisces the classical single-spin-flip Metropolis
algorithm for Ising models. Simulations for Central London shows, against outputs generated with
a comparable state-of-the-art paradigm, consistency over a realistic range of scaling exponents.
We expect our future simulations to reveal collective phenomena transitions within a realistic
range. Such simulational observations will bring powerful tools and methods inherited from statistical
physics.
