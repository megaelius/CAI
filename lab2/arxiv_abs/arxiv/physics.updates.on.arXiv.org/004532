Computational modeling of the properties of crystalline materials has become an increasingly
important research paradigm over the last decade. A routine operation in such calculations is the
evaluation of integrals over the Brillouin zone, where traditional Monkhorst-Pack grids are widely
used across popular simulation packages. We have previously demonstrated that generalised Monkhorst-Pack
k-point grids, which are generated independently of any particular choice of reciprocal lattice
unit cell, are much more efficient than traditional Monkhorst-Pack grids and can roughly double
the speed of well-converged calculations of the properties of crystalline materials. In this paper,
we present algorithms that can rapidly generate optimized generalized Monkhorst Pack grids both
dynamically and using a pre-generated database. The algorithms identify highly efficient grids
by performing an exhaustive search over all symmetry-preserving grids, and they also incorporate
designs to accelerate such searches. Implementations of these algorithms in three different formats
are provided to meet the diverse demands of users. We present benchmarks of the speed of our algorithms
on structures randomly selected from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. For grids that
correspond to a real-space supercell with at least 50 angstroms between lattice points, which is
sufficient to converge density functional theory calculations within 1 meV / atom for nearly all
materials, our algorithm finds optimized grids in an average of 0.19 seconds on a single processing
core. For 100 angstroms between real-space lattice points, our algorithm finds optimal grids in
less than 5 seconds on average. Our benchmarks further show that the database approach is consistently
faster than dynamic grid generation, and the grids returned by our algorithms are more efficient
than those generated by previously reported algorithms.
