Doppler orbitography uses the Doppler shift in a transmitted signal to determine the orbital parameters
of satellites including range and range-rate (or radial velocity). We describe two techniques
for atmospheric-limited optical Doppler orbitography measurements of range-rate. The first
determines the Doppler shift directly from a heterodyne measurement of the returned optical signal.
The second aims to improve the precision of the first by suppressing atmospheric phase noise imprinted
on the transmitted optical signal. We demonstrate the performance of each technique over a 2.2 km
horizontal link with a simulated in-line velocity Doppler shift at the far end. A horizontal link
of this length has been estimated to exhibit nearly half the total integrated atmospheric turbulence
of a vertical link to space. Without stabilisation of the atmospheric effects, we obtained an estimated
range rate precision of 17 um/s at 1 s of integration. With active suppression of atmospheric phase
noise, this improved by three orders-of-magnitude to an estimated range rate precision of 9.0 nm/s
at 1 second of integration, and 1.1 nm/s when integrated over a 60 s. This represents four orders-of-magnitude
improvement over the typical performance of operational ground to space X-Band systems in terms
of range-rate precision at the same integration time. The performance of this system is a promising
proof of concept for coherent optical Doppler orbitography. There are many additional challenges
associated with performing these techniques from ground to space, that were not captured within
the preliminary experiments presented here. In the future, we aim to progress towards a 10 km horizontal
link to replicate the expected atmospheric turbulence for a ground to space link.
