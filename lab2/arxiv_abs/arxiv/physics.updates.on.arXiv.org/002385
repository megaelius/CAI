Proximal gamma-ray spectroscopy recently emerged as a promising technique for non-stop monitoring
of soil water content with possible applications in the field of precision farming. The potentialities
of the method are investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations applied to the reconstruction
of gamma-ray spectra collected by a NaI scintillation detector permanently installed at an agricultural
experimental site. A two steps simulation strategy based on a geometrical translational invariance
is developed. The strengths of this approach are the reduction of computational time with respect
to a direct source-detector simulation, the reconstruction of $^{40}K$, $^{232}Th$ and $^{238}U$
fundamental spectra, the customization in relation to different experimental scenarios and the
investigation of effects due to individual variables for sensitivity studies. The reliability
of the simulation is effectively validated against an experimental measurement with known soil
water content and radionuclides abundances. The relation between soil water content and gamma
signal is theoretically derived and applied to a Monte Carlo synthetic calibration performed with
the specific soil composition of the experimental site. Ready to use general formulae and simulated
coefficients for the estimation of soil water content are also provided adopting standard soil
compositions. Linear regressions between input and output soil water contents, inferred from
simulated $^{40}K$ and $^{208}Tl$ gamma signals, provide excellent results demonstrating the
capability of the proposed method in estimating soil water content with an average uncertainty
<1%.
