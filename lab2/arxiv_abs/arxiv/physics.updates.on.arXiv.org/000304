Photoinduced charge transfer processes play a key role for novel photovoltaic phenomena and devices.
Thus, the development of ab initio methods that allow for accurate and computationally inexpensive
treatment of charge transfer excitations is a topic that attracts nowadays a lot of scientific attention.
In this paper we extend an approach recently introduced for the description of single and double
excitations (M. Tassi, I. Theophilou and S. Thanos, Int. J. Quantum Chem., {113}, 690 (2013), M.
Tassi, I. Theophilou and S. Thanos, J. Chem. Phys. {138}, 124107 (2013)) to allow for the description
of intermolecular charge transfer excitations. For the description of an excitation where an electron
is transferred from a donor system to an acceptor one, it is necessary to keep the excited state orthogonal
to the ground sate in order to avoid variational collapse. These conditions are achieved by decomposing
the subspace spanned by the Hartree-Fock (HF) ground state orbitals to four subspaces: The subspace
spanned by the occupied orbitals that are localized in the region of the donor molecule, the corresponding
for the acceptor ones and two more subspaces containing the virtual orbitals that are localized
in the neighborhood of the donor and the acceptor respectively. Next, we create a Slater determinant
with a hole in the subspace of occupied orbitals of the donor and a particle in the virtual subspace
of the acceptor. Subsequently we optimize both the hole and the particle by minimizing the HF energy
functional in the corresponding subspaces. Finally, we test our approach by calculating the lowest
charge transfer excitation energies for a set of tetracyanoehylene-hydrocarbon complexes, that
have been used earlier as a test set for such kind of excitations.
