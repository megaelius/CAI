This work reports on the application of a novel electric field-ionization setup for high-resolution
laser spectroscopy measurements on bunched fast atomic beams in a collinear geometry. In combination
with multi-step resonant excitation to Rydberg states using pulsed lasers, the field ionization
technique demonstrates increased sensitivity for isotope separation and measurement of atomic
parameters over non-resonant laser ionization methods. The setup was tested at the Collinear Resonance
Ionization Spectroscopy experiment at ISOLDE-CERN to perform high-resolution measurements
of transitions in the indium atom from the 5s$^2$5d~$^2$D$_{5/2}$ and 5s$^2$5d~$^2$D$_{3/2}$
states to 5s$^2$($n$)p~$^2$P and 5s$^2$($n$)f~$^2$F Rydberg states, up to a principal quantum
number of $n$ = 72. The extracted Rydberg level energies were used to re-evaluate the ionization
potential of the indium atom to be 46670.1055(21) cm$^{-1}$. The nuclear magnetic dipole and nuclear
electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants and level isotope shifts of the 5s$^2$5d~$^2$D$_{5/2}$
and 5s$^2$5d~$^2$D$_{3/2}$ states were determined for $^{113,115}$In. The results are compared
to calculations using relativistic coupled-cluster theory. A good agreement is found with the
ionization potential and isotope shifts, while disagreement of hyperfine structure constants
indicates an increased importance of electron correlations in these excited atomic states. With
the aim of further increasing the detection sensitivity for measurements on exotic isotopes, a
systematic study of the field-ionization arrangement implemented in the work was performed and
an improved design was simulated and is presented. The improved design offers increased background
suppression independent of the distance from field ionization to ion detection.
