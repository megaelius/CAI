Understanding how efforts to limit exposure to COVID-19 have altered electricity demand provides
insights not only into how dramatic restrictions shape electricity demand but also about future
electricity use in a post-COVID-19 world. We develop a unified modeling framework to quantify and
compare electricity usage changes in 58 countries and regions around the world from January-May
2020. We find that daily electricity demand declined as much as 10% in April 2020 compared to modelled
demand, controlling for weather, seasonal and temporal effects, but with significant variation.
Clustering techniques show that four impact groups capture systematic differences in timing and
depth of electricity usage changes, ranging from a mild decline of 2% to an extreme decline of 26%.
These groupings do not align with geography, with almost every continent having at least one country
or region that experienced a dramatic reduction in demand and one that did not. Instead, we find that
such changes relate to government restrictions and mobility. Government restrictions have a non-linear
effect on demand that generally saturates at its most restrictive levels and sustains even as restrictions
ease. Mobility offers a sharper focus on electricity demand change with workplace and residential
mobility strongly linked to demand changes at the daily level. Steep declines in electricity usage
are associated with workday hourly load patterns that resemble pre-COVID weekend usage. Quantifying
these impacts is a crucial first step in understanding the impacts of crises like the pandemic and
the associated societal response on electricity demand.
