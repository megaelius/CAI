The Collison nebulizer (as well as its variations) has been widely used for generating fine aerosol
droplets of a few microns from liquids of viscosity up to 1000 centipoise. It was originally developed
for producing medical aerosols in inhalation therapy, and now has become an important component
as pneumatic atomizer in the Aerosol Jet(R) direct-write system for additive manufacturing. Qualitative
descriptions of its working mechanism were given in the literature as an expanding high-speed gas
jet creates a negative pressure to syphon liquid into the jet stream, where the liquid is subsequently
blown into sheets, filaments, and eventually droplets. But quantitative analysis and in-depth
understanding have been lacking until rather recently. In this work, we present a logical description
of the working mechanism of Collison nebulizer based on OpenFOAM(R) CFD analysis of compressible
jet flow in the jet expansion channel. The positive-feedback liquid aspiration mechanism becomes
clear by examining the CFD results as the jet expansion channel geometry is varied. As a consequence,
the output mist density can be rather insensitive to the liquid viscosity, which is illustrated
by a set of experiments with the Collison-type pneumatic atomizer in an Aerosol Jet(R) direct-write
system. Thus, an intrinsic self-regulation mechanism is elegantly incorporated in the Collison
nebulizer design. As intuitively expected, experimental data also supports the notion of the existence
of an upper limit for liquid holdup in the limited space of jet expansion channel; therefore, the
output mist density cannot increase indefinitely by increasing the atomization gas flow rate.
