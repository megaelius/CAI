The entrance to public universities in Brazil depends on scores obtained by students in Enem, Brazilian
National Assessment of High School Education. This exam consists of four multiple choice tests
(Language, Maths, Natural and Human Sciences) scored by Item Response Theory (IRT). It is a high
stake exam for students, allowing the use of its results of this exam to provide conditions for monitoring
high school learning and quality of education in Brazil. We present a study of the Physics items of
Enem from 2009 to 2014. The questions were classified based on qualitative categories, providing
a profile of the Natural Sciences test: a disciplinary exam (Physics, Chemistry and Biology), with
mostly qualitative questions, long and time consuming items, only a few of them demanding more complex
reasoning and assessing some problem solving skills. The answers of the students were analyzed,
using basic statistical exploration and IRT to draw the ICC of the Physics items. A comparison was
made between the qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis for the Physics questions.
The study of student performance reveals the low attaining levels of Physics learning at the end
of high school, with a small percentage of correct answers; students perform worse in questions
that require disciplinary knowledge or use of basic mathematical reasoning. It is also possible
to observe discrepancies on the results of two subsets of groups: female students perform worse
than male students in most items, and students that come from federal and private high school perform
significantly better that those from state high school (75% of students in high school attend state
or regional schools). In conclusion, the combined analysis of student's performance and content
of the items reveal some of the characteristics of student's learning in Brazil, at around 18 years,
that can impact Physics Education system.
