It is possible to make image reconstruction based on the dose dependence of the therapeutic XA (X-ray
induced acoustic signal) amplitude which is then used to make dose mapping. We give further explicit
parametrization for the acoustic signal in terms of the absorption parameters based on a physical
model of the absorption process. The first step is to obtain pressure waveform due to a point dose
absorption by solving the thermo-acoustic equation governing the heat absorption-pressure induction
process based on the analytic integration technique. Then, clinically relevant XA signal profile
at the detection point is obtained by generalizing point-dose-gradient induced acoustic signal
to surface-dose-gradient of a uniform spherical 3D dose distribution based on the reciprocity
principle for pressure waves in fluid media. Therapeutic XA signal induced from the surface of the
uniform spherical dose distribution due to X-ray irradiation onto $5x5$ $cm^2$ field of the water
surface by $1~\mu s$ pulses delivering $1.7$ mGy/pulse is simulated in time and frequency domain.
XA waves obtained in previous empirical studies are simulated and compared by means of shape and
relative amplitude. Considering the previous studies on this subject, we believe that the significance
of this study is the foundation of a novel and self-contained analytic approach to simulate the therapeutic
X-ray acoustic waves based on the physical parametrization of the energy transfer process. This
not only provides a better understanding of the physical phenomena underlying the medical technique
in terms of the medically relevant parameters such as field size, pulse duration, absorbed dose
per pulse etc. together with the physical assumptions used to obtain a solution to the photo-acoustic
equation, but also brings consistent simulation results with previous experimental and k-Wave
results.
