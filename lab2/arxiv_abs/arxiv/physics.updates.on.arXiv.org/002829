, Ischial pressure ulcer is an important risk for every paraplegic person and a major public health
issue. Pressure ulcers appear following excessive compression of buttock's soft tissues by bony
structures, and particularly in ischial and sacral bones. Current prevention techniques are mainly
based on daily skin inspection to spot red patches or injuries. Nevertheless, most pressure ulcers
occur internally and are difficult to detect early. Estimating internal strains within soft tissues
could help to evaluate the risk of pressure ulcer. A subject-specific biomechanical model could
be used to assess internal strains from measured skin surface pressures. However, a realistic 3D
non-linear Finite Element buttock model, with different layers of tissue materials for skin, fat
and muscles, requires somewhere between minutes and hours to compute, therefore forbidding its
use in a real-time daily prevention context. In this article, we propose to optimize these computations
by using a reduced order modeling technique (ROM) based on proper orthogonal decompositions of
the pressure and strain fields coupled with a machine learning method. ROM allows strains to be evaluated
inside the model interactively (i.e. in less than a second) for any pressure field measured below
the buttocks. In our case, with only 19 modes of variation of pressure patterns, an error divergence
of one percent is observed compared to the full scale simulation for evaluating the strain field.
This reduced model could therefore be the first step towards interactive pressure ulcer prevention
in a daily setup. Highlights-Buttocks biomechanical modelling,-Reduced order model,-Daily
