In a crowd, individuals make different motion choices such as "moving to destination", "following
another pedestrian", and "making a detour". For the sake of convenience, the three direction choices
are respectively called destination direction, following direction and detour direction in this
paper. Here, it is found that the featured direction choices could be inspired by the shape characteristics
of Voronoi diagram. To be specific, in the Voronoi cell of a pedestrian, the direction to a Voronoi
node is regarded as a potential "detour" direction, and the direction perpendicular to a Voronoi
link is regarded as a potential "following" direction. A pedestrian generally owns several alternative
Voronoi nodes and Voronoi links in a Voronoi cell, and the optimal detour and following direction
are determined by considering related factors such as deviation. Plus the destination direction
which is directly pointing to the destination, the three basic direction choices are defined in
a Voronoi cell. In order to evaluate the Voronoi diagram based basic directions, the empirical trajectory
data in both uni- and bi-directional flow experiments are extracted. A time series method considering
the step frequency is used to reduce the original trajectories' swaying phenomena which might disturb
the recognition of actual forward direction. The deviations between the empirical velocity direction
and the basic directions are investigated, and each velocity direction is classified into a basic
direction or regarded as an inexplicable direction according to the deviations. The analysis results
show that each basic direction could be a potential direction choice for a pedestrian. The combination
of the three basic directions could cover most empirical velocity direction choices in both uni-
and bi-directional flow experiments.
