Linearly polarized light can exert a torque on a birefringent object when passing through it. This
phenomena, present in Maxwell's equations, was revealed by Poynting and beautifully demonstrated
in the pioneer experiments of Beth and Holbourn. Modern uses of this effect lie at the heart of optomechanics
with angular momentum exchange between light and matter. A milestone of controlling movable massive
objects with light is the reduction of their mechanical fluctuations, namely cooling. Optomechanical
cooling has been implemented through linear momentum transfer of the electromagnetic field in
a variety of systems, but remains unseen for angular momentum transfer to rotating objects. We present
the first observation of cooling in a rotational optomechanical system. Particularly, we reduce
the thermal noise of the torsional modes of a birefringent optical nanofiber, with resonant frequencies
near 200 kHz and a Q-factor above $\mathbf{2\times10^4}$. Nanofibers are centimeter long, sub-micrometer
diameter optical fibers that confine propagating light, reaching extremely large intensities,
hence enhancing optomechanical effects. The nanofiber is driven by a propagating linearly polarized
laser beam. We use polarimetry of a weak optical probe propagating through the nanofiber as a proxy
to measure the torsional response of the system. Depending on the polarization of the drive, we can
observe both reduction and enhancement of the thermal noise of many torsional modes, with noise
reductions beyond a factor of two. The observed effect opens a door to manipulate the torsional motion
of suspended optical waveguides in general, expanding the field of rotational optomechanics,
and possibly exploiting its quantum nature for precision measurements in mesoscopic systems.
