Analysis of microscope images is a tedious work which requires patience and time, usually done manually
by the microscopist after data collection. Here we introduce an approach of automatic image analysis,
which is based on locally applied Fourier Transform and Machine Learning methods. In this approach,
a whole image is scanned by a local moving window with defined size and the 2D Fourier Transform is
calculated for each window. Then, all the Local Fourier Transforms are fed into Machine Learning
processing. Firstly, a number of components in the data is estimated from Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) Scree Plot performed on the data. Secondly, the data are decomposed blindly by Non-Negative
Matrix Factorization (NMF) into interpretable spatial maps (loadings) and corresponding Fourier
Transforms (factors). The microscopic image is analyzed and the features on the image are automatically
discovered, based on the local changes in Fourier Transform. The user selects only a size and movement
of the scanning local window which defines the final analysis resolution. This automatic approach
was successfully applied to analysis of various microscopic images with and without local periodicity
i.e. atomically resolved High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) Scanning Transmission Electron
Microscopy (STEM) image of Au nanoisland of fcc and Au hcp phases, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
(STM) image of Au-induced reconstruction on Ge(001) surface, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
image of metallic nanoclusters grown on GaSb surface, and Fluorescence microscopy image of HeLa
cell line of cervical cancer. The proposed approach could be used to automatically analyze the local
structure of microscopic images within a time of about a minute for a single image on a modern desktop/notebook
computer and it is freely available as a Python analysis notebook and Python program for batch processing.
