Flows through medical devices as well as in anatomical vessels despite being at moderate Reynolds
number may exhibit transitional or even turbulent character. In order to validate numerical methods
and codes used for biomedical flow computations, the U.S. food and drug administration (FDA) established
an experimental benchmark, which was a pipe with gradual contraction and sudden expansion representing
a nozzle. The experimental results for various Reynolds numbers ranging from 500 to 6500 were publicly
released. Previous and recent computational investigations of flow in the FDA nozzle found limitations
in various CFD approaches and some even questioned the adequacy of the benchmark itself. This communication
reports the results of a lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) based direct numerical simulation (DNS)
approach applied to the FDA nozzle benchmark for transitional cases of Reynolds numbers 2000 and
3500. The goal is to evaluate if a simple off the shelf LBM would predict the experimental results
without the use of complex models or synthetic turbulence at the inflow. LBM computations with various
spatial and temporal resolutions are performed - in the extremities of 44 million to 2.8 billion
lattice cells - conducted respectively on 32 CPU cores of a desktop to more than 300'000 cores of a
modern supercomputer to explore and characterize miniscule flow details and quantify Kolmogorov
scales. The LBM simulations transition to turbulence at a Reynolds number 2000 like the FDA's experiments
and acceptable agreement in jet breakdown locations, average velocity, shear stress and pressure
is found for both the Reynolds numbers.
