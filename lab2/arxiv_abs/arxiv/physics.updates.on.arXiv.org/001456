Feature identification is an important task in many fluid dynamics applications and diverse methods
have been developed for this purpose. These methods are based on a physical understanding of the
underlying behavior of the flow in the vicinity of the feature. Particularly, they rely on definition
of suitable criteria (i.e. point-based or neighborhood-based derived properties) and proper
selection of thresholds. For instance, among other techniques, vortex identification can be done
through computing the Q-criterion or by considering the center of looping streamlines. However,
these methods rely on creative visualization of physical idiosyncrasies of specific features
and flow regimes, making them non-universal and requiring significant effort to develop. Here
we present a physics-based, data-driven method capable of identifying any flow feature it is trained
to. We use convolutional neural networks, a machine learning approach developed for image recognition,
and adapt it to the problem of identifying flow features. The method was tested using mean flow fields
from numerical simulations, where the recirculation region and boundary layer were identified
in a two-dimensional flow through a convergent-divergent channel, and the horseshoe vortex was
identified in three-dimensional flow over a wing-body junction. The novelty of the method is its
ability to identify any type of feature, even distinguish between similar ones, without the need
to explicitly define the physics (i.e. through development of suitable criterion and tunning of
threshold). This provides a general method and removes the large burden placed on identifying new
features. We expect this method can supplement existing techniques and allow for more automatic
and discerning feature detection. The method can be easily extended to time-dependent flows, where
it could be particularly impactful.
