While advances in computation are enabling finer grid resolutions in numerical weather prediction
models, representing land-atmosphere exchange processes as a lower boundary condition remains
a challenge. This partially results of the fact that land-surface heterogeneity exists at all spatial
scales and its variability does not `average' out with decreasing scales. The work here presented
uses large-eddy simulations and the concept of dispersive fluxes to quantify the effect of surface
thermal heterogeneity with scales $\sim$ 1/10th the height of the atmospheric boundary layer and
characterized by uniform roughness. Such near-canonical cases describe inhomogeneous scalar
transport in an otherwise planar homogeneous flow when thermal stratification is weak or absent.
Results illustrate a regime in which the flow is mostly driven by the surface thermal heterogeneities,
in which the contribution of the dispersive fluxes can account for more than 40\% of the total sensible
heat flux at about 0.1$z_i$, with a value of 5 to 10\% near the surface, regardless of the spatial distribution
of the thermal heterogeneities, and with a weak dependence on time averaging. Results also illustrate
an alternative regime in which the effect of the surface thermal heterogeneities is quickly blended,
and the dispersive fluxes match those obtained over an equivalent thermally homogeneous surface.
This character seems to be governed by a new non-dimensional parameter representing the ratio of
the large-scale advection effects to the convective turbulence. We believe that results from this
research are a first step in developing new parameterizations appropriate for non-canonical atmospheric
surface layer conditions.
