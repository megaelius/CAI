In this paper we investigate both theoretically and numerically the forward and backward in time
mean square separation of fluid and inertial particle pairs in isotropic turbulence. Fluid particles
are known to separate faster backward in time than forward in time, and we find that inertial particles
do the same. However, we find that the time asymmetry in their dispersion is in general much greater
than for fluid particles. Whereas the time-irreversibility of fluid particle pair dispersion
can be understood in terms of a directional bias arising from the dissipative dynamics of turbulence,
inertial particles experience an additional source of irreversibility arising from a symmetry
breaking path history effect of their inertia. For each given initial (final, in the backward in
time case) separation $\mathbf{r}^0$ there is an optimum value of the particle momentum response
time, $\tau_p$, for which the particles are most strongly affected by the time reversal since those
particles are optimally affected by both sources of irreversibility. We derive analytical expressions
for the backward in time mean square separation of inertial particles and compare the predictions
with numerical data obtained from a $Re_{\lambda}\approx 580$ DNS of particle laden isotropic
turbulent flow. For times $\leq\max[\tau_{p},\tau_{r^0}]$ (where $\tau_{r^0}$ is the timescale
of the fluid velocity differences at separation $r^0=\vert\mathbf{r}^0\vert$), we find excellent
agreement between the theoretical predictions and the DNS. The theory for times $>\max[\tau_{p},\tau_{r^0}]$
is in good agreement with the DNS provided that the pair separation at these times exceeds a few multiples
of the Kolmogorov spatial scale $\eta$.
