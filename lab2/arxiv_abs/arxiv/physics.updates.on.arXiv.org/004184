In a combined experimental and theoretical study, we investigate the influence of the material
source arrangement in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system on the growth of nanowire (NW) core-shell
structures. In particular, we study the shell growth of GaN around GaN template NWs under the boundary
condition that Ga and N do not impinge on a given sidewall facet at the same time. Our experiments with
different V/III ratios and substrate temperatures show that obtaining shells with homogeneous
thickness along the whole NW length is not straightforward. Analyzing in detail the shell morphology
with and without substrate rotation, we find that the different azimuthal angles of the sources
have a major impact on the Ga adatom kinetics and the final shell morphology. On the basis of these
experimental results, we develop a diffusion model which takes into account different NW facets
and the substrate. The model allows to describe well the experimental shell profiles and predicts
that homogeneous shell growth can be achieved if the Ga and N source are arranged next to each other
or for very high rotation speeds. Moreover, the modeling reveals that the growth on a given side facet
can be categorized within one rotation in four different phases: the Ga wetting phase, the metal-rich
growth phase, the N-rich growth phase, and the dissociation phase. The striking difference to growth
processes on planar samples is that, in our case, diffusion takes place between different regions,
i.e. the sidewall vs. the top facet and substrate, out of which on one N impinges not continuously,
resulting in complex gradients in chemical potential that are modulated in time by substrate rotation.
The comprehensiveness of our model provides a deep understanding of diffusion processes and the
resulting adatom concentration, and could be applied to other 3D structures and material systems
