In recent years, the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method has been widely employed to simulate boiling
phenomena [A. M\'arkus and G. H\'azi, Phys. Rev. E 83, 046705 (2011); Biferale et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 108, 104502 (2012); Li et al., Phys. Rev. E 96, 063303 (2017); Wu et al., Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer
126, 773 (2018)]. However, a very important issue still remains open, i.e., how does boiling occur
in the LB simulations? For instance, the existing LB studies showed that the boiling on a hydrophobic
surface begins at a lower wall superheat than that on a hydrophilic surface, which qualitatively
agrees well with experimental studies, but no one has yet explained how this phenomenon appears
in the LB simulations and what happened in the simulations after changing the wettability of the
heating surface. In this paper, the LB boiling mechanism is revealed by analyzing boiling on a flat
surface with mixed wettability and boiling on a structured surface with homogeneous wettability.
Through a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that, when the same wall superheat is applied, in
the LB boiling simulations the fluid density near the heating surface decreases faster on a hydrophobic
surface than that on a hydrophilic surface. Accordingly, a lower wall superheat can induce the phase
transition from liquid to vapor on a hydrophobic surface than that on a hydrophilic surface. Furthermore,
a similar theoretical analysis shows that the fluid density decreases fastest at concave corners
in the case of a structured surface with homogeneous wettability, which explains why vapor bubbles
are nucleated at concave corners in the LB simulations of boiling on structured surfaces.
