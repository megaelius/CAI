An explicit moving boundary method for the numerical solution of time-dependent hyperbolic conservation
laws on grids produced by the intersection of complex geometries with a regular Cartesian grid is
presented. As it employs directional operator splitting, implementation of the scheme is rather
straightforward. Extending the method for static walls from Klein et al., Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.,
A367, no. 1907, 4559-4575 (2009), the scheme calculates fluxes needed for a conservative update
of the near-wall cut-cells as linear combinations of standard fluxes from a one-dimensional extended
stencil. Here the standard fluxes are those obtained without regard to the small sub-cell problem,
and the linear combination weights involve detailed information regarding the cut-cell geometry.
This linear combination of standard fluxes stabilizes the updates such that the time-step yielding
marginal stability for arbitrarily small cut-cells is of the same order as that for regular cells.
Moreover, it renders the approach compatible with a wide range of existing numerical flux-approximation
methods. The scheme is extended here to time dependent rigid boundaries by reformulating the linear
combination weights of the stabilizing flux stencil to account for the time dependence of cut-cell
volume and interface area fractions. The two-dimensional tests discussed include advection in
a channel oriented at an oblique angle to the Cartesian computational mesh, cylinders with circular
and triangular cross-section passing through a stationary shock wave, a piston moving through
an open-ended shock tube, and the flow around an oscillating NACA 0012 aerofoil profile.
