In this article, a new conceptual biomedical engineering strategy to tackle modern disease challenges,
termed as liquid metal enabled electrobiology, is proposed. This generalized and easy going way
is based on the physiological fact that specially administrated electricity would induce a series
of subsequent desired biological effects, either shortly, transitional or permanently. Owing
high compliance within any part of the biological tissues, the liquid metal would aid to mold a pervasive
way to treat physiological or psychological diseases. As highly conductive and non-toxic multifunctional
flexible materials, such liquid metals (LMs) consist of the core to generate any requested electric
treating fields (ETFields) which can adapt to various sites inside the human body. The basic mechanisms
of electrobiology in delivering electricity to the target tissues and then inducing expected outputs
for disease treatment are interpreted. The methods toward realizing soft and conformable electronics
based on liquid metal are illustrated. Further, a group of typical disease challenges were taken
to illustrate the basic strategies to perform liquid metal electrobiology therapy, which include
but are not limited to: tissue electronics, brain disorder, immunotherapy, neural functional
recovery, muscle stimulation, skin rejuvenation, cosmetology and dieting, artificial organs,
cardiac pacing and cancer therapy etc. Some practical issues involved in the electrobiology for
future disease therapy were discussed. Perspective along this direction to incubate an easy-going
biomedical tool for health care was pointed out.
