We tested a new way of coupling bolometric light detectors to scintillating crystal bolometers.
This simple and extremely neat coupling is obtained by resting the light detector on the crystal
surface, held in position only by gravity. This apparently straightforward mounting results in
three important improvements: i) it decreases the amount of non active materials needed to assemble
the detector; ii) it substantially increases the light collection efficiency by minimizing the
light losses induced by the mounting structure iii) it enhances the thermal signal induced in the
light detector thanks to the extremely weak thermal link to the thermal bath. We measured that the
heat exchange between the crystal absorber and the light detector is negligible, provided that
the pressure force is of the order of few grams. We tested this new technique with thermistor-based
sensors on a large TeO$_2$ bolometer, demonstrating that the light collection efficiency on the
tiny Cherenkov light emission is magnified by more than 50% with respect to all the previous measurements,
obtained with different cryogenic sensors and different types of mountings. We obtained a baseline
energy resolution on the light detector of 20 eV RMS, that, together with increased light collection,
enabled us to obtain the best $\alpha$ vs $\beta/\gamma$ discrimination ever obtained in massive
TeO$_2$. At the same time we achieved rise and decay times of 0.8 and 1.6 ms, respectively. Thanks
to these excellent performances, this bolometric light detector fully matches all the requirements
for CUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle IDentification), the 1-ton scintillating bolometer follow
up of CUORE, both in the case of TeO$_2$ and $^{100}$Mo-based crystal options.
