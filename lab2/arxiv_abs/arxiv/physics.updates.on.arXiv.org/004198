Coevolutionary arms races form between interacting populations that constitute each other's
environment and respond to mutual changes. This inherently far-from-equilibrium process finds
striking manifestations in the adaptive immune system, where highly variable antigens and a finite
repertoire of immune receptors coevolve on comparable timescales. This unique challenge to the
immune system motivates general questions: How do ecological and evolutionary processes interplay
to shape diversity? What determine the endurance and fate of coevolution? Here, we take the perspective
of responsive environments and develop a phenotypic model of coevolution between receptors and
antigens that both exhibit cross-reactivity (one-to-many responses). The theory predicts that
the extent of asymmetry in cross-reactivity is a key determinant of repertoire composition: small
asymmetry supports persistent large diversity, whereas strong asymmetry yields long-lived transients
of quasispecies in both populations. The latter represents a new type of Turing mechanism. More
surprisingly, patterning in the trait space feeds back on population dynamics: spatial resonance
between the Turing modes breaks the dynamic balance, leading to antigen extinction or unrestrained
growth. Model predictions can be tested via combined genomic and phenotypic measurements. Our
work identifies cross-reactivity as an important regulator of diversity and coevolutionary outcome,
and reveals the remarkable effect of ecological feedback in pattern-forming systems, which drives
evolution toward non-steady states different than the Red Queen persistent cycles.
