The goal of this paper is to develop a high order numerical method based on Kinetic Inviscid Flux (KIF)
method and Flux Reconstruction (FR) framework. The KIF aims to find a balance between the excellent
merits of Gas-Kinetic Scheme (GKS) and the lower computational costs. The idea of KIF can be viewed
as an inviscid-viscous splitting version of the gas-kinetic scheme, and Shu and Ohwada have made
the fundamental contribution. The combination of Totally Thermalized Transport (TTT) scheme
and Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting (KFVS) method are achieved in KIF. Using a coefficient which is
related to time step $\delta t$ and averaged collision time $\tau$, KIF can adjust the weights of
TTT and KFVS flux in the simulation adaptively. By doing the inviscid-viscous splitting, KIF is
very suitable and easy to integrate into the existing framework. The well understood FR framework
is used widely for the advantages of robustness, economical costs and compactness. The combination
of KIF and FR is originated by three motivations. The first purpose is to develop a high order method
based on the gas kinetic theory. The second reason is to keep the advantages of GKS. The last aim is
that the designed method should be more efficient. In present work, we use the KIF method to replace
the Riemann flux solver applied in the interfaces of elements. The common solution at the interface
is computed according to the gas kinetic theory, which makes the combination of KIF and FR scheme
more reasonable and available. The accuracy and performance of present method are validated by
several numerical cases. The Taylor-Green vortex problem has been used to verify its potential
to simulate turbulent flows.
