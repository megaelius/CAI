Brain metabolites, such as N-acetylaspartate or myo-inositol, are constantly probing their local
cellular environment under the effect of diffusion. Diffusion-weighted NMR spectroscopy therefore
presents unparalleled potential to yield cell-type specific microstructural information. Double
diffusion encoding (DDE) relies on two diffusion blocks which relative directions describe a varying
angle during the course of the experiment. Unlike single diffusion encoding, DDE measurements
at long mixing time display some angular modulation of the signal amplitude which reflects compartment
shape anisotropy, while requiring relatively low gradient strength. This angular dependence
has been formerly used to quantify cell fiber diameter using a model of isotropically oriented infinite
cylinders. However, it has been little explored how additional features of the cell microstructure,
such as cell body diameter, fiber length and branching may also influence the DDE signal. Here, we
used a cryoprobe as well as state-of-the-art post-processing to perform DDE acquisitions with
high accuracy and precision in the mouse brain at 11.7 T. We then compared our results to simulated
DDE datasets obtained in various 3D cell models in order to pinpoint which features of cell morphology
may influence the most the angular dependence of the DDE signal. While the infinite cylinder model
poorly fits our experimental data, we show that incorporating branched fiber structure in our model
is paramount to sensibly interpret the DDE signal. Lastly, experiments and simulations in the short
mixing time regime suggest that some sensitivity to cell body diameter might be retrieved, although
additional experiments would be required to further support this statement.
