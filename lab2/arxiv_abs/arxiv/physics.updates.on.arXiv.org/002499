In environments with scarce resources, adopting the right search strategy can make the difference
between succeeding and failing, even between life and death. At different scales, this applies
to molecular encounters in the cell cytoplasm, to animals looking for food or mates in natural landscapes,
to rescuers during search-and-rescue operations in disaster zones, as well as to genetic computer
algorithms exploring parameter spaces. When looking for sparse targets in a homogeneous environment,
a combination of ballistic and diffusive steps is considered optimal; in particular, more ballistic
L\'evy flights with exponent {\alpha} <= 1 are generally believed to optimize the search process.
However, most search spaces present complex topographies, with boundaries, barriers and obstacles.
What is the best search strategy in these more realistic scenarios? Here we show that the topography
of the environment significantly alters the optimal search strategy towards less ballistic and
more Brownian strategies. We consider an active particle performing a blind search in a two-dimensional
space with steps drawn from a L\'evy distribution with exponent varying from {\alpha} = 1 to {\alpha}
= 2 (Brownian). We demonstrate that the optimal search strategy depends on the topography of the
environment, with {\alpha} assuming intermediate values in the whole range under consideration.
We interpret these findings in terms of a simple theoretical model, and discuss their robustness
to the addition of Brownian diffusion to the searcher's motion. Our results are relevant for search
problems at different length scales, from animal and human foraging to microswimmers' taxis, to
biochemical rates of reaction.
