Marine hydrokinetic (MHK) power generation systems enable harvesting energy from waterways without
the need for water impoundment. A major research challenge for numerical simulations of field-scale
MHK farms stems from the large disparity in scales between the size of waterway and the energy harvesting
device. We propose a large-eddy simulation (LES) framework to perform high-fidelity, multi-resolution
simulations of MHK arrays in a real-life marine environment using a novel unstructured Cartesian
flow solver coupled with a sharp-interface immersed boundary method. The potential of the method
as a powerful engineering design tool is demonstrated by applying it to simulate a 30 turbine MHK
array under development in the East River in New York City. A virtual model of the MHK power-plant
is reconstructed from high-resolution bathymetry measurements in the East River and the 30 turbines
placed in 10 TriFrame arrangements as designed by Verdant Power. A locally refined, near the individual
turbines, background unstructured Cartesian grid enables LES across a range of geometric scales
of relevance spanning approximately five orders of magnitude. The simulated flow-field is compared
with a baseline LES of the flow in the East River without turbines. While velocity deficits and increased
levels of turbulence kinetic energy are observed in the vicinity of the turbine wakes, away from
the turbines as well as on the water surface only small increase in mean momentum is found. Therefore,
our results point to the conclusion that MHK energy harvesting from large rivers is possible without
a significant disruption of the river flow.
