We present a generalisation of efficient numerical frameworks for modelling fluid-filament interactions
via the discretisation of a recently-developed, non-local integral equation formulation to incorporate
regularised Stokeslets with half-space boundary conditions, as motivated by the importance of
confining geometries in many applications. We proceed to utilise this framework to examine the
drag on slender inextensible filaments moving near a boundary, firstly with a relatively-simple
example, evaluating the accuracy of resistive force theories near boundaries using regularised
Stokeslet segments. This highlights that resistive force theories do not accurately quantify
filament dynamics in a range of circumstances, even with analytical corrections for the boundary.
However, there is the notable and important exception of movement in a plane parallel to the boundary,
where accuracy is maintained. In particular, this justifies the judicious use of resistive force
theories in examining the mechanics of filaments and monoflagellate microswimmers with planar
flagellar patterns moving parallel to boundaries. We proceed to apply the numerical framework
developed here to consider how filament elastohydrodynamics can impact drag near a boundary, analysing
in detail the complex responses of a passive cantilevered filament to an oscillatory flow. In particular,
we document the emergence of an asymmetric periodic beating in passive filaments in particular
parameter regimes, which are remarkably similar to the power and reverse strokes exhibited by motile
9+2 cilia. Furthermore, these changes in the morphology of the filament beating, arising from the
fluid-structure interactions, also induce a significant increase in the hydrodynamic drag of
the filament.
