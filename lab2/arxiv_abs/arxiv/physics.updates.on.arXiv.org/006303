Neutral-beam-driven, sub-cyclotron compressional (CAE) and global (GAE) \Alfven eigenmodes
are routinely excited in spherical tokamaks such as NSTX(-U) and MAST, have been observed on the
conventional aspect ratio tokamak DIII-D, and may be unstable in ITER burning plasmas. Their presence
has been experimentally linked to the anomalous flattening of electron temperature profiles at
high beam power in NSTX, potentially limiting fusion performance. A detailed understanding of
CAE/GAE excitation, therefore, is vital to predicting (and ultimately controlling) their effects
on plasma confinement. To this end, hybrid kinetic-MHD simulations are complemented with an analytic
study of the linear stability properties of CAEs and GAEs. Perturbative, local analytic theory
has been used to derive new instability conditions for CAEs/GAEs driven by realistic neutral beam
distributions. A comprehensive set of simulations of NSTX-like plasmas has been performed for
a wide range of beam parameters, providing a wealth of information on CAE and GAE stability in spherical
tokamaks. Linear simulations show that the excitation of CAEs vs GAEs has a complex dependence on
the fast ion injection velocity and geometry, qualitatively described by the analytic theory developed
in this thesis. Strong energetic particle modifications of GAEs are found in simulations, indicating
the existence of a new type of high frequency energetic particle mode. A cross validation between
the theoretical stability bounds, simulation results, and experimental measurements shows favorable
agreement for both the unstable CAE and GAE spectra's dependence on fast ion parameters. The analytic
results accurately explain the recent experimental discovery of GAE stabilization with small
amounts of off-axis beam injection on NSTX-U and suggest new techniques for control of these instabilities
in future experiments.
