The interpolated bounce-back scheme and the immersed boundary method are the two most popular algorithms
in treating a no-slip boundary on curved surfaces in the lattice Boltzmann method. While those algorithms
are frequently implemented in the numerical simulations involving complex geometries, such as
particle-laden flows, their performances are seldom compared systematically over the same local
quantities within the same context. In this paper, we present a systematic comparative investigation
on some frequently used and most state-of-the-art interpolated bounce-back schemes and immersed
boundary methods, based on both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of four selected
2D and 3D laminar flow problems. Our analyses show that immersed boundary methods (IBM) typically
yield a first-order accuracy when the regularized delta-function is employed to interpolate velocity
from the Eulerian to Lagrangian mesh, and the resulting boundary force back to the Eulerian mesh.
This first order in accuracy for IBM is observed for both the local velocity and hydrodynamic force/torque,
apparently different from the second-order accuracy sometimes claimed in the literature. Another
serious problem of immersed boundary methods is that the local stress within the diffused fluid-solid
interface tends to be significantly underestimated. On the other hand, the interpolated bounce-back
generally possesses a second-order accuracy for velocity, hydrodynamic force/torque, and local
stress field. The main disadvantage of the interpolated bounce-back schemes is its higher level
of fluctuations in the calculated hydrodynamic force/torque when a solid object moves across the
grid lines. General guidelines are also provided for the necessary grid resolutions in the two approaches
in order to accurately simulate flows over a solid particle.
