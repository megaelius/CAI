"In the next century, planet earth will don an electronic skin. It will use the Internet as a scaffold
to support and transmit its sensations. This skin is already being stitched together. It consists
of millions of embedded electronic measuring devices: thermostats, pressure gauges, pollution
detectors, cameras, microphones, glucose sensors, EKGs, electroencephalographs. These will
probe and monitor cities and endangered species, the atmosphere, our ships, highways and fleets
of trucks, our conversations, our bodies--even our dreams ....What will the earth's new skin permit
us to feel? How will we use its surges of sensation? For several years--maybe for a decade--there
will be no central nervous system to manage this vast signaling network. Certainly there will be
no central intelligence...some qualities of self-awareness will emerge once the Net is sensually
enhanced. Sensuality is only one force pushing the Net toward intelligence". These statements
are quoted by an interview by Cherry Murray, Dean of the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied
Sciences and Professor of Physics. It is interesting to outline the timeliness and highly predicting
power of these statements. In particular, we would like to point to the relevance of the question
"What will the earth's new skin permit us to feel?" to the work we are going to discuss in this paper.
There are many additional compelling questions, as for example: "How can the electronic earth's
skin be made more resilient?"; "How can the earth's electronic skin be improved to better satisfy
the need of our society?";"What can the science of complex systems contribute to this endeavour?"
