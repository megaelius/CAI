COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that began to rapidly spread in the US with the first case detected
on January 19, 2020, in Washington State. March 9, 2020, and then increased rapidly with total cases
of 25,739 as of April 20, 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic is so unnerving that it is difficult to understand
how any person is affected by the virus. Although most people with coronavirus 81%, according to
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will have little to mild symptoms, others
may rely on a ventilator to breathe or not at all. SEIR models have broad applicability in predicting
the outcome of the population with a variety of diseases. However, many researchers use these models
without validating the necessary hypotheses. Far too many researchers often "overfit" the data
by using too many predictor variables and small sample sizes to create models. Models thus developed
are unlikely to stand validity check on a separate group of population and regions. The researcher
remains unaware that overfitting has occurred, without attempting such validation. In the paper,
we present a combination algorithm that combines similar days features selection based on the region
using Xgboost, K Means, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to construct a prediction
model (i.e., K-Means-LSTM) for short-term COVID-19 cases forecasting in Louisana state USA. The
weighted k-means algorithm based on extreme gradient boosting is used to evaluate the similarity
between the forecasts and past days. The results show that the method with K-Means-LSTM has a higher
accuracy with an RMSE of 601.20 whereas the SEIR model with an RMSE of 3615.83.
