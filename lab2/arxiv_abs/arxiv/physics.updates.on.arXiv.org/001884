Radiative polarization of electrons and positrons through the Sokolov-Ternov effect is important
for applications in high-energy physics. Radiative spin-polarization is a manifestation of quantum
radiation reaction affecting the spin-dynamics of electrons. We recently proposed that an analogue
of the Sokolov-Ternov effect could occur in the strong electromagnetic fields of ultra-high-intensity
lasers, which would result in a build-up of spin-polarization in femtoseconds. In this paper we
develop a density matrix formalism for describing beam polarization in strong electromagnetic
fields. We start by using the density matrix formalism to study spin-flips in non-linear Compton
scattering and its dependence on the initial polarization state of the electrons. Numerical calculations
show a radial polarization of the scattered electron beam in a circularly polarized laser, and we
find azimuthal asymmetries in the polarization patterns for ultra-short laser pulses. A degree
of polarization approaching 9 % is achieved after emitting just a single photon. We develop the theory
by deriving a local constant crossed field approximation (LCFA) for the polarization density matrix,
which is a generalization of the well known LCFA scattering rates. We find spin-dependent expressions
that may be included in electromagnetic charged-particle simulation codes, such as particle-in-cell
plasma simulation codes, using Monte-Carlo modules. In particular, these expressions include
the spin-flip rates for arbitrary initial polarization of the electrons. The validity of the LCFA
is confirmed by explicit comparison with an exact QED calculation of electron polarization in an
ultrashort laser pulse.
