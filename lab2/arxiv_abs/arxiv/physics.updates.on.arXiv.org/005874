An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion
rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this
epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where
the epidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view
of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, mainly the variation of
the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially
exposed individuals and infected people and the infection, recovery and fatality rates. First,
we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions.
Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to
date (April 14, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature.
The peak occurs at day 37 (April 1), when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 2.80
initially, 1.95 at day 22 and 0.97 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The number
of fatalities amounts to approximately 12000 at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing
a better fit of the dead individuals is 5.2 days and the infection period is 3.7 days, with a fatality
rate of 0.00053/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The case fatality
rate (CFR) is 0.2 % (0.45 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed). If we use a wider
range for the constraints, we obtain ca. 13 days and 5.53 days for the incubation and recovery periods,
respectively, and a higher CFR, ca. 0.6 %. These values become ca. 9 days, 7.6 days and 1.2 % assuming
two times more casualties.
