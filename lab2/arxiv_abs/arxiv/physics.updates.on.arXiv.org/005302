Our objective is the calibration of mathematical tumor growth models from a single multiparametric
scan. The target problem is the analysis of preoperative Glioblastoma (GBM) scans. To this end,
we present a fully automatic tumor-growth calibration methodology that integrates a single-species
reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) model for tumor progression with multiparametric
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) scans to robustly extract patient specific biomarkers i.e.,
estimates for (i) the tumor cell proliferation rate, (ii) the tumor cell migration rate, and (iii)
the original, localized site(s) of tumor initiation. Our method is based on a sparse reconstruction
algorithm for the tumor initial location (TIL). This problem is particularly challenging due to
nonlinearity, ill-posedeness, and ill conditioning. We propose a coarse-to-fine multi-resolution
continuation scheme with parameter decomposition to stabilize the inversion. We demonstrate
robustness and practicality of our method by applying the proposed method to clinical data of 206
GBM patients. We analyze the extracted biomarkers and relate tumor origin with patient overall
survival by mapping the former into a common atlas space. We present preliminary results that suggest
improved accuracy for prediction of patient overall survival when a set of imaging features is augmented
with estimated biophysical parameters. All extracted features, tumor initial positions, and
biophysical growth parameters are made publicly available for further analysis. To our knowledge,
this is the first fully automatic scheme that can handle multifocal tumors and can localize the TIL
to a few millimeters.
