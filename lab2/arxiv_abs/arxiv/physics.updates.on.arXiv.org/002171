Vertically banded zonal jets are frequently observed in weakly or non-rotating stratified turbulence,
with the quasi-biennial oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere and the ocean's equatorial
deep jets being two examples. Explaining the formation of jets in stratified turbulence is a fundamental
problem in geophysical fluid dynamics. Statistical state dynamics (SSD) provides powerful methods
for analyzing turbulent systems exhibiting emergent organization, such as banded jets. In SSD,
dynamical equations are written directly for the evolution of the turbulence statistics, enabling
direct analysis of the statistical interactions between the incoherent component of the turbulence
and the coherent large-scale structure component that underlie jet formation. A second-order
closure of SSD, known as S3T, has previously been applied to show that meridionally banded jets emerge
in barotropic beta-plane turbulence via a statistical instability referred to as the zonostrophic
instability. Two-dimensional Boussinesq turbulence provides a simple model of non-rotating
stratified turbulence analogous to the beta-plane model of planetary turbulence. Jets known as
vertically sheared horizontal flows (VSHFs) often emerge in simulations of Boussinesq turbulence,
but their dynamics is not yet clearly understood. In this work S3T analysis of the zonostrophic instability
is extended to study VSHF emergence in two-dimensional Boussinesq turbulence using an analytical
formulation of S3T amenable to perturbation stability analysis. VSHFs are shown to form via an instability
that is analogous in stratified turbulence to the zonostrophic instability in beta-plane turbulence.
This instability is shown to be strikingly similar to the zonostrophic instability, suggesting
that jet emergence in both geostrophic and non-rotating stratified turbulence may be understood
as instances of the same generic phenomenon.
