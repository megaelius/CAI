We propose a methodology for generating time-dependent turbulent inflow data with the aid of machine
learning (ML), which has a possibility to replace conventional driver simulations or synthetic
turbulent inflow generators. As for the ML model, we use an auto-encoder type convolutional neural
network (CNN) with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). For the test case, we study a fully-developed
turbulent channel flow at the friction Reynolds number of ${\rm Re}_{\tau} = 180$ for easiness of
assessment. The ML models are trained using a time series of instantaneous velocity fields in a single
cross-section obtained by direct numerical simulation (DNS) so as to output the cross-sectional
velocity field at a specified future time instant. From the a priori test in which the output from
the trained ML model are recycled to the input, the spatio-temporal evolution of cross-sectional
structure is found to be reasonably well reproduced by the proposed method. The turbulence statistics
obtained in the a priori test are also, in general, in reasonable agreement with the DNS data, although
some deviation in the flow rate was found. It is also found that the present machine-learned inflow
generator is free from the spurious periodicity, unlike the conventional driver DNS in a periodic
domain. As an a posteriori test, we perform DNS of inflow-outflow turbulent channel flow with the
trained ML model used as a machine-learned turbulent inflow generator (MLTG) at the inlet. It is
shown that the present MLTG can maintain the turbulent channel flow for a long time period sufficient
to accumulate turbulent statistics, with much lower computational cost than the corresponding
driver simulation. It is also demonstrated that we can obtain accurate turbulent statistics by
properly correcting the deviation in the flow rate.
