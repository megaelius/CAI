Diffusion anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is commonly quantified with normalized
diffusion anisotropy indices (DAIs). Most often, the fractional anisotropy (FA) is used, but several
alternative DAIs have been introduced in attempts to maximize the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)
in diffusion anisotropy maps. Examples include the scaled relative anisotropy (sRA), the gamma
variate anisotropy index (GV), the surface anisotropy (UAsurf), and the lattice index (LI). With
the advent of multidimensional diffusion encoding it became possible to determine the presence
of microscopic diffusion anisotropy in a voxel, which is theoretically independent of orientation
coherence. In accordance with DTI, the microscopic anisotropy is typically quantified by the microscopic
fractional anisotropy (uFA). In this work, in addition to the uFA, the four microscopic diffusion
anisotropy indices (uDAIs) usRA, uGV, uUAsurf, and uLI are defined in analogy to the respective
DAIs by means of the average diffusion tensor and the covariance tensor. Simulations with three
representative distributions of microscopic diffusion tensors revealed distinct CNR differences
when differentiating between isotropic and microscopically anisotropic diffusion. q-Space
trajectory imaging (QTI) was employed to acquire brain in-vivo maps of all indices. For this purpose,
a 15 min protocol featuring linear, planar, and spherical tensor encoding was used. The resulting
maps were of good quality and exhibited different contrasts, e.g. between gray and white matter.
This indicates that it may be beneficial to use more than one uDAI in future investigational studies.
