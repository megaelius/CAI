We argue that special relativity, instead of quantum theory, should be radically reformulated
to resolve inconsistencies between those two theories. The idea for a new theory of relativity consistent
with quantum theory is outlined. A new relativistic transformation recently-proposed renders
physical laws form-invariant via transformation of physical quantities, instead of space-time
coordinates. Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics are rendered form-invariant among inertial
frames by this new relativistic transformation. The space-time concept underlying this new relativistic
transformation is Newtonian absolute space and absolute time as presumed in quantum theory. This
new perspective on relativistic transformation provides an insight into the very meaning of the
principle of relativity. The principle of relativity means that the same physical laws hold in all
inertial frames, rather than their mathematical formulas are Lorentz-covariant under the Lorentz
transformation of space-time coordinates. With this new perspective on relativistic transformation,
quantum theory becomes compatible with the principle of relativity. Furthermore, a new theory
of relativistic quantum mechanics is formulated herein. The relativistic quantum mechanics thus
obtained maintains the essentials of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, for instance, the statistical
single-particle interpretation and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The new relativistic
quantum mechanics contains non-relativistic quantum mechanics as a low-speed limit. Studies
on standard problems in quantum mechanics, square step and barrier potential, show that this relativistic
quantum mechanics is free from such anomalies as the negative probability density, Zitterbewegung
and the Klein paradox in the current relativistic quantum mechanics.
