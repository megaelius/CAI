The enhanced continualization approach proposed in this paper is aimed to overcome some drawbacks
observed in the homogenization of beam lattices. To this end an enhanced homogenization technique
is proposed and formulated to obtain consistent micropolar continuum models of the beam lattices
and able to simulate with good approximation the boundary layer effects and the Floquet-Bloch spectrum
of the Lagrangian model. The continualization technique here proposed is based on a transformation
of the difference equation of motion of the discrete system via a proper down-scaling law into a pseudo-differential
problem; a further McLaurin approximation is applied to obtain a higher order differential problem.
The formulation is carried out for simple one-dimensional beam lattices that are, nevertheless,
characterized by a rather wide variety of static and dynamic behaviors: the rod lattice, the beam
lattice with node rotations and a 1D beam lattice model with generalized displacements. Higher
order models may be obtained which are characterized by differential problems involving non-local
inertia terms together with spatial high gradient terms. Moreover, the homogenized models obtained
by the proposed enhanced continualization technique turn out to be energetically consistent and
provide a good simulation of both the static response and of the acoustic spectrum of the original
discrete models. The proposed homogenization procedure is first presented for the simple case
of monoatomic axial chains. The beam lattice with node rotations and displacement prevented exhibits,
in the static regime, decaying oscillations of the nodal rotation in the boundary layer which is
well simulated by the homogenized model obtained by the proposed approach.
