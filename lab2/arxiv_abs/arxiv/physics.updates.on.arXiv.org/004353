We report the role of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in switching characteristics of a highly nonlinear
fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with cubic-quintic-septic nonlinearities. We demonstrate that the
device shows novel bi-(multi-) stable states in the broken regime as a direct consequence of the
shift in the photonic band gap influenced by both $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and higher-order nonlinearities.
We also numerically depict that such FBGs provide a productive test bed where the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
regime can be exploited to set up all-optical applications such as binary switches, multi-level
signal processing and optical computing. Unlike optical bistability (OB) in the traditional and
unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric FBG, it exhibits many peculiar features such as flat-top stable
states and ramp like input-output characteristics before the onset of OB phenomenon in the broken
regime. The gain/loss parameter plays a dual role in controlling the switching intensities between
the stable states which is facilitated by reversing the direction of light incidence. We also find
that the gain/loss parameter tailors the formation of gap solitons pertaining to transmission
resonances which clearly indicates that it can be employed to set up optical storage devices. Moreover,
the interplay between gain/loss and higher order nonlinearities brings notable changes in the
nonlinear reflection spectra of the system under constant pump powers. The influence of each control
parameters on the switching operation is also presented in a nutshell to validate that FBG offers
more degrees of freedom in controlling light with light.
