In atomic multi-level systems, adiabatic elimination is a method used to minimize complicity of
the system by eliminating irrelevant and strongly coupled levels by detuning them from one-another.
Such a three-level system, for instance, can be mapped onto physical in form of a three-waveguide
system. Actively detuning the coupling strength between the respective waveguide modes allows
modulating light propagating through the device, as proposed here. The outer waveguides act as
an effective two- photonic-mode system similar to ground- and excited states of a three-level atomic
system, whilst the center waveguide is partially plasmonic. In adiabatic elimination regime,
the amplitude of the middle waveguide oscillates much faster in comparison to the outer waveguides
leading to a vanishing field build up. As a result, the middle waveguide becomes a dark state and hence
a low insertion-loss of 8 decibel is expected to keep when achieving the modulation depth as high
as 70 decibel despite the involvement of a plasmonic waveguide in the design presented here. The
modulation mechanism relies on switching this waveguide system from a critical coupling regime
to adiabatic elimination condition via electrostatically tuning the free-carrier concentration
and hence the optical index of a thin ITO layer residing in the plasmonic center waveguide. This alters
the effective coupling length and the phase mismatching condition thus modulation in each of outer
waveguides. Our results show a modulator energy efficiency as low as 40 atto-joule per bit and an
extinction ratio of 50 decibel. Given the minuscule footprint of the modulator, the resulting lumped-element
limited RC delay is expected to exceed 200 giga hertz. This type of modulator paves the way for next-generation
both energy-and speed conscience optical short-reach interconnects.
