Interacting Bosons, loaded in artificial lattices, have emerged as a modern platform to explore
collective manybody phenomena, quantum phase transitions and exotic phases of matter as well as
to enable advanced on chip simulators. Such experiments strongly rely on well-defined shaping
the potential landscape of the Bosons, respectively Bosonic quasi-particles, and have been restricted
to cryogenic, or even ultra-cold temperatures. On chip, the GaAs-based exciton-polariton platform
emerged as a promising system to implement and study bosonic non-linear systems in lattices, yet
demanding cryogenic temperatures. In our work, we discuss the first experiment conducted on a polaritonic
lattice at ambient conditions: We utilize fluorescent proteins as an excitonic gain material,
providing ultra-stable Frenkel excitons. We directly take advantage of their soft nature by mechanically
shaping them in the photonic one-dimensional lattice. We demonstrate controlled loading of the
condensate in distinct orbital lattice modes of different symmetries, and finally explore, as
an illustrative example, the formation of a gap solitonic mode, driven by the interplay of effective
interaction and negative effective mass in our lattice. The observed phenomena in our open dissipative
system are comprehensively scrutinized by a nonequilibrium model of polariton condensation.
We believe, that this work is establishing the organic polariton platform as a serious contender
to the well-established GaAs platform for a wide range of applications relying on coherent Bosons
in lattices, given its unprecedented flexibility, cost effectiveness and operation temperature.
