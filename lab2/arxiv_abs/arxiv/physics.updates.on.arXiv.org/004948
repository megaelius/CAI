We introduce the first comprehensive approach to determine the uncertainty in volumetric Particle
Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) measurements. Volumetric PTV is a state-of-the-art non-invasive
flow measurement technique, which measures the velocity field by recording successive snapshots
of the tracer particle motion using a multi-camera set-up. The measurement chain involves reconstructing
the three-dimensional particle positions by a triangulation process using the calibrated camera
mapping functions. The non-linear combination of the elemental error sources during the iterative
self-calibration correction and particle reconstruction steps increases the complexity of the
task. Here, we first estimate the uncertainty in the particle image location, which we model as a
combination of the particle position estimation uncertainty and the reprojection error uncertainty.
The latter is obtained by a gaussian fit to the histogram of disparity estimates within a sub-volume.
Next, we determine the uncertainty in the camera calibration coefficients. As a final step the previous
two uncertainties are combined using an uncertainty propagation through the volumetric reconstruction
process. The uncertainty in the velocity vector is directly obtained as a function of the reconstructed
particle position uncertainty. The framework is tested with synthetic vortex ring images. The
results show good agreement between the predicted and the expected RMS uncertainty values. The
prediction is consistent for seeding densities tested in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 particles per pixel.
Finally, the methodology is also successfully validated for an experimental test case of laminar
pipe flow velocity profile measurement where the predicted uncertainty is within 17% of the RMS
error value.
