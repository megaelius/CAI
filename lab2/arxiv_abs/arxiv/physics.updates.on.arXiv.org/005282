Neural computation is associated with the emergence, reconfiguration and dissolution of cell
assemblies in the context of varying oscillatory states. Here, we describe the complex spatio-temporal
dynamics of cell assemblies through temporal network formalism. We use a sliding window approach
to extract sequences of networks of information sharing among single units in hippocampus and enthorinal
cortex during anesthesia and study how global and node-wise functional connectivity properties
evolve along time. First, we find that information sharing networks display, at any time, a core-periphery
structure in which an integrated core of more tightly functionally interconnected units link to
more loosely connected network leaves. However the units participating to the core or to the periphery
substantially change across time-windows. Second, we find that discrete network states can be
defined on top of this continuously ongoing liquid core-periphery reorganization. Switching
between network states results in a more abrupt modification of the units belonging to the core and
is only loosely linked to transitions between global oscillatory states. Third, we characterize
different styles of temporal connectivity that cells can exhibit within each state of the sharing
network. While inhibitory cells tend to be central, we show that, otherwise, anatomical localization
only poorly influences the patterns of temporal connectivity of the different cells. Cells can
also change temporal connectivity style when the network changes state. Altogether, these findings
reveal that the sharing of information mediated by the intrinsic dynamics of hippocampal and enthorinal
cortex cell assemblies have a rich spatiotemporal structure, which could not have been identified
by more conventional time- or state-averaged analyses of functional connectivity.
