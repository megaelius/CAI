In this paper, a detailed parameter extraction methodology is proposed for low-frequency noise
(LFN) in single layer (SL) graphene transistors (GFETs) based on a recently established compact
LFN model. Drain current and LFN of two short channel back-gated GFETs (L=300, 100 nm) were measured
at lower and higher drain voltages, for a wide range of gate voltages covering the region away from
charge neutrality point (CNP) up to CNP at p-type operation region. Current-voltage (IV) and LFN
data were also available from a long channel SL top solution-gated (SG) GFET (L=5 um), for both p-
and n-type regions near and away CNP. At each of these regimes, the appropriate IV and LFN parameters
can be accurately extracted. Regarding LFN, mobility fluctuation effect is dominant at CNP and
from there the Hooge parameter aH can be extracted while the carrier number fluctuation contribution
which is responsible for the well-known M-shape bias dependence of output noise divided by squared
drain current, also observed in our data, makes possible the extraction of the NT parameter related
to the number of traps. In the less possible case of a Lambda-shape trend, NT and aH can be extracted
simultaneously from the region near CNP. Away from CNP, contact resistance can have a significant
contribution to LFN and from there the relevant parameter SDR^2 is defined. The LFN parameters described
above can be estimated from the low drain voltage region of operation where the effect of Velocity
Saturation (VS) mechanism is negligible. VS effect results in the reduction of LFN at higher drain
voltages and from there the IV parameter hOmega which represents the phonon energy and is related
to VS effect can be derived both from drain current and LFN data.
