Fluoroscopic imaging that captures X-ray images at video framerates is advantageous for guiding
catheter insertions by vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists. Visualizing the dynamical
movements non-invasively allows complex surgical procedures to be performed with less trauma
to the patient. To improve surgical precision, endovascular procedures can benefit from more accurate
fluoroscopy data via calibration. This paper presents a robust self-calibration algorithm suitable
for single-plane and dual-plane fluoroscopy. A three-dimensional (3D) target field was imaged
by the fluoroscope in a strong geometric network configuration. The unknown 3D positions of targets
and the fluoroscope pose were estimated simultaneously by maximizing the likelihood of the Student-t
probability distribution function. A smoothed k-nearest neighbour (kNN) regression is then used
to model the deterministic component of the image reprojection error of the robust bundle adjustment.
The Maximum Likelihood Estimation step and the kNN regression step are then repeated iteratively
until convergence. Four different error modeling schemes were compared while varying the quantity
of training images. It was found that using a smoothed kNN regression can automatically model the
systematic errors in fluoroscopy with similar accuracy as a human expert using a small training
dataset. When all training images were used, the 3D mapping error was reduced from 0.61-0.83 mm to
0.04 mm post-calibration (94.2-95.7% improvement), and the 2D reprojection error was reduced
from 1.17-1.31 to 0.20-0.21 pixels (83.2-83.8% improvement). When using biplanar fluoroscopy,
the 3D measurement accuracy of the system improved from 0.60 mm to 0.32 mm (47.2% improvement).
