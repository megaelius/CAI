Quantum Moves is a citizen science game that investigates the ability of humans to solve complex
physics challenges that are intractable for computers. During the launch of Quantum Moves in April
2016 the game's leaderboard function broke down resulting in a "no leaderboard" game experience
for some players for a couple of days (though their scores were still displayed). The subsequent
quick fix of an all-time Top 5 leaderboard, and the following long-term implementation of a personalized
relative-position (infinite) leaderboard provided us with a unique opportunity to compare and
investigate the effect of different leaderboard implementations on player performance in a points-driven
citizen science game. All three conditions were live sequentially during the game's initial influx
of more than 150.000 players that stemmed from global press attention on Quantum Moves due the publication
of a Nature paper about the use of Quantum Moves in solving a specific quantum physics problem. Thus,
it has been possible to compare the three conditions and their influence on the performance (defined
as a player's quality of game play related to a high-score) of over 4500 new players. These 4500 odd
players in our three leaderboard-conditions have a similar demographic background based upon
the time-window over which the implementations occurred and controlled against Player ID tags.
Our results placed Condition 1 experience over condition 3 and in some cases even over condition
2 which goes against the general assumption that leaderboards enhance gameplay and its subsequent
overuse as a an oft-relied upon element that designers slap onto a game to enhance said appeal. Our
study thus questions the use of leaderboards as general performance enhancers in gamification
contexts and brings some empirical rigor to an often under-reported but overused phenomenon.
