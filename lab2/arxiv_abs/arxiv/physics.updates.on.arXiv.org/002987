Shear modulus is one of the fundamental mechanical properties of materials, while its quick and
accurate measurement is still a challenge. Here we proposed two methods for shear modulus measurement
based on torsional resonance and torsional wave propagation using a same piezoelectric torsional
transducer. Firstly, the torsional transducer was introduced which consists of two thickness
poled, thickness shear (d15) piezoelectric half-rings. Secondly, the equivalent circuit of the
transducer-cylindrical specimen system is derived and the shear modulus can be explicitly obtained
using the torsional resonance frequency. The internal friction can also be obtained, which is calculated
by using an approximate formula. Then, the principle of shear modulus and internal friction measurement
based on torsional wave propagation were presented. Finally, shear modulus and internal friction
measurement on four materials including 1045 steel, aluminum, quartz glass and PMMA, were conducted.
Results indicate that the measured shear moduli using these two methods are very close to each other,
and consistent with the reference values in literatures. The resonance method is quite convenient
and highly repeatable, but is typically not suitable for long specimens where the first torsional
resonance may not be visible. The wave propagation method is especially suitable for long specimens
and high frequency measurement is suggested. The internal frictions measured by these two methods
were also close to each other, and the simple wave attenuation method is suggested. The two shear
modulus measurement methods proposed in this work are quite reliable and can be widely used in near
future.
