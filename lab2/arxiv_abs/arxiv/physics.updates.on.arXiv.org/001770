Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling neuropsychiatric disorder characterized
by insufficient top-down modulation of the amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex. Real-time
fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging method with potential for modifying the amygdala-prefrontal
interactions. We report the first controlled emotion self-regulation study in veterans with combat-related
PTSD utilizing rtfMRI-nf of the amygdala activity. PTSD patients in the experimental group (EG,
n=20) learned to upregulate BOLD activity of the left amygdala (LA) using rtfMRI-nf during a happy
emotion induction task. PTSD patients in the control group (CG, n=11) were provided with a sham rtfMRI-nf.
The study included three rtfMRI-nf training sessions, and EEG recordings were performed simultaneously
with fMRI. PTSD severity was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). The
EG participants showed a significant reduction in total CAPS ratings, including significant reductions
in avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms. Overall, 80% of the EG participants demonstrated clinically
meaningful reductions in CAPS ratings, compared to 38% in the CG. During the first session, fMRI
connectivity of the LA with the orbitofrontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
was progressively enhanced, and this enhancement significantly and positively correlated with
initial CAPS ratings. Left-lateralized enhancement in upper alpha EEG coherence also exhibited
a significant positive correlation with the initial CAPS. Reduction in PTSD severity between the
first and last rtfMRI-nf sessions significantly correlated with enhancement in functional connectivity
between the LA and the left DLPFC. Our results demonstrate that the rtfMRI-nf of the amygdala activity
has the potential to correct the amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity deficiencies specific
to PTSD.
