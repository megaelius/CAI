During radiation therapy, respiratory motion can lead to inter- and intra-fraction variations
in patient anatomy, which may result in discrepancies between the planned and the delivered dose.
Continuous knowledge of a patient's three-dimensional anatomy is required to fully assess the
dosimetric impact of this motion, and would also enable treatment adaptation to account for any
deviations in delivered dose. However, current clinical imaging techniques do not provide sufficient
information to fully reconstruct 3D anatomy in real time on current clinical linear accelerators.
We present a technique that combines information obtained during treatment on a standard clinical
accelerator with a patient-specific motion model to generate continuous volumetric imaging that
can serve as a basis for improved delivered dose calculation and adaptive radiotherapy. A patient-specific
motion model is constructed by performing principal component analysis (PCA) on displacement
vector fields (DVFs) created by deformably registering images of each phase of a pre-treatment
four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) scan. During treatment, planar kV images are acquired
at a maximum rate of 1/3 Hz, and the position of an external surrogate is continuously monitored.
Volumetric images are reconstructed for each kV image acquisition by optimizing the PCA weights
of the motion model to match the acquired planar kV image. A correlation between these PCA weights
and surrogate kinetics enables continuous generation of a patient's 3D anatomy throughout treatment
delivery. Using digital phantom datasets with an average duration of 155.8 seconds, and comparing
to the ground truth 3D tumor positions and volumetric images, three-dimensional tumor positions
were reconstructed with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.47 mm, and an average 95th percentile
3D positional error of 2.80 mm.
