The magnetization $|\Omega_{\mathrm e}|/\omega_{\mathrm{e}}$ is an important parameter in
plasma astrophysics, where $\Omega_{\mathrm e}$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{e}}$ are the electron
gyro-frequency and electron plasma frequency, respectively. It only depends on the mass ratio
$m_{\mathrm i}/m_{\mathrm e}$ and the light-to-Alfv\'en speed ratio $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$, where
$m_{\mathrm i}$ ($m_{\mathrm e}$) is the ion (electron) mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$
is the ion Alfv\'en speed. Nonlinear numerical plasma models such as particle-in-cell simulations
must often assume unrealistic values for $m_{\mathrm i}/m_{\mathrm e}$ and for $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$.
Because linear theory yields exact results for parametric scalings of wave properties at small
amplitudes, we use linear theory to investigate the dispersion relations of Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron
and fast-magnetosonic/whistler waves as prime examples for collective plasma behaviour depending
on $m_{\mathrm i}/m_{\mathrm e}$ and $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$. We analyse their dependence on $m_{\mathrm
i}/m_{\mathrm e}$ and $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$ in quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular directions
of propagation with respect to the background magnetic field for a plasma with $\beta_j\sim1$,
where $\beta_j$ is the ratio of the thermal to magnetic pressure for species $j$. Although their
dispersion relations are largely independent of $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$ for $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}\gtrsim
10$, the mass ratio $m_{\mathrm i}/m_{\mathrm e}$ has a strong effect at scales smaller than the
ion inertial length. Moreover, we study the impact of relativistic electron effects on the dispersion
relations. Based on our results, we recommend aiming for a more realistic value of $m_{\mathrm i}/m_{\mathrm
e}$ than for a more realistic value of $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$ in non-relativistic plasma simulations
if such a choice is necessary, although $\dots$
