In this paper, we aim to resolve two fundamental issues in the dynamics of relativity: (i) Under what
condition, the time-column space integrals of a Lorentz four-tensor constitute a Lorentz four-vector,
and (ii) under what condition, the time-element space integral of a Lorentz four-vector is a Lorentz
scalar; namely two ``conservation laws'', which are mispresented in traditional textbooks, and
widely used in fundamental research, such as relativistic analysis of the momentum of light in a
medium, and the proofs of the positive mass theorem in general relativity. To resolve issue (i),
we have developed a generalized Lorentz \emph{four-vector} theorem from the change of variables
theorem in classical mathematical analysis. We use this four-vector theorem to verify M\o ller's
theorem, and surprisingly find that M\o ller's theorem is fundamentally wrong. We provide a corrected
version of M\o ller's theorem. We also use this four-vector theorem to analyze a plane light wave
in a moving uniform medium, and find that the momentum and energy of Minkowski quasi-photon constitute
a Lorentz four-vector and Planck constant is a Lorentz invariant. To resolve issue (ii), we have
developed a generalized Lorentz \emph{scalar} theorem. We use this theorem to verify the ``invariant
conservation law'' in relativistic electrodynamics, and unexpectedly find that it is also fundamentally
wrong. Thus the two ``conservation laws'' in traditional textbooks, which have magically attracted
several generations of most outstanding scientists, turned out to be imaginary, just like the emperor's
new clothes; creating a scientific myth in the modern theoretical and mathematical physics: Believing
is seeing.
