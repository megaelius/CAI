Data-based discovery of effective, coarse-grained (CG) models of high-dimensional dynamical
systems presents a unique challenge in computational physics and particularly in the context of
multiscale problems. The present paper offers a data-based, probablistic perspective that enables
the quantification of predictive uncertainties. One of the outstanding problems has been the introduction
of physical constraints in the probabilistic machine learning objectives. The primary utility
of such constraints stems from the undisputed physical laws such as conservation of mass, energy
etc that they represent. Furthermore and apart from leading to physically realistic predictions,
they can significantly reduce the requisite amount of training data which for high-dimensional,
multiscale systems are expensive to obtain (Small Data regime). We formulate the coarse-graining
process by employing a probabilistic state-space model and account for the aforementioned equality
constraints as virtual observables in the associated densities. We demonstrate how probabilistic
inference tools can be employed to identify the coarse-grained variables in combination with deep
neural nets and their evolution model without ever needing to define a fine-to-coarse (restriction)
projection and without needing time-derivatives of state variables. Furthermore, it is capable
of reconstructing the evolution of the full, fine-scale system and therefore the observables of
interest need not be selected a priori. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework by
applying it to systems of interacting particles and an image-series of a nonlinear pendulum.
