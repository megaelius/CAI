Cascaded or central-moment-based lattice Boltzmann method (CLBM) proposed in [Geier \textit{et
al.}, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{63}, 066705 (2006)] possesses very good numerical stability. However,
two constraints exist in three-dimensional (3D) CLBM simulations. Firstly, the conventional
implementation for 3D CLBM involves cumbersome operations and requires much higher computational
cost compared to the single-relaxation-time (SRT) LBM. Secondly, it is a challenge to accurately
incorporate a general force field into the 3D CLBM. In this paper, we present an improved method to
implement CLBM in 3D. The main strategy is to adopt a simplified central moment set, and carry out
the central-moment-based collision operator based on a general multi-relaxation-time (GMRT)
framework. Next, the recently proposed consistent forcing scheme in CLBM [L. Fei and K. H. Luo, Phys.
Rev. E \textbf{96}, 053307 (2017)] is extended to incorporate a general force field into 3D CLBM.
Compared with the recently developed non-orthogonal CLBM [A. D. Rosis, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{95},
013310 (2017)], our implementation is proved to reduce the computational cost significantly.
The inconsistency of adopting the discrete equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs) in the non-orthogonal
CLBM is revealed and discussed. The 3D CLBM developed here in conjunction with the consistent forcing
scheme is verified through numerical simulations of several canonical force-driven flows, highlighting
very good properties in terms of accuracy, convergence and consistency with the nonslip rule. Finally,
the techniques developed here for 3D CLBM can be applied to make the implementation and execution
of 3D MRT-LBM much more efficient.
