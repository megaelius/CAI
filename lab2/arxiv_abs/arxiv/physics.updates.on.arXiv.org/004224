After the efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells achieved more than 10%, the control of
stability and degradation mechanisms of solar cells became a prominent task. The improvement of
device efficiency due to incorporation of a hole-transport layer (HTL) in bulk-heterojunction
solar cells has been extensively reported. However, the most widely used HTL material, PEDOT:PSS
is frequently suspected to be the dominating source for devices instability under environmental
conditions. Thereby effects like photooxidation and electrode corrosion are often reported to
shorten device lifetime. However, often in environmental device studies, the source of degradation,
whether being from the HTL, the active layer or the metal cathode are rather difficult to distinguish,
because the external diffusion of oxygen and water affects all components. In this study, different
HTLs, namely prepared from traditional PEDOT:PSS and also two types of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3),
are exposed to different environments such as oxygen, light or humidity, prior to device finalization
under inert conditions. This allows investigating any effects within the HTL and from reactions
at its interface to the indium-tin-oxide electrode or the active layer. The surface and bulk chemistry
of the exposed HTL has been monitored and discussed in context to the observed device physics, dynamic
charge transport and spatial performance homogeneity of the according OPV device. The results
show that merely humidity-exposure of the HTL leads to decreased device performance for PEDOT:PSS,
but also for one type of the tested MoO3. The losses are related to the amount of absorbed water in the
HTL, inducing loss of active area in terms of interfacial contact. The device with PEDOT:PSS HTL
after humid air exposure showed seriously decreased photocurrent by micro-delamination of swelling/shrinkage
of the hygroscopic layer.
