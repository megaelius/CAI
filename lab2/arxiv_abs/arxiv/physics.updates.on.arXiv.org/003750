Over the last decades, several types of collision models have been proposed to extend the validity
domain of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), each of them being introduced in its own formalism.
The present article proposes a formalism that describes all these methods within a common mathematical
framework, and in this way allows us to draw direct links between them. Here, the focus is put on single
and multirelaxation time collision models in either their raw moment, central moment, cumulant
or regularized form. In parallel with that, several bases (non orthogonal, orthogonal, Hermite)
are considered for the polynomial expansion of populations. General relationships between moments
are first derived to understand how moment spaces are related to each other. In addition, a review
of collision models further sheds light on collision models that can be rewritten in a linear matrix
form. More quantitative mathematical studies are then carried out by comparing explicit expressions
for the post collision populations. Thanks to this, it is possible to deduce the impact of both the
polynomial basis (raw, Hermite, central, central Hermite, cumulant) and the inclusion of regularization
steps on isothermal LBMs. Extensive results are provided for the D1Q3, D2Q9, and D3Q27 lattices,
the latter being further extended to the D3Q19 velocity discretization. Links with the most common
two and multirelaxation time collision models are also provided for the sake of completeness. The
present work ends by emphasizing the importance of an accurate representation of the equilibrium
state, independently of the choice of moment space. As an addition to the theoretical purpose of
the present article, general instructions are provided to help the reader with the implementation
of the most complicated collision models.
