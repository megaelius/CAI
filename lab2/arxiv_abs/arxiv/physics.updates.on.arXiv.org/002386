Proximal gamma-ray spectroscopy supported by adequate calibration and correction for growing
biomass is an effective field scale technique for a continuous monitoring of top soil water content
dynamics to be potentially employed as a decision support tool for automatic irrigation scheduling.
This study demonstrates that this approach has the potential to be one of the best space-time trade-off
methods, representing a joining link between punctual and satellite fields of view. The inverse
proportionality between soil moisture and gamma signal is theoretically derived taking into account
a non-constant correction due to the presence of growing vegetation beneath the detector position.
The gamma signal attenuation due to biomass is modelled with a Monte Carlo-based approach in terms
of an equivalent water layer which thickness varies in time as the crop evolves during its life-cycle.
The reliability and effectiveness of this approach is proved through a 7 months continuous acquisition
of terrestrial gamma radiation in a 0.4 ha tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) test field. We demonstrate
that a permanent gamma station installed at an agricultural field can reliably probe the water content
of the top soil only if systematic effects due to the biomass shielding are properly accounted for.
Biomass corrected experimental values of soil water content inferred from radiometric measurements
are compared with gravimetric data acquired under different soil moisture levels, resulting in
an average percentage relative discrepancy of about 3% in bare soil condition and of 4% during the
vegetated period. The temporal evolution of corrected soil water content values exhibits a dynamic
range coherent with the soil hydraulic properties in terms of wilting point, field capacity and
saturation.
