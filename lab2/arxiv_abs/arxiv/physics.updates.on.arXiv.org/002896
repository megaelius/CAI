On the strength of a double Nobel prize winning experiment (Super)Kamiokande and an extremely successful
long baseline neutrino programme, the third generation Water Cherenkov detector, Hyper-Kamiokande,
is being developed by an international collaboration as a leading worldwide experiment based in
Japan. The Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be hosted in the Tochibora mine, about 295 km away from
the J-PARC proton accelerator research complex in Tokai, Japan. The currently existing accelerator
will be steadily upgraded to reach a MW beam by the start of the experiment. A suite of near detectors
will be vital to constrain the beam for neutrino oscillation measurements. A new cavern will be excavated
at the Tochibora mine to host the detector. The experiment will be the largest underground water
Cherenkov detector in the world and will be instrumented with new technology photosensors, faster
and with higher quantum efficiency than the ones in Super-Kamiokande. The science that will be developed
will be able to shape the future theoretical framework and generations of experiments. Hyper-Kamiokande
will be able to measure with the highest precision the leptonic CP violation that could explain the
baryon asymmetry in the Universe. The experiment also has a demonstrated excellent capability
to search for proton decay, providing a significant improvement in discovery sensitivity over
current searches for the proton lifetime. The atmospheric neutrinos will allow to determine the
neutrino mass ordering and, together with the beam, able to precisely test the three-flavour neutrino
oscillation paradigm and search for new phenomena. A strong astrophysical programme will be carried
out at the experiment that will detect supernova neutrinos and will measure precisely solar neutrino
oscillation.
