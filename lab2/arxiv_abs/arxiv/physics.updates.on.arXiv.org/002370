Solids facing a plasma are a common situation in many astrophysical systems and laboratory setups.
Moreover, many plasma technology applications rely on the control of the plasma-surface interaction.
However, presently often a fundamental understanding of them is missing, so most technological
applications are being developed via trial and error. In the majority of plasma simulations surface
processes are either neglected or treated via phenomenological parameters such as sticking coefficients,
sputter rates or secondary electron emission coefficients. However, those parameters are known
only in some cases and with very limited accuracy. Similarly, while surface physics simulations
have often studied the impact of single ions or neutrals, so far, the influence of a plasma medium
and correlations between successive impacts have not been taken into account. Such an approach
cannot have predictive power. In this paper we discuss in some detail the physical processes a the
plasma-solid interface which brings us to the necessity of coupled plasma-solid simulations.
We briefly summarize relevant theoretical methods from solid state and surface physics that are
suitable to contribute to such an approach and identify four methods. The first are mesoscopic simulations
such as kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) and molecular dynamics (MD) that are able to treat complex processes
on large scales but neglect electronic effects. The second are quantum kinetic methods based on
the quantum Boltzmann equation that give access to a more accurate treatment of surface processes
using simplifying models for the solid. The third approach are ab initio simulations of surface
process that are based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT. The fourths are
nonequilibrium Green functions that able to treat correlation effects in the material and at the
interface.
