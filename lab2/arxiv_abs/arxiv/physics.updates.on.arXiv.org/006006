The goal of this paper is to enable 3D printed lightweight composite foams by blending hollow glass
micro balloons (GMB) with HDPE. To that end, lightweight feedstock for printing syntactic foam
composites is developed. The blend for this is prepared by varying GMB content (20, 40, and 60 volume
%) in HDPE for filament extrusion, which is subsequently used for three-dimensional printing (3DP).
The rheological properties and the melt flow index (MFI) of blends are investigated for identifying
optimal printing parameters. It is observed that the storage and loss modulus, as well as complex
viscosity increases with increasing GMB content, whereas MFI decreases. Further, coefficient
of thermal expansion of HDPE and foam filaments decreases with increasing GMB content, thereby
lowering the thermal stresses in prints which promotes reduction in warpage. The mechanical properties
of filaments are determined by subjecting them to tensile tests, whereas 3D printed samples are
tested under tensile and flexure tests. The tensile modulus of the filament increases with increasing
GMB volume % and exhibiting comparable filament strength. 3D printed foams show higher specific
tensile and flexural modulus as compared to neat HDPE, making them suitable candidate materials
for weight sensitive applications. Also, the micrographs of filaments and 3D printed foams show
a uniform distribution of GMBs in the HDPE matrix. Finally, property map reveals higher modulus
and comparable strength against injection and compression molded composite foams. Hence, 3D printed
foams have the potential for replacing components processed through conventional manufacturing
processes that have limitations on geometrically complex designs, lead time, and associated costs.
