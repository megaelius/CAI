In this paper, we discover novel negative space and discover a new GLHUA outer annular layer electromagnetic
(EM) invisible cloak with relative parameter not less than 1. The outer layer cloak can be any positive
thickness. In GLHUA outer annular layer cloak, $R_1 \le r \le R_2 $,$R_1>0$,$R_2>R_1$, $\varepsilon_r
= \mu_r = \frac{{R_2 ^2 }}{{r^2 }}$, $\varepsilon_\theta = \varepsilon_\phi = \mu_\theta = \mu_\phi
= \frac{{R_2 - R_1 }}{{r - R_1 }}$. We discovered an exact analytical EM wave propagation solution
of the full wave Maxwell EM equation in the GLHUA outer cloak. In GLHUA outer annular layer cloak,
$R_1 \le r \le R_2 $, the exact analytic radial EM wave field solution of Maxwell radial EM differential
equation is discovered in this paper The exact analytical radial EM wave solution show that there
is no scattering from the GLHUA outer layer cloak to disturb the incident EM wave outside of the cloak
in free space. The exact analytical radial EM wave solution show that the EM wave can not propagation
penetrate into the sphere $r < R_1 $.In the free space inside of the concealment, $r < R_1 $,$E_r (\vec
r) = 0$ $H_r (\vec r) = 0$. We propose a GLHUA expansion method to find an exact analytical EM wave propagation
in the GLHUA double cloak The idea and ingredients in this paper are breakthrough progress and different
from all other cloak in other research publications. Our analytical EM wave in GLHUA cloak is undisputed
evidence and rigorous proof to prove that the GLHUA double layer cloak is practicable invisible
cloak without exceed light speed propagation. We discover a novel GLHUA mirage bridge wave that
make EM wave without exceeding light speed propagation.
