We report 3D-printed acoustic holographic lenses for the formation of ultrasonic fields of complex
spatial distribution inside the skull. Using holographic lenses, we experimentally, numerically
and theoretically produce acoustic beams whose spatial distribution matches target structures
of the central nervous system. In particular, we produce three types of targets of increasing complexity.
First, a set of points are selected at the center of both right and left human hippocampi. Experiments
using a skull phantom and 3D printed acoustic holographic lenses show that the corresponding bifocal
lens simultaneously focuses acoustic energy at the target foci, with good agreement between theory
and simulations. Second, an arbitrary curve is set as the target inside the skull phantom. Using
time-reversal methods the holographic beam bends following the target path, in a similar way as
self-bending beams do in free space. Finally, the right human hippocampus is selected as a target
volume. The focus of the corresponding holographic lens overlaps with the target volume in excellent
agreement between theory in free-media, and experiments and simulations including the skull phantom.
The precise control of focused ultrasound into the central nervous system is mainly limited due
to the strong phase aberrations produced by refraction and attenuation of the skull. Using the present
method, the ultrasonic beam can be focused not only at a single point but overlapping one or various
target structures simultaneously using low-cost 3D-printed acoustic holographic lens. The results
open new paths to spread incoming biomedical ultrasound applications including blood-brain barrier
opening or neuromodulation.
