This paper develops mfEGRA, a multifidelity active learning method using data-driven adaptively
refined surrogates for failure boundary location in reliability analysis. This work addresses
the issue of prohibitive cost of reliability analysis using Monte Carlo sampling for expensive-to-evaluate
high-fidelity models by using cheaper-to-evaluate approximations of the high-fidelity model.
The method builds on the Efficient Global Reliability Analysis (EGRA) method, which is a surrogate-based
method that uses adaptive sampling for refining Gaussian process surrogates for failure boundary
location using a single-fidelity model. Our method introduces a two-stage adaptive sampling criterion
that uses a multifidelity Gaussian process surrogate to leverage multiple information sources
with different fidelities. The method combines expected feasibility criterion from EGRA with
one-step lookahead information gain to refine the surrogate around the failure boundary. The computational
savings from mfEGRA depends on the discrepancy between the different models, and the relative cost
of evaluating the different models as compared to the high-fidelity model. We show that accurate
estimation of reliability using mfEGRA leads to computational savings of $\sim$46% for an analytic
multimodal test problem and 24% for a three-dimensional acoustic horn problem, when compared to
single-fidelity EGRA. We also show the effect of using a priori drawn Monte Carlo samples in the implementation
for the acoustic horn problem, where mfEGRA leads to computational savings of 45% for the three-dimensional
case and 48% for a rarer event four-dimensional case as compared to single-fidelity EGRA.
