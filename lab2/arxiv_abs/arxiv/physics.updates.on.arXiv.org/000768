We present a systematic investigation of the effects of roughness geometry on turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection (RBC) over rough plates with pyramid-shaped and periodically distributed roughness
elements. Using a parameter $\lambda$ defined as the height of a roughness element over its base
width, the heat transport, the flow dynamics and local temperatures are measured for the Rayleigh
number range $7.50\times 10^{7} \leq Ra\leq 1.31\times 10^{11}$, and the Prandtl number $Pr$ from
3.57 to 23.34 at four values of $\lambda$. It is found that the heat transport scaling, i.e. $Nu\sim
Ra^{\alpha}$ where $Nu$ is the Nusselt number, may be classified into three regimes. In Regime I,
the system is in a dynamically smooth state. The heat transport scaling is the same as that in a smooth
cell. In Regimes II and III, the heat transport enhances. When $\lambda$ is increased from 0.5 to
4.0, $\alpha$ increases from 0.36 to 0.59 in Regime II, and it increases from 0.30 to 0.50 in Regime
III. The experiment demonstrates the heat transport scaling in turbulent RBC can be manipulated
using $\lambda$. Previous studies suggest that the transition from Regime I to Regime II, occurs
when the thermal boundary layer (BL) thickness becomes smaller than the roughness height $h$. Direct
measurements of the viscous BL in the present study suggest that the transition from Regime II to
Regime III is likely a result of the viscous BL thickness becoming smaller $h$. The scaling exponent
of the Reynolds number $Re$ vs. $Ra$ changes from 0.471 to 0.551 when $\lambda$ is increased from
0.5 to 4.0. It is also found that increasing $\lambda$ increases the clustering of thermal plumes
which effectively increases the plumes lifetime that are ultimately responsible for the enhanced
heat transport.
