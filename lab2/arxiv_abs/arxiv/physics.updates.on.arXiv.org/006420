When a nematic liquid crystal (LC) is confined on a self-closing spherical shell, topological constraints
arise with intriguing consequences that depend critically on how the LC is aligned in the shell.
We demonstrate reversible dynamic tuning of the alignment, and thereby the topology, of nematic
LC shells stabilized by the nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer Pluronic F127. Deep in the nematic
phase, the director is tangential to the interface, but upon approaching the temperature TNI of
the nematic-isotropic transition, the director realigns to normal. We link this to a delicate interplay
between an interfacial tension that is nearly independent of director orientation, and the configuration-dependent
elastic deformation energy of an LC confined in a shell. The process is primarily triggered by the
heating-induced reduction of the nematic order parameter, hence realignment temperatures differ
by several tens of degrees between LCs with high and low TNI, respectively. The temperature of realignment
is always lower on the positive-curved shell outside than at the negative-curved inside, yielding
a complex topological reconfiguration on heating. Complementing experimental investigations
with mathematical modeling and computer simulations, we identify and investigate three different
trajectories, distinguished by their configurations of topological defects in the initial tangential-aligned
shell. Our results uncover a new aspect of the complex response of LCs to curved confinement, demonstrating
that the order of the LC itself can influence the alignment and thereby the topology of the system.
They also reveal the potential of amphiphilic block copolymer stabilizers for enabling continuous
tunability of LC shell configuration, opening doors for in-depth studies of topological dynamics
as well as novel applications in, e.g., sensing and programmed soft actuators.
