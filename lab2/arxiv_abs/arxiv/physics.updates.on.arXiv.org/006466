The velocity particle distributions measured in-situ in space plasmas deviate from Maxwellian
(thermal) equilibrium, showing enhanced suprathermal tails which are well described by the standard
Kappa-distribution (SKD). Despite its successful application, the SKD is frequently disputed
due to a series of unphysical implications like diverging velocity moments, preventing a macroscopic
description of the plasma. The regularized Kappa-distribution (RKD) has been introduced to overcome
these limitations, but the dispersion properties of RKD-plasmas are not explored yet. In the present
paper we compute the wavenumber dispersion of the frequency and damping or growth rates for the electromagnetic
modes in plasmas characterized by the RKD. This task is accomplished by using the grid-based kinetic
dispersion solver LEOPARD developed for arbitrary gyrotropic distributions [P. Astfalk and F.
Jenko, J. Geophys. Res. 122, 89 (2017)]. By reproducing previous results obtained for the SKD and
Maxwellian, we validate the functionality of the code. Furthermore, we apply the isotropic as well
as the anisotropic RKDs to investigate stable electromagnetic electron-cyclotron (EMEC) and
ion-cyclotron (EMIC) modes as well as temperature-anisotropy-driven instabilities, both for
the case $T_\perp / T_\parallel > 1$ (EMEC and EMIC instabilities) and for the case $T_\perp / T_\parallel
< 1$ (proton and electron firehose instabilities), where $\parallel$ and $\perp$ denote directions
parallel and perpendicular to the local time-averaged magnetic field. Provided that the cutoff
parameter $\alpha$ is small enough, the results show that the RKDs reproduce the dispersion curves
of the SKD plasmas at both qualitative and quantitative levels. For higher values, however, physically
significant deviation occurs.
