In this paper, we study fixed points of N-point gravitational lenses. We use complex form of lens
mapping to study fixed points. Complex form has an advantage over coordinate one because we can describe
N-point gravitational lens by system of two equation in coordinate form and we can describe it by
one equation in complex form. We can easily transform the equation, which describe N-point gravitational
lens, into polynomial equation that is convenient to use for our research. In our work, we present
lens mapping as a linear combination of two mapping: complex analytical and identity mapping. Analytical
mapping is specified by analytical function (deflection function). We studied necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of deflection function and proved some theorems. Deflection function
is analytical, rational, its zeroes are fixed points of lens mapping and their number is from 1 to
N-1, poles of deflection function are coordinates of point masses, all poles are simple, the residues
at the poles are equal to the value of point masses.\\ We used Gauss-Lucas theorem and proved that
all fixed points of lens mapping are in the convex polygon. Vertices of the polygon consist of point
masses. We proved theorem that can be used to find all fixed point of lens mapping. On the basis of the
above, we conclude that one-point gravitational lens has no fixed points, 2-point lens has only
1 fixed point, 3-point lens has 1 or 2 fixed points. Also we present expressions to calculate fixed
points in 2-point and 3-point gravitational lenses. We present some examples of parametrization
of point masses and distribution of fixed points for this parametrization.
