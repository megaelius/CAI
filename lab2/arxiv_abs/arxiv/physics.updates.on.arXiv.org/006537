Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is being increasingly adopted as a label-free and non-invasive
technique for biomedical applications such as cancer and ocular disease diagnosis. Diagnostic
information for these tissues is manifest in textural and geometric features of the OCT images,
which are used by human expertise to interpret and triage. However, it suffers delays due to the long
process of the conventional diagnostic procedure and shortage of human expertise. Here, a custom
deep learning architecture, LightOCT, is proposed for the classification of OCT images into diagnostically
relevant classes. LightOCT is a convolutional neural network with only two convolutional layers
and a fully connected layer, but it is shown to provide excellent training and test results for diverse
OCT image datasets. We show that LightOCT provides 98.9% accuracy in classifying 44 normal and 44
malignant (invasive ductal carcinoma) breast tissue volumetric OCT images. Also, >96% accuracy
in classifying public datasets of ocular OCT images as normal, age-related macular degeneration
and diabetic macular edema. Additionally, we show ~96% test accuracy for classifying retinal images
as belonging to choroidal neovascularization, diabetic macular edema, drusen, and normal samples
on a large public dataset of more than 100,000 images. The performance of the architecture is compared
with transfer learning based deep neural networks. Through this, we show that LightOCT can provide
significant diagnostic support for a variety of OCT images with sufficient training and minimal
hyper-parameter tuning. The trained LightOCT networks for the three-classification problem
will be released online to support transfer learning on other datasets.
