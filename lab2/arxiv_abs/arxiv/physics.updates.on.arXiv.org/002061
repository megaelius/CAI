We investigate the effect of turbulence on the collisional growth of um-sized droplets through
high- resolution numerical simulations with well resolved Kolmogorov scales, assuming a collision
and coalescence efficiency of unity. The droplet dynamics and collisions are approximated using
a superparticle approach. In the absence of gravity, we show that the time evolution of the shape
of the droplet-size distribution due to turbulence-induced collisions depends strongly on the
turbulent energy-dissipation rate, but only weakly on the Reynolds number. This can be explained
through the energy dissipation rate dependence of the mean collision rate described by the Saffman-Turner
collision model. Consistent with the Saffman-Turner collision model and its extensions, the collision
rate increases as the square root of the energy dissipation rate even when coalescence is invoked.
The size distribution exhibits power law behavior with a slope of -3.7 between a maximum at approximately
10 um up to about 40 um. When gravity is invoked, turbulence is found to dominate the time evolution
of an initially monodisperse droplet distribution at early times. At later times, however, gravity
takes over and dominates the collisional growth. We find that the formation of large droplets is
very sensitive to the turbulent energy dissipation rate. This is due to the fact that turbulence
enhances the collisional growth between similar sized droplets at the early stage of raindrop formation.
The mean collision rate grows exponentially, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction
of the continuous collisional growth even when turbulence-generated collisions are invoked.
This consistency only reflects the mean effect of turbulence on collisional growth.
