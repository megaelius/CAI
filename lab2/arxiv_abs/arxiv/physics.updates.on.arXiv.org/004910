Bubble bursting at the surface of a liquid open to a gas environment may exhibit the appearance of
a spatiotemporal singularity for a specific choice of flow parameters. The flow can be described
as a non-simple two-phase dipole centered at the surface of the liquid whose mechanical energy comes
from the free surface energy of the initial bubble. Its topology shows both a rapid ejection of a microjet
into the gas environment and the thrust of a relatively large ellipsoidal liquid blob into the liquid
to ensure that the total momentum in the axial direction is always preserved. We propose a general
physical model where the radius $R$ of the ejected droplet sizes and their initial speeds $V$ scale
as $R/R_o\sim \left(\left(a^2+\psi\right)^{1/2}+a\right)^{-1}\delta$, and $V/V_o\sim \left(\left(a^2+\psi\right)^{1/2}+a\right)\delta^{-1/2}$,
where $\psi=\left( \left(b \varphi\right)^{1/4}-\left(b \varphi\right)^{-1/4}\right)^{-2}$.
$a$ and $b$ are universal constants. Here, $\delta=\parallel\text{Oh}^*-\text{Oh}\parallel$
and $\varphi=\text{Oh}^{-2}\delta$, where Oh$=\mu/\left(\rho\sigma R_o\right)^{1/2}$ is
the Ohnesorge number ($\rho$, $\sigma$ and $\mu$ are the liquid density, surface tension and viscosity).
$R_o$ and $V_o=\left(\sigma/(\rho R_o)\right)^{1/2}$ are the initial bubble radius and the reference
capillary speed, respectively. The experimental and numerical results yield Oh$^*\simeq 0.038$,
$a\simeq 0.15$, and $b\simeq 1.7$. These laws are modified with the Bond number as here proposed.
Previously proposed models can be derived from our model by choosing different values of the parameters
$\{\text{Oh}^*,a,b\}$. As an intriguing result, this model anticipates the appearance of two
relatively close critical values of Oh, which would explain the striking discrepancy among previous
proposed critical values of this parameter.
