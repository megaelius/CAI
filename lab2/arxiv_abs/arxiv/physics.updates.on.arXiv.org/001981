Ultrathin planar absorbing layers, including semiconductor and metal films, and 2D materials,
are promising building blocks for solar energy harvesting devices but poor light absorption has
been a critical issue. Although interference in ultrathin absorbing layers has been studied to
realize near perfect absorption at a specific wavelength, achieving high broadband absorption
still remains challenging. Here, we both theoretically and experimentally demonstrated a method
to tune not only reflection phase shift but also electromagnetic energy dissipation to design broadband
solar absorber with simple planar structure consisting of an ultrathin absorbing layer separated
from the metallic substrate by a transparent layer. We explicitly identified by deriving a new formulism
that the absorbing material with refractive index proportional to the wavelength as well as extinction
coefficient independent of the wavelength, is the ideal building block to create ultrathin planar
broadband absorbers. To demonstrate the general strategy for naturally available absorbing materials
in both high-loss (refractory metals) and weak-absorption (2D materials) regimes, we leveraged
the bound-electron interband transition with a broad Lorentz oscillator peak to design a solar
thermal absorber based on a ultrathin Cr layer; and leveraged the strong exciton attributed to the
spin-orbit coupling for the spectrum near the band edge, and the bound-electron interband transition
for shorter wavelengths, to design a solar photovoltaic absorber based on a atomically thin MoS2
layer. Furthermore, our designed ultrathin broadband solar absorbers with planar structures
have comparable absorption properties compared to the absorbers with nanopatterns. Our proposed
design strategies pave the way to novel nanometer thick energy harvesting and optoelectronic devices
with simple planar structures.
