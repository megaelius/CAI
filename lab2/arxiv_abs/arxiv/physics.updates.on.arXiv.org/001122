We present a numerical study of noncolloidal spherical and rigid particles suspended in Newtonian,
shear thinning and shear thickening fluids employing an Immersed Boundary Method. We consider
a linear Couette configuration to explore a wide range of solid volume fractions ($0.1\le \Phi \le
0.4$) and particle Reynolds Numbers ($0.1\le Re_p \le 10$). We report the distribution of solid
and fluid phase velocity and solid volume fraction and show that close to the boundaries inertial
effects result in a significant slip velocity between the solid and fluid phase. The local solid
volume fraction profiles indicate particle layering close to the walls, which increases with the
nominal $\Phi$. This feature is associated with the confinement effects. We calculate the probability
density function of local strain rates and compare their mean value with the values estimated from
the homogenization theory of \cite{Chateau08}, indicating a reasonable agreement in the Stokesian
regimes. Both the mean value and standard deviation of the local strain rates increase primarily
with the solid volume fraction and secondarily with the $Re_p$. The wide spectrum of the local shear
rate and its dependency on $\Phi$ and $Re_p$ points to the deficiencies of the mean value of the local
shear rates in estimating the rheology of these noncolloidal complex suspensions. Finally, we
show that in the presence of inertia, the effective viscosity of these noncolloidal suspensions
deviates from that of Stokesian suspensions. We discuss how inertia affects the microstructure
and provide a scaling argument to give a closure for the suspension shear stress for both Newtonian
and power-law suspending fluids. The stress closure is valid for moderate particle Reynolds numbers,
$ O(Re_p)\sim 10$.
