In recent years, machine learning has been adopted to complex networks, but most existing works
concern about the structural properties. To use machine learning to detect phase transitions and
accurately identify the critical transition point associated with dynamical processes on complex
networks thus stands out as an open and significant problem. Here we develop a framework combining
supervised and unsupervised learning, incorporating proper sampling of training data set. In
particular, using epidemic spreading dynamics on complex networks as a paradigmatic setting,
we start from supervised learning alone and identify situations that degrade the performance.
To overcome the difficulties leads to the idea of exploiting confusion scheme, effectively a combination
of supervised and unsupervised learning. We demonstrate that the scheme performs well for identifying
phase transitions associated with spreading dynamics on homogeneous networks, but the performance
deteriorates for heterogeneous networks. To strive to meet this challenge leads to the realization
that sampling the training data set is necessary for heterogeneous networks, and we test two sampling
methods: one based on the hub nodes together with their neighbors and another based on k-core of the
network. The end result is a general machine learning framework for detecting phase transition
and accurately identifying the critical transition point, which is robust, computationally efficient,
and universally applicable to complex networks of arbitrary size and topology. Extensive tests
using synthetic and empirical networks verify the virtues of the articulated framework, opening
the door to exploiting machine learning for understanding, detection, prediction, and control
of complex dynamical systems in general.
