The CMS drift tubes (DT) muon detector, built for withstanding the LHC expected integrated and instantaneous
luminosities, will be used also in the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) at a 5 times larger instantaneous
luminosity and, consequently, much higher levels of radiation, reaching about 10 times the LHC
integrated luminosity. Initial irradiation tests of a spare DT chamber at the CERN gamma irradiation
facility (GIF++), at large ($\sim$O(100)) acceleration factor, showed ageing effects resulting
in a degradation of the DT cell performance. However, full CMS simulations have shown almost no impact
in the muon reconstruction efficiency over the full barrel acceptance and for the full integrated
luminosity. A second spare DT chamber was moved inside the GIF++ bunker in October 2017. The chamber
was being irradiated at lower acceleration factors, and only 2 out of the 12 layers of the chamber
were switched at working voltage when the radioactive source was active, being the other layers
in standby. In this way the other non-aged layers are used as reference and as a precise and unbiased
telescope of muon tracks for the efficiency computation of the aged layers of the chamber, when set
at working voltage for measurements. An integrated dose equivalent to two times the expected integrated
luminosity of the HL-LHC run has been absorbed by this second spare DT chamber and the final impact
on the muon reconstruction efficiency is under study. Direct inspection of some extracted aged
anode wires presented a melted resistive deposition of materials. Investigation on the outgassing
of cell materials and of the gas components used at the GIF++ are underway. Strategies to mitigate
the ageing effects are also being developed. From the long irradiation measurements of the second
spare DT chamber, the effects of radiation in the performance of the DTs expected during the HL-LHC
run will be presented.
