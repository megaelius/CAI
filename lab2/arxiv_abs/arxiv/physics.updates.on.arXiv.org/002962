We present a thorough analysis of symmetry breaking observed in Hartree-Fock (HF) solutions of
fullerenes C$_{60}$, C$_{36}$, and C$_{20}$ in order to characterize the nature of electron correlation
in them. Our analysis is based on (1) the critical regularization strength to restore symmetry breaking
in the recently developed regularized orbital optimized second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation
theory ($\kappa$-OOMP2), (2) singlet-triplet gaps from various MP2 methods, and (3) natural orbital
occupation numbers from restricted coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (RCCSD) and coupled-cluster
valence bond with singles and doubles (CCVB-SD). Based on these three independent probes, we conclude
that C$_{36}$ (D$_\text{6h}$) exhibits genuine strong correlation and symmetry breaking whereas
C$_{60}$ exhibits {\it artificial} HF symmetry breaking and is not strongly correlated. Investigating
the critical regularization strength, we discuss strong correlation in C$_{20}$ at the Jahn-Teller
distorted geometries (C$_\text{2h}$, D$_\text{2h}$, C$_\text{i}$, and D$_\text{3h}$) and
the I$_\text{h}$ geometry. Only C$_{20}$ (I$_\text{h}$) was found to be strongly correlated while
others exhibit {\it artificial} HF symmetry breaking. This analysis highlights a useful feature
of the recommended $\kappa$-OOMP2 method. It is an electronic structure method that describes
dynamic correlation, and attenuates strong correlation in MP2 towards zero by regularization.
Therefore, $\kappa$-OOMP2 will exhibit symmetry breaking in its reference determinant only when
correlation is strong (i.e., essential symmetry breaking). Artificial symmetry breaking (arising
in HF due to neglect of dynamic correlation) is thus removed in $\kappa$-OOMP2.
