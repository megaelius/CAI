Dynamic community detection provides a coherent description of network clusters over time, allowing
one to track the growth and death of communities as the network evolves. However, modularity maximization,
a popular method for performing multilayer community detection, requires the specification of
an appropriate null model as well as resolution and interlayer coupling parameters. Importantly,
the ability of the algorithm to accurately detect community evolution is dependent on the choice
of these parameters. In functional temporal networks, where evolving communities reflect changing
functional relationships between network nodes, it is especially important that the detected
communities reflect any state changes of the system. Here, we present analytical work suggesting
that a uniform null model provides improved sensitivity to the detection of small evolving communities
in temporal correlation networks. We then propose a method for increasing the sensitivity of modularity
maximization to state changes in nodal dynamics by modeling self-identity links between layers
based on the self-similarity of the network nodes between layers. This method is more appropriate
for functional temporal networks from both a modeling and mathematical perspective, as it incorporates
the dynamic nature of network nodes. We motivate our method based on applications in neuroscience
where network nodes represent neurons and functional edges represent similarity of firing patterns
in time. Finally, we show that in simulated data sets of neuronal spike trains, updating interlayer
links based on the firing properties of the neurons provides superior community detection of evolving
network structure when group of neurons change their firing properties over time.
