The molecular dipole moment is a central quantity in chemistry. It is essential in predicting infrared
spectra, sum-frequency generation spectra, and long-range electrostatic interactions. Furthermore,
it can be extracted directly -- via the ground state electron density -- from high-level quantum
mechanical calculations, making it an ideal target for machine learning. We choose to represent
this quantity with a physically-inspired ML model that captures two distinct physical effects:
local atomic polarization is captured within the symmetry-adapted Gaussian process regression
(SA-GPR) framework, which assigns a (vector) dipole moment to each atom, while movement of charge
across the entire molecule is captured by assigning a partial (scalar) charge to each atom. These
"MuML" models are fitted together to reproduce molecular dipole moments computed by high-level
coupled-cluster theory (CCSD) on the QM7b dataset, achieving more accurate results due to the physics-inspired
combination of these complementary terms. The combined model shows excellent transferability
to a showcase dataset of larger molecules, approaching the accuracy of DFT at a small fraction of
the computational cost. The ultimate performance -- and the optimal weighting of their combination
-- depend, however, on the details of the system at hand, with the scalar model being clearly superior
when describing large molecules whose dipole is almost entirely generated by charge separation.
These observations point to the importance of simultaneously accounting for the local and non-local
effects that contribute to the molecular dipole moment; further, they define a challenging task
to benchmark future models, particularly those aimed at the description of condensed phases.
