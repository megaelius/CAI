We report on recent progress in the physical and numerical modeling of compressible two-phase flows
that involve phase transition between the liquid and gaseous state of the fluid. The high-speed
dynamics of cavitation bubbles is studied in well-resolved simulations (DNS) with a sharp-interface
numerical model on a micro scale. The underlying assumption of the employed evaporation/condensation
model is that phase change occurs in thermal non-equilibrium and that the associated timescale
is larger than that of the wave dynamics. Results for the collapse of a spherical vapor bubble close
to a solid wall are discussed for three different bubble-wall configurations. The major challenge
for such numerical investigations is to accurately reproduce the dynamics of the interface between
liquid and vapor during the entire collapse process, including the high-speed dynamics of the late
stages, where compressibility of both phases plays a decisive role. Direct interface resolving
simulations are intractable for real world technical applications such as turbulent flows involving
cavitation clouds with millions of vapor bubbles and a wide range of time and length scales. For this
reason, we developed a coarse grained model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent two-phase
flows with cavitation. In LES, vapor bubbles constitute sub-grid scales that have to be modeled
accordingly. On the grid scale, we solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a homogeneous
mixture of liquid and vapor. For deriving an appropriate equation of state, we assume that the characteristic
time scale of phase change is much smaller than the numerical time step and that phase change is isentropic
and in mechanical equilibrium at the saturation pressure. This macroscopic model is applied to
realistic technical problems and to more generic flows to study the mutual interaction of turbulence
and cavitation.
