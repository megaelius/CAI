Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS) possess locally minimized surface area under the constraint
of periodic boundary conditions. Different families of surfaces were obtained with different
topologies satisfying such conditions. Examples of such families include Primitive (P), Gyroid
(G) and Diamond (D) surfaces. From a purely mathematical subject, TPMS have been recently found
in materials science as optimal geometries for structural applications. Proposed by Mackay and
Terrones in 1991, schwarzites are 3D crystalline porous carbon nanocrystals exhibiting the shape
of TPMS. Although their complex topology poses serious limitations on their synthesis with conventional
nanoscale fabrication methods, such as Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD), TPMS can be fabricated
by Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques, such as 3D Printing. In this work, we used an optimized
atomic model of a schwarzite structure from the D family (D8bal) to generate a surface mesh that was
subsequently used for 3D-printing through Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). This D schwarzite
was 3D-printed with thermoplastic PolyLactic Acid (PLA) polymer filaments. Mechanical properties
under uniaxial compression were investigated for both the atomic model and the 3D-printed one.
Fully atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were also carried out to investigate the uniaxial
compression behavior of the D8bal atomic model. Mechanical testings were performed on the 3D-printed
schwarzite where the deformation mechanisms were found to be similar to those observed in MD simulations.
These results are suggestive of a scale-independent mechanical behavior that is dominated by structural
topology.
