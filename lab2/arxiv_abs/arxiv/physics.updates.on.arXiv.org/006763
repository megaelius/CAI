Nepal has a topographically diverse terrain with variations from plain flatland to high hills and
mountains within a small region. Due to the lack of abundant ground-based measurement sites, it
is difficult to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) covering most of the areas of Nepal from lower
to higher elevations. In this study, we proposed to use a remote sensing-based METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration
at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration) model for estimating ET in Nepal. Landsat 8 imagery,
which provides a fine spatial resolution (30 m), was used for the estimation. The results obtained
from the METRIC model were compared with ground-based measurements from an independent Eddy-Covariance
(EC) station. Besides ET, the estimated surface temperatures (Ts) from the remote sensing model
were also compared with ground-based measurements for model validation. The results obtained
from the remote sensing model were close to the ground-based measurements which establish the accuracy
of the model. Root mean square error (RMSE) for hourly and daily ET was obtained as 0.06 mm/hr and 1.24
mm/day while mean bias error (MBE) for hourly and daily ET was observed as 0.03 mm/hr and 0.29 mm/day,
respectively. Further, we analyzed the variations of ET with elevation for six different months
and found that ET was inversely related to elevation, in general, over the regions of Nepal. This
was established as an effect of Ts and vegetation distribution over different elevations. To the
best of our knowledge, our study is a first that has investigated ET estimation over a topographically
diverse region of Nepal with fine spatial resolution afforded by Landsat 8. Such large-scale ET
estimation in Nepal has several applications. This can be leveraged for agricultural planning
and forecasting in a country where most of the population still relies on agriculture for their daily
livelihood.
