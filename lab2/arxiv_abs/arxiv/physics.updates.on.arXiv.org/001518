In this paper, a new fractional step method is proposed for simulating stiff and nonstiff chemically
reacting flows. In stiff cases, a well-known spurious numerical phenomenon, i.e. the incorrect
propagation speed of discontinuities, may be produced by general fractional step methods due to
the under-resolved discretization in both space and time. The previous random projection method
has been successfully applied for stiff detonation capturing in under-resolved conditions. Not
to randomly project the intermediate state into two presumed equilibrium states (completely burnt
or unburnt) as in the random projection method, the present study is to randomly choose the time-dependent
advance or stop of a reaction process. Each one-way reaction has been decoupled from the multi-reaction
kinetics using operator splitting and the local smeared temperature due to numerical dissipation
of shock-capturing schemes is compared with a random one within two limited temperatures corresponding
to the advance and its inverse states, respectively, to control the random reaction. The random
activation or deactivation in the reaction step is thus promising to correct the deterministic
accumulative error of the propagation of discontinuities. Extensive numerical experiments,
including model problems and realistic reacting flows in one and two dimensions, demonstrate this
expectation as well as the effectiveness and robustness of the method. Meanwhile, for nonstiff
problems when spatial and temporal resolutions are fine, the proposed random method recovers the
results as general fractional step methods, owing to the increasing possibility of activation
with diminishing randomness by adding a shift term.
