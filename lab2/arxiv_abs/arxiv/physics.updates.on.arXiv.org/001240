A comprehensive monitoring system for the thermal environment inside the Borexino neutrino detector
was developed and installed in order to reduce uncertainties in determining temperatures throughout
the detector. A complementary thermal management system limits undesirable thermal couplings
between the environment and Borexino's active sections. This strategy is bringing improved radioactive
background conditions to the region of interest for the physics signal thanks to reduced fluid mixing
induced in the liquid scintillator. Although fluid-dynamical equilibrium has not yet been fully
reached, and thermal fine-tuning is possible, the system has proven extremely effective at stabilizing
the detector's thermal conditions while offering precise insights into its mechanisms of internal
thermal transport. Furthermore, a Computational Fluid-Dynamics analysis has been performed,
based on the empirical measurements provided by the thermal monitoring system, and providing information
into present and future thermal trends. A two-dimensional modeling approach was implemented in
order to achieve a proper understanding of the thermal and fluid-dynamics in Borexino. It was optimized
for different regions and periods of interest, focusing on the most critical effects that were identified
as influencing background concentrations. Literature experimental case studies were reproduced
to benchmark the method and settings, and a Borexino-specific benchmark was implemented in order
to validate the modeling approach for thermal transport. Finally, fully-convective models were
applied to understand general and specific fluid motions impacting the detector's Active Volume.
