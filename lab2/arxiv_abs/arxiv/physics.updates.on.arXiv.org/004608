In recent years, numerical weather prediction models have begun to show notable levels of skill
at predicting the average winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) when initialised one month ahead.
At the same time, these model predictions exhibit unusually low signal-to-noise ratios, in what
has been dubbed a `signal-to-noise paradox'. We analyse both the skill and signal-to-noise ratio
of the Integrated Forecast System (IFS), the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts
(ECMWF) model, in an ensemble hindcast experiment. Specifically, we examine the contribution
to both from the regime dynamics of the North Atlantic eddy-driven jet. This is done by constructing
a statistical model which captures the predictability inherent to to the trimodal jet latitude
system, and fitting its parameters to reanalysis and IFS data. Predictability in this regime system
is driven by interannual variations in the persistence of the jet latitude regimes, which determine
the preferred state of the jet. We show that the IFS has skill at predicting such variations in persistence:
because the position of the jet strongly influences the NAO, this automatically generates skill
at predicting the NAO. We show that all of the skill the IFS has at predicting the winter NAO over the
period 1980-2010 can be attributed to its skill at predicting regime persistence in this way. Similarly,
the tendency of the IFS to underestimate regime persistence can account for the low signal-to-noise
ratio, giving a possible explanation for the signal-to-noise paradox. Finally, we examine how
external forcing drives variability in jet persistence, as well as highlight the role played by
transient baroclinic eddy feedbacks to modulate regime persistence.
