In lean premixed combustors, flame stabilization is an important operational concern that can
affect efficiency, robustness and pollutant formation. The focus of this paper is on flame lift-off
and re-attachment to the nozzle of a swirl combustor. Using time-resolved experimental measurements,
a data-driven approach known as cluster-based reduced order modeling (CROM) is employed to 1) isolate
key flow patterns and their sequence during the flame transitions, and 2) formulate a forecasting
model to predict the flame instability. The flow patterns isolated by the CROM methodology confirm
some of the experimental conclusions about the flame transition mechanism. In particular, CROM
highlights the key role of the precessing vortex core (PVC) in the flame detachment process in an
unsupervised manner. For the attachment process, strong flow recirculation far from the nozzle
appears to drive the flame upstream, thus initiating re-attachment. Different data-types (velocity
field, OH concentration) were processed by the modeling tool, and the predictive capabilities
of these different models are also compared. It was found that the swirling velocity possesses the
best predictive properties, which gives a supplemental argument for the role of the PVC in causing
the flame transition. The model is tested against unseen data and successfully predicts the probability
of flame transition (both detachment and attachment) when trained with swirling velocity with
minimal user input. The model trained with OH-PLIF data was only successful at predicting the flame
attachment, which implies that different physical mechanisms are present for different types
of flame transition. Overall, these aspects show the great potential of data-driven methods, particularly
probabilistic forecasting techniques, in analyzing and predicting large-scale features in complex
turbulent combustion problems.
