Purpose: To evaluate the influence of ADMIRE algorithm on image texture and image visual impression
as a supplement to measurements of common image quality parameters such as noise levels and spatial
resolution. Methods: An ACR phantom was examined at different radiation dose levels. To characterize
the image texture, two Haralick texture parameters, contrast and entropy, for different dose level
and reconstruction algorithms were assessed. The visual impression of images and their structural
differences were evaluated using the structural similarity index (SSIM). Noise was determined
for all dose and AMIRE levels and compared to those by filtered back projection (FBP). The spatial
resolution was determined by the modulation transfer functions and the line spread function. Results:
The Haralick texture parameters decreased with increasing ADMIRE levels I up to V. ADMIRE III, IV
and V offered a comparable contrast and entropy to those calculated by FBP with a radiation dose reduction
up to 50%. SSIM improved with increasing ADMIRE levels. SSIM calculated by ADMIRE IV and V showed
similar values by the filter back projection with a dose decrease up to 50%. Spatial resolution was
retained up to 90% dose reduction. With increasing ADMIRE as well as dose level the noise distribution
shifted to a more narrow distribution, which was in accordance with the reconstructed images using
ADMIRE. Conclusion: Texture analysis and SSIM allow a more realistic assessment of the dose reduction
potential of iterative reconstruction algorithms than quality metrics only based on physical
measurements of noise distribution or spatial resolution. This work presented that by means of
the ADMIRE algorithm, a comparable image quality at reduced radiation doses can be reached.
