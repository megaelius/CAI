We present model for anisotropic compact star under the general theory of relativity of Einstein.
In the study a 4-dimensional spacetime has been considered which is embedded into the 5-dimensional
flat metric so that the spherically symmetric metric has class 1 when the condition $e^{\lambda}=\left(\,1+C\,e^{\nu}
\,{\nu'}^2\,\right)$ is satisfied ($\lambda$ and $\nu$ being the metric potentials along with
a constant $C$). A set of solutions for the field equations are found depending on the index $n$ involved
in the physical parameters. The interior solutions have been matched smoothly at the boundary of
the spherical distribution to the exterior Schwarzschild solution which necessarily provides
values of the unknown constants. We have chosen the values of $n$ as $n=2$ and $n$=10 to 20000 for which
interesting and physically viable results can be found out. The numerical values of the parameters
and arbitrary constants for different compact stars are assumed in the graphical plots and tables
as follows: (i) LMC X-4 : $a=0.0075$, $b=0.000821$ for $n=2$ and $a=0.0075$, $nb=0.00164$ for $n\ge
10$, (ii) SMC X-1: $a=0.00681$, $b=0.00078$ for $n=2$, and $a=0.00681$, $nb=0.00159$ for $n \ge
10$. The investigations on the physical features of the model include several astrophysical issues,
like (i) regularity behavior of stars at the centre, (ii) well behaved condition for velocity of
sound, (iii) energy conditions, (iv) stabilty of the system via the following three techniques
- adiabatic index, Herrera cracking concept and TOV equation, (v) total mass, effective mass and
compactification factor and (vi) surface redshift. Specific numerical values of the compact star
candidates LMC X-4 and SMC X-1 are calculated for central and surface densities as well as central
pressure to compare the model value with actual observational data.
