A pore network modeling (PNM) framework for the simulation of transport of charged species, such
as ions, in porous media is presented. It includes the Nernst-Planck (NP) equations for each charged
species in the electrolytic solution in addition to a charge conservation equation which relates
the species concentration to each other. Moreover, momentum and mass conservation equations are
adopted and there solution allows for the calculation of the advective contribution to the transport
in the NP equations. The proposed framework is developed by first deriving the numerical model equations
(NMEs) corresponding to the partial differential equations (PDEs) based on several different
time and space discretization schemes, which are compared to assess solutions accuracy. The derivation
also considers various charge conservation scenarios, which also have pros and cons in terms of
speed and accuracy. Ion transport problems in arbitrary pore networks were considered and solved
using both PNM and finite element method (FEM) solvers. Comparisons showed an average deviation,
in terms of ions concentration, between PNM and FEM below $5\%$ with the PNM simulations being over
${10}^{4}$ times faster than the FEM ones for a medium including about ${10}^{4}$ pores. The improved
accuracy is achieved by utilizing more accurate discretization schemes for both the advective
and migrative terms, adopted from the CFD literature. The NMEs were implemented within the open-source
package OpenPNM based on the iterative Gummel algorithm with relaxation. This work presents a comprehensive
approach to modeling charged species transport suitable for a wide range of applications from electrochemical
devices to nanoparticle movement in the subsurface.
