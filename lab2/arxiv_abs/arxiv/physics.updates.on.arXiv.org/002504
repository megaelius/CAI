Transitions between low-lying electron states in atoms of heavy elements lead to electromagnetic
radiation with discrete energies between about 0.1 keV and 100 keV (x rays) that are characteristic
of the element. Moseley's law -- an empirical relation first described by Mosely in 1914 which supported
predictions of the then-new Bohr model of atomic energy levels while simultaneously identifying
the integer atomic number Z as the measure of nuclear charge--predicts that the energy of these characteristic
x rays scales as Z^2. The foundational nature of Moseley's experiment has led to the popularity of
Moseley's law measurements in undergraduate advanced laboratory physics subjects. We report
here observations of deviations from Moseley's law in the characteristic K_alpha x-ray emission
of 13 elements ranging from Z = 29 to Z = 92. While following the square-law predictions of the Bohr
model fairly well at low Z, the deviations become larger with increasing Z (p < 10^1000 by a chi^2 test).
We find that relativistic models of atomic structure are necessary to fit the full range of atomic
numbers observed (p = 0.23 for the relativistic Bohr model). As has been argued by previous authors,
measurements of the relativistic deviations from Moseley's law are both pedagogically valuable
at the advanced laboratory level and accessible with modern but modest apparatus. Here, we show
that this pedagogical value can be be extended even further-- to higher Z elements, where the effects
are more dramatically observable--using apparatus which is enhanced relative to more modest versions,
but nevertheless still accessible for many teaching laboratories.
