A flow vessel with an elastic wall can deform significantly due to viscous fluid flow within it, even
at vanishing Reynolds number (no fluid inertia). Deformation leads to an enhancement of throughput
due to the change in cross-sectional area. The latter gives rise to a non-constant pressure gradient
in the flow-wise direction and, hence, to a nonlinear flow rate--pressure drop relation (unlike
the Hagen--Poiseuille law for a rigid tube). Many biofluids are non-Newtonian, and are well approximated
by generalized Newtonian (say, power-law) rheological models. Consequently, we analyze the problem
of steady low Reynolds number flow of a generalized Newtonian fluid through a slender elastic tube
by coupling fluid lubrication theory to a structural problem posed in terms of Donnell shell theory.
A perturbative approach (in the slenderness parameter) yields analytical solutions for both the
flow and the deformation. Using matched asymptotics, we obtain a uniformly valid solution for the
tube's radial displacement, which features both a boundary layer and a corner layer caused by localized
bending near the clamped ends. In doing so, we obtain a ``generalized Hagen--Poiseuille law'' for
soft microtubes. We benchmark the mathematical predictions against three-dimensional two-way
coupled direct numerical simulations (DNS) of flow and deformation performed using the commercial
computational engineering platform by ANSYS. The simulations show good agreement and establish
the range of validity of the theory. Finally, we discuss the implications of the theory on the problem
of the flow-induced deformation of a blood vessel, which is featured in some textbooks.
