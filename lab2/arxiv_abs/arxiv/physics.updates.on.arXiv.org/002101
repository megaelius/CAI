Polaritons are compositional light-matter quasiparticles that arise as a result of strong coupling
between a vacuum field of a resonant optical cavity and electronic excitations in quantum emitters.
Reaching such a regime is often hard, as it requires materials possessing high oscillator strengths
to interact with the relevant optical mode. Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) have recently emerged as promising candidates for realization of the strong coupling regime
at room temperature. However, these materials typically provide coupling strengths in the range
of 10-40 meV, which may be insufficient for reaching strong coupling with low quality factor resonators.
Here, we demonstrate a universal scheme that allows a straightforward realization of strong and
ultra-strong coupling regime with 2D materials and beyond. By intermixing plasmonic excitations
in nanoparticle arrays with excitons in a WS2 monolayer inside a resonant metallic microcavity,
we fabricate a hierarchical system with the combined Rabi splitting exceeding 500 meV at room temperature.
Photoluminescence measurements of the coupled systems show dominant emission from the lower polariton
branch, indicating the participation of excitons in the coupling process. Strong coupling has
been recently suggested to affect numerous optical- and material-related properties including
chemical reactivity, exciton transport and optical nonlinearities. With the universal scheme
presented here, strong coupling across a wide spectral range is within easy reach and therefore
exploring these exciting phenomena can be further pursued in a much broader class of materials.
