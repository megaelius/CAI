Graphene, the carbon monolayer and 2D allotrope of graphite, has the potential to impact technology
with a wide range of applications such as optical modulators for high-speed communications. In
contrast to modulation devices that rely on plasmonic or electronic effects, MEMS-based modulators
can have wider tuning ranges albeit at a lower operating frequency. These properties make electro-optic
mechanical modulators ideal for reflective-type display technologies as has been demonstrated
previously with SiN membranes in Interferometric MOdulator Displays (IMODs). Despite their low-power
consumption and performance in bright environments, IMODs suffer from low frame rates and limited
color gamut. Double-layer graphene (DLG) membranes grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can
also recreate the interference effect like in IMODs as proven with drumheads displaying Newton's
rings. Here, we report on the electro-optical response of CVD DLG mechanical pixels by measuring
the change in wavelength-dependent reflectance of a suspended graphene drumhead as a function
of electrical gating. We use a spectrometer to measure the wavelength spectrum at different voltages,
and find a good agreement with a model based on light interference. Moreover, to verify that gas compression
effects do not play an important role, we use a stroboscopic illumination technique to study the
electro-optic response of these graphene pixels at frequencies up to 400 Hz. Based on these findings,
we demonstrate a continuous full-spectrum reflective-type pixel technology with a Graphene Interferometric
MOdulator Display (GIMOD) prototype of 2500 pixels per inch (ppi) equivalent to more than 12K resolution.
