Friendship prediction is an important task in social network analysis (SNA). It can help users identify
friends and improve their level of activity. Most previous approaches predict users' friendship
based on their historical records, such as their existing friendship, social interactions, etc.
However, in reality, most users have limited friends in a single network, and the data can be very
sparse. The sparsity problem causes existing methods to overfit the rare observations and suffer
from serious performance degradation. This is particularly true when a new social network just
starts to form. We observe that many of today's social networks are composite in nature, where people
are often engaged in multiple networks. In addition, users' friendships are always correlated,
for example, they are both friends on Facebook and Google+. Thus, by considering those overlapping
users as the bridge, the friendship knowledge in other networks can help predict their friendships
in the current network. This can be achieved by exploiting the knowledge in different networks in
a collective manner. However, as each individual network has its own properties that can be incompatible
and inconsistent with other networks, the naive merging of all networks into a single one may not
work well. The proposed solution is to extract the common behaviors between different networks
via a hierarchical Bayesian model. It captures the common knowledge across networks, while avoiding
negative impacts due to network differences. Empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed
approach improves the mean average precision of friendship prediction over state-of-the-art
baselines on nine real-world social networking datasets significantly.
