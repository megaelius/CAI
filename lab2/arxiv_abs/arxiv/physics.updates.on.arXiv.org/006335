Satellite imaging of night light provides a global record of lighted development from 1992 to present.
Not all settlements can be detected with night light, but the continuum of built environments where
a rapidly growing majority of the population lives generally can. Segmenting a continuous field
into discrete spatially contiguous subsets of pixels produces a spatial network in which each contiguous
segment represents a distinct network component. Representing the continuum of lighted development
as spatial networks of varying spatial connectivity allows the generative conditions for power
law network structure to be applied in a spatial context to provide a general explanation for similar
scaling observed in settlements and other land cover types. This study introduces a novel methodology
to combine complementary sources of satellite-derived night light observations to quantify the
evolution of the global spatial network structure of lighted development from 1992 to 2015. Area-perimeter
distributions of network components show multifractal scaling with larger components becoming
increasingly tortuous. Rank-size distributions of network components are linear and well described
by power laws with exponents within 0.08 of -1 for all 27 subsets of geography, year and degree of connectivity
- indicating robust scaling properties. Area distributions of luminance within network components
show an abrupt transition from continuously low-skewed for smaller components to discontinuous,
nearly uniform luminance distributions for larger components, suggesting a fundamental change
in network structure despite a continuum of size and shape. These results suggest that city size
scaling, observed inconsistently for administratively-defined city populations, is more consistent
for physically-defined settlement network area and can be explained more simply by a spatial network
growth process.
