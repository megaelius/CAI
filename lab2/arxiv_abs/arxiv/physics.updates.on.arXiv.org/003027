The existence of large nonlinear optical coefficients is one of the preconditions for using nonlinear
optical materials in nonlinear optical devices. For a crystal, such large coefficients can be achieved
by matching photon energies with resonant energies between different bands, and so the details
of the crystal band structure play an important role. Here we demonstrate that large third-order
nonlinearities can also be generally obtained by a different strategy: As any of the incident frequencies
or the sum of any two or three frequencies approaches zero, the doped or excited populations of electronic
states lead to divergent contributions in the induced current density. We refer to these as intraband
divergences, by analogy with the behavior of Drude conductivity in linear response. Physically,
such resonant processes can be associated with a combination of inraband and interband optical
transitions. Current-induced second order nonlinearity, coherent current injection, and jerk
currents are all related to such divergences, and we find similar divergences in degenerate four
wave mixing and cross-phase modulation under certain conditions. These divergences are limited
by intraband relaxation parameters, and lead to a large optical response from a high quality sample;
we find they are very robust with respect to variations in the details of the band structure. To clearly
track all of these effects, we analyze gapped graphene, describing the electrons as massive Dirac
fermions; under the relaxation time approximation, we derive analytic expressions for the third
order conductivities, and identify the divergences that arise in describing the associated nonlinear
phenomena.
