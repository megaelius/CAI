Evolutionary games on graphs have been extensively studied. A variety of graph structures, graph
dynamics, and behaviours of replicators have been explored. These models have primarily been studied
in the framework of facilitation of cooperation, and much previous research has shed light on this
field of study. However, there has been little attention devoted to truncation selection as most
models employ proportional selection (such as in the replicator equation) or `imitate the best.'
Here we systematically explore truncation selection on periodic square lattices, where replicators
below a fitness threshold are culled and the reproduction probabilities are equal for all survivors.
We employ two variations of this method: independent truncation, where the threshold is fixed;
and dependent truncation, which is a generalization of `imitate the best.' Further, we explore
the effects of diffusion in our networks in the following orders of operation: contest-diffusion-offspring
(CDO), and diffusion-contest-offspring (DCO). CDO and DCO frequently facilitate and diminish
cooperation, respectively. For independent truncation, we find three regimes determined by the
fitness threshold: cooperation decreases as we raise the threshold; polymorphisms and extinction
can occur; and the entire population goes extinct. Further, we show how an intermediate sucker's
payoff maximizes cooperation in the DCO independent truncation model. We find that dependent truncation
affects games differently; lower levels reduce cooperation for the Hawk Dove game and increase
it for the Stag Hunt, and higher levels produce the opposite effects. We compare these truncation
methods to proportional selection, and show that they can facilitate cooperation. We conclude
that truncation selection can impact the prevalence of cooperation in complex ways, and therefore
merit further study.
