Medical devices with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) modulating functionality are highly desirable
to restore tissue homeostasis in critical inflammation states, such as chronic wounds, rotator
cuff tears and cancer. The introduction of MMP-modulating functionality in such devices is typically
achieved via loading of either rapidly-diffusing chelating factors, e.g. EDTA, or MMP-cleavable
substrates, raising issues in terms of non-controllable pharmacokinetics and enzymatic degradability,
respectively. Aiming to accomplish inherent, long-term, device-induced MMP regulation, this
study investigated the synthesis of a hydroxamic acid (HA)-methacrylated collagen conjugate
as the building block of a soluble factor-free MMP-modulating hydrogel network with controlled
enzymatic degradability. This was realised via a two-step synthetic route: (i) type I collagen
was functionalised with photonetwork-inducing methacrylic anhydride (MA) adducts; (ii) this
methacrylated product was activated with a water-soluble carbodiimide prior to reaction with
hydroxylamine, resulting in MMP-chelating HA functions. Nearly-quantitative methacrylation
of collagen amines was observed via 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) assay. The molar
content of HA adducts was indirectly quantified via conversion of remaining carboxyl functions
into ethylenediamine (EDA), so that 12-16 mol.% HA was revealed in the conjugate. Resulting UV cured,
HA-bearing collagen hydrogels proved to induce up to ~13 and ~32 RFU% activity reduction of MMP-9
and MMP-3, respectively, following 4-day incubation in vitro. No hydrogel-induced toxic response
was observed following 4-day culture of G292 cells. The novel synthetic strategies described in
this work provide a new insight into the systematic chemical manipulation of collagen materials
aiming at the design of biomimetic, inflammation-responsive medical devices.
