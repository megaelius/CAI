This article puts forward a model of the formation of the universe, whose essential novel ingredient
is a pre-Universe reservoir $\mathrm{R_U}$ with neither space nor time dimensions, in interaction
with the universe U. U results from a process of apparition of spacetime entities emanating from
the ur-elements in $\mathrm{R_U}$. The analysis of this apparition relies on a few principles like
the second law and the principle of conservation of energy, applied to the thermodynamic system
U $\cup\ \mathrm{R_U}$, which is closed. The principle of conservation of energy does not apply
to U alone. The second law must be understood as ruling the transfer of entropy from $\mathrm{R_U}$
to U, which is as small as one bit i.e., $k_B \ln 2$ per spacetime entity. In this context, it is shown
that the pressure $p$ of the Universe is negative and that time and space are decoupled. We interpret
the spacetime entities as elementary black holes (EBHs) at a Planckian scale (their entropy of one
bit as resulting from quantum entanglement?). These EBHs with a constant entropy $k_B\ln 2$ own
possibly various angular momenta and electric charges; their statistics obeys a Boltzmann distribution,
if one considers the rotating and charged EBHs as high energy states of the Schwarzschild EBH. Assuming
that the total mass-energy of the EBHs appeared up to the present epoch is the total mass-energy of
the observable universe, $\approx 35.3\times10^{53}$ kg, we find $T\approx 4.1\ T_P$, a temperature
interpreted as the temperature of apparition of the EBHs. Incidentally this model gives a possible
explanation to non-local interactions, through the hidden presence of $\mathrm{R_U}$, in reason
of the absence of time and space.
