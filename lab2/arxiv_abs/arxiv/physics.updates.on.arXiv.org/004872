Potentiostatic impedance spectroscopy (IS) is a well stablished characterization technique
for elucidating the electric resistivity and capacitive features of materials and devices. In
the case of solar cells, by applying a small voltage perturbation the current signal is recorded
and the recombination processes and defect distributions are among the typical outcomes in IS studies.
In this work a photo-impedance approach, named light intensity modulated impedance spectroscopy
(LIMIS), is first tested in all-solid-state photovoltaic cells by recording the individual photocurrent
(IMPS) and photovoltage (IMVS) responsivity signals due to a small light perturbation at open-circuit
(OC), and combining them: LIMIS=IMVS/IMPS. The experimental LIMIS spectra from silicon, organic,
and perovskite solar cells are presented and compared with IS. An analysis of the equivalent circuit
numerical models for total resistive and capacitive features is discussed. Our theoretical findings
show a correction to the lifetimes evaluations by obtaining the total differential resistances
and capacitances combining IS and LIMIS measurements. This correction addresses the discrepancies
among different techniques, as shown with transient photovoltage. The experimental differences
between IS and LIMIS (i) proves the unviability of the superposition principle, (ii) suggest a bias-dependent
photo-current correction to the empirical Shockley equation of the steady-state current at different
illumination intensities around OC and (iii) are proposed as a potential figure of merit for characterizing
performance and stability of solar cells. In addition, new features are reported for the low-frequency
capacitance of perovskite solar cells, measured by IS and LIMIS.
