Two of the most successful methods that are presently available for simulating the quantum dynamics
of condensed phase systems are centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) and ring polymer molecular dynamics
(RPMD). Despite their conceptual differences, practical implementations of these methods differ
in just two respects: the choice of the Parrinello-Rahman mass matrix and whether or not a thermostat
is applied to the internal modes of the ring polymer during the dynamics. Here we explore a method
which is halfway between the two approximations: we keep the path integral bead masses equal to the
physical particle masses but attach a Langevin thermostat to the internal modes of the ring polymer
during the dynamics. We justify this by showing analytically that the inclusion of an internal mode
thermostat does not affect any of the desirable features of RPMD: thermostatted RPMD (TRPMD) is
equally valid with respect to everything that has actually been proven about the method as RPMD itself.
In particular, because of the choice of bead masses, the resulting method is still optimum in the
short-time limit, and the transition state approximation to its reaction rate theory remains closely
related to the semiclassical instanton approximation in the deep quantum tunneling regime. In
effect, there is a continuous family of methods with these properties, parameterised by the strength
of the Langevin friction. Here we explore numerically how the approximation to quantum dynamics
depends on this friction, with a particular emphasis on vibrational spectroscopy. We find that
a broad range of frictions approaching optimal damping give similar results, and that these results
are immune to both the resonance problem of RPMD and the curvature problem of CMD.
