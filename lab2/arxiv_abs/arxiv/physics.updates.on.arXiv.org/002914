Brain cognitive functions arise through the coordinated activity of several brain regions, which
actually form complex dynamical systems operating at multiple frequencies. These systems often
consist of interacting subsystems, whose characterization is of importance for a complete understanding
of the brain interaction processes. To address this issue, we present a technique, namely the bispectral
Pairwise Interacting Source Analysis (biPISA), for analyzing systems of cross-frequency interacting
brain sources when multichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) or magnetoencephalographic
(MEG) data are available. Specifically, the biPISA allows to identify one or many subsystems of
cross-frequency interacting sources by decomposing the antisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra
between EEG or MEG signals, based on the assumption that interactions are pairwise. Thanks to the
properties of the antisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra, biPISA is also robust to spurious
interactions arising from mixing artifacts, i.e. volume conduction or field spread, which always
affect EEG or MEG functional connectivity estimates. This method is an extension of the Pairwise
Interacting Source Analysis (PISA), which was originally introduced for investigating interactions
at the same frequency, to the study of cross-frequency interactions. The effectiveness of this
approach is demonstrated in simulations for up to three interacting source pairs, and for real MEG
recordings of spontaneous brain activity. Simulations show that the performances of biPISA in
estimating the phase difference between the interacting sources are affected by the increasing
level of noise rather than by the number of the interacting subsystems. The analysis of real MEG data
reveals an interaction between two pairs of sources of central mu and beta rhythms, localizing in
the proximity of the left and right central sulci.
