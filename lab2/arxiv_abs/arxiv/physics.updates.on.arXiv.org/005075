In its permanent quest of mechanobiological homeostasis, our vascula-ture significantly adapts
across multiple length and time scales in various physiological and pathological conditions.
Computational modeling of vascular growth and remodeling (G\&R) has significantly improved our
insights of the mechanobio-logical processes of diseases such as hypertension or aneurysms. However,
patient-specific computational modeling of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) evolution,
based on finite-element models (FEM), remains a challenging scientific problem with rare contributions,
despite the major significance of this topic of research. Challenges are related to complex boundary
conditions and geometries combined with layer-specific G\&R responses. To address these challenges,
in the current paper, we employed the constrained mixture model (CMM) to model the arterial wall
as a mixture of different constituents such as elastin, collagen fiber families and smooth muscle
cells (SMCs). Implemented in Abaqus as a UMAT, this first patient-specific CMM-based FEM of G\&R
in human ATAA was first validated for canonical problems such as single-layer thick-wall cylindrical
and bi-layer thick-wall toric arterial geometries. Then it was used to predict ATAA evolution for
a patient-specific aortic geometry, showing that the typical shape of an ATAA can be simply produced
by elastin proteolysis localized in regions of deranged hemodymanics. The results indicate a transfer
of stress to the adventitia by elastin loss and continuous adaptation of the stress distribution
due to change of ATAA shape. Moreover, stress redistribution leads to collagen deposition where
the maximum elastin mass is lost, which in turn leads to stiffening of the arterial wall. As future
work, the predictions of this G\&R framework will be validated on datasets of patient-specific
ATAA geometries followed up over a significant number of years.
