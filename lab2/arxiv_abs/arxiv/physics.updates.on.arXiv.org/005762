In-situ observations in the Earth's and Saturn's magnetosheaths and in the solar wind reveal the
presence of Alfv\'en vortices as intermittent structures in the range of scales from fluid lengths
down to few ion lengths. The density and the magnetic field associated with them appear to be compressible
for higher plasma betas. Until now, only incompressible Alfv\'en vortices have been known. Motivated
by space plasma observations we develop a new model of magnetic vortices in high-beta plasmas with
anisotropic temperature, possessing compressible density and magnetic field, whose typical
size ranges from fluid to ion scales. At magneto-fluid scales we find novel non-propagating field-aligned
cylindrical monopoles and inclined propagating dipoles. Their transverse magnetic and velocity
fluctuations are aligned, but not identical, {and they exhibit density and compressible magnetic
field fluctuations $\delta n$ and $\delta B_\Vert$ localized inside the vortex core. In the presence
of thermal anisotropy and acoustic effects, they may be correlated or anti-correlated $\delta
n/\delta B_\Vert={\rm constant}\gtrless 0$; fluctuations whose velocity along the magnetic
field is below the ion thermal speed are always correlated.} At ion or kinetic scales (with the smallest
radii $\sim c/\omega_{pi}, \rho_{L i}$) {and in the absence of acoustic perturbations}, only dipolar
Alfv\'en vortices survive with similar properties as those at fluid scales, except for their $\delta
n/n_0$ that reaches the level of $\delta B_\Vert/B_0$. At kinetic scales we find also pressure balanced
dipolar structures, possessing finite parallel electric field $E_\Vert$ and purely compressional
magnetic field perturbation.
