An essential ingredient of turbulent flows is the vortex stretching mechanism, which emanates
from the non-linear interaction of vorticity and strain-rate tensor and leads to formation of extreme
events. We analyze the statistical correlations between vorticity and strain rate by using a massive
database generated from very well resolved direct numerical simulations of forced isotropic turbulence
in periodic domains. The grid resolution is up to $12288^3$, and the Taylor-scale Reynolds number
is in the range $140-1300$. In order to understand the formation and structure of extreme vorticity
fluctuations, we obtain statistics conditioned on enstrophy (vorticity-squared). The magnitude
of strain, as well as its eigenvalues, is approximately constant when conditioned on weak enstrophy;
whereas they grow approximately as power laws for strong enstrophy, which become steeper with increasing
$R_\lambda$. We find that the well-known preferential alignment between vorticity and the intermediate
eigenvector of strain tensor is even stronger for large enstrophy, whereas vorticity shows a tendency
to be weakly orthogonal to the most extensive eigenvector (for large enstrophy). Yet the dominant
contribution to the production of large enstrophy events arises from the most extensive eigendirection,
the more so as $R_\lambda$ increases. Nevertheless, the stretching in intense vorticity regions
is significantly depleted, consistent with the kinematic properties of weakly-curved tubes in
which they are organized. Further analysis reveals that intense enstrophy is primarily depleted
via viscous diffusion, though viscous dissipation is also significant. Implications for modeling
are nominally addressed as appropriate.
