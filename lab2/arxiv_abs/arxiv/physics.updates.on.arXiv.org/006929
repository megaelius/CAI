Models are often given in terms of differential equations to represent physical systems. In the
presence of uncertainty, accurate prediction of the behavior of these systems using the models
requires understanding the effect of uncertainty in the response. In uncertainty quantification,
statistics such as mean and variance of the response of these physical systems are sought. To estimate
these statistics sampling-based methods like Monte Carlo often require many evaluations of the
models' governing equations for multiple realizations of the uncertainty. However, for large
complex engineering systems, these methods become computationally burdensome. In structural
engineering, often an otherwise linear structure contains spatially local nonlinearities with
uncertainty present in them. A standard nonlinear solver for them with sampling-based methods
for uncertainty quantification incurs significant computational cost for estimating the statistics
of the response. To ease this computational burden of uncertainty quantification of large-scale
locally nonlinear dynamical systems, a method is proposed herein, which decomposes the response
into two parts -- response of a nominal linear system and a corrective term. This corrective term
is the response from a pseudoforce that contains the nonlinearity and uncertainty information.
In this paper, neural network, a recently popular tool for universal function approximation in
the scientific machine learning community due to the advancement of computational capability
as well as the availability of open-sourced packages like PyTorch and TensorFlow is used to estimate
the pseudoforce. Since only the nonlinear and uncertain pseudoforce is modeled using the neural
networks the same network can be used to predict a different response of the system and hence no new
network is required to train if the statistic of a different response is sought.
