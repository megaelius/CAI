Solar wind charge-changing reactions are of paramount importance to the physico-chemistry of
the atmosphere of a comet. The ESA/Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) provides
a unique opportunity to study charge-changing processes in situ. To understand the role of these
reactions in the evolution of the solar wind plasma, and interpret the complex in-situ measurements
made by Rosetta, numerical or analytical models are necessary. We use an extended analytical formalism
describing solar wind charge-changing processes at comets along solar wind streamlines. The model
is driven by solar wind ion measurements from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium-Ion Composition Analyzer
(RPC-ICA) and neutral density observations from the Rosetta Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis-Comet
Pressure Sensor (ROSINA-COPS), as well as charge-changing cross sections of hydrogen and helium
particles in a water gas. A mission-wide overview of charge-changing efficiencies at comet 67P
is presented. Electron capture cross sections dominate and favor the production of He and H energetic
neutral atoms, with fluxes expected to rival those of H+ and He2+ ions. Neutral outgassing rates
are retrieved from local RPC-ICA flux measurements, and match ROSINA's estimates very well. From
the model, we find that solar wind charge exchange is unable to fully explain the magnitude of the
sharp drop of solar wind ion fluxes observed by Rosetta for heliocentric distances below 2.5 AU.
This is likely because the model does not take into account the relative ion dynamics and, to a lesser
extent, ignore the formation of bow shock-like structures upstream of the nucleus. This work also
shows that the ionization by solar EUV radiation and energetic electrons dominates the source of
cometary ions, although solar wind contributions may be significant during isolated events.
