Centuries of effort to improve imaging has focused on perfecting and combining lenses to obtain
better optical performance, such as achromatic lenses, and new functionalities, such as microscopy.
The arrival of nanotechnology has now enabled thin subwavelength-structured surfaces called
metalenses, which promise to make imaging devices more compact. However, unaddressed by this promise
is the space between the lenses, which is crucial for image formation but takes up by far the most room
in imaging systems. Here, we address this issue by presenting the concept and demonstration of an
optical 'spaceplate' that effectively propagates light for a length that can be considerably longer
than the plate thickness. Such propagation compression produces signatures that we experimentally
observe in three common situations in optics: first, in the focusing of a beam; second, in the transverse
translation of a beam incident at an angle; and lastly, in image formation. Whereas metalenses and
essentially all other optical components act on the complex light field at each transverse position
(i.e., locally), a spaceplate operates directly on the transverse momentum of the field (i.e.,
non-locally). Specifically, the spaceplate reproduces the Fourier transfer function that describes
the propagation of light through a homogeneous isotropic dielectric slab (e.g., a slab of vacuum)
by shifting the optical phase as a function of the wave's direction. This concept promises to dramatically
compress the length of all imaging systems and opens the possibility for ultra-thin flat monolithic
cameras. It also breaks the current constraint between image sensor size and field-of-view and,
thus, between pixel size and image resolution, enabling ultra-large pixels for high-sensitivity.
