Experiments on fluid systems in micro-/nano-scale solid conveyors have shown a violation of the
no-slip assumption that have been adopted by the classical fluid mechanics. To correct this mechanics
for the fluid slip, various approaches have been proposed to determine the slip boundary conditions.
However, these approaches have revealed contradictory results for a variety of systems, and a debate
on the mechanisms and the conditions of the fluid slip/no-slip past solid surfaces is sustained
for a long time. In this paper, we establish the hybrid continuum-molecular modeling (HCMM) as a
general approach of modeling the fluid slip flow under the influence of excess fluid-solid molecular
interactions. This modeling approach postulates that fluids flow over solid surfaces with/without
slip depending on the difference between the applied impulse on the fluid and a drag due to the excess
fluid-solid molecular interactions. In the HCMM, the Navier-Stokes equations are corrected for
the excess fluid-solid interactions. Measures of the fluid-solid interactions are incorporated
into the fluid viscosity. We demonstrate that the correction of the fluid mechanics by the slip boundary
conditions is not an accurate approach, as the fluid-solid interactions would impact the fluid
internally. To show the effectiveness of the proposed HCMM, it is implemented for water flow in nanotubes.
The HCMM is validated by an extensive comparison with over 90 cases of experiments and molecular
dynamics simulations of different fluid systems. We foresee that the hybrid continuum-molecular
modeling of the fluid slip flow will find many important implementations in fluid mechanics.
