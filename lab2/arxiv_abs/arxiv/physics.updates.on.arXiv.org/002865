Determination of the thermal properties of a material is an important task in many scientific and
engineering applications. How a material behaves when subjected to high or fluctuating temperatures
can be critical to the safety and longevity of a system's essential components. The laser flash experiment
is a well-established technique for indirectly measuring the thermal diffusivity, and hence the
thermal conductivity, of a material. In previous works, optimization schemes have been used to
find estimates of the thermal conductivity and other quantities of interest which best fit a given
model to experimental data. Adopting a Bayesian approach allows for prior beliefs about uncertain
model inputs to be conditioned on experimental data to determine a posterior distribution, but
probing this distribution using sampling techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can
be incredibly computationally intensive. This difficulty is especially true for forward models
consisting of time-dependent partial differential equations. We pose the problem of determining
the thermal conductivity of a material via the laser flash experiment as a Bayesian inverse problem
in which the laser intensity is also treated as uncertain. We introduce a parametric surrogate model
that takes the form of a stochastic Galerkin finite element approximation, also known as a generalized
polynomial chaos expansion, and show how it can be used to sample efficiently from the approximate
posterior distribution. This approach gives access not only to the sought-after estimate of the
thermal conductivity but also important information about its relationship to the laser intensity,
and information for uncertainty quantification. We also investigate the effects of the spatial
profile of the laser on the estimated posterior distribution for the thermal conductivity.
