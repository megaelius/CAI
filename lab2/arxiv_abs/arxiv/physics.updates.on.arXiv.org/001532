This article describes the future P2 parity-violating electron scattering facility at the upcoming
MESA accelerator in Mainz. The physics program of the facility comprises indirect, high precision
search for physics beyond the Standard Model, measurement of the neutron distribution in nuclear
physics, single-spin asymmetries stemming from two-photon exchange and a possible future extension
to the measurement of hadronic parity violation. The first measurement of the P2 experiment aims
for a high precision determination of the weak mixing angle to a precision of 0.14% at a four-momentum
transfer of Q^2 = 4.5 10^{-3} GeV^2. The accuracy is comparable to existing measurements at the Z
pole. It comprises a sensitive test of the standard model up to a mass scale of 50 TeV, extendable to
70 TeV. This requires a measurement of the parity violating cross section asymmetry -39.94 10^{-9}
in the elastic electron-proton scattering with a total accuracy of 0.56 10^-9 (1.4 %) in 10,000 h
of 150 \micro A polarized electron beam impinging on a 60 cm liquid H_2 target allowing for an extraction
of the weak charge of the proton which is directly connected to the weak mixing angle. Contributions
from gamma Z-box graphs become small at the small beam energy of 155 MeV. The size of the asymmetry
is the smallest asymmetry ever measured in electron scattering with an unprecedented goal for the
accuracy. We report here on the conceptual design of the P2 spectrometer, its Cherenkov detectors,
the integrating read-out electronics as well as the ultra-thin, fast tracking detectors. There
has been substantial theory work done in preparation of the determination of the weak mixing angle.
The further physics program in particle and nuclear physics is described as well.
