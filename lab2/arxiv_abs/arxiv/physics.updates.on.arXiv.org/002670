Sea ripples are small-scale bedforms which originate from the interaction of an oscillatory flow
with an erodible sand bed. The phenomenon of sea ripple formation is investigated by means of direct
numerical simulation in which the sediment bed is represented by a large number of fully-resolved
spherical grains. Two sets of parameter values are adopted which are motivated by laboratory experiments
on the formation of laminar rolling-grain ripples. The knowledge on the origin of ripples is presently
enriched by insights and by providing fluid- and sediment-related quantities that are difficult
to obtain in the laboratory. Detailed analysis of flow and sediment bed evolution has confirmed
that ripple wavelength is determined by the action of steady recirculating cells which tend to accumulate
sediment grains into ripple crests. The ripple amplitude is observed to grow exponentially consistent
with established linear stability analysis theories. Particles at the bed surface exhibit two
kinds of motion depending on their position with respect to the recirculating cells: particles
at ripple crests are significantly faster and show larger excursions than those lying on ripple
troughs. In analogy with segregation phenomenon of polydisperse sediments the non-uniform distribution
of the velocity field promotes the formation of ripples. The wider the gap between the excursion
of fast and slow particles, the the larger the resulting growth rate of ripples. Finally, it is revealed
that, in the absence of turbulence, the sediment flow rate is driven by both the bed shear stress and
the wave-induced pressure gradient, the dominance of each depending on the phase of the oscillation
period. In phases of maximum bed shear stress, the sediment flow rate correlates more with the Shields
number while the pressure gradient tends to drive sediment bed motion during phases of minimum bed
shear stress.
