Gaseous microemboli (GME) introduced during cardiac surgery are considered as a potential source
of morbidity, which has driven the development of the first bubble counters. Two new generation
bubble counters claim correct sizing and counting of GME. This in-vitro study aims to validate the
accuracy of two bubble counters using monodisperse bubbles in a highly controlled setting at low
GME concentrations. Monodisperse GME with a radius of 43 {\mu}m were produced in a microfluidic
chip. Directly after their formation, they were injected one-by-one into the BCC200 and the EDAC
sensors. GME size and count were optically verified using high-speed imaging. During best-case
scenarios or low GME concentrations of GME with a size of 43 {\mu}m in radius in an in-vitro setup,
the BCC200 overestimates GME size by a factor of 2 to 3 while the EDAC underestimates the average GME
size by at least a factor of two. The BCC200 overestimates the GME concentration by approximately
20% while the EDAC overestimates the concentration by nearly one order of magnitude. Nevertheless,
the calculated total GME volume is only over-predicted by a factor 2 since the EDAC underestimates
the actual GME size. For the BCC200, the total GME volume was over-predicted by 25 times due to the
over-estimation of GME size. The measured errors in the absolute sizing/counting of GME do not imply
that all results obtained using the bubble counters are insignificant or invalid. A relative change
in bubble size or bubble concentration can accurately be measured. However, care must be taken in
the interpretation of the results and their absolute values. Moreover, the devices cannot be used
interchangeably when reporting GME activity. Nevertheless, both devices can be used to study the
relative air removal characteristics of CPB components or for the quantitative monitoring of GME
production during CPB interventions.
