Controlling the spread of COVID-19 - even after a licensed vaccine is available - requires the effective
use of non-pharmaceutical interventions: physical distancing, limits on group sizes, mask wearing,
etc. To date, such interventions have neither been uniformly nor systematically implemented in
most countries. For example, even when under strict stay-at-home orders, numerous jurisdictions
granted exceptions and/or were in close proximity to locations with entirely different regulations
in place. Here, we investigate the impact of such geographic inconsistencies in epidemic control
policies by coupling search and mobility data to a simple mathematical model of SARS-COV2 transmission.
Our results show that while stay-at-home orders decrease contacts in most areas of the US, some specific
activities and venues often see an increase in attendance. Indeed, over the month of March 2020,
between 10 and 30% of churches in the US saw increases in attendance; even as the total number of visits
to churches declined nationally. This heterogeneity, where certain venues see substantial increases
in attendance while others close, suggests that closure can cause individuals to find an open venue,
even if that requires longer-distance travel. And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churches
in the US rose by 13% over the same period. Strikingly, our model reveals that across a broad range
of model parameters, partial measures can often be worse than none at all where individuals not complying
with policies by traveling to neighboring areas can create epidemics when the outbreak would otherwise
have been controlled. Taken together, our data analysis and modelling results highlight the potential
unintended consequences of inconsistent epidemic control policies and stress the importance
of balancing the societal needs of a population with the risk of an outbreak growing into a large epidemic.
