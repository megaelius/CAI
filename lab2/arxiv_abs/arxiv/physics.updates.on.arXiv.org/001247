We theoretically investigate long-range interactions between an excited $L$ state He atom and
two identical $S$ state He atoms, for the cases of the three atoms all in spin singlet states or all
in spin triplet states, denoted by He($n_0\,^{\lambda}S$)-He($n_0\,^{\lambda}S$)-He($n_0^{\prime}\,^{\lambda}L$),
with $n_0$ and $n_0'$ principal quantum numbers, $\lambda=1$ or 3 the spin multiplicity, and $L$
the orbital angular momentum of a He atom. Using degenerate perturbation theory for the energies
up to second-order, we evaluate the coefficients $C_3$ of the first order dipolar interactions
and the coefficients $C_6$ and $C_8$ of the second order additive and nonadditive interactions.
Both the dipolar and dispersion interaction coefficients, for these three-body degenerate systems,
show dependences on the geometrical configurations of the three atoms. The nonadditive interactions
start to appear in second-order. To demonstrate the results and for applications, the obtained
coefficients $C_n$ are evaluated with highly accurate variationally-generated nonrelativistic
wave functions in Hylleraas coordinates for He($1\,^{1}S$)-He($1\,^{1}S$)-He($2\,^{1}S$),
He${(1\,^{1}S)}$-He${(1\,^{1}S)}$-He${(2\,^{1}P)}$, He${(2\,^{1}S)}$-He${(2\,^{1}S)}$-He${(2\,^{1}P)}$,
and He${(2\,^{3}S)}$-He${(2\,^{3}S)}$-He${(2\,^{3}P)}$. The calculations are given for three
like-nuclei for the cases of hypothetical infinite mass He nuclei, and of real finite mass $^4{}$He
or $^3{}$He nuclei. The special cases of the three atoms in equilateral triangle configurations
are explored in detail, and for the cases where one of the atoms is in a $P$ state, we also present results
for the atoms in an isosceles right triangle configuration or in an equally spaced co-linear configuration.
The results can be applied to construct potential energy surfaces for three helium atom systems.
