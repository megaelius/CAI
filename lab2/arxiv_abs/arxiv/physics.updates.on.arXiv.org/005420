A self-contained shallow-water theory is proposed for interfacial gravity waves comprising strong
hydraulic jumps in the two-layer system bounded by a rigid lid. The theory is based on a locally conservative
form of momentum equation which contains a free parameter $\alpha.$ This parameter defines the
relative contribution of each layer to the pressure at the interface and reflects the non-uniqueness
of the shallow-water momentum conservation law which is inherently entangled with the circulation
conservation law in the system of fixed height. Only discontinuous solutions which do not conserve
circulation are affected by $\alpha.$ This is the case with hydraulic jumps which conserve momentum
and mass. The respective Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions are found to be mathematically equivalent
to the classical front conditions which were commonly thought to be outside shallow-water theory
and derivable only by various control-volume approximations. In contrast to control-volume approach,
no phenomenological or poorly defined concepts like the head loss or energy dissipation in separate
layers are required in the shallow-water theory. Dimensional arguments suggest $\alpha$ to depend
on the density ratio. For nearly equal densities, both layers are expected to affect the interfacial
pressure with approximately equal weight coefficients which corresponds to $\alpha\approx0.$
The front propagation velocities for $\alpha=0$ agree well with experimental and numerical results
in a wide range of bore strengths. A remarkably better agreement with high-accuracy numerical results
is achieved by $\alpha=\sqrt{5}-2,$ which corresponds to a self-organised critical state produced
by unstable gravity current collapsing to the largest stable front height.
