Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) is an important computational tool in physics and chemistry. In contrast
to standard Monte Carlo, KMC permits the description of time dependent dynamical processes and
is not restricted to systems in equilibrium. Recently KMC has been applied successfully in modelling
of novel energy materials such as Lithium-ion batteries and solar cells. We consider general solid
state systems which contain free, interacting particles which can hop between localised sites
in the material. The KMC transition rates for those hops depend on the change in total potential energy
of the system. For charged particles this requires the frequent calculation of electrostatic interactions,
which is usually the bottleneck of the simulation. To avoid this issue and obtain results in reasonable
times, many studies replace the long-range potential by a short range approximation. This, however,
leads to systematic errors and unphysical results. On the other hand standard electrostatic solvers
such as Ewald summation or fast Poisson solvers are highly inefficient or introduce uncontrollable
systematic errors at high resolution. In this paper we describe how the Fast Multipole Method by
Greengard and Rokhlin can be adapted to overcome this issue by dramatically reducing computational
costs. We exploit the fact that each update in the transition rate calculation corresponds to a single
particle move and changes the configuration only by a small amount. This allows us to construct an
algorithm which scales linearly in the number of charges for each KMC step, something which had not
been deemed to be possible before. We demonstrate the performance and parallel scalability of the
method by implementing it in a performance portable software library. We describe the high-level
Python interface of the code which makes it easy to adapt to specific cases.
