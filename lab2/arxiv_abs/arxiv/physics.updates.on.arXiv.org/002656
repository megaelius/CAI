In this paper, a novel lattice Boltzmann (LB) model based on the Allen-Cahn phase-field theory is
proposed for simulating axisymmetric multiphase flows. The most striking feature of the model
is that it enables to handle multiphase flows with large density ratio, which are unavailable in
all previous axisymmetric LB models. The present model utilizes two LB evolution equations, one
of which is used to solve fluid interface, and another is adopted to solve hydrodynamic properties.
To simulate axisymmetric multiphase flows effectively, the appropriate source term and equilibrium
distribution function are introduced into the LB equation for interface tracking, and simultaneously,
a simple and efficient forcing distribution function is also delicately designed in the LB equation
for hydrodynamic properties. Unlike many existing LB models, the source and forcing terms of the
model arising from the axisymmetric effect include no additional gradients, and consequently,
the present model contains only one non-local phase field variable, which in this regard is much
simpler. We further conducted the Chapman-Enskog analysis to demonstrate the consistencies of
our present MRT-LB model with the axisymmetric Allen-Cahn equation and hydrodynamic equations.
A series of numerical examples, including static droplet, oscillation of a viscous droplet, breakup
of a liquid thread, and bubble rising in a continuous phase, are used to test the performance of the
proposed model. It is found that the present model can generate relatively small spurious velocities
and can capture interfacial dynamics with higher accuracy than the previously improved axisymmetric
LB model. Besides, it is also found that our present numerical results show excellent agreement
with analytical solutions or available experimental data for a wide range of density ratios, which
highlights the strengths of the proposed model.
