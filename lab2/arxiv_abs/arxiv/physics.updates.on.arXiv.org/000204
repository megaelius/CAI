Site-specific flow and turbulence information are needed for various practical applications,
ranging from aerodynamic/aeroelastic modeling for wind turbine design to optical diffraction
calculations. Even though highly desirable, collecting on-site meteorological measurements
can be an expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes a challenging task. In this work, we propose
a coupled mesoscale-large-eddy modeling framework to synthetically generate site-specific
flow and turbulence data. The workhorses behind our framework are a state-of-the-art, open-source
atmospheric model called the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and a tuning-free large-eddy
simulation (LES) model. Using this coupled framework, we simulate a nighttime stable boundary
layer (SBL) case from the well-known CASES-99 field campaign. One of the unique aspects of this work
is the usage of a diverse range of observations for characterization and validation. The coupled
models reproduce certain characteristics of observed low-level jets. They also capture various
scaling regimes of energy spectra, including the so-called spectral gap. However, the coupled
models are unable to capture the intermittent nature of the observed surface fluxes. Lastly, we
document and discuss: (i) the tremendous spatio-temporal variabilities of observed and modeled
SBL flow fields, and (ii) the significant disagreements among different observational platforms.
Based on these results, we strongly recommend that future SBL modeling studies consider rigorous
validation exercises based on multi-sensor/multi-platform datasets. In summary, we believe
that the numerical generation of realistic SBL is not an impossible task. Without any doubt, there
remain several computational and fundamental challenges. The present work should be viewed as
a first step to confront some of these challenges.
