Despite the nonlinear nature of turbulence, there is evidence that the energy-injection mechanisms
sustaining wall turbulence can be ascribed to linear processes. Different scenarios stem from
linear stability theory and comprise exponential instabilities of the mean flow, neutral modes,
transient growth from non-normal operators, and parametric instabilities from temporal mean-flow
variations, among others. These mechanisms, each potentially capable of leading to the observed
turbulence structure, are rooted in simplified theories and conceptual arguments. Whether the
flow follows any or a combination of them remains unclear. Here, we devise a collection of numerical
experiments in which the Navier-Stokes equations are sensibly modified to quantify the role of
the different linear mechanisms at low Reynolds number ($Re_\tau\approx180$). We do this by DNS
of turbulent channel flows, in which the energy transfer from the streamwise-averaged mean-flow
($\boldsymbol{U}$) to the fluctuating velocities ($\boldsymbol{u}'$) is constrained to preclude
a targeted linear mechanism. In contrast to other studies, our approach allows for direct evaluation
of cause-and-effect links between the linear energy injection from $\boldsymbol{U}$ to $\boldsymbol{u}'$
in a fully nonlinear setup. We show that turbulence persists when exponential instabilities of
the mean flow are suppressed. Removing all exponential instabilities only reduces the turbulent
fluctuations by 10%. We also show that the energy transfer from $\boldsymbol{U}$ to $\boldsymbol{u}'$
via transient growth alone, without exponential or parametric instabilities, suffices to sustain
turbulence. Finally, we demonstrate that a collection of simulations with frozen-in-time $\boldsymbol{U}$
that only support transient growth provides a faithful representation of the actual time-varying
energy transfer from $\boldsymbol{U}$ to $\boldsymbol{u}'$.
