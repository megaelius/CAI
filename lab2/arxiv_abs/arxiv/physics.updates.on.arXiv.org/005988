Travel time tomography for the velocity structure of a medium is a highly non-linear and non-unique
inverse problem. Monte Carlo methods are becoming increasingly common choices to provide probabilistic
solutions to tomographic problems but those methods are computationally expensive. Neural networks
can often be used to solve highly non-linear problems at a much lower computational cost when multiple
inversions are needed from similar data types. We present the first method to perform fully non-linear,
rapid and probabilistic Bayesian inversion of travel time data for 2D velocity maps using a mixture
density network. We compare multiple methods to estimate probability density functions that represent
the tomographic solution, using different sets of prior information and different training methodologies.
We demonstrate the importance of prior information in such high dimensional inverse problems due
to the curse of dimensionality: unrealistically informative prior probability distributions
may result in better estimates of the mean velocity structure, however the uncertainties represented
in the posterior probability density functions then contain less information than is obtained
when using a less informative prior. This is illustrated by the emergence of uncertainty loops in
posterior standard deviation maps when inverting travel time data using a less informative prior,
which are not observed when using networks trained on prior information that includes (unrealistic)
a priori smoothness constraints in the velocity models. We show that after an expensive program
of training the networks, repeated high-dimensional, probabilistic tomography is possible on
timescales of the order of a second on a standard desktop computer.
