During the course of an epidemic, individuals constantly make decisions on how to fight against
epidemic spreading. Collectively, these individual decisions are critical to the global outcome
of the epidemic, especially when no pharmaceutical interventions are available. However, existing
epidemic models lack the ability to capture this complex decision-making process, which is shaped
by an interplay of factors including government-mandated policy interventions, expected socio-economic
costs, perceived infection risks and social influences. Here, we introduce a novel parsimonious
model, grounded in evolutionary game theory, able to capture decision-making dynamics over heterogeneous
time scales. Using real data, we analyse three case studies in the spreading of gonorrhoea, the 1918--19
Spanish flu and COVID-19. Behavioural factors shaping the course of the epidemic are intelligibly
mapped onto a minimal set of model parameters, and their interplay gives rise to characteristic
phenomena, such as sustained periodic outbreaks, multiple epidemic waves, or a successful eradication
of the disease. Our model enables a direct assessment of the epidemiological and socio-economic
impact of different policy interventions implemented to combat epidemic outbreaks. Besides the
common-sense finding that stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions are essential to taming
the initial phases of the outbreak, the duration of such interventions and the way they are phased
out are key for an eradication in the medium-to-long term. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that
social influence is a double-edged sword in the control of epidemics, helping strengthen collective
adoption of self-protective behaviours during the early stages of the epidemic, but then accelerating
their rejection upon lifting of non-pharmaceutical containment interventions.
