In this work we further advance theoretical investigation of radiation by the electric dipole under
the assumption that wavelength is much smaller than charge separation distance of an electric dipole,
which in turn is much smaller than a distance up to the point of observation. The electric dipole considered
in this paper is the one with fixed charge positions, but oscillating charge magnitudes. Specifically,
two cases were considered. In the first case phase delay between oscillations of the charge magnitudes
was taken into account. In the second case, opposite current wave travel direction was considered.
These results generalize the classical solution for electric dipole radiation, and they show that
under the above assumptions the electric dipole emits both long-range longitudinal electric and
transverse electromagnetic waves. Longitudinal and transverse electric fields emitted by the
electric dipole with current wave traveling in both directions are displayed for specific values
of the dipole system parameters. It was shown that under the standard assumptions that charge separation
distance is much smaller than wavelength and non-zero phase delay between charge oscillations:
a) our solution reduces to classical solution; b) transverse electromagnetic waves are dominant
while longitudinal electric waves are negligible; c) total radiated power is proportional to the
fourth degree of frequency and to the second degree of the charge separation distance. In case wavelength
is much smaller than charge separation distance: a) the classical solution is invalid and it overestimates
the total radiated power; b) longitudinal electric waves are dominant and transverse electromagnetic
waves are negligible; c) total radiated power is proportional to the third degree of frequency and
to the charge separation distance. All derived potential and force fields were summarized in the
table.
