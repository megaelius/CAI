This paper presents one of the case studies of the Gamma Factory initiative -- a proposal of a new operation
scheme of ion beams in the CERN accelerator complex. Its goal is to extend the scope and precision
of the LHC-based research by complementing the proton-proton collision programme with the high-luminosity
nucleus-nucleus one. Its numerous physics highlights include studies of the exclusive Higgs-boson
production in photon-photon collisions and precision measurements of the electroweak (EW) parameters.
There are two principal ways to increase the LHC luminosity which do not require an upgrade of the
CERN injectors: (1) modification of the beam-collision optics and (2) reduction of the transverse
emittance of the colliding beams. The former scheme is employed by the ongoing high-luminosity
(HL-LHC) project. The latter one, applicable only to ion beams, is proposed in this paper. It is based
on laser cooling of bunches of partially stripped ions at the SPS flat-top energy. For isoscalar
calcium beams, which fulfil the present beam-operation constrains and which are particularly
attractive for the EW physics, the transverse beam emittance can be reduced by a factor of $5$ within
the $8$ seconds long cooling phase. The predicted nucleon-nucleon luminosity of $L_{NN}= 4.2 \times
10^{34}\,$s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ for collisions of the cooled calcium beams at the LHC top energy is
comparable to the levelled luminosity for the HL-LHC proton-proton collisions, but with reduced
pile-up background. The scheme proposed in this paper, if confirmed by the future Gamma Factory
proof-of-principle experiment, could be implemented at CERN with minor infrastructure investments.
