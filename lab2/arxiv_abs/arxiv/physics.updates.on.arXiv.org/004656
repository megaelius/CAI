The dynamics of a passive scalar plume in a turbulent boundary layer is experimentally investigated
via vertical turbulent transport time-series. Data are acquired in a rough-wall turbulent boundary
layer that develops in a recirculating wind tunnel set-up. Two source sizes in an elevated position
are considered in order to investigate the influence of the emission conditions on the plume dynamics.
The analysis is focused on the effects of the meandering motion and the relative dispersion. First,
classical statistics are investigated. We found that (in accordance with previous studies) the
meandering motion is the main responsible for differences in the variance and intermittency, as
well as the kurtosis and power spectral density, between the two source sizes. On the contrary, the
mean and the skewness are slightly affected by the emission conditions. To characterize the temporal
structure of the turbulent transport series, the visibility algorithm is exploited to carry out
a complex network-based analysis. Two network metrics -- the average peak occurrence and the assortativity
coefficient -- are analysed, as they can capture the temporal occurrence of extreme events and their
relative intensity in the series. The effects of the meandering motion and the relative dispersion
of the plume are discussed in the view of the network metrics, revealing that a stronger meandering
motion is associated with higher values of both the average peak occurrence and the assortativity
coefficient. The network-based analysis advances the level of information of classical statistics,
by characterizing the impact of the emission conditions on the temporal structure of the signals
in terms of extreme events and their relative intensity. In this way, complex networks provide --
through the evaluation of network metrics -- an effective tool for time-series analysis of experimental
data.
