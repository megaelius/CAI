A joint experimental and numerical investigation of turbulent flame front anchoring at externally
heated walls is presented. The phenomenon is examined for lean hydrogen/air mixtures in a novel
burner design, which comprises a cylindrical burning chamber converging into a glass pipe as well
as a wall heating assembly at their intersection. The transparent part allows for optical OH* chemiluminescence
measurements serving as a basis for numerical validation. For a comprehensive numerical evaluation
the effect of heat loss on different hydrogen/air chemical reaction mechanisms is reviewed in a
preparatory one-dimensional flame study. The subsequent numerical investigation focuses on
the application of the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) as a turbulence-chemistry interaction model
in the realm of wall anchoring turbulent flames. All simulations are based on the Reynolds time-averaged
formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations and feature axisymmetric domains. The influence of
different two-equation turbulence models and EDC modeling constants are discussed. Since wall
heat transfer is responsible for ignition as well as quenching of the flame front, a special focus
is put on boundary layer resolving near-wall treatment. A qualitative comparison between simulations
and experiment is performed for multiple operating conditions. These are selected to display the
influence of equivalence ratio, bulk Reynolds number and unburnt mixture temperature. While the
choice of RANS-based turbulence model has a distinguishable impact, EDC modeling coefficients
exhibit a more significant influence on flame shape and length. It is only surpassed by the impact
of correct diffusion treatment on reacting lean hydrogen/air mixtures. To depict this behavior
as accurately as possible, full multicomponent diffusion treatment using the Maxwell-Stefan
equation is applied.
