Diffusion functional MRI (dfMRI) is a promising technique to map functional activations by acquiring
diffusion-weighed spin-echo images. In previous studies, dfMRI showed higher spatial accuracy
at activation mapping compared to classic functional MRI approaches. However, it remains unclear
whether dfMRI measures result from changes in the intra-/extracellular environment, perfusion
and/or T2 values. We designed an acquisition/quantification scheme to disentangle such effects
in the motor cortex during a finger tapping paradigm. dfMRI was acquired at specific diffusion weightings
to selectively suppress perfusion and free-water diffusion, then times series of the apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC-fMRI) and of the perfusion signal fraction (IVIM-fMRI) were derived.
ADC-fMRI provided ADC estimates sensitive to changes in perfusion and free-water volume, but not
to T2/T2* values. With IVIM-fMRI we isolated the perfusion contribution to ADC, while suppressing
T2 effects. Compared to conventional gradient-echo BOLD fMRI, activation maps obtained with dfMRI
and ADC-fMRI had smaller clusters, and the spatial overlap between the three techniques was below
50%. Increases of perfusion fractions were observed during task in both dfMRI and ADC-fMRI activations.
Perfusion effects were more prominent with ADC-fMRI than with dfMRI but were significant in less
than 25% of activation ROIs. Taken together, our results suggest that the sensitivity to task of
dfMRI derives from a decrease of hindered diffusion and an increase of the pseudo-diffusion signal
fraction, leading to different, more confined spatial activation patterns compared to classic
functional MRI.
