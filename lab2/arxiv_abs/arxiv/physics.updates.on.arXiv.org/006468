The nation-wide lockdown starting 25 March 2020, aimed at suppressing the spread of the COVID-19
disease, was extended until 31 May 2020 in three subsequent orders by the Government of India. The
extended lockdown has had significant social and economic consequences and `lockdown fatigue'
has likely set in. Phased reopening began from 01 June 2020 onwards. Mumbai, one of the most crowded
cities in the world, has witnessed both the largest number of cases and deaths among all the cities
in India (41986 positive cases and 1368 deaths as of 02 June 2020). Many tough decisions are going
to be made on re-opening in the next few days. In an earlier IISc-TIFR Report, we presented an agent-based
city-scale simulator(ABCS) to model the progression and spread of the infection in large metropolises
like Mumbai and Bengaluru. As discussed in IISc-TIFR Report 1, ABCS is a useful tool to model interactions
of city residents at an individual level and to capture the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions
on the infection spread. In this report we focus on Mumbai. Using our simulator, we consider some
plausible scenarios for phased emergence of Mumbai from the lockdown, 01 June 2020 onwards. These
include phased and gradual opening of the industry, partial opening of public transportation (modelling
of infection spread in suburban trains), impact of containment zones on controlling infections,
and the role of compliance with respect to various intervention measures including use of masks,
case isolation, home quarantine, etc. The main takeaway of our simulation results is that a phased
opening of workplaces, say at a conservative attendance level of 20 to 33\%, is a good way to restart
economic activity while ensuring that the city's medical care capacity remains adequate to handle
the possible rise in the number of COVID-19 patients in June and July.
