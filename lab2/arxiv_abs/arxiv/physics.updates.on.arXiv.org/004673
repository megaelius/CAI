Accurate estimates of historical changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and their uncertainties
are important for documenting and understanding historical changes in climate. A source of uncertainty
that has not previously been quantified in historical SST estimates stems from position errors.
A Bayesian inference framework is proposed for quantifying errors in reported positions and their
implications for SST estimates. The analysis framework is applied to data from ICOADS3.0 in 1885,
a time when astronomical and chronometer estimation of position was common, but predating the use
of radio signals. Focus is upon a subset of 943 ship tracks from ICOADS3.0 that report their position
every two hours to a precision of 0.01{\deg} longitude and latitude. These data are interpreted
as positions determined by dead reckoning that are periodically updated by celestial correction
techniques. The 90% posterior probability intervals for two-hourly dead reckoning uncertainties
are (9.90%, 11.10%) for ship speed and (10.43{\deg}, 11.92{\deg}) for ship heading, leading to
position uncertainties that average 0.29{\deg} (32 km on the equator) in longitude and 0.20{\deg}
(22 km) in latitude. Reported ship tracks also contain systematic position uncertainties relating
to precursor dead-reckoning positions not being updated after obtaining celestial position estimates,
indicating that more accurate positions can be provided for SST observations. Finally, we translate
position errors into SST uncertainties by sampling an ensemble of SSTs from MURSST data set. Evolving
technology for determining ship position, heterogeneous reporting and archiving of position
information, and seasonal and spatial changes in navigational uncertainty and SST gradients together
imply that accounting for positional error in SST estimates over the span of the instrumental record
will require substantial additional effort.
