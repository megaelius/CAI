We use numerical simulations to investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of the interface between
nematic (N) and isotropic (I) phases of a confined active liquid crystal. At low activities, a stable
interface is observed separating the active nematic and the isotropic states. At higher activities,
we found an interfacial instability beyond which dynamical interfacial states are observed. The
stable interface is generic, while the interfacial dynamical states differ for open and closed
channels. For nematics with planar interfacial anchoring and homeotropic channels, the velocity
of the interface at the NI transition increases from zero (i) linearly with the activity for contractile
systems and (ii) quadratically for extensile systems. In the former, the nematic order in the channel
increases while the order decreases in the latter. Since both the activity and the temperature can
favour the nematic or the isotropic states, for active systems in the stable regime the temperature
may be tuned to observe a static interface in the channel, providing an operational definition for
the coexistence of active nematic and isotropic phases. Beyond the stable regime, for extensile
systems in a slab geometry (nematic in the middle) an interfacial instability was observed. The
interface breaks the symmetry with respect to the middle of the channel and becomes distorted. At
higher activities, one pair of defects appears moving in and out of the interfaces. The motion of
these defects is regular and persists asymptotically. In a closed channel a similar instability
is observed although the symmetry of the single interface is not broken. We used an improved hybrid
model of finite differences and lattice Boltzmann method with multi-relaxation-time collision
operator, which was crucial to characterize the dynamics of the system.
