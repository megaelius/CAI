Reverse Osmosis Membrane (ROM) filtration systems are widely applied in wastewater recovery,
seawater desalination, landfill water treatment, etc. During filtration, the system performance
is dramatically affected by membrane fouling which causes a significant decrease in permeate flux
as well as an increase in the energy input required to operate the system. Design and optimization
of ROM filtration systems aim at reducing membrane fouling by studying the coupling between membrane
structure, local flow field, local solute concentration and foulant adsorption patterns. Yet,
current studies focus exclusively on oversimplified steady-state models that ignore any dynamic
coupling between the fluid dynamics and the transport through the membrane, while membrane design
still proceeds through trials and errors. In this work, we develop a model that couples the transient
Navier-Stokes and the Advection-Diffusion-Equations, as well as an adsorption-desorption equation
for the foulant accumulation, and we validate it against unsteady measurements of permeate flux
as well as steady-state spatial fouling patterns. Furthermore, we analytically show that, for
a straight channel, a universal scaling relationship exists between the Sherwood and Bejam numbers.
We then generalize this result to membranes subject to morphological and/or topological modifications.
We demonstrate that universal scaling behavior can be identified through the definition of a modified
Reynolds number, that accounts for the additional length scales introduced by the membrane modifications,
and a membrane performance index, which represents an aggregate efficiency measure with respect
to both clean permeate flux and energy input required to operate the system.
