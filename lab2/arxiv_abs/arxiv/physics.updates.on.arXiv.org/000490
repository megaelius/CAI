For a high energy electron facility, the estimates of induced radioactivity in materials are of
major importance to keep exposure to personnel and to the environment as low as reasonably achievable.
In addition, an accurate prediction of induced radioactivity is also essential for the design,
operation and decommissioning of a high energy electron linear accelerator. The research of induced
radioactivity focuses on the photonuclear reaction, whose giant resonance response in the copper
is ranging from 10 MeV to 28 MeV. The 200 MeV electron linac of NSRL is one of the earliest high-energy
electron linear accelerators in P. R. China. The electrons are accelerated to 200 MeV by five acceleration
tubes and collimated by the scrapers made of copper. At present, it is the first retired high-energy
electron linear accelerator in domestic. Its decommissioning provides an efficient way for the
induced radioactivity research of such accelerators, and is a matter of great significance to the
accumulation of the induced radioactivity experience. When the copper target is impacted by an
158 MeV electron beam, the number of photons generated whose energy are in the range of giant resonance
response is the largest. Thus, this paper focuses on the induced radioactivity for a copper target
impacted by the 158 MeV electron beam. The slicing method is applied in the research. The specific
activity of each slice was measured at cooling times of ten months and the results were compared with
the prediction from the Monte-Carlo program FLUKA. The simulation results are in good agreement
with the measurement results. The method by Monte Carlo simulation in this paper gives a reasonable
prediction of the induced radioactivity problem for the high-energy electron linear accelerators,
laying a foundation for the accumulation of the induced radioactivity experience.
