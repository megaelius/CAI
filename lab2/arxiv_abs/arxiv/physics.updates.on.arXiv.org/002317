In brittle fracture applications, failure paths, regions where the failure occurs and damage statistics,
are some of the key quantities of interest (QoI). High-fidelity models for brittle failure that
accurately predict these QoI exist but are highly computationally intensive, making them infeasible
to incorporate in upscaling and uncertainty quantification frameworks. The goal of this paper
is to provide a fast heuristic to reasonably estimate quantities such as failure path and damage
in the process of brittle failure. Towards this goal, we first present a method to predict failure
paths under tensile loading conditions and low-strain rates. The method uses a $k$-nearest neighbors
algorithm built on fracture process zone theory, and identifies the set of all possible pre-existing
cracks that are likely to join early to form a large crack. The method then identifies zone of failure
and failure paths using weighted graphs algorithms. We compare these failure paths to those computed
with a high-fidelity model called the Hybrid Optimization Software Simulation Suite (HOSS). A
probabilistic evolution model for average damage in a system is also developed that is trained using
150 HOSS simulations and tested on 40 simulations. A non-parametric approach based on confidence
intervals is used to determine the damage evolution over time along the dominant failure path. For
upscaling, damage is the key QoI needed as an input by the continuum models. This needs to be informed
accurately by the surrogate models for calculating effective modulii at continuum-scale. We show
that for the proposed average damage evolution model, the prediction accuracy on the test data is
more than 90\%. In terms of the computational time, the proposed models are $\approx \mathcal{O}(10^6)$
times faster compared to high-fidelity HOSS.
