Here a new chronocoulometric sensor, based on semiconducting 2H MoS2 nanosheets decorated with
a controlled density of monodispersed small gold nanoparticles, was fabricated via electrodeposition,
for the highly sensitive detection of miRNA-21. The size and interparticle spacing of AuNPs was
optimized by controlling nucleation and growth rates through tuning of deposition-potential
and Au-precursor concentration and by getting simultaneous feedback from morphological and electrochemical
activity studies. The sensing strategy, involved the selective immobilization of thiolated capture
probe DNA (CP) at AuNPs and hybridization of CP to a part of miRNA target, whereas the remaining part
of the target was complementary to a signaling non-labelled DNA sequence. Chronocoulometry provided
precise quantification of nucleic acids at each step of the sensor assay by interrogating [Ru(NH3)6]3+
electrostatically bound to phosphate backbones of oligonucleotides. A detailed and systematic
optimization study demonstrated that the thinnest and smallest MoS2 NSs improved the sensitivity
of the AuNP@MoS2 sensor achieving an impressive detection limit of 100 aM, which is 2 orders of magnitude
lower than that of bare Au electrode and also enhanced the DNA-miRNA hybridization efficiency by
25%. Such improved performance can be attributed to the controlled packing density of CPs achieved
by their self -assembly on AuNPs, large interparticle density, small size and the intimate coupling
between AuNPs and MoS2. Alongside the outstanding sensitivity, the sensor exhibited excellent
selectivity down to femtomolar concentrations, for discriminating complementary miRNA-21 target
in a complex system composed of different foreign targets including mismatched and non-complementary
miRNA-155. These advantages make our sensor a promising contender in the point of care miRNA sensor
family for medical diagnostics.
