Different simplified and detailed chemical models and their impact on simulations of combustion
regimes initiating by the initial temperature gradient in methane/air mixtures are studied. The
limits of the regimes of reaction wave propagation depend upon the spontaneous wave speed and the
characteristic velocities of the problem. The present study mainly focus to identify conditions
required for the development a detonation and to compare the difference between simplified chemical
models and detailed chemistry. It is shown that a widely used simplified chemical schemes, such
as one-step, two-step and other simplified models, do not reproduce correctly the ignition process
in methane/air mixtures. The ignition delay times calculated using simplified models are in orders
of magnitude shorter than the ignition delay times calculated using detailed chemical models and
measured experimentally. This results in considerably different times when the exothermic reaction
affects significantly the ignition, evolution, and coupling of the spontaneous reaction wave
and pressure waves. We show that the temperature gradient capable to trigger detonation calculated
using detailed chemical models is much shallower (the size of the hot spot is much larger) than that,
predicted by simulations with simplified chemical models. These findings suggest that the scenario
leading to the deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) may depend greatly on the chemical model
used in simulations and that the Zeldovich gradient mechanism is not necessary a universal mechanism
triggering DDT. The obtained results indicate that the conclusions derived from the simulations
of DDT with simplified chemical models should be viewed with great caution.
