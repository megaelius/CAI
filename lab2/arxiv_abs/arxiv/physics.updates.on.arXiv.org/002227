The effect of air viscosity on the flow around an insect wing increases as insect size decreases.
For the smallest insects (wing length R below 1 mm), the viscous effect is so large that lift-generation
mechanisms used by their larger counterparts become ineffective. How the weight-supporting vertical
force is generated is unknown. To elucidate the aerodynamic mechanisms responsible, we measure
the wing kinematics of the tiny wasp Encarsia formosa (0.6 mm R) in hovering or very slow ascending
flight and compute and analyze the aerodynamic forces. We find that the insects perform two unusual
wing-motions. One is rowing: the wings move fast downward and backward, like stroking oars; the
other is the previously discovered Weis-Fogh fling. The rowing produces 70 percent of the required
vertical force and the Weis-Fogh fling the other 30 percent. The oaring wing mainly produces an approximately
up-pointing drag, resulting in the vertical force. Because each oaring produces a starting flow,
the drag is unsteady in nature and much greater than that in steady motion at the same velocities and
angles of attack. Furthermore, our computation shows that if the tiny wasps employed the usual wing
kinematics of the larger insects (flapping back and forth in a horizontal plane), vertical force
produced would be only one third of that by the real wing kinematics; i.e. they must use the special
wing movements to overcome the problem of large viscous effects encountered by the commonly used
flapping kinematics. We for the first time observe very small insects using drag to support their
weight and explain how a net vertical force is generated when the drag principle is applied.
