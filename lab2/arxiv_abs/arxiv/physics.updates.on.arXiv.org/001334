Cascaded or central-moment-based lattice Boltzmann method (CLBM) proposed in [Geier \textit{et
al.}, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{63}, 066705 (2006)] has been proved to possess very good numerical stability,
and applied to a series of complex flows. However, two constraints still exist in three-dimensional
(3D) CLBM simulations. Firstly, the practical implementation for 3D CLBM involves cumbersome
notations and needs much higher computational cost compared to the classical single-relaxation-time
(SRT) LBM. Secondly, it is still puzzling about how to accurately incorporate a general force field
into the 3D CLBM. In this paper, we present a simplified method to implement CLBM in 3D. The main strategy
is to adopt a simplified central moment set, and carry out the central-moment-based collision operator
based on a general multi-relaxation-time (GMRT) framework. Next, the recently proposed consistent
forcing scheme in CLBM [L. Fei and K. H. Luo, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{96}, 053307 (2017)] is extended
to incorporate a general force field into 3D CLBM. Compared with the most recently developed non-orthogonal
CLBM [A. D. Rosis, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{95}, 013310 (2017)], our proposed simplified implementation
is proved to reduce the computational cost significantly. The inconsistency of adopting the discrete
equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs) in the non-orthogonal CLBM is also discussed and revealed.
The consistent forcing scheme in 3D CLBM is verified through numerical simulations of several canonical
force-driven flows, highlighting very good properties in terms of accuracy, convergence and consistency
of the nonslip rule. In addition, the proposed simplified methodology in CLBM indicates directions
to simplify the MRT-LBM.
