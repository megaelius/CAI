In order to optimize the parameters of the plasma plume for atmospheric pressure plasma applications
such as biological and industrial applications, it is highly necessary to thoroughly understand
its characteristics. In this paper, various diagnostic techniques are discussed to characterize
the atmospheric pressure plasma plume. The major emphasis of this work is to utilize possibly simple
methods, low complexity in post data analysis and obtain in-situ information. The parameters of
the plasma plume such as spatial variation of gas temperature, electron excitation temperature,
plume velocity, plume current, electron density are experimentally measured. In addition, plasma
discharge behavior and plume formation with various gas flow rates and applied voltage are studied.
The characterization of the above parameters is carried out by using electrical diagnostics (voltage
probe and a current sensor), Optical diagnostics (optical emission spectroscopy (OES), fast imaging
method using ICCD camera), and thermocouple. The plasma plume/gas temperature along the plume
length is measured by using a simple K-type thermocouple and is found to be in the range of (42.5 - 24.5)
deg C. The OES is used to estimate the electron excitation temperature of plasma plume and to identify
the key reactive species (OH, NO, N2+, O, etc.) present in the plume. ICCD camera is utilized to capture
the temporal evolution of plasma and to estimate the plume velocity along the plume length. The current
transformer is utilized to measure the plume current along the plume length. By using the velocity
and current information, the plasma density is evaluated, and the obtained values are in the range
of (0.069-5.96)x 10^12 cm^-3. The above range of parameters and tunable nature of our designed plasma
source will be useful for the development and optimization of plasma sources for various applications.
