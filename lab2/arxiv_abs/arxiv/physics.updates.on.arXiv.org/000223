Location Based Services (LBS) provide a new perspective for spatiotemporally analyzing dynamic
urban systems. Research has investigated urban dynamics using GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications),
GPS (Global Positioning System), SNS (Social Networking Services) and Wi-Fi techniques. However,
less attention has been paid to the analysis of urban structure (especially commuting pattern)
using smart card data (SCD), which are widely available in most cities. Additionally, ubiquitous
LBS data, although providing rich spatial and temporal information, lacks rich information on
the social dimension, which limits its in-depth application. To bridge this gap, this paper combines
bus SCD for a one-week period with a one-day household travel survey, as well as a parcel-level land
use map to identify job-housing locations and commuting trip routes in Beijing. Two data forms (TRIP
and PTD) are proposed, with PTD used for jobs-housing identification and TRIP used for commuting
trip route identification. The results of the identification are aggregated in the bus stop and
traffic analysis zone (TAZ) scales, respectively. Particularly, commuting trips from three typical
residential communities to six main business zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting
patterns in Beijing. The identified commuting trips are validated on three levels by comparison
with those from the survey in terms of commuting time and distance, and the positive validation results
prove the applicability of our approach. Our experiment, as a first step toward enriching LBS data
using conventional survey and urban GIS data, can obtain solid identification results based on
rules extracted from existing surveys or censuses.
