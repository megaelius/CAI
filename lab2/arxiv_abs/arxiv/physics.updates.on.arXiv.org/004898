Controlling light propagation using artificial photonic crystals and electromagnetic metamaterials
is an important topic in the vibrant field of photonics. Notably, chiral edge states on the surface
or at the interface of photonic Chern insulators can be used to make reflection-free waveguides.
Here, by both theoretical analysis and electromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that gyromagnetic
hyperbolic metamaterials (GHM) are photonic Chern insulators with superior properties. As a novel
mechanism, the simultaneous occurrence of the hyperbolic and gyromagnetic effects in these metamaterials
is shown to open the large topological band gaps with gap Chern number of one. Importantly, unlike
many other photonic Chern insulators, the GHM Chern insulators possess non-radiative chiral edge
modes on their surfaces, and thus allow to fabricate unidirectional waveguides without cladding
metals which generally incurr considerable Ohmic loss. Furthermore, the photonic edge states
in the proposed Chern insulators are robust against disorder on a wide range of length scales, in
strong contrast to crystalline topological insulators, and the light flow direction on the surface
of the Chern insulators can be easily flipped by switching the direction of an applied magnetic field.
Fascinatingly, we find that negative refraction of the topological surface wave occurs at the boundary
between the GHMs with the opposite signs of gyromagnetic parameters. Finally, we show that compared
with other photonic topological materials such as chiral hyperbolic materials, the present GHM
Chern insulators can be much easier to fabricate.
