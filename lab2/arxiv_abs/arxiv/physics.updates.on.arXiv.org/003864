Abeta is a disordered peptide central to Alzheimer's Disease. Aggregation of Abeta has been widely
explored, but its molecular crowding less so. The synaptic cleft where Abeta locates only holds
60-70 water molecules along its width. We subjected Abeta40 to 100 different simulations with variable
water cell size. We show that even for this disordered aggregation-prone peptide, many properties
are not cell-size dependent, i.e. a small cell is easily justified. The radius of gyration, intra-peptide,
and peptide-water hydrogen bonds are well-sampled by short (50 ns) time scales at any cell size.
Abeta is mainly disordered with 0-30% alpha helix but undergoes consistent alpha-beta transitions
up to 14% strand in 5-10% of the simulations regardless of cell size. The similar prevalence in long
and short simulations indicate small diffusion barriers for structural transitions in contrast
to folded globular proteins, which we suggest is a defining hallmark of intrinsically disordered
proteins. Importantly, the hydrophobic surface increases significantly in small cells (confidence
level 95%, two-tailed t-test), as does the variation in exposure and backbone conformations (>40%
and >27% increased standard deviations). Whereas hydrophilic exposure dominates hydrophobic
exposure in large cells, this tendency breaks down at low water concentration. We interpret these
findings as a concentration-dependent hydrophobic effect, with the small water layer unable to
keep the protein unexposed, an effect mainly caused by the layered water-water interactions, not
by the peptide dynamics. The exposure correlates with radius of gyration (R2 0.35-0.50) and could
be important in crowded environments, e.g. the synaptic cleft.
