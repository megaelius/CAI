The elemental composition of the solar wind differs from the solar photospheric composition. Elements
with low first ionization potential (FIP) appear enhanced compared to O in the solar wind relative
to the respective photospheric abundances. This so-called FIP effect is different in the slow solar
wind and the coronal hole wind. However, under the same plasma conditions, for elements with similar
FIPs such as Mg, Si, and Fe, comparable enhancements are expected. We scrutinize the assumption
that the FIP effect is always similar for different low FIP elements, namely Mg, Si, and Fe. We investigate
the dependency of the FIP effect of low FIP elements on the O7+/O6+ charge state ratio depending on
time and solar wind type. We order the observed FIP ratios with respect to the O7+/O6+ charge state
ratio into bins and analyze separately the respective distributions of the FIP ratio of Mg, Si, and
Fe for each O7+/O6+ charge state ratio bin. We observe that the FIP effect shows the same qualitative
yearly behavior for Mg and Si, while Fe shows significant differences during the solar activity
maximum and its declining phase. In each year, the FIP effect for Mg and Si always increases with increasing
O7+/O6+ charge state ratio, but for high O7+/O6+ charge state ratios the FIP effect for Fe shows a
qualitatively different behavior. During the years 2001-2006, instead of increasing with the
O7+/O6+ charge state ratio, the Fe FIP ratio exhibits a broad peak. Also, the FIP distribution per
O7+/O6+ charge state bin is significantly broader for Fe than for Mg and Si. These observations support
the conclusion that the elemental fractionation is only partly determined by FIP. In particular,
the qualitative difference behavior with increasing O7+/O6+ charge state ratio between Fe on the
one hand and Mg and Si on the other hand is not yet well explained by models of fractionation.
