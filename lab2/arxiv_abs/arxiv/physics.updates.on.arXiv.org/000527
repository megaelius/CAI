The Fenna Mathews Olson (FMO) complex of green sulphur bacteria is an example of a photosynthetic
pigment protein complex, in which the electronic properties of the pigments are modified by the
protein environment to promote efficient excitonic energy transfer from antenna complexes to
the reaction centres. Many of the electronic properties of the FMO complex can be extracted from
knowledge of the static crystal structure. However, the recent observation and analysis of long
lasting quantum dynamics in the FMO complex point to protein dynamics as a key factor in protecting
and generating quantum coherence under laboratory conditions. While fast inter and intra molecular
vibrations have been investigated extensively, the slow dynamics which effectively determine
the optical inhomogeneous broadening of experimental ensembles has received less attention.
Our study employs constrained geometric dynamics to study the flexibility in the protein network
by efficiently generating the accessible conformational states from the published crystal structure.
Statistical and principle component analysis reveal highly correlated low frequency motions
between functionally relevant elements, including strong correlations between pigments that
are excitonically coupled. Our analysis reveals a hierarchy of structural interactions which
enforce these correlated motions, from the level of monomer monomer interfaces right down to the
alpha helices, beta sheets and pigments. In addition to inducing strong spatial correlations across
the conformational ensemble, we find that the overall rigidity of the FMO complex is exceptionally
high. We suggest that these observations support the idea of highly correlated inhomogeneous disorder
of the electronic excited states, which is further supported by the remarkably low variance of the
excitonic couplings of the conformational ensemble.
