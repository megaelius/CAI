New developments in liquid scintillators, high-efficiency, fast photon detectors, and chromatic
photon sorting have opened up the possibility for building a large-scale detector that can discriminate
between Cherenkov and scintillation signals. Such a detector could exploit these two distinct
signals to observe particle direction and species using Cherenkov light while also having the excellent
energy resolution and low threshold of a scintillator detector. Situated in a deep underground
laboratory, and utilizing new techniques in computing and reconstruction techniques, such a detector
could achieve unprecedented levels of background rejection, thus enabling a rich physics program
that would span topics in nuclear, high-energy, and astrophysics, and across a dynamic range from
hundreds of keV to many GeV. The scientific program would include observations of low- and high-energy
solar neutrinos, determination of neutrino mass ordering and measurement of the neutrino CP violating
phase, observations of diffuse supernova neutrinos and neutrinos from a supernova burst, sensitive
searches for nucleon decay and, ultimately, a search for NeutrinoLess Double Beta Decay (NLDBD)
with sensitivity reaching the normal ordering regime of neutrino mass phase space. This paper describes
Theia, a detector design that incorporates these new technologies in a practical and affordable
way to accomplish the science goals described above. We consider two scenarios, one in which Theia
would reside in a cavern the size and shape of the caverns intended to be excavated for the Deep Underground
Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) which we call Theia 25, and a larger 100 ktonne version (Theia 100) that
could achieve an even broader and more sensitive scientific program.
