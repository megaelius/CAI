Microresonator-based soliton frequency combs - microcombs - have recently emerged to offer low-noise,
photonic-chip sources for optical measurements. Owing to nonlinear-optical physics, microcombs
can be built with various materials and tuned or stabilized with a consistent framework. Some applications
require phase stabilization, including optical-frequency synthesis and measurements, optical-frequency
division, and optical clocks. Partially stabilized microcombs can also benefit applications,
such as oscillators, ranging, dual-comb spectroscopy, wavelength calibration, and optical communications.
Broad optical bandwidth, brightness, coherence, and frequency stability have made frequency-comb
sources important for studying comb-matter interactions with atoms and molecules. Here, we explore
direct microcomb atomic spectroscopy, utilizing a cascaded, two-photon 1529-nm atomic transition
of rubidium. Both the microcomb and the atomic vapor are implemented with planar fabrication techniques
to support integration. By fine and simultaneous control of the repetition rate and carrier-envelope-offset
frequency of the soliton microcomb, we obtain direct sub-Doppler and hyperfine spectroscopy of
the $4^2D_{5/2}$ manifold. Moreover, the entire set of microcomb modes are stabilized to this atomic
transition, yielding absolute optical-frequency fluctuations of the microcomb at the kilohertz-level
over a few seconds and < 1 MHz day-to-day accuracy. Our work demonstrates atomic spectroscopy with
microcombs and provides a rubidium-stabilized microcomb laser source, operating across the 1550
nm band for sensing, dimensional metrology, and communication.
