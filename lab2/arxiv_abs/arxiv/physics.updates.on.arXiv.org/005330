Bacterial populations in natural conditions are expected to experience stochastic environmental
fluctuations, and in addition, environments are affected by bacterial activities since they consume
substrates and excrete various chemicals. One of the likely environmental fluctuations that happen
in nature is the repeated cycle of substrate-rich conditions and starvation, called the "feast-famine
cycle". It is not trivial how bacteria can cope with the feast-famine cycle and evolve under such
a situation since in the feast period faster growth is beneficial in competition, but faster growth
will shorten the feast period. Furthermore, in the famine period, the tolerance to the starvation
is needed, which may be negatively correlated with faster growth. We here study possible outcomes
of population dynamics and evolution under the feast-famine cycle by a simple stochastic model.
In the model, the feast period is led by a stochastic substrate addition event, while the famine period
is evoked because bacteria use the supplied substrate. By allowing the model bacteria to evolve
growth rate in the feast period with a trade-off with the growth yield and the death rate, the bacterial
population tends to increase the growth rate by changing the counterpart of the trade-off, even
though that tends to decrease the total population size. Analysis showed that, under the repeated
feast-famine cycles, the ratio between the growth rate and the death rate becomes the effective
fitness of the population. Hence, when there is a trade-off between the growth and the death rate,
the functional form of the trade-off determines if the bacterial population eventually go extinct.
We then show that the increase of the added substrate in the feast period can drive the extinction
faster.
