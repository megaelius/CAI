Metallic nanostructures are essential to many applications in photonics, including biosensing,
spectroscopy, nanolasing, all-optical switching, nonlinear optical processes, and metasurface
technologies. These plasmonic elements form flexible components with geometry-dependent responses
and have many desirable properties, such as the possibility to confine light to sub-wavelength
scales, and large local-field enhancements. Metals also possess intrinsic nonlinear optical
constants that are many orders of magnitude larger than dielectric materials. Combined, these
features hold promise for the realization of ultra-thin sub-wavelength devices, reducing power
operating thresholds and enabling nonlinear functionality in metasurfaces. However, this promise
is substantially undercut by absorption introduced by resistive losses, causing the metasurface
community to turn away from metal nanostructures in favour of alternative material platforms (e.g.,
dielectrics) that have much less field enhancement, but more tolerable losses. Here, we refute
this long-held assumption by designing and experimentally demonstrating a metasurface based
on gold meta-atoms with a quality-factor (Q-factor) of 2340 in the telecommunication C band. This
value exceeds the record for plasmonic metasurfaces by an order of magnitude, and is among the highest
reported in a metasurface. We obtain this sharp resonance by exploiting surface lattice resonances
(SLRs) that are aided by the proper choice of nanostructure geometry, large array sizes, and the
use of a collimated coherent light source. Our platform combines the aforementioned benefits of
metals with long interaction times provided by high Q-factors. Additionally, we show that SLRs
retain many of the same benefits as localized plasmonic resonances, such as field enhancement and
strong confinement of light along the metal surface.
