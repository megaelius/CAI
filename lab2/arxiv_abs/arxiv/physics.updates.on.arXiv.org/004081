On-chip optical resonators have proven to be a promising platform for generating Kerr frequency
combs. Whispering gallery mode resonators are particularly attractive because of their small
footprint as well as low threshold and power consumption. This performance can be attributed to
two characteristics: the cavity quality factor (Q) and the cavity dispersion. The input optical
field into the cavity is amplified by the cavity Q, enabling nonlinear processes to occur with low
input powers. In addition, the total span of the optical comb is governed by the dispersion. In an
optical cavity-based comb, the dispersion is governed by the geometric dispersion of the cavity
and the material dispersion. While many different materials have been explored, the realization
of ultra-high Q (UHQ) on-chip frequency combs sources is still challenging for most materials.
One exception is the family of integrated silica devices. However, because the silica attracts
water molecules from the ambient environment, the lifetime of the device performance is fundamentally
limited, unless packaged in a controlled atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate the generation of environmentally-stable
frequency combs fabricated from SiO1.7N0.13 microtoroidal resonators. Due to the UHQ factors
of the cavities, parametric oscillations with sub-microwatt thresholds are demonstrated. Based
on their geometry and material properties, the cavities have normal dispersion. However, due to
avoided mode crossing, frequency combs are generated. Finally, unlike SiO2, the SiO1.7N0.13 inhibits
the formation of a water monolayer, allowing sub-microwatt performance to be maintained for over
a week in devices stored with minimal environmental controls.
