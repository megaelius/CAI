Dynamic radiative cooling attracts fast-increasing interest due to its adaptability to changing
environment and promises for more energy-savings than the static counterpart. Here we demonstrate
enhanced infrared emission by thermally switching the excitation of magnetic polariton with microstructured
vanadium dioxide (VO2) metasurfaces fabricated via scalable and etch-free processes. Temperature-dependent
infrared spectroscopy clearly shows that the spectral emittance of fabricated tunable metasurfaces
at wavelengths from 2 to 6 um is significantly enhanced when heated beyond its phase transition temperature,
where the magnetic polariton is excited with metallic VO2. The tunable emittance spectra are also
demonstrated to be insensitive to incidence and polarization angles such that the VO2 metasurface
can be treated as a diffuse infrared emitter. Numerical optical simulation and analytical inductance-capacitance
model elucidate the suppression or excitation of magnetic polariton with insulating or metallic
VO2 upon phase transition. The effect of enhanced thermal emission with the tunable VO2 metasurface
is experimentally demonstrated with a thermal vacuum test. For the same heating power of 0.2 W, the
steady-state temperature of the tunable VO2 metasurface emitter after phase transition is found
to be 20degC lower than that of a reference V2O5 emitter whose static spectral emittance is almost
the same as that of the VO2 metasurface before phase transition. The radiative thermal conductance
for the tunable metasurface emitter is found to be 3.96 W/m2K with metallic VO2 at higher temperatures
and 0.68 W/m2K with insulating VO2 at lower temperatures, clearly demonstrating almost six-fold
enhancement in radiative heat dissipation.
