Interfractional geometric uncertainties can lead to deviations of the actual delivered dose from
the prescribed dose distribution. To better handle these uncertainties during treatment, the
authors propose a dynamic framework for robust adaptive radiation therapy in which a variety of
robust adaptive treatment strategies are introduced and evaluated. This variety is a result of
optimization variables with various degrees of freedom within robust optimization models that
vary in their grade of conservativeness. We formulate an adaptive framework with dependence on
time and/or uncertainty or neither. The framework is evaluated with either expected-value-, worst-case-
or conditional-value-at-risk-(CVaR)-optimization. The goal of this study is to identify the
mathematical properties of the proposed robust adaptive strategies in order to restore the planned
dose distribution. We apply a result from convex analysis to show that in our framework, the time-dependent
problem has a time-independent optimal solution. This implies that the time-dependent problem
can be solved by dynamically solving the corresponding time-independent problem. This is especially
relevant in a clinical context, since it implies that adaptive radiation therapy can be implemented
in clinical practice using commercially available treatment planning systems. We demonstrate
that time-and-scenario-dependent variables are most compatible with worst-case-optimization
and that including dose prediction potentially improves treatment compared to non-adaptive planning.
Contrarily, time-and-scenario-independent variables appear most compatible with expected-value-optimization.
Non-adaptive robust strategies may provide sufficient target coverage, comparable to robust
adaptive strategies, if the occurring uncertainties follow the same distribution as those included
in the robust model.
