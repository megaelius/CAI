We present a relativistic model for light sails of arbitrary reflectivity undertaking non rectilinear
motion. Analytical solutions and a reduced model for straight motion with arbitrary sail's illumination
are given, including for the case of a perfectly reflecting light sail examined in earlier works.
When the sail is partially absorbing incoming radiation, its rest mass varies, an effect completely
discarded in previous works. Is is shown how sailing at relativistic velocities is intricate due
to the existence of an unstable fixed point, when the sail is parallel to the incoming radiation beam,
surrounded by two attractors corresponding to two different regimes of radial escape. We apply
this model to the Starshot project by showing several important points for mission design. First,
any misalignement between the driving light beam and the direction of sail's motion is naturally
swept away during acceleration toward relativistic speed, yet leading to a deviation of about $80$
AU in the case of an initial misalignement of one arcsec for a sail accelerated up to $0.2\times c$
toward Alpha Centauri. Then, the huge proper acceleration felt by the probes (of order $2500$-g),
the tremendous energy cost (of about $13$ kilotons per probe) for poor efficiency (of about $3\%$),
the trip duration (between $22$ and $33$ years), the rest mass variation (up to $14\%$) and the time
dilation aboard (about $140$ days difference) are all presented and their variation with sail's
reflectivity is discussed. We also present an application to single trips within the Solar System
using double-stage lightsails. A spaceship of mass $24$ tons can start from Earth and stop at Mars
in about $7$ months with a peak velocity of $30$ km/s but at the price of a huge energy cost of about $5.3\times
10^4$ GWh due to extremely low efficiency of the directed energy system, around $10^{-4}$ in this
low-velocity case.
