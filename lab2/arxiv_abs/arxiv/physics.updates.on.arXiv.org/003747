In this article, we propose a semi-analytical inverse technique that accurately reconstructs
the ocean's density stratification profile, and hence, the pycnocline depth, simply from the free
surface elevation data. Satellite observations suggest that the ocean surface contains the signature
of internal tides, which are internal gravity waves generated when the stably stratified ocean
water is forced to move back and forth over the submarine topography by the barotropic tides. Since
the internal tides, in turn, contain information of the ocean's density stratification, the latter
can in principle be reconstructed from the free surface signature. We consider a simple theoretical
model that approximates a continuously stratified ocean as discrete layers of constant buoyancy
frequency; this facilitates the derivation of a closed-form dispersion relation. First, we numerically
simulate the internal tide generation for toy ocean scenarios and subsequently perform Space-Time
Fourier Transform (STFT) of the free surface. The free surface STFT yields internal tide spectra
which has wavenumbers corresponding to the tidal frequency. The density profile reconstruction
has been performed by substituting these internal tide wavenumbers into the dispersion relation.
Next we consider a more realistic situation in which rotation is included; moreover the bottom topography,
the density and the shear profiles are representative of the Strait of Gibraltar. While the density
reconstruction is 94.4% accurate in the absence of shear, the accuracy decreases to 90.2% when moderate
shear is present. In the final part of the study, we have used wavenumbers obtained from satellite
altimetry data to reconstruct the (smoothed) density profile near the Hawaiian Ridge. Density
reconstruction using the three-layered model revealed 93.67% accuracy.
