A model-based reconstruction framework is proposed for MOtion-Corrected and High-resolution
anatomically-Assisted (MOCHA) reconstruction of ASL data. In this framework, all low-resolution
ASL control-label pairs are used to reconstruct a single high-resolution cerebral blood flow (CBF)
map, corrected for rigid motion, point-spread-function (PSF) blurring and partial-volume effect
(PVE).Six volunteers were recruited for CBF imaging using PCASL labelling, 2-shot 3D-GRASE sequences
and high-resolution T1-weighted MRI. For two volunteers, high-resolution scans with double and
triple resolution in the partition direction were additionally collected. Simulations were designed
for evaluations against a high-resolution ground-truth CBF map, including a simulated hyper-perfused
lesion and hyper/hypo-perfusion abnormalities. MOCHA was compared to standard reconstruction
and a 3D linear regression (3DLR) PVE correction method and was further evaluated for acquisitions
with reduced control-label pairs and k-space undersampling. MOCHA reconstructions of low-resolution
ASL data showed enhanced image quality particularly in the partition direction. In simulations,
both MOCHA and 3DLR provided more accurate CBF maps than the standard reconstruction, however MOCHA
resulted in the lowest errors and well delineated the abnormalities. MOCHA reconstruction of standard-resolution
in-vivo data showed good agreement with higher-resolution scans requiring 4x and 9x longer acquisitions.
MOCHA was found to be robust for 4x-accelerated ASL acquisitions, achieved by reduced control-label
pairs or k-space undersampling. Conclusion: MOCHA reconstruction reduces PVE by direct reconstruction
of CBF maps in the high-resolution space of the corresponding anatomical image, incorporating
motion correction and PSF modelling. Following further evaluation, MOCHA should promote the clinical
application of ASL.
