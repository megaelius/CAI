We open the paper with introductory considerations describing the motivations of our long-term
research plan targeting gravitomagnetism, illustrating the fluid-dynamics numerical test case
selected for that purpose, that is, a perfect-gas sphere contained in a solid shell located in empty
space sufficiently away from other masses, and defining the main objective of this study: the determination
of the gravitofluid-static field required as initial field ($t=0$) in forthcoming fluid-dynamics
calculations. The determination of the gravitofluid-static field requires the solution of the
isothermal-sphere Lane-Emden equation. We do not follow the habitual approach of the literature
based on the prescription of the central density as boundary condition; we impose the gravitational
field at the solid-shell internal wall. As the discourse develops, we point out differences and
similarities between the literature's and our approach. We show that the nondimensional formulation
of the problem hinges on a unique physical characteristic number that we call gravitational number
because it gauges the self-gravity effects on the gas' fluid statics. We illustrate and discuss
numerical results; some peculiarities, such as gravitational-number upper bound and multiple
solutions, lead us to investigate the thermodynamics of the physical system, particularly entropy
and energy, and preliminarily explore whether or not thermodynamic-stability reasons could provide
justification for either selection or exclusion of multiple solutions. We close the paper with
a summary of the present study in which we draw conclusions and describe future work.
