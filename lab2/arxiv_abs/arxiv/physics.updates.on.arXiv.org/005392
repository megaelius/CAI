Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors promise efficient (~100%) and fast (~Gcps)
detection of light at the single-photon level. They constitute one of the building blocks to realize
integrated quantum optical circuits in a waveguide architecture. The optical response of single-photon
detectors, however, is limited to measure only the presence of photons. It misses the capability
to resolve the spectrum of a possible broadband illumination. In this work, we propose the optical
design for a superconducting nanowire single-photon spectrometer in an integrated optical platform.
We exploit a cascade of cavities with different resonance wavelengths side-coupled to a photonic
crystal bus waveguide. This allows to demultiplex different wavelengths into different spatial
regions, where individual superconducting nanowires that measure the presence of single photons
are placed next to these cavities. We employ temporal coupled-mode theory to derive the optimal
conditions to achieve a high absorption efficiency in the nanowire with fine spectral resolution.
It is shown that the use of a mirror at the end of the cascaded system that terminates the photonic crystal
bus waveguide increases the absorption efficiency up to unity, in principle, in the absence of loss.
The expected response is demonstrated by full-wave simulations for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional
structures. Absorption efficiencies of about 80% are achieved both in two-dimensional structures
for four cascaded cavities and in three-dimensional structures for two cascaded cavities. The
achieved spectral resolution is about 1 nm. We expect that the proposed setup, both analytically
studied and numerically demonstrated in this work, offers a great impetus for future quantum nanophotonic
on-chip technologies.
