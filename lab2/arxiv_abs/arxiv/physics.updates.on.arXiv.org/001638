Purpose: The aim of this work was to create tissue-mimicking gel phantoms appropriate for diffusion
kurtosis imaging (DKI) for quality assurance, protocol optimization and sequence development.
Methods: A range of agar, agarose and polyvinyl alcohol phantoms with concentrations ranging from
1.0% to 3.5%, 0.5% to 3.0% and 10% to 20%, respectively, and up to 3 g of glass microspheres per 100 ml
were created. Diffusion coefficients, excess kurtosis values and relaxation rates were experimentally
determined. Results: The kurtosis values for the plain gels ranged from 0.05 with 95% confidence
interval (CI) of $(0.029, 0.071)$ to $0.216(0.185, 0.246)$, well below the kurtosis values reported
in the literature for various tissues. The addition of glass microspheres increased the kurtosis
of the gels with values up to $0.523(0.465, 0.581)$ observed for gels with the highest concentration
of microspheres. Repeat scans of some of the gels after more than six months of storage at room temperature
indicate changes in the diffusion parameters of less than 10%. The addition of the glass microspheres
reduces the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and increases the longitudinal and transverse
relaxation rates but the values remain comparable to those for plain gels and tissue, with ADCs observed
ranging from $818(585, 1053) \times 10^{-6}$ mm$^2$/s to $2257(2118, 2296) \times 10^{-6}$ mm$^2$/s,
and R1 values ranging from $0.34(0.32, 0.35)$ 1/s to $0.51(0.50, 0.52)$ 1/s, and R2 values ranging
from $9.69(9.34, 10.04)$ 1/s to $33.07(27.10, 39.04)$ 1/s. Conclusions: Glass microspheres can
be used to effectively modify diffusion properties of gel phantoms and achieve a range of kurtosis
values comparable to those reported for a variety of tissues.
