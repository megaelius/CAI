Various forms of numerical shock instabilities are known to plague many contact and shear preserving
approximate Riemann solvers, including the popular Harten-Lax-van Leer with Contact (HLLC) scheme,
during high speed flow simulations. In this paper we propose a simple and inexpensive novel strategy
to prevent the HLLC scheme from developing such spurious solutions without compromising on its
linear wave resolution ability. The cure is primarily based on a reinterpretation of the HLLC scheme
as a combination of its well-known diffusive counterpart, the HLL scheme, and an antidiffusive
term responsible for its accuracy on linear wavefields. In our study, a linear analysis of this alternate
form indicates that shock instability in the HLLC scheme could be triggered due to the unwanted activation
of the antidiffusive terms of its mass and interface-normal flux components on interfaces that
are not aligned with the shock front. This inadvertent activation results in weakening of the favourable
dissipation provided by its inherent HLL scheme and causes unphysical mass flux variations along
the shock front. To mitigate this, we propose a modified HLLC scheme that employs a simple differentiable
pressure based multidimensional shock sensor to achieve smooth control of these critical antidiffusive
terms near shocks. Using a linear perturbation analysis and a matrix based stability analysis,
we establish that the resulting scheme, called HLLC-ADC (Anti-Diffusion Control), is shock stable
over a wide range of freestream Mach numbers. Results from standard numerical test cases demonstrate
that the HLLC-ADC scheme is indeed free from the most common manifestations of shock instability
including the Carbuncle phenomenon without significant loss of accuracy on shear dominated viscous
flows.
