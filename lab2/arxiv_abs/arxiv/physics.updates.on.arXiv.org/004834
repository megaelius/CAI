Photonic topological insulators supporting unidirectional topologically protected edge states
represent attractive platform for realization of disorder- and backscattering-immune transport
of edge excitations in both linear and nonlinear regimes. In many realizations of topological insulators
structured periodic materials are used, since they may admit specific Dirac degeneracy in the spectrum,
around which unidirectional edge states appear under the action of physical effects breaking time-reversal
symmetry. While properties of the edge states at unclosed interfaces of two bulk media with different
topology are known, the existence of the edge states in practical finite-dimensional topological
insulators fully immersed in nontopological environment remains largely unexplored. In this
work using as an example realistic polariton topological insulators built from small-size honeycomb
arrays of microcavity pillars, we illustrate how topological properties of the system build up
upon gradual increase of its dimensionality. To account for dissipative nature of polariton condensate
forming in the array of microcavity pillars, we consider the impact of losses and resonant pump leading
to rich bistability effects in this system. We describe the mechanism in accordance with which trivial-phase
pump "selects" and excites specific nonlinear topological edge states circulating along the periphery
of the structure in the azimuthal direction dictated by the direction of the external applied magnetic
field. We also show the possibility of utilization of vortex pump with different topological charges
for selective excitation of different edge currents.
