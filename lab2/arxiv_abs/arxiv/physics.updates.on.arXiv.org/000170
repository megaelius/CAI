This paper addresses the impact of assimilating data from the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network
(ENTLN) during two cases of severe weather. Data from the ENTLN serve as a substitute for those from
the upcoming launch of the GOES Lightning Mapper (GLM). We use the Weather Research and Forecast
(WRF) model and variational data assimilation techniques at 9 km spatial resolution. The main goal
is to examine the potential impact of lightning observations from the future GLM. Previous efforts
to assimilate lightning observations mainly utilized nudging approaches. We develop three more
sophisticated approaches, 3D-VAR WRFDA and 1D+nD-VAR (n=3,4) WRFDA schemes that currently are
being considered for operational implementation by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
(NCEP) and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). This research uses Convective Available Potential
Energy (CAPE) as a proxy between lightning data and model variables. To test the performance of the
aforementioned schemes, we assess the quality of resulting analysis and forecasts of precipitation
compared to those from a control experiment and verify them against NCEP stage IV precipitation.
Results demonstrate that assimilating lightning observations improves precipitation statistics
during the assimilation window and for 3-7 h thereafter. The 1D+4D-VAR approach performs best,
significantly improving precipitation root mean square errors by 25% and 27.5% compared to the
control during the assimilation window on the two cases. This finding confirms that the variational
nD-VAR (n=3,4) assimilation of lightning observations improves the accuracy of moisture analyses
and forecasts. Finally, we briefly discuss limitations inherent in the current lightning assimilation
schemes, their implications, and possible ways to improve them.
