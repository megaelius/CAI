Studies on random packing of polydispersive particles have shown that such systems can capture
the underlying behavior of more complex phenomena found in physics and materials engineering.
In industry, polydispersive particles are used to allow the increase of density and fluidity of
the formed compounds. The understanding of the dynamics of these processes is therefore of great
theoretical and practical interest. In this paper, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
to study the packing process of spheres in different particle size distributions. In particular,
we deal with non-Gaussian distributions by means of the L{\'e}vy and uniform distributions. The
initial positions as well as the radii of five thousand non-overlapping particles are assigned
inside a confining rectangular box. After that, the system is allowed to settle under gravity towards
the bottom of the box. Both the translational and rotational movements of each particle are considered
in the simulations. In order to deal with interacting particles, we take into account both the contact
and long-range cohesive forces. The normal viscoelastic force is calculated according to the nonlinear
Hertz model, whereas the tangential force is calculated through an accurate nonlinear-spring
model. Assuming a molecular approach, we account for the long-range cohesive forces using a Lennard-Jones(LJ)-like
potential. The packing processes are studied assuming different long-range interaction strengths.
We carry out statistical calculations of the different quantities studied including packing density,
mean coordination number and kinetic energy during the time evolution of the system.
