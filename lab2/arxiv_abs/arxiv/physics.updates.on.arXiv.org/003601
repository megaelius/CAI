We designed, fabricated, and characterized four arrays of horn--coupled, lumped element kinetic
inductance detectors (LEKIDs), optimized to work in the spectral bands of the balloon-borne OLIMPO
experiment. OLIMPO is a 2.6 m aperture telescope, aimed at spectroscopic measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) effect. OLIMPO will also validate the LEKID technology in a representative space environment.
The corrected focal plane is filled with diffraction limited horn-coupled KID arrays, with 19,
37, 23, 41 active pixels respectively at 150, 250, 350, and 460$\:$GHz. Here we report on the full
electrical and optical characterization performed on these detector arrays before the flight.
In a dark laboratory cryostat, we measured the resonator electrical parameters, such as the quality
factors and the electrical responsivities, at a base temperature of 300$\:$mK. The measured average
resonator $Q$s are 1.7$\times{10^4}$, 7.0$\times{10^4}$, 1.0$\times{10^4}$, and 1.0$\times{10^4}$
for the 150, 250, 350, and 460$\:$GHz arrays, respectively. The average electrical phase responsivities
on resonance are 1.4$\:$rad/pW, 1.5$\:$rad/pW, 2.1$\:$rad/pW, and 2.1$\:$rad/pW; the electrical
noise equivalent powers are 45$\:\rm{aW/\sqrt{Hz}}$, 160$\:\rm{aW/\sqrt{Hz}}$, 80$\:\rm{aW/\sqrt{Hz}}$,
and 140$\:\rm{aW/\sqrt{Hz}}$, at 12 Hz. In the OLIMPO cryostat, we measured the optical properties,
such as the noise equivalent temperatures (NET) and the spectral responses. The measured NET$_{\rm
RJ}$s are $200\:\mu\rm{K\sqrt{s}}$, $240\:\mu\rm{K\sqrt{s}}$, $240\:\mu\rm{K\sqrt{s}}$,
and $\:340\mu\rm{K\sqrt{s}}$, at 12 Hz; under 78, 88, 92, and 90 mK Rayleigh-Jeans blackbody load
changes respectively for the 150, 250, 350, and 460 GHz arrays. The spectral responses were characterized
with the OLIMPO differential Fourier transform spectrometer (DFTS) up to THz frequencies, with
a resolution of 1.8 GHz.
