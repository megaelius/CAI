Long periods of strong southward magnetic fields are known to be the primary cause of intense geomagnetic
storms. The majority of such events are caused by the passage over Earth of a magnetic ejecta. Irrespective
of the interplanetary cause, fast-forward shocks often precede such strong southward B$_{z}$
periods. Here, we first look at all long periods of strong southward magnetic fields as well as fast-forward
shocks measured by the \textit{Wind} spacecraft in a 22.4-year span. We find that 76{\%} of strong
southward B$_{z}$ periods are preceded within 48 hours by at least a fast-forward shock but only
about 23{\%} of all shocks are followed within 48 hours by strong southward B$_{z}$ periods. Then,
we devise a threshold-based probabilistic forecasting method based on the shock properties and
the pre-shock near-Earth solar wind plasma and interplanetary magnetic field characteristics
adopting a `superposed epoch analysis'-like approach. Our analysis shows that the solar wind conditions
in the 30 minutes interval around the arrival of fast-forward shocks have a significant contribution
to the prediction of long-duration southward B$_{z}$ periods. This probabilistic model may provide
on average a 14-hour warning time for an intense and long-duration southward B$_{z}$ period. Evaluating
the forecast capability of the model through a statistical and skill score-based approach reveals
that it outperforms a coin-flipping forecast. By using the information provided by the arrival
of a fast-forward shock at L1, this model represents a marked improvement over similar forecasting
methods. We outline a number of future potential improvements.
