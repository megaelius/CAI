Plant response is not only dependent on the atmospheric evaporative demand due to the combined effects
of wind speed, air temperature, humidity, and solar radiation, but is also dependent on the water
transport within the leaf-xylem-root system. Therefore, a detailed understanding of such dynamics
is key to the development of appropriate mitigation strategies and numerical models. In this study,
we unveil the diurnal dynamics of the microclimate of a Buxus sempervirens plant using multiple
high-resolution non-intrusive imaging techniques. The wake flow field is measured using stereoscopic
particle image velocimetry, the spatiotemporal leaf temperature history is obtained using infrared
thermography, and additionally, the plant porosity is obtained using X-ray tomography. We find
that the wake velocity statistics is not directly linked with the distribution of the porosity but
depends mainly on the geometry of the plant foliage which generates the shear flow. The interaction
between the shear regions and the upstream boundary layer profile is seen to have a dominant effect
on the wake turbulent kinetic energy distribution. Furthermore, the leaf area density distribution
has a direct impact on the short-wave radiative heat flux absorption inside the foliage where 50%
of the radiation is absorbed in the top 20% of the foliage. This localized radiation absorption results
in a high local leaf and air temperature. Furthermore, a comparison of the diurnal variation of leaf
temperature and the net plant transpiration rate enabled us to quantify the diurnal hysteresis
resulting from the stomatal response lag. The day of this plant is seen to comprise of four stages
of climatic conditions: no-cooling, high-cooling, equilibrium, and decaying-cooling stages.
