Inter subject variability of the electrical conductivity of brain, skull and skin strongly limits
the accuracy by which current sources underlying electro-encephalography (EEG) can be localized
in the brain. This inter subject variability also constrains the possibility to use EEG amplitude
parameters as a biomarker to compare the amount of neural activity between different patients.
To overcome this problem, one may estimate conductivity parameters in vivo by analyzing the potentials
generated by known electric currents, injected into different pairs of EEG electrodes. At present,
routine application of this approach is hampered by the computational complexity of the conductivity
estimation problem. Here we analyze the efficiency of this conductivity parameter estimation
problem in the context of boundary element method (BEM). We assume geometries of brain, skull and
skin compartments are fixed triangular meshes whereas conductivity parameters are treated as
unknowns. We show that a Woodbury update algorithm can be used to obtain a fast conductivity update
scheme for both the single and double layer BEM formalism. This algorithm yields a speed gain up to
a factor of 20 when compared to the direct computations, apart from at most 50% of additional computation
time in the initialization phase of the algorithm. We also derive novel analytically closed expressions
for the efficient and accurate computation of BEM matrix elements. Finally, we discuss which further
steps are needed to equip future EEG systems with software devices that enable subject tailored
head models for calibrated EEG and accurate source localization, on a routine basis.
