The three-body problem is arguably the oldest open question in astrophysics, and has resisted a
general analytic solution for centuries. Various implementations of perturbation theory provide
solutions in portions of parameter space, but only where hierarchies of masses or separations exist.
Numerical integrations show that bound, non-hierarchical triples of Newtonian point particles
will almost always disintegrate into a single escaping star and a stable, bound binary, but the chaotic
nature of the three-body problem prevents the derivation of tractable analytic formulae deterministically
mapping initial conditions to final outcomes. However, chaos also motivates the assumption of
ergodicity, suggesting that the distribution of outcomes is uniform across the accessible phase
volume. Here, we use the ergodic hypothesis to derive a complete statistical solution to the non-hierarchical
three-body problem, one which provides closed-form distributions of outcomes (e.g. binary orbital
elements) given the conserved integrals of motion. We compare our outcome distributions to large
ensembles of numerical three-body integrations, and find good agreement, so long as we restrict
ourselves to "resonant" encounters (the ~50% of scatterings that undergo chaotic evolution).
In analyzing our scattering experiments, we identify "scrambles" (periods in time where no pairwise
binaries exist) as the key dynamical state that ergodicizes a non-hierarchical triple. The generally
super-thermal distributions of survivor binary eccentricity that we predict have notable applications
to many astrophysical scenarios. For example, non-hierarchical triples produced dynamically
in globular clusters are a primary formation channel for black hole mergers, but the rates and properties
of the resulting gravitational waves depend on the distribution of post-disintegration eccentricities.
