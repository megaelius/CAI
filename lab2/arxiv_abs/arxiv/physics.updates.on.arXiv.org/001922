The ability to effectively control brain dynamics holds great promise for the enhancement of cognitive
function in humans, and the betterment of their quality of life. Yet, successfully controlling
dynamics in neural systems is challenging, in part due to the immense complexity of the brain and
the large set of interactions that can drive any single change. While we have gained some understanding
of the control of single neurons, the control of large-scale neural systems -- networks of multiply
interacting components -- remains poorly understood. Efforts to address this gap include the construction
of tools for the control of brain networks, mostly adapted from control and dynamical systems theory.
Informed by current opportunities for practical intervention, these theoretical contributions
provide models that draw from a wide array of mathematical approaches. We present intriguing recent
developments for effective strategies of control in dynamic brain networks, and we also describe
potential mechanisms that underlie such processes. We review efforts in the control of general
neurophysiological processes with implications for brain development and cognitive function,
as well as the control of altered neurophysiological processes in medical contexts such as anesthesia
administration, seizure suppression, and deep-brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. We
conclude with a forward-looking discussion regarding how emerging results from network control
-- especially approaches that deal with nonlinear dynamics or more realistic trajectories for
control transitions -- could be used to directly address pressing questions in neuroscience.
