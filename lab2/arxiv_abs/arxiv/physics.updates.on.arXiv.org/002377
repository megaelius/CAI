We have developed a method to quantify reaction product ratios using high resolution microwave
spectroscopy in a cryogenic buffer gas cell. We demonstrate the power of this method with the study
of the ozonolysis of isoprene, CH2=C(CH3)-CH=CH2, the most abundant, non-methane hydrocarbon
emitted into the atmosphere by vegetation. Isoprene is an asymmetric diene, and reacts with O3 at
the 1,2 position to produce methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), formaldehyde, and a pair of carbonyl oxides:
[CH3CO-CH=CH2 + CH2=OO] + [CH2=O + CH3COO-CH=CH2]. Alternatively, O3 could attack at the 3,4 position
to produce methacrolein (MACR), formaldehyde, and two carbonyl oxides [CH2=C(CH3)-CHO + CH2=OO]
+ [CH2=O + CH2=C(CH3)-CHOO]. Purified O3 and isoprene were mixed for approximately 10 seconds under
dilute (1.5-4% in argon) continuous flow conditions in an alumina tube held at 298 K and 5 Torr. Products
exiting the tube were rapidly slowed and cooled within the buffer gas cell by collisions with cryogenic
(4-7 K) He. High resolution chirped pulse microwave detection between 12 and 26 GHz was used to achieve
highly sensitive (ppb scale), isomer-specific product quantification. We observed a ratio of
MACR to MVK of 2.1 +/- 0.4 under 1:1 ozone to isoprene conditions and 2.1 +/- 0.2 under 2:1 ozone to isoprene
conditions, a finding which is consistent with previous experimental results. Additionally,
we discuss relative quantities of formic acid (HCOOH), an isomer of CH2=OO, and formaldehyde (CH2=O)
under varying experimental conditions, and characterize the spectroscopic parameters of the
singly-substituted 13C trans-isoprene and 13C anti-periplanar-methacrolein species. This
work has the potential to be extended towards a complete branching ratio analysis, as well towards
the ability to isolate, identify, and quantify new reactive intermediates in the ozonolysis of
alkenes.
