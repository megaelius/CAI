The present article experimentally explores the concept of large improving the AC dielectric breakdown
strength of insulating mineral oils by the addition of trace amounts of graphene or CNTs to form stable
dispersions. The nano-oils infused with these nanostructures of high electronic conductance
indicate superior AC dielectric behaviour in terms of augmented breakdown strength compared to
the base oils. Experimental observations of two grades of synthesized graphene and CNT nano-oils
show that the nanomaterials not only improve the average breakdown voltage but also significantly
improve the reliability and survival probabilities of the oils under AC high voltage stressing.
Improvement of the tune of ~ 70-80 % in the AC breakdown voltage of the oils has been obtained via the
present concept. The present study examines the reliability of such nano-colloids with the help
of two parameter Weibull distribution and the oils show greatly augmented electric field bearing
capacity at both standard survival probability values of 5 % and 63.3 %. The fundamental mechanism
responsible for such observed outcomes is reasoned to be delayed streamer development and reduced
streamer growth rates due to effective electron scavenging by the nanostructures from the ionized
liquid insulator. A mathematical model based on the principles of electron scavenging is proposed
to quantify the amount of electrons scavenged by the nanostructures. The same is then employed to
predict the enhanced AC breakdown voltage and the experimental values are found to match well with
the model predictions. The present study can have strong implications in efficient, reliable and
safer operation of real life AC power systems.
