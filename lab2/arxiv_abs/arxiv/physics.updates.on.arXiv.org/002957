An $\mathit{ab\ initio}$ theory is devised for the quantum dynamics of molecules undergoing (multiple)
ionization in ultrafast and intense light. Specifically, the intertwined problem of photoionization,
radiative, and electronic transitions in the course of dissociation is addressed which arises,
e.g., when molecules are exposed to XUV light or x rays from free electron lasers or attosecond light
sources, but the approach is equally useful in optical strong-field physics. The coherent interaction
of the molecule with the light in a specific charge state is also treated. I set out from an abstract
formulation in terms of the quantum optical notion of system-reservoir interaction using a master
equation in Lindblad form and analyze its short-time approximation. First, I express it in a direct
sum rigged Hilbert space for an efficient solution with numerical methods for systems of differential
equations. Second, I derive a treatment via quantum Monte Carlo wave packet (MCWP) propagation.
The formalism is concretized to diatomic molecules in Born-Oppenheimer approximation whereby
molecular rotation is disregarded. The numerical integration of the master equation is carried
out with a suitably factored density matrix that exploits the locality of the Hamiltonian and the
Lindblad superoperator with respect to the internuclear distance. The formulation of the MCWP
for molecules requires a thorough analysis of the quantum jump process; namely, the dependence
on the continuous distance renders a straight wave packet promotion useless and, instead, a projected
outer product needs to be employed involving an integrated quantum jump operator.
