We present a comprehensive study of two single-reference approaches to singlet biradicaloids.
These two approaches are based on the recently developed regularized orbital-optimized M{\o}ller-Plesset
method ($\kappa$-OOMP2). The first approach is to combine the Yamaguchi's approximate projection
(AP) scheme and $\kappa$-OOMP2 with unrestricted (U) orbitals ($\kappa$-UOOMP2). By capturing
only essential symmetry breaking, $\kappa$-UOOMP2 can serve as a suitable basis for AP. The second
approach is $\kappa$-OOMP2 with complex, restricted (cR) orbitals ($\kappa$-cROOMP2). Though
its applicability is more limited due to the comparative rarity of cR solutions, $\kappa$-cROOMP2
offers a simple framework for describing singlet biradicaloids with complex polarization while
removing artificial spatial symmetry breaking. We compare the scope of these two methods with numerical
studies. We show that AP+$\kappa$-UOOMP2 and $\kappa$-cROOMP2 can perform similarly well in the
TS12 set, a data set that includes 12 data points for triplet-singlet gaps of several atoms and diatomic
molecules with a triplet ground state. This was also found to be true for the barrier height of a reaction
involving attack on a cysteine ion by a singlet oxygen molecule. However, we also demonstrate that
in highly symmetric systems like $\text{C}_{30}$ ($\text{D}_{5h}$) $\kappa$-cROOMP2 is more
suitable as it conserves spatial symmetry. Lastly, we present an organic biradicaloid that does
not have a $\kappa$-cROOMP2 solution in which case only AP+$\kappa$-UOOMP2 is applicable. We recommend
$\kappa$-cROOMP2 whenever complex polarization is essential and AP+$\kappa$-UOOMP2 for biradicaloids
without essential complex polarization but with essential spin-polarization.
