The fungi disperse spores to move across landscapes and spore liberation takes different patterns.
While many species release spores intermittently, others release spores at specific times of day
or night according to intrinsic rhythms. Despite intriguing evidence of diurnal rhythms, why the
timing of spore liberation would matter to a fungus remains an open question. Here we use state-of-the-art
numerical simulations of atmospheric transport with meteorological data to follow the trajectory
of many spores released in the open atmosphere at different times of day, during different seasons
and at different locations across North America. While individual spores follow unpredictable
trajectories due to turbulence, in the aggregate patterns emerge: statistically, spores released
during the day fly for several days, while spores released at night return to the ground within a few
hours. Differences are caused by intense turbulence during the day and weak turbulence at night.
The pattern is widespread but its reliability varies, for example, day/night patterns are stronger
in southern regions, where temperatures are warmer. Results provide a set of testable hypotheses
explaining intermittent and regular patterns of spore release as strategies to maximize spore
survival in the air. Species with short lived spores reproducing where there is strong and regular
turbulence during the day, for example in Mexico, will maximize survival by routinely releasing
spores at night. Where cycles are weak, for example in Canada during spring, there will be no benefit
to releasing spores at the same time every day. We also challenge the perception of atmospheric dispersal
as risky, wasteful, and beyond control of a sporocarp; our data suggest the timing of spore liberation
may be finely tuned by a fungus to maximize fitness during atmospheric transport.
