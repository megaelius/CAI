Integration of nanoporous materials such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with sensitive transducers
can result robust sensing platforms for monitoring gases and chemical vapors for a range of applications.
Here, we report on an integration of the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) MOF with surface
acoustic wave (SAW) and thickness shear mode quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) devices to monitor
carbon dioxide(CO2)and methane (CH4) at ambient conditions. The MOF was directly coated on the
custom fabricated Y-Z LiNbO3 SAW delay lines (operating frequency,f0 = 436 MHz)and AT-cut Quartz
TSM resonators (resonant frequency, f0 = 9 MHz) and the devices were tested for various gases in N2
at ambient condition. The devices were able to detect the changes in CO2 or CH4 concentrations with
relatively higher sensitivity to CO2, which was due to its higher adsorption potential and heavier
molecular weight. The sensors showed full reversibility and repeatability which were attributed
to the physisorption of the gases into the MOF and high stability of the devices. Both types of the
sensors showed linear responses relative to changes in the binary gas compositions thereby allowing
to construct calibration curves which correlated well with the expected mass changes in the sorbent
layer based on mixed-gas gravimetric adsorption isotherms measured on bulk samples.For 200 nm
thick films, the SAW sensitivity to CO2 and CH4 were 1.44x10^-6/vol-%, respectivel yagainst the
QCM sensitivities 0.24x10^-6/vol-% and 1x10^-8/vol-%,respectively which were evaluated as
the fractional change in the signal. The SAW sensors were also evaluated for 100 nm - 300 nm thick films,
the sensitivities of which were found to increase with the thickness due to the increased number
of pores for adsorption of larger amount of gases. Also, the SAW devices had a good wireless response
for detecting gases remotely.
