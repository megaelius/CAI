Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules have been widely adopted in biomedical studies.
As classical point-charge models continue to be used in routine biomolecular applications, there
have been growing demands on developing polarizable force fields for handling more complicated
biomolecular processes. Here we focus on a recently proposed polarizable Gaussian Multipole (pGM)
model for biomolecular simulations. A key benefit of pGM is its screening of all short-range electrostatic
interactions in a physically consistent manner, which is critical for stable charge-fitting and
is needed to reproduce molecular anisotropy. Another advantage of pGM is that each atom's multipoles
are represented by a single Gaussian function or its derivatives, allowing for more efficient electrostatics
than other Gaussian-based models. In this study we present an efficient formulation for the pGM
model defined with respect to a local frame formed with a set of covalent basis vectors. The covalent
basis vectors are chosen to be along each atom's covalent bonding directions. The new local frame
allows molecular flexibility during molecular simulations and facilitates an efficient formulation
of analytical electrostatic forces without explicit torque computation. Subsequent numerical
tests show that analytical atomic forces agree excellently with numerical finite-difference
forces for the tested system. Finally, the new pGM electrostatics algorithm is interfaced with
the PME implementation in Amber for molecular simulations under the periodic boundary conditions.
To validate the overall pGM/PME electrostatics, we conducted an NVE simulation for a small water
box of 512 water molecules. Our results show that, to achieve energy conservation in the polarizable
model, it is important to ensure enough accuracy on both PME and induction iteration.
