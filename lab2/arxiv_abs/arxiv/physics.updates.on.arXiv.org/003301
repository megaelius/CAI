We study thermal processes in infinite harmonic crystals having a unit cell with arbitrary number
of particles. Initially particles have zero displacements and random velocities, corresponding
to some initial temperature profile. Our main goal is to calculate spatial distribution of kinetic
temperatures, corresponding to degrees of freedom of the unit cell, at any moment in time. An approximate
expression for the temperatures is derived from solution of lattice dynamics equations. It is shown
that the temperatures are represented as a sum of two terms. The first term describes high-frequency
oscillations of the temperatures caused by local transition to thermal equilibrium at short times.
The second term describes slow changes of the temperature profile caused by ballistic heat transport.
It is shown, in particular, that local values of temperatures, corresponding to degrees of freedom
of the unit cell, are generally different even if their initial values are equal. Analytical findings
are supported by results of numerical solution of lattice dynamics equations for diatomic chain
and graphene lattice. Presented theory may serve for description of unsteady ballistic heat transport
in real crystals with low concentration of defects. In particular, solution of the problem with
sinusoidal temperature profile can be used for proper interpretation of experimental data obtained
by the transient thermal grating technique. Keywords: ballistic heat transport; heat transfer;
