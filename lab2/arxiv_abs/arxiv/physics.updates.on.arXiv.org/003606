We report experimental observations of two canonical surface wave patterns --- ship waves and ring
waves --- skewed by sub-surface shear, thus confirming effects predicted by recent theory. Observed
ring waves on a still surface with sub-surface shear current are strikingly asymmetric, an effect
of strongly anisotropic wave dispersion. Ship waves for motion across a sub--surface current on
a still surface exhibit striking asymmetry about the ship's line of motion, and large differences
in wake angle and transverse wavelength for upstream vs downstream motion are demonstrated, all
of which in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Neither of these phenomena can occur on
a depth-uniform current. A quantitative comparison of measured vs predicted average phase shift
for a ring wave is grossly mispredicted by no-shear theory, but in good agreement with predictions
for the measured shear current. A clear difference in wave frequency within the ring wave packet
is observed in the upstream vs downstream direction for all shear flows, while it conforms with theory
for quiescent water for propagation normal to the shear current, as expected. Peak values of the
measured 2-dimensional Fourier spectrum for ship waves are shown to agree well with the predicted
criterion of stationary ship waves, with the exception of some cases where results are imperfect
due to the limited wave-number resolution, transient effects and/or experimental noise. Experiments
were performed on controlled shear currents created in two different ways, with a curved mesh, and
beneath a blocked stagnant-surface flow. Velocity profiles were measured with particle image
velocimetry, and surface waves with a synthetic schlieren method. Our observations lend strong
empirical support to recent predictions that wave forces on vessels and structures can be greatly
affected by shear in estuarine and tidal waters.
