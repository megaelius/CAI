Over the last two decades, prototype devices for future classical and quantum computing technologies
have been fabricated, by using scanning tunneling microscopy and hydrogen resist lithography
to position phosphorus atoms in silicon with atomic-scale precision. Despite these successes,
phosphine remains the only donor precursor molecule to have been demonstrated as compatible with
the hydrogen resist lithography technique. The potential benefits of atomic-scale placement
of alternative dopant species have, until now, remained unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate
successful fabrication of atomic-scale structures of arsenic-in-silicon. Using a scanning tunneling
microscope tip, we pattern a monolayer hydrogen mask to selectively place arsenic atoms on the Si(001)
surface using arsine as the precursor molecule. We fully elucidate the surface chemistry and reaction
pathways of arsine on Si(001), revealing significant differences to phosphine. We explain how
these differences result in enhanced surface immobilization and in-plane confinement of arsenic
compared to phosphorus, and a dose-rate independent arsenic saturation density of $0.24{\pm}0.04$
ML. We demonstrate the successful encapsulation of arsenic delta-layers using silicon molecular
beam epitaxy, and find electrical characteristics that are competitive with equivalent structures
fabricated with phosphorus. Arsenic delta-layers are also found to offer improvement in out-of-plane
confinement compared to similarly prepared phosphorus layers, while still retaining >80% carrier
activation and sheet resistances of $<2 k{\Omega}/{\square}$. These excellent characteristics
of arsenic represent opportunities to enhance existing capabilities of atomic-scale fabrication
of dopant structures in silicon, and are particularly important for three-dimensional devices,
where vertical control of the position of device components is critical.
