Over the last years extraordinary advances in experimental and theoretical tools have allowed
us to monitor and control matter at short time and atomic scales with a high-degree of precision.
An appealing and challenging route towards engineering materials with tailored properties is
to find ways to design or selectively manipulate materials, especially at the quantum level. To
this end, having a state-of-the-art ab initio computer simulation tool that enables a reliable
and accurate simulation of light-induced changes in the physical and chemical properties of complex
systems is of utmost importance. The first principles real-space-based Octopus project was born
with that idea in mind, providing an unique framework allowing to describe non-equilibrium phenomena
in molecular complexes, low dimensional materials, and extended systems by accounting for electronic,
ionic, and photon quantum mechanical effects within a generalized time-dependent density functional
theory framework. The present article aims to present the new features that have been implemented
over the last few years, including technical developments related to performance and massive parallelism.
We also describe the major theoretical developments to address ultrafast light-driven processes,
like the new theoretical framework of quantum electrodynamics density-functional formalism
(QEDFT) for the description of novel light-matter hybrid states. Those advances, and other being
released soon as part of the Octopus package, will enable the scientific community to simulate and
characterize spatial and time-resolved spectroscopies, ultrafast phenomena in molecules and
materials, and new emergent states of matter (QED-materials).
