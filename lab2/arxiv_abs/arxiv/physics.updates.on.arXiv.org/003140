Minkowski space serves as a framework for the theoretical constructions that deal with manifestations
of relativistic effects in physical phenomena. But neither Minkowski himself nor the subsequent
developers of the relativity theory have provided a reasonable rationale for this mathematical
construct. In physics, such a rationale should show lower-level statements that determine where
the proposed mathematical structure is applicable and yield formal premises for proving its existence.
The above failure has apparently been due to the features of the adopted formalism based on the unjustifiably
exclusive use of coordinates in the theoretical analysis of physical phenomena, which ignores
the necessity of having physical grounds for mathematical concepts. In particular, the use of a
coordinate transformation between two inertial reference frames makes the consideration so cumbersome
that it appears useless for solving the fundamental problems of physical theory, including the
question of whether Minkowski space exists. In contrast, a straightforward calculation proves
that the transformation of the time and the position vector of a physical event between two physical
spaces establishes an equivalence relation between pairs made of these variables. This means the
existence of Minkowski space and shows that the premises for its proof are the same as for the coordinate-free
derivation of basic effects of the special relativity theory: the use of Einsteinian time variable
and motions of particles able to interact with each other and electromagnetic field over a short
spatial range only. The high degeneracy of free motions of point particles, together with the intricacy
of the above mentioned calculation, suggests that a further generalization of Minkowski space
is beyond belief, so that the modification or even the abandonment of the concept of spacetime seems
quite natural.
