Motor enzymes are remarkable molecular machines that use the energy derived from the hydrolysis
of a nucleoside triphosphate to generate mechanical movement, achieved through different steps
that constitute their kinetic cycle. These macromolecules, nowadays investigated with advanced
experimental techniques to unveil their molecular mechanisms and the properties of their kinetic
cycles, are implicated in many biological processes, ranging from biopolymerisation (RNA polymerases,
ribosomes,...) to intracellular transport (motor proteins such as kinesins or dyneins). Although
the kinetics of individual motors is well studied on both theoretical and experimental grounds,
the repercussions of their stepping cycle on the collective dynamics is still to be understood.
Advances in this direction will improve our comprehension of transport process in the natural intracellular
medium, where processive motor enzymes might operate in crowded conditions. In this work, we therefore
extend the current statistical kinetic analysis to study collective transport phenomena of motors
in terms of lattice gas models belonging to the exclusion process class. Via numerical simulations,
we show how to interpret and use the randomness calculated from single particle trajectories in
crowded conditions. Importantly, we also show that time fluctuations and non-Poissonian behavior
are intrinsically related to spatial correlations and the emergence of large, but finite, clusters
of co-moving motors. The properties unveiled by our analysis have important biological implications
on the collective transport characteristics of processive motor enzymes in crowded conditions.
