The reliable statistical characterization of the spatial and temporal properties of large earthquakes
occurrence is one of the most debated issues in seismic hazard assessment, due to the unavoidably
limited observations from past events. We show that pattern recognition techniques, which are
designed in a formal and testable way, may provide significant space-time constraints about impending
strong earthquakes. This information, when combined with physically sound methods for ground
shaking computation, like the neo-deterministic approach (NDSHA), may produce effectively preventive
seismic hazard maps. Pattern recognition analysis of morphostructural data provide quantitative
and systematic criteria for identifying the areas prone to the largest events, taking into account
a wide set of possible geophysical and geological data, whilst the formal identification of precursory
seismicity patterns (by means of CN and M8S algorithms), duly validated by prospective testing,
provides useful constraints about impending strong earthquakes at the intermediate space-time
scale. According to a multi-scale approach, the information about the areas where a strong earthquake
is likely to occur can be effectively integrated with different observations (e.g. geodetic and
satellite data), including regional scale modeling of the stress field variations and of the seismic
ground shaking, so as to identify a set of priority areas for detailed investigations of short-term
precursors at local scale and for microzonation studies. Results from the pattern recognition
of earthquake prone areas (M>=5.0) in the Po plain (Northern Italy), as well as from prospective
testing and validation of the time-dependent NDSHA scenarios are presented.
