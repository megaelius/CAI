Thermal spraying has been present for over a century, being greatly refined and optimised during
this time, becoming nowadays a reliable and cost-efficient method to deposit thick coatings with
a wide variety of feedstock materials and substrates. Thermal sprayed coatings have been successfully
applied in fields such as aerospace or electricity production, becoming an essential component
of today's industry. To overpass the traditional capabilities of those coatings, new functionalities
and coherent responses are being integrated, opening the field of functional and smart coatings.
The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of the current state of functional and smart
coatings produced using thermal spraying deposition. It will first describe the different thermal
spraying technologies, with a focus on how different techniques achieve the thermal and kinetic
energy required to form a coating, as well as the environment to which feedstock particles are exposed
in terms of temperature and velocity. It will then deal with the state-of-the-art functional and
smart coatings applied using thermal spraying techniques, with a discussion on the fundamentals
on which the coatings are designed, the efficiency of its performance and the industrial applications,
both current and potential. The inherent designing flexibility of thermal sprayed functional
and smart coatings has been exploited to explore exciting new possibilities on many different fields.
Applications such as anti-bacterial and anti-fouling coatings, superhydrophobic surfaces,
electrical and heating devices for functional coatings and self-healing, self-lubricating and
sensors for smart coatings are here presented and discussed. All these exciting developments pave
the way for the numerous applications that are to come in the next decade, making the field of thermal
sprayed coatings a unique opportunity for research.
