Compound-specific chlorine isotope analysis (CSIA-Cl) is a practicable and high-performance
approach for quantification of transformation processes and pollution source apportionment
of chlorinated organic compounds. This study developed a CSIA-Cl method for perchlorethylene
(PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) using gas chromatography-double focus magnetic-sector high
resolution mass spectrometry (GC-DFS-HRMS) with a bracketing injection mode. The achieved highest
precision for PCE was 0.021% (standard deviation of isotope ratios), and that for TCE was 0.025%.
When one standard was used as the external isotopic standard for another of the same analyte, the
lowest standard deviations of relative isotope-ratio variations ({\delta}37Cl') between the
two corresponding standards were 0.064% and 0.080% for PCE and TCE, respectively. As a result, the
critical {\delta}37Cl' for differentiating two isotope ratios are 0.26% and 0.32% for PCE and TCE,
respectively, which are comparable with those in some reported studies using GC-quadrupole MS
(GC-qMS). The lower limit of detection for CSIA-Cl of PCE was 0.1 ug/mL (0.1 ng on column), and that
for TCE was determined to be 1.0 ug/mL (1.0 ng on column). Two isotope ratio calculation schemes,
i.e., a scheme using complete molecular-ion isotopologues and another one using a pair of neighboring
isotopologues, were evaluated in terms of precision and accuracy. The complete-isotopologue
scheme showed evidently higher precision and was deduced to be more competent to reflect trueness
in comparison with the isotopologue-pair scheme. The CSIA-Cl method developed in this study will
be conducive to future studies concerning transformation processes and source apportionment
of PCE and TCE, and light the ways to method development of CSIA-Cl for more organochlorines.
