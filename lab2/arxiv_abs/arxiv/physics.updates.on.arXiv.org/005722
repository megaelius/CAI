Traditionally, scholars in physics education research pay attention to students solving well-structured
learning activities, which provide restricted room for collaboration and idea-generation due
to their close-ended nature. In order to encourage the socialization of information among group
members, we utilized a real-world problem where students were asked to generate a well-structured
physics task, and investigated how student groups collaborated to create physics problems for
younger students at an introductory physics course at a university in northern Chile. Data collection
consists of audio recording the group discussions while they were collaborating to develop their
physics problems as well as the solutions they created to their problems. Through interviews, we
accessed students' perceptions on the task and its challenges. Results suggest that generating
problems is an opportunity for students to propose ideas and make decisions regarding the goals
of the problem, concepts and procedures, contextual details and magnitudes and units to introduce
in their generated problems. In addition, we found evidence that groups tested the validity of their
creations by engaging in strategies often observed with algebra-based physics problems, such
as mathematical procedures and qualitative descriptions of the physics embedded in the problem,
yet groups invested more time with algebra-based strategies compared to more qualitative descriptions.
Students valued the open-ended nature of the task and recognized its benefits in utilizing physics
ideas into context, which in turn enabled collaboration in a way not experienced with traditional
algebra-based problems. These findings support the use of generative activities as a pathway for
students to engage in real-world physics problems that allow for a range and variety of collective
processes and ideas.
