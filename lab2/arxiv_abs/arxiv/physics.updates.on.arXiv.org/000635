Although riparian vegetation is present in or along many water courses of the world, its active role
resulting from the interaction with flow and sediment processes has only recently become an active
field of research. Especially, the role of vegetation in the process of river pattern formation
has been explored and demonstrated mostly experimentally and numerically until now. In the present
work, we shed light on this subject by performing a linear stability analysis on a simple model for
riverbed vegetation dynamics coupled with the set of classical river morphodynamic equations.
The vegetation model only accounts for logistic growth, local positive feedback through seeding
and resprouting, and mortality by means of uprooting through flow shear stress. Due to the simplicity
of the model, we can transform the set of equations into an eigenvalue problem and assess the stability
of the linearized equations when slightly perturbated away from a spatially homogeneous solution.
If we couple vegetation dynamics with a 1D morphodynamic framework, we observe that instability
towards long sediment waves is possible due to competitive interaction between vegetation growth
and mortality. Moreover, the domain in the parameter space where perturbations are amplified was
found to be simply connected. Subsequently, we proceed to the analysis of vegetation dynamics coupled
with a 2D morphodynamic framework, which can be used to evaluate instability towards alternate
and multiple bars. It is found that two kinds of instabilities, which are discriminated mainly by
the Froude number, occur in a connected domain in the parameter space. At lower Froude number, instability
is mainly governed by sediment dynamics and leads to the formation of alternate and multiple bars
while at higher Froude number instability is driven by vegetation dynamics, which only allows for
alternate bars.
