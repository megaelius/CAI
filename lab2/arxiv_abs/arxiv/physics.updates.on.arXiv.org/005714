Macroscopic growth laws, solutions of mean field equations, describe in an effective way an underlying
complex dynamics. They are applied to study the spreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD-19,
where the counting of the cumulated number $N(t)$ of detected infected individuals is a generally
accepted, coarse-grain, variable to understand the epidemic phase. However $N(t)$ does not take
into account the unknown number of asymptomatic, not detected, cases $A(t)$. Therefore, the question
arises if the observed time series of data of $N(t)$ is a reliable tool for monitoring the evolution
of the infectious disease. We study a system of coupled differential equations which includes the
dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and the strong containment
effects due to the social isolation. The solution is therefore compared with a macroscopic law for
the population $N(t)$ coming from a single, non-linear, differential equation with no explicit
reference to $A(t)$, showing the equivalence of the two methods. Indeed, $N(t)$ takes into account
a more complex and detailed population dynamics which permits the evaluation of the number of asymptomatic
individuals also. The model is then applied to Covid-19 spreading in Italy where a transition from
an exponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for $N(t)$ has been observed in more recent data. Then
the information contained in the data analysis of $N(t)$ is reliable to understand the epidemic
phase, although it does not describe the total infected population. The asymptomatic population
is larger than the symptomatic one in the fast growth phase of the spreading.
