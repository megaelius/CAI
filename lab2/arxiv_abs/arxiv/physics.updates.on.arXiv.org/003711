In this manuscript, we will discuss the construction of covariant derivative operator in quantum
gravity. We will find it is more perceptive to use affine connections more general than metric compatible
connections in quantum gravity. We will demonstrate this using the canonical quantization procedure.
This is valid irrespective of the presence and nature of sources. The Palatini and metric-affine
formalisms, where metric and affine connections are the independent variables, are not sufficient
to construct a source-free theory of gravity with affine connections more general than the metric
compatible Levi-Civita connections. This is also valid for many minimally coupled interacting
theories where sources only couple with metric by using the Levi-Civita connections exclusively.
We will discuss potential formalism of affine connections to introduce affine connections more
general than metric compatible connections in gravity. We will also discuss possible extensions
of the actions for this purpose. General affine connections introduce new fields in gravity besides
metric. In this article, we will consider a simple potential formalism with symmetric Ricci tensor.
Corresponding affine connections introduce two massless scalar fields. One of these fields contributes
a stress-tensor with opposite sign to the sources of Einstein's equation when we state the equation
using the Levi-Civita connections. This means we have a massless scalar field with negative stress-tensor
in the familiar Einstein equation. These scalar fields can be useful to explain dark energy and inflation.
These fields bring us beyond strict local Minkowski geometries.
