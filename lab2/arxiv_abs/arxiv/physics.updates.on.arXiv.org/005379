The energy extraction and vortex dynamics from the sinusoidal heaving and pitching motion of an
elliptical hydrofoil is explored through large-eddy simulations (LES) at a Reynolds number of
$50,000$. The LES is able to capture the time-dependent vortex shedding and dynamic stall properties
of the foil as it undergoes high relative angles of attack. Results of the computations are validated
against experimental flume data in terms of power extraction and leading edge vortex (LEV) position
and trajectory. The kinematics for optimal efficiency are found in the range of heave amplitude
$h_o/c=0.5-1$ and pitch amplitude $\theta_o=60^{\circ}-65^{\circ}$ for $fc/U_{\infty}=0.1$
and of $h_o/c=1-1.5$ and $\theta_o=75^{\circ}-85^{\circ}$ for $fc/U_{\infty}=0.15$. Direct
comparison with low Reynolds number simulations and experiments demonstrate strong agreement
in energy harvesting performance between Reynolds numbers of $1000$ to $50,000$, with the high
Reynolds number flows demonstrating a moderate $0.8-6.7\%$ increase in power compared to the low
Reynolds number flow. In the high Reynolds number flows, the coherent LEV, which is critical for
high-efficiency energy conversion, forms earlier and is slightly stronger, resulting in more
power extraction. After the LEV is shed from the foil, the LEV trajectory is demonstrated to be relatively
independent of Reynolds number, but has a very strong nonlinear dependence with kinematics. It
is shown that the LEV trajectories are highly influenced by the heave and pitch amplitudes as well
as the oscillation frequency. This has strong implications for arrays of oscillating foils since
the coherent LEVs can influence the energy extraction efficiency and performance of downstream
foils.
