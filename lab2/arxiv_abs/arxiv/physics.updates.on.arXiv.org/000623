The kinetic energy balance in Rayleigh--B\'{e}nard convection is investigated for the Prandtl
number range $0.01\le Pr \le 150$ and for fixed Rayleigh number $Ra=5\cdot10^{6}$. The kinetic
energy balance is divided into a dissipation, a production and a flux term. We discuss profiles of
all terms and find that the different contributions to the energy balance can be spatially separated
into regions where kinetic energy is produced and where kinetic energy is dissipated. Analysing
the Prandtl number dependence of the kinetic energy balance, we show that the height-dependence
of the mean viscous dissipation is closely related to the flux of kinetic energy. We show that the
flux of kinetic energy can be divided into four additive contributions, each representing a different
elementary physical process (advection, buoyancy, normal viscous stresses and viscous shear
stresses). The behaviour of these individual flux contributions is found to be surprisingly rich
and exhibits a pronounced Prandtl number dependence. Different flux contributions dominate the
kinetic energy transport at different depth, such that a comprehensive discussion requires a decomposition
of the domain into a considerable number of sub-layers. On a less detailed level, our results reveal
that advective kinetic energy fluxes play a key role in balancing the near-wall dissipation at low
Prandtl number, whereas normal viscous stresses are particularly important at high Prandtl number.
Finally, our work reveals that classical velocity boundary layers are deeply connected to the kinetic
energy transport, but fail to correctly represent regions of enhanced viscous dissipation.
