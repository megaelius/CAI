The performance of high-order gas-kinetic scheme (HGKS) has been investigated for the direct numerical
simulation (DNS) of isotropic compressible turbulence up to the supersonic regime. Due to the multi-scale
nature and coupled temporal-spatial evolution process, HGKS provides a valid tool for the numerical
simulation of compressible turbulent flow. Based on the domain decomposition and message passing
interface (MPI), a parallel HGKS code is developed for large-scale computation in this paper. The
standard tests from the nearly incompressible flow to the supersonic one, including Taylor-Green
vortex problem, turbulent channel flow and isotropic compressible turbulence, are presented
to validate the parallel scalability, efficiency, accuracy and robustness of parallel implementation.
The performance of HGKS for the nearly incompressible turbulence is comparable with the high-order
finite difference scheme, including the resolution of flow structure and efficiency of computation.
Based on the accuracy of the numerical solution, the numerical dissipation of the scheme in the turbulence
simulation is quantitatively evaluated. As a mesoscopic method, HGKS performs better than both
lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS), due to its high-order
accuracy. Meanwhile, based on the kinetic formulation HGKS shows advantage for supersonic turbulent
flow simulation with its accuracy and robustness. The current work demonstrates the capability
of HGKS as a powerful DNS tool from the low speed to supersonic turbulence study, which is less reported
under the framework of finite volume scheme.
