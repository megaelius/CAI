Many fluctuation-driven phenomena in fluids can be analysed effectively using the generalised
Lagrangian mean (GLM) theory of Andrews & McIntyre (1978). This theory relies on particle-following
averaging to incorporate the constraints imposed by the material conservations. It relies implicitly
on an Euclidean structure; as a result, it does not have a geometrically intrinsic interpretation
and suffers from undesirable features, including the divergence of the Lagrangian-mean velocity
for incompressible fluids. Motivated by this, we develop a geometric generalisation of GLM that
we formulate intrinsically. The theory applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds; it also establishes
a clear distinction between results that stem directly from geometric consistency and those that
depend on particular choices. We show that the Lagrangian mean momentum -- the average of the pull-back
of the momentum one-form -- obeys a simple equation which guarantees the conservation of Kelvin's
circulation, irrespective of the mean-flow definition. We discuss four possible definitions
of the mean flow: a direct extension of standard GLM, a definition based on optimal transportation,
a definition based on a geodesic distance in the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, and
the glm definition proposed by Soward & Roberts (2010). Assuming small-amplitude perturbations,
we carry out order-by-order calculations to obtain explicit expressions for the mean flow and pseudomomentum
at leading order. We also show how the wave-action conservation of GLM extends to the geometric setting.
To make the paper self-contained, we introduce the tools of differential geometry and main ideas
of geometric fluid dynamics on which we rely. We mostly focus on the Euler equations for incompressible
inviscid fluids but sketch out extensions to the rotating-stratified Boussinesq, compressible
Euler and magnetohydrodynamic equations.
