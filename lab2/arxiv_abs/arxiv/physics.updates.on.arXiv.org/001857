Interactions between people and ecological systems, through leisure or tourism activities, form
a complex socio-ecological spatial network. The analysis of the benefits people derive from their
interactions with nature - also referred to as cultural ecosystem services (CES) - enables a better
understanding of these socio-ecological systems. In the age of information, the increasing availability
of large social media databases enables a better understanding of complex socio-ecological interactions
at an unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. Within this context, we model and analyze these
interactions based on information extracted from geotagged photographs embedded into a multiscale
socio-ecological network. We apply this approach to 16 case study sites in Europe using a social
media database (Flickr) containing more than 150,000 validated and classified photographs. After
evaluating the representativeness of the network, we investigate the impact of visitors' origin
on the distribution of socio-ecological interactions at different scales. First at a global scale,
we develop a spatial measure of attractiveness and use this to identify four groups of sites. Then,
at a local scale, we explore how the distance traveled by the users to reach a site affects the way they
interact with this site in space and time. The approach developed here, integrating social media
data into a network-based framework, offers a new way of visualizing and modeling interactions
between humans and landscapes. Results provide valuable insights for understanding relationship
between social demands for CES and the places of their realization, thus allowing for the development
of more efficient conservation and planning strategies.
