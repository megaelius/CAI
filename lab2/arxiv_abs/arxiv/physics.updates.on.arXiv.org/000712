Developing avoidance or mitigation strategies of runaway electrons (RE) in magnetic confinement
fusion (MCF) plasmas is of crucial importance for the safe operation of ITER. In order to develop
these strategies, an accurate diagnostic capability that allows good estimates of the RE distribution
function in these plasmas is needed. Synchrotron radiation (SR) of RE in MCF, besides of being one
of the main damping mechanisms for RE in the high energy relativistic regime, is routinely used in
current MCF experiments to infer the parameters of RE energy and pitch angle distribution functions.
In the present paper we address the long standing question about what are the relationships between
different RE distribution functions and their corresponding synchrotron emission simultaneously
including: full-orbit effects, information of the spectral and angular distribution of SR of each
electron, and basic geometric optics of a camera. We study the spatial distribution of the SR on the
poloidal plane, and the statistical properties of the expected value of the synchrotron spectra
of runaway electrons. We observe a strong dependence of the synchrotron emission measured by the
camera on the pitch angle distribution of RE, namely we find that crescent shapes of the spatial distribution
of the SR as measured by the camera relate to RE distributions with small pitch angles, while ellipse
shapes relate to distributions of runaways with larger the pitch angles. A weak dependence of the
synchrotron emission measured by the camera with the RE energy, value of the q-profile at the edge,
and the chosen range of wavelengths is observed. Furthermore, we find that oversimplifying the
angular dependence of the SR changes the shape of the synchrotron spectra, and overestimates its
amplitude by approximately 20 times for avalanching RE and by approximately 60 times for mono-energetic
distributions of runaways.
