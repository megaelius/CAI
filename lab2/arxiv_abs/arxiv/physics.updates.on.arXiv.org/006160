State-of-the-art optical clocks achieve fractional precisions of $10^{-18}$ and below using
ensembles of atoms in optical lattices or individual ions in radio-frequency traps. Promising
candidates for novel clocks are highly charged ions (HCIs) and nuclear transitions, which are largely
insensitive to external perturbations and reach wavelengths beyond the optical range, now becoming
accessible to frequency combs. However, insufficiently accurate atomic structure calculations
still hinder the identification of suitable transitions in HCIs. Here, we report on the discovery
of a long-lived metastable electronic state in a HCI by measuring the mass difference of the ground
and the excited state in Re, the first non-destructive, direct determination of an electronic excitation
energy. This result agrees with our advanced calculations, and we confirmed them with an Os ion with
the same electronic configuration. We used the high-precision Penning-trap mass spectrometer
PENTATRAP, unique in its synchronous use of five individual traps for simultaneous mass measurements.
The cyclotron frequency ratio $R$ of the ion in the ground state to the metastable state could be determined
to a precision of $\delta R=1\cdot 10^{-11}$, unprecedented in the heavy atom regime. With a lifetime
of about 130 days, the potential soft x-ray frequency reference at $\nu=4.86\cdot 10^{16}\,\text{Hz}$
has a linewidth of only $\Delta \nu\approx 5\cdot 10^{-8}\,\text{Hz}$, and one of the highest electronic
quality factor ($Q=\frac{\nu}{\Delta \nu}\approx 10^{24}$) ever seen in an experiment. Our low
uncertainty enables searching for more HCI soft x-ray clock transitions, needed for promising
precision studies of fundamental physics in a thus far unexplored frontier.
