We conduct two- and three-dimensional simulations for double diffusive convection in the diffusive
regime, where the fluid flow is driven by a destabilizing temperature gradient and stabilized by
a stably stratified salinity gradient. We study how the heat flux, Reynolds number, and flow structures
change with the density ratio $\Lambda$, which is the ratio of the buoyancy force induced by the salinity
gradient to that by the temperature gradient. When $\Lambda$ increases from zero, the flow first
behaves similarly as in pure Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection, both with respect to flow structure
and to heat transport. The linear stability analysis of Baines & Gill (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 37, 1969,
pp. 289-306) had estimated the critical density ratio $\Lambda_c$, above which the flow becomes
stable. However, here we show that by using a large-scale circulation as initial condition (rather
than the linear profiles assumed in the linear stability analysis), DDC in the diffusive regime
can exhibit subcritical behaviour when $\Lambda > \Lambda_c$, i.e., coexistence of states at the
same control parameters. Even though the density ratio becomes thousands times that of the critical
value $\Lambda_c$, there is still convection with strongly enhanced heat transfer properties
compared to the pure conduction case. We reveal the corresponding flow structures and find an unstably-stratified
region sandwiched between two stably-stratified layers. Our results demonstrate the importance
of the initial condition for DDC in the diffusive regime, especially in the situation of a large density
ratio, which occurs in high-latitude ocean regions.
