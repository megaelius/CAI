We show that monochromatic long-crested corrugations on an otherwise flat seafloor can coherently
scatter the energy of an oblique incident internal wave to multiple multi-directional higher-mode
waves via a series of resonant interactions. We demonstrate that a resonance between seabed corrugations
and a normally or slightly oblique incident internal wave results in a series of follow-up resonant
interactions, which take place between the same corrugations and successively resonated shorter
waves. A chain resonance of internal waves that carries energy to small scales is thus obtained,
and we find that the Richardson number decreases by several orders of magnitude over the corrugated
patch. If the incidence angle is large, and the incident wave perfectly satisfies a resonance condition
with the topography, it turns out that not many higher-mode resonance or near-resonance conditions
can be satisfied, such that energy stays confined within the first few modes. Nevertheless, if the
incident waves are sufficiently detuned from satisfying a perfect resonance condition with the
seabed corrugations, then we show that this frequency detuning may balance off the large detuning
due to oblique incidence, leading to a chain resonance that again carries energy to small scales.
The evolution of the incident and resonated wave amplitudes is predicted from the envelope equation
for internal waves over resonant seabed topography in a three-dimensional rotating fluid, which
we derive considering the Boussinesq and $f$-plane approximations with $f$ the Coriolis frequency,
linear density stratification and small-amplitude corrugations. Our results suggest that topographic
features on the ocean floor with a dominant wavenumber vector, through the chain resonance mechanism
elucidated here, may play a more important role than previously thought in the enhancement of diapycnal
mixing and energy dissipation.
