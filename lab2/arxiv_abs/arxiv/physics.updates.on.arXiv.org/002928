Understanding the thermodynamics of the duplication process is a fundamental step towards a comprehensive
physical theory of biological systems. However, the immense complexity of real cells obscures
the fundamental tensions between energy gradients and entropic contributions that underlie duplication.
The study of synthetic, feasible systems reproducing part of the key ingredients of living entities
but overcoming major sources of biological complexity is of great relevance to deepen the comprehension
of the fundamental thermodynamic processes underlying life and its prevalence. In this paper an
abstract -- yet realistic -- synthetic system made of small synthetic protocell aggregates is studied
in detail. A fundamental relation between free energy and entropic gradients is derived for a general,
non-equilibrium scenario, setting the thermodynamic conditions for the occurrence and prevalence
of duplication phenomena. This relation sets explicitly how the energy gradients invested in creating
and maintaining structural -- and eventually, functional -- elements of the system must always
compensate the entropic gradients, whose contributions come from changes in the translational,
configurational and macrostate entropies, as well as from dissipation due to irreversible transitions.
Work/energy relations are also derived, defining lower bounds on the energy required for the duplication
event to take place. A specific example including real ternary emulsions is provided in order to
grasp the orders of magnitude involved in the problem. It is found that the minimal work invested
over the system to trigger a duplication event is around $\sim 10^{-13}{\rm J}$. Without aiming
to describe a truly biological process of duplication, this theoretical contribution seeks to
explicitly define and identify the key actors that participate in it.
