Precise spectroscopic analysis of polyatomic molecules enables many striking advances in physical
chemistry and fundamental physics. We use several new high-resolution spectroscopic devices
to improve our understanding of the rotational and rovibrational structure of methyltrioxorhenium
(MTO), the achiral parent of a family of large oxorhenium compounds that are ideal candidate species
for a planned measurement of parity violation in chiral molecules. Using millimetre-wave and infrared
spectroscopy in a pulsed supersonic jet, a cryogenic buffer gas cell, and room temperature absorption
cells, we probe the ground state and the Re=O antisymmetric and symmetric stretching excited states
of both CH3 187 ReO3 and CH3 185 ReO3 isotopologues in the gas phase with unprecedented precision.
By extending the rotational spectra to the 150-300 GHz range, we characterize the ground state rotational
and hyperfine structure up to J = 43 and K = 41, resulting in refinements to the rotational, quartic
and hyperfine parameters, and the determination of sextic parameters and a centrifugal distortion
correction to the quadrupolar hyperfine constant. We obtain rovibrational data for temperatures
between 6 and 300 K in the 970-1015 cm-1 range, at resolutions down to 8 MHz and accuracies of 30 MHz.
We use these data to determine more precise excited-state rotational, Coriolis and quartic parameters,
as well as the ground-state centrifugal distortion parameter D K of the 187 Re isotopologue. We also
account for hyperfine structure in the rovibrational transitions and hence determine the upper
state rhenium atom quadrupole coupling constant eQq' .
