We combine theory, numerical simulation and experiments to investigate the breakup of two identical
droplets entering a Y-junction with controlled spatial offset by which the second droplet trails
the first. Based on fully resolved 3D simulations, we describe the flow physics leading to breakup.
Scaling arguments, numerical simulation and experiments consistently show that for small initial
offset, breakup always occurs with the droplet fragment volume depending linearly on the offset.
Above a critical offset, which increases with the capillary number, the droplets enter the constriction
sequentially without breakup. Our results are relevant for understanding the breakup behavior
in a dense emulsion flowing through a linearly converging channel leading to a constriction. Such
geometry is commonly used for the serial interrogation of droplet content in droplet microfluidic
applications, where droplet breakup can limit the maximum throughput for such process. For capillary
numbers up to $Ca\simeq10^{-2}$, the results from the two-droplet system in a Y-junction are consistent
with breakup observations in dense emulsions flowing through a linearly converging channel. The
deterministic relation between initial offset and resulting breakup in the two-droplet system
suggests that the stochasticity that is observed in the breakup of a dense emulsion arises from multi-droplet
interactions. The numerical value of the prefactor in the linear relation between initial offset
and droplet fragment volume determined from experiments differs slightly from the one extracted
from fully resolved numerical simulations. This discrepancy suggests that even at very high bulk
surfactant concentrations, the rate-limiting surfactant adsorption kinetics allows for Marangoni
stresses to develop and modify the droplet dynamics.
