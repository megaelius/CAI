The Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA) is designed to solve fully connected quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization (QUBO) problems. It is implemented on application-specific CMOS hardware
and currently solves problems of up to 1024 variables. The DA's algorithm is currently based on simulated
annealing; however, it differs from it in its utilization of an efficient parallel-trial scheme
and a dynamic escape mechanism. In addition, the DA exploits the massive parallelization that custom
application-specific CMOS hardware allows. We compare the performance of the DA to simulated annealing
and parallel tempering with isoenergetic cluster moves on two-dimensional and fully connected
spin-glass problems with bimodal and Gaussian couplings. These represent the respective limits
of sparse versus dense problems, as well as high-degeneracy versus low-degeneracy problems. Our
results show that the DA currently exhibits a time-to-solution speedup of roughly two orders of
magnitude for fully connected spin-glass problems with bimodal or Gaussian couplings, over the
single-core implementations of simulated annealing and parallel tempering Monte Carlo used in
this study. The DA does not appear to exhibit a speedup for sparse two-dimensional spin-glass problems,
which we explain on theoretical grounds. We also benchmarked an early implementation of the Parallel
Tempering DA. Our results suggest an improved scaling over the other algorithms for fully connected
problems of average difficulty with bimodal disorder. The next generation of the DA is expected
to be able to solve fully connected problems up to 8192 variables in size. This would enable the study
of fundamental physics problems and industrial applications that were previously inaccessible
using standard computing hardware or special-purpose quantum annealing machines.
