In mammals, most cells in the brain and peripheral tissues generate circadian (~24hr) rhythms autonomously.
These self-sustained rhythms are coordinated and entrained by a master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN). Within the SCN, the individual rhythms of each neuron are synchronized through intercellular
signaling. One important feature of SCN is that the synchronized period is close to the cell population
mean of intrinsic periods. In this way, the synchronized period of the SCN stays close to the periods
of cells in peripheral tissues. This is important for SCN to entrain cells throughout the body. However,
the mechanism that drives the period of the coupled SCN cells to the population mean is not known.
We use mathematical modeling and analysis to show that the mechanism of transcription repression
plays a pivotal role in regulating the coupled period. Specifically, we use phase response curve
analysis to show that the coupled period within the SCN stays near the population mean if transcriptional
repression occurs via protein sequestration. In contrast, the coupled period is far from the mean
if repression occurs through highly nonlinear Hill-type regulation (e.g. oligomer- or phosphorylation-based
repression). Furthermore, we find that the timescale of intercellular coupling needs to be fast
compared to that of intracellular feedback to maintain the mean period. These findings reveal the
important relationship between the intracellular transcriptional feedback loop and intercellular
coupling. This relationship explains why transcriptional repression appears to occur via protein
sequestration in multicellular organisms, mammals and Drosophila, in contrast with the phosphorylation-based
repression in unicellular organisms. That is, transition to protein sequestration is essential
for synchronizing multiple cells with a period close to the population mean (~24hr).
