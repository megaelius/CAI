We present a topology-based method for mesh-partitioning in three-dimensional discrete fracture
network (DFN) simulations that takes advantage of the intrinsic multi-level nature of a DFN. DFN
models are used to simulate flow and transport through low-permeability fracture media in the subsurface
by explicitly representing fractures as discrete entities. The governing equations for flow and
transport are numerically integrated on computational meshes generated on the interconnected
fracture networks. Modern high-fidelity DFN simulations require high-performance computing
on multiple processors where performance and scalability depends partially on obtaining a high-quality
partition of the mesh to balance work work-loads and minimize communication across all processors.
The discrete structure of a DFN naturally lends itself to various graph representations, which
can be thought of as coarse-scale representations of the computational mesh. Using this concept,
we develop a variant of the multilevel graph partitioning algorithm to partition the mesh of a DFN.
We compare the performance of this DFN-based mesh-partitioning with standard multi-level graph
partitioning using graph-based metrics (cut, imbalance, partitioning time), computational-based
metrics (FLOPS, iterations, solver time), and total run time. The DFN-based partition and the mesh-based
partition are comparable in terms of the graph-based metrics, but the time required to obtain the
partition is several orders of magnitude faster using the DFN-based partition. The computation-based
metrics show comparable performance between both methods so, in combination, the DFN-based partition
is several orders of magnitude faster than the mesh-based partition.
