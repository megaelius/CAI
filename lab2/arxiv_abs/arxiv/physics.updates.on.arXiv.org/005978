We present a new turbulent data reconstruction method with supervised machine learning techniques
inspired by super resolution and inbetweening, which can recover high-resolution turbulent flows
from grossly coarse flow data in space and time. For the present machine learning based data reconstruction,
we use the downsampled skip-connection/multi-scale model based on a convolutional neural network
to incorporate the multi-scale nature of fluid flows into its network structure. As an initial example,
the model is applied to a two-dimensional cylinder wake at $Re_D$ = 100. The reconstructed flow fields
by the proposed method show great agreement with the reference data obtained by direct numerical
simulation. Next, we examine the capability of the proposed model for a two-dimensional decaying
homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The machine-learned models can follow the decaying evolution
from coarse input data in space and time, according to the assessment with the turbulence statistics.
The proposed concept is further investigated for a complex turbulent channel flow over a three-dimensional
domain at $Re_{\tau}$ =180. The present model can reconstruct high-resolved turbulent flows from
very coarse input data in space, and it can also reproduce the temporal evolution when the time interval
is appropriately chosen. The dependence on the amount of training snapshots and duration between
the first and last frames based on a temporal two-point correlation coefficient are also assessed
to reveal the capability and robustness of spatio-temporal super resolution reconstruction.
These results suggest that the present method can meet a range of flow reconstructions for supporting
computational and experimental efforts.
