We analyze quantitatively the effect of spurious multifractality induced by the presence of fat-tailed
symmetric and asymmetric probability distributions of fluctuations in time series. In the presented
approach different kinds of symmetric and asymmetric broad probability distributions of synthetic
data are examined starting from Levy regime up to those with finite variance. We use nonextensive
Tsallis statistics to construct all considered data in order to have good analytical description
of frequencies of fluctuations in the whole range of their magnitude and simultaneously the full
control over exponent of power-law decay for tails of probability distribution. The semi-analytical
compact formulas are then provided to express the level of spurious multifractality generated
by the presence of fat tails in terms of Tsallis parameter $\tilde{q}$ and the scaling exponent $\beta$
of the asymptotic decay of cumulated probability density function (CDF).The results are presented
in Hurst and H\"{o}lder languages - more often used in study of multifractal phenomena. According
to the provided semi-analytical relations, it is argued how one can make a clear quantitative distinction
for any real data between true multifractality caused by the presence of nonlinear correlations,
spurious multifractality generated by fat-tailed shape of distributions - eventually with their
asymmetry, and the correction due to linear autocorrelations in analyzed time series of finite
length. In particular, the spurious multifractal effect of fat tails is found basic for proper quantitative
estimation of all spurious multifractal effects. Examples from stock market data are presented
to support these findings.
