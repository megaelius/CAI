The plasma of the lower solar atmosphere consists of mostly neutral particles, whereas the upper
solar atmosphere is mostly ionised particles and electrons. A shock that propagates upwards in
the solar atmosphere therefore undergoes a transition where the dominant fluid is either neutral
or ionised. An upwards propagating shock also passes a point where the sound and Alfv\'en speed are
equal. At this point the energy of the acoustic shock can separated into fast and slow components.
How the energy is distributed between the two modes depends on the angle of magnetic field. The separation
of neutral and ionised species in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere is investigated. The
role of two-fluid effects on the structure of the shocks post-mode-conversion and the frictional
heating is quantified for different levels of collisional coupling. Two-fluid numerical simulations
are performed using the (P\underline{I}P) code of a wave steepening into a shock in an isothermal,
partially-ionised atmosphere. The collisional coefficient is varied to investigate the regimes
where the plasma and neutral species are weakly, strongly and finitely coupled. The propagation
speeds of the compressional waves hosted by neutral and ionised species vary, therefore velocity
drift between the two species is produced as the plasma attempts to propagate faster than the neutrals.
This is most extreme for a fast-mode shock. We find that the collisional coefficient drastically
changes the features present in the system, specifically the mode conversion height, type of shocks
present, and the finite shock widths created by the two-fluid effects. In the finitely-coupled
regime fast-mode shock widths can exceed the pressure scale height leading to a new potential observable
of two-fluid effects in the lower solar atmosphere.
