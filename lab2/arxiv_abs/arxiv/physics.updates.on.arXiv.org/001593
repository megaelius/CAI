We present a long-duration ($\sim$10 years) statistical analysis of the temperatures, plasma
betas, and temperature ratios for the electron, proton, and alpha-particle populations observed
by the \emph{Wind} spacecraft near 1 AU. The mean(median) scalar temperatures are $T{\scriptstyle_{e,
tot}}$ $=$ 12.2(11.9) eV, $T{\scriptstyle_{p, tot}}$ $=$ 12.7(8.6) eV, and $T{\scriptstyle_{\alpha,
tot}}$ $=$ 23.9(10.8) eV. The mean(median) total plasma betas are $\beta{\scriptstyle_{e, tot}}$
$=$ 2.31(1.09), $\beta{\scriptstyle_{p, tot}}$ $=$ 1.79(1.05), and $\beta{\scriptstyle_{\alpha,
tot}}$ $=$ 0.17(0.05). The mean(median) temperature ratios are $\left(T{\scriptstyle_{e}}/T{\scriptstyle_{p}}\right){\scriptstyle_{tot}}$
$=$ 1.64(1.27), $\left(T{\scriptstyle_{e}}/T{\scriptstyle_{\alpha}}\right){\scriptstyle_{tot}}$
$=$ 1.24(0.82), and $\left(T{\scriptstyle_{\alpha}}/T{\scriptstyle_{p}}\right){\scriptstyle_{tot}}$
$=$ 2.50(1.94). We also examined these parameters during time intervals that exclude interplanetary
(IP) shocks, times within the magnetic obstacles (MOs) of interplanetary coronal mass ejections
(ICMEs), and times that exclude MOs. The only times that show significant alterations to any of the
parameters examined are those during MOs. In fact, the only parameter that does not show a significant
change during MOs is the electron temperature. Although each parameter shows a broad range of values,
the vast majority are near the median. We also compute particle-particle collision rates and compare
to effective wave-particle collision rates. We find that, for reasonable assumptions of wave amplitude
and occurrence rates, the effect of wave-particle interactions on the plasma is equal to or greater
than the effect of Coulomb collisions. Thus, wave-particle interactions should not be neglected
when modeling the solar wind.
