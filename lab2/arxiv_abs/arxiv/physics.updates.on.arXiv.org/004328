Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into saline aquifers is one method of mitigating anthropogenic
climate change. To ensure secure storage of this CO2, it is important to understand the interaction
of CO2 injection and migration with geological layering. For example, seismic monitoring at the
Sleipner pilot project suggests that the injected CO2 is ponding against, and leaking across, a
series of thin, intermediate seals. Here, we develop a gravity-current model for weakly compressible,
two-phase fluid migration in a system of layered aquifers. Our model includes vertical leakage
of both water and gas across seals, where the latter is subject to a capillary entry threshold. We
demonstrate that the buildup of capillary pressure is very sensitive to the conductivity and connectivity
of water films in the gas region. We identify two associated limiting cases, where gas obstructs
water flow either completely or not at all. We then explore the parameters that govern gas leakage
and the resulting fluid distributions---demonstrating that this problem involves a complex interplay
between pressure dissipation, capillary pressure buildup, and fluid migration. We show that decreasing
the relative permeability of water in the gas region can initiate gas leakage or significantly increase
the amount of gas leakage. Finally, we apply our model to rock properties expected for Sleipner and
show that CO2 injection may build up sufficient capillary pressure to invade the seals---suggesting
that, contrary to conventional wisdom, CO2 may be able to leak across the intermediate seals at Sleipner
in the absence of a focused conduit.
