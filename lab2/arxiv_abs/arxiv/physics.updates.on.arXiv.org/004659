Topography representing digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential inputs for computational
models capable of simulating the run-out of flow-like landslides. Yet, DEMs are often subject to
error, a fact that is mostly overlooked in landslide modeling. We address this research gap and investigate
the impact of topographic uncertainty on landslide-run-out models. In particular, we will describe
two different approaches to account for DEM uncertainty, namely unconditional and conditional
stochastic simulation methods. We investigate and discuss their feasibility, as well as whether
DEM uncertainty represented by stochastic simulations critically affects landslide run-out
simulations. Based upon a historic flow-like landslide event in Hong Kong, we present a series of
computational scenarios to compare both methods using our modular Python-based workflow. Our
results show that DEM uncertainty can significantly affect simulation-based landslide run-out
analyses, depending on how well the underlying flow path is captured by the DEM, as well as further
topographic characteristics and the DEM error's variability. We further find that in the absence
of systematic bias in the DEM, a performant root mean square error based unconditional stochastic
simulation yields similar results than a computationally intensive conditional stochastic simulation
that takes actual DEM error values at reference locations into account. In all other cases the unconditional
stochastic simulation overestimates the variability of the DEM error, which leads to an increase
of the potential hazard area as well as extreme values of dynamic flow properties.
