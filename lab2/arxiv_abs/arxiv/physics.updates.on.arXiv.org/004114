Monocrystalline silicon solar cells with photo-absorbing morphology can amplify light-trapping
properties within the absorber layer and help to fabricate cost-effective solar cells. In this
paper, the effect of different parameters namely temperature and time of Cu-assisted chemical
etching was thoroughly investigated for the optimization of the light absorption properties.
P-type monocrystalline wafers were selectively treated with Cu(NO3)2.3H2O:HF:H2O2:DI water
solution at 50 deg.C for five different time duration. The entire process was repeated at five different
temperatures for 20min as well to study the relation between etching temperature and surface reflectance.
Sonication bathing was used for the removal of the deposited Cu atoms from the surface with the variation
of time and the effect was examined using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and UV/VIS spectroscopy were conducted to study the surface
morphology and light absorbance respectively. Inverted shapes almost similar to inverted pyramids
or porous surface were found randomly on the surface of the wafer. The effect of temperature was found
more significant compared to the effect of time variation. An optimum light reflectance was found
at 50 deg.C for 20 min of texturization. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the textured sample revealed
the average depth of pyramidal shape was about 1.58 micro meter. EDS results showed a proportional
relation between time and Cu removal process, and a complete Cu atoms free textured surface after
25 min of sonication bathing. Therefore, a suitable Cu-assisted texturization technique was found,
which could enable lowering the photo-reflectance below 1% without any antireflection coating.
