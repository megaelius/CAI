Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) have the potential to reduce drag at solid boundaries. However,
multiple independent studies have recently shown that small amounts of surfactant, naturally
present in the environment, can induce Marangoni forces that increase drag, at least in the laminar
regime. To obtain accurate drag predictions, one must solve the mass, momentum, bulk surfactant
and interfacial surfactant conservation equations. This requires expensive simulations, thus
preventing surfactant from being widely considered in SHS studies. To address this issue, we propose
a theory for steady, pressure-driven, laminar, two-dimensional flow in a periodic SHS channel
with soluble surfactant. We linearise the coupling between flow and surfactant, under the assumption
of small concentration, finding a scaling prediction for the local slip length. To obtain the drag
reduction and interfacial shear, we find a series solution for the velocity field by assuming Stokes
flow in the bulk and uniform interfacial shear. We find how the slip and drag depend on the six dimensionless
groups characterizing surfactant transport near SHSs, the gas fraction and the ratio of the interface
length to the channel half-height. Our model agrees with numerical simulations spanning orders
of magnitude in each dimensionless group. The simulations also provide the three constants in the
scaling theory. Our model significantly improves predictions relative to a surfactant-free one,
which can otherwise overestimate slip and underestimate drag by several orders of magnitude. Our
slip length model can provide the boundary condition in other simulations, thereby accounting
for surfactant effects without having to solve the full problem.
