As charged particles surpass the speed of light in an optical medium they produce radiation - analogously
to the way jet planes surpass the speed of sound and produce a sonic boom. This radiation emission,
known as the Cherenkov effect, is among the most fundamental processes in electrodynamics. As such,
it is used in numerous applications of particle detectors, particle accelerators, light sources,
and medical imaging. Surprisingly, all Cherenkov-based applications and experiments thus far
were fully described by classical electrodynamics even though theoretical work predicts new Cherenkov
phenomena coming from quantum electrodynamics. The quantum description could provide new possibilities
for the design of highly controllable light sources and more efficient accelerators and detectors.
Here, we provide a direct evidence of the quantum nature of the Cherenkov effect and reveal its intrinsic
quantum features. By satisfying the Cherenkov condition for relativistic electron wavefunctions
and maintaining it over hundreds of microns, each electron simultaneously accelerates and decelerates
by absorbing and emitting hundreds of photons in a coherent manner. We observe this strong interaction
in an ultrafast transmission electron microscope, achieving for the first time a phase-matching
between a relativistic electron wavefunction and a propagating light wave. Consequently, the
quantum wavefunction of each electron evolves into a coherent plateau, analogous to a frequency
comb in ultrashort laser pulses, containing hundreds of quantized energy peaks. Our findings prove
that the delocalized wave nature of electrons can become dominant in stimulated interactions.
In addition to prospects for known applications of the Cherenkov effect, our work provides a platform
for utilizing quantum electrodynamics for applications in electron microscopy and in free-electron
pump-probe spectroscopy.
