Alfv\'en vortex is a multi-scale nonlinear structure which contributes to intermittency of turbulence.
Despite previous explorations mostly on the spatial properties of the Alfv\'en vortex (i.e., scale,
orientation, and motion), the plasma characteristics within the Alfv\'en vortex are unknown.
Moreover, the connection between the plasma energization and the Alfv\'en vortex still remains
unclear. Based on high resolution in-situ measurement from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)
mission, we report for the first time, distinctive plasma features within an Alfv\'en vortex. This
Alfv\'en vortex is identified to be two-dimensional ($k_{\bot} \gg k_{\|}$) quasi-monopole with
a radius of ~10 proton gyroscales. Its magnetic fluctuations $\delta B_{\bot}$ are anti correlated
with velocity fluctuations $\delta V_{\bot}$, thus the parallel current density $j_{\|}$ and
flow vorticity $\omega_{\|}$ are anti-aligned. In different part of the vortex (i.e., edge, middle,
center), the ion and electron temperatures are found to be quite different and they behave in the
reverse trend: the ion temperature variations are correlated with $j_{\|}$, while the electron
temperature variations are correlated with $\omega_{\|}$. Furthermore, the temperature anisotropies,
together with the non-Maxwellian kinetic effects, exhibit strong enhancement at peaks of $|\omega_{\|}|
(|j_{\|}|)$ within the vortex. Comparison between observations and numerical/theoretical results
are made. In addition, the energy-conversion channels and the compressibility associated with
the Alfv\'en vortex are discussed. These results may help to understand the link between coherent
vortex structures and the kinetic processes, which determines how turbulence energy dissipate
in the weakly-collisional space plasmas.
