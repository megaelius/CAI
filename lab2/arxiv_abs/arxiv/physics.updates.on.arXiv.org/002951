The first-order approximation to the solution of the Boltzmann--Curtiss transport equation is
derived. The resulting distribution function treats the rotation or gyration of spherical particles
as an independent classical variable, deviating from the quantum mechanical treatment of molecular
rotation found in the Wang Chang-Uhlenbeck equation. The Boltzmann-Curtiss equation, therefore,
does not treat different rotational motions as separate molecular species. The first-order distribution
function yields momentum equations for the translational velocity and gyration that match the
form of the governing equations of morphing continuum theory (MCT), a theory derived from the approach
of rational continuum thermomechanics. The contribution of the local rotation to the Cauchy stress
and the viscous diffusion are found to be proportional to an identical expression based off the relaxation
time, number density, and equilibrium temperature of the fluid. When gyration is equated to the
macroscopic angular velocity, the kinetic description reduces to the first-order approximation
for a classical monatomic gas, and the governing equations match the form of the Navier--Stokes
equations. The relaxation time used for this approximation is shown to be more complex due to the
additional variable of local rotation. The approach of De Groot and Mazur is invoked to give an initial
approximation for the relaxation of the gyration. The incorporation of this relaxation time, and
other physical parameters, into the coefficients of the governing equations provides a more in-depth
physical treatment of the new terms in the MCT equations, allowing experimenters to test these expressions
and get a better understanding of new coefficients in MCT.
