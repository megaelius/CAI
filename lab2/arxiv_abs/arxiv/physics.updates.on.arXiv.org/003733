This paper presents an immersed boundary (IB) method for fluid--structure--acoustics interactions
involving large deformations and complex geometries. In this method, the fluid dynamics is solved
by a finite difference method where the temporal, viscous and convective terms are respectively
discretized by the third-order Runge-Kutta scheme, the fourth-order central difference scheme
and a fifth-order W/TENO (Weighted/Targeted Essentially Non-oscillation) scheme. Without loss
of generality, a nonlinear flexible plate is considered here, and is solved by a finite element method
based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. The no-slip boundary condition at the fluid--structure
interface is achieved by using a diffusion-interface penalty IB method. With the above proposed
method, the aeroacoustics field generated by the moving boundaries and the associated flows are
inherently solved. In order to validate and verify the current method, several benchmark cases
are conducted: acoustic waves scattered from a stationary cylinder in a quiescent flow, sound generation
by a stationary and a rotating cylinder in a uniform flow, sound generation by an insect in hovering
flight, deformation of a red blood cell induced by acoustic waves and acoustic waves scattered by
a stationary sphere. The comparison of the sound scattered by a cylinder shows that the present IB--WENO
scheme, a simple approach, has an excellent performance which is even better than the implicit IB--lattice
Boltzmann method. For the sound scattered by a sphere, the IB--TENO scheme has a lower dissipation
compared with the IB--WENO scheme. Applications of this technique to model fluid-structure-acoustics
interactions of flapping foils mimicking an insect wing section during forward flight and flapping
foil energy harvester are also presented, considering the effects of foil shape and flexibility.
