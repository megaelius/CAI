We develop a numerical model using both artificial and empirical inputs to analyze taxi dynamics
in an urban setting. More specifically, we quantify how the supply and demand for taxi services,
the underlying road network, and the public acceptance of taxi ridesharing (TRS) affect the optimal
number of taxis for a particular city, as well as commuters' average waiting time and trip time. Results
reveal certain universal features of the taxi dynamics with real-time taxi-booking---that there
is a well-defined transition between the oversaturated phase when demand exceeds supply, and the
undersaturated phase when supply exceeds demand. The boundary between the two phases gives the
optimal number of taxis a city should accommodate, given the specific demand, road network and commuter
habits. Adding or removing taxis may affect commuter experience very differently in the two phases
revealed. In the oversaturated phase the average waiting time is affected exponentially, while
in the undersaturated phase it is affected sub-linearly. We analyze various factors that can shift
the phase boundary, and show that an increased level of acceptance for TRS universally shifts the
phase boundary by reducing the number of taxis needed. We discuss some of the useful insights on the
benefits and costs of TRS, especially how under certain situations TRS will not only have economic
benefits for commuters, but can also save the overall travel time for the shared parties, by significantly
reducing the time commuters spend on waiting for taxis. Our simulations also suggest that simple
artificial taxi systems can capture most of the universal features of the taxi dynamics. The relevance
of the assumptions and the overall methodology are also illustrated using the empirical road network
and taxi demand in Singapore.
