The electrostatic, entropic and surface interactions between a macroion (nanoparticle or biomolecule),
surrounding ions and water molecules play a fundamental role in the behavior and function of colloidal
systems. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these phenomena are still poorly understood.
In this article, we present a free, multi-platform, portable Java software, which provides experts
and non-experts in the field an easy and efficient way to obtain an accurate molecular characterization
of electrical and structural properties of aqueous electrolyte mixture solutions around both
cylindrical- and spherical-like macroions under multiple conditions. The Java software does
not require outstanding skills, and comes with detailed user-guide documentation. The application
is based on the so-called Classical Density Functional Theory Solver (CSDFTS), which was successfully
applied to a variety of rod-like biopolymers, rigid-like globular proteins, nanoparticles, and
nano-rods. CSDFTS implements several electrolyte and macroion models, uses different level of
approximation and takes advantage of high performance Fortran90 routines and optimized libraries.
These features enable the software to run on single processor computers at low-to-moderate computational
cost depending on the computer performance, the grid resolution, and the characterization of the
macroion and the electrolyte solution, among other factors. As a unique feature, the software comes
with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to take advantage of the visually guided
setup of the required input data to properly characterize the system and configure the solver. Several
examples on nanomaterials and biomolecules are provided to illustrate the use of the GUI and the
solver performance.
