With growing concern for the depletion of soil resources, conventional soil data must be updated
to support spatially explicit human-landscape models. Three US soil point datasetswere combined
with a stack of over 200 environmental datasets to generate complete coverage gridded predictions
at 100 m spatial resolution of soil properties (percent organic C, total N, bulk density, pH, and
percent sand and clay) and US soil taxonomic classes (291 great groups and 78 modified particle size
classes) for the conterminous US. Models were built using parallelized random forest and gradient
boosting algorithms. Soil property predictions were generated at seven standard soil depths (0,
5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm). Prediction probability maps for US soil taxonomic classifications
were also generated. Model validation results indicate an out-of-bag classification accuracy
of 60 percent for great groups, and 66 percent for modified particle size classes; for soil properties
cross-validated R-square ranged from 62 percent for total N to 87 percent for pH. Nine independent
validation datasets were used to assess prediction accuracies for soil class models and results
ranged between 24-58 percent and 24-93 percent for great group and modified particle size class
prediction accuracies, respectively. The hybrid "SoilGrids+" modeling system that incorporates
remote sensing data, local predictions of soil properties, conventional soil polygon maps, and
machine learning opens the possibility for updating conventional soil survey data with machine
learning technology to make soil information easier to integrate with spatially explicit models,
compared to multi-component map units.
