Recently a novel concept for collisionless electron heating and plasma generation at low pressures
was proposed theoretically (U Czarnetzki and Kh Tarnev, Phys. Plasmas 21 (2014) 123508). It is based
on periodically structured vortex fields which produce certain electron resonances in velocity
space. A more detailed investigation of the underlying theory is presented in a companion paper
(U Czarnetzki, submitted to PSST (2018), arXiv:1806.00505). Here, the new concept is experimentally
realized for the first time by the INCA (INductively Coupled Array) discharge. The periodic vortex
fields are produced by an array of small planar coils. It is shown that the array can be scaled up to
arbitrary dimensions while keeping its electrical characteristics. Stable operation at pressures
around and below 1 Pa is demonstrated. The power coupling efficiency is characterized and an increase
in the efficiency is observed with decreasing pressure. The spatial homogeneity of the discharge
is investigated and the behaviour of the plasma parameters with power and pressure are presented.
Linear scaling of the plasma density with power and pressure, typical for conventional inductive
discharges, is observed. Most notably, the plasma potential and the corresponding mean ion energy
show clear evidence for the presence of super energetic electrons, attributed to stochastic heating.
In the stochastic heating mode, the electron distribution function becomes approximately Maxwellian
but with increasing pressure it turns to the characteristic local distribution function known
from classical inductive discharges. Large area processing or thrusters are possible applications
for this new plasma source.
