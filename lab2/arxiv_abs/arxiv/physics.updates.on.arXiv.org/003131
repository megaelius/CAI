In a succession of articles published over 65 years ago, Sir Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Sir Andrew Fielding
Huxley established what now forms our physical understanding of excitation in nerve, and how the
axon conducts the action potential. They uniquely quantified the movement of ions in the nerve cell
during the action potential, and demonstrated that the action potential is the result of a depolarizing
event across the cell membrane. They confirmed that a complete depolarization event is followed
by an abrupt increase in voltage that propagates longitudinally along the axon, accompanied by
considerable increases in membrane conductance. In an elegant theoretical framework, they rigorously
described fundamental properties of the Na+ and K+ conductances intrinsic to the action potential.
Notwithstanding the elegance of Hodgkin and Huxley's incisive and explicative series of discoveries,
their model is mathematically complex, relies on no small number of stochastic factors, and has
no analytical solution. Solving for the membrane action potential and the ionic currents requires
integrations approximated using numerical methods. In this article I present an analytical formalism
of the nerve action potential, Vm and that of the accompanying cell membrane electric field, Em.
To conclude, I present a novel description of Vm in terms of a single, nonlinear differential equation.
This is an original stand-alone article: the major contribution is the latter, and how this description
coincides with the cell membrane electric field. This work has necessitated unifying information
from two preceding papers, each being concerned with the development of closed-form descriptions
of the nerve action potential.
