The kinetic analyses are quite important when it comes to understand the particle behavior in any
device as they start to deviate from continuum nature. In the present study, kinetic simulations
are performed using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method to analyze the behavior of ions inside a cylindrical
Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Fusion (IECF) device which is being developed as a tabletop
neutron source. Here, the lighter ions, like deuterium are accelerated by applying an electrostatic
field between the chamber wall (anode) and the cathode (cylindrical gridded wire), placed at the
center of the device. These ions recirculate across the cathode grid, which in turn capable of producing
fusion reaction at the central region of the device. An open source PIC code (XOOPIC) is used in our
study to simulate the ion dynamics at different experimental conditions. The plasma potential
profiles obtained from the simulated results indicate the formation of multiple potential well
structures inside the cathode grid depending upon the applied cathode potential (from $-1$ to $-5~kV$).
The ion density at the core region of the device is found to be of the order of $10^{16}~m^{-3}$, which
closely resembles the experimental observations. Spatial variation of Ion Energy Distribution
Function (IEDF) has been measured in order to observe the characteristics of ions at different cathode
voltages. Finally, the simulated results are compared and found to be in good agreement with the
experimental profiles. The present analysis can serve as a reference guide to optimize the technological
parameters of the discharge process in IECF devices.
