Behavior of the photoacoustic signal produced by nanoparticles as a function of their concentration
was studied in detail. As the concentration of nanoparticles is increased in a sample, the peak-to-peak
photoacoustic amplitude increases linearly up to a certain value, after which an asymptotic saturated
behavior is observed. These concentration-dependent regimes have been previously reported by
different authors, but not explained. We evaluate the effects of nanoparticles concentration
and the optical attenuation and the effects of heat propagation from nano-sources to their surroundings
described by a photo-thermo-acoustic model, whose main parameter consists of a thermal propagation
distance. We found that the saturation effect of the photoacoustic signal as a function the concentration
of nanoparticles is explained by a combination of two different mechanisms. The most important
mechanism is attributed to optical attenuation. The second mechanism is due to an interference
destructive process attributed to the superimposition of the photoacoustic amplitudes generated
for each nanoparticle, this explanation is reinforced through our experimental and simulations
results, were the photoacoustic signal shape changes from symmetric, at low concentrations, to
an asymmetric shape at higher concentration. Based on the experimental and numerical simulations
it is found that the linear behavior of the photoacoustic amplitude could be restricted to optical
densities $\le0.5$. This result establishes a limit for the maximum possible photoacoustic amplitude
signal that can be obtained from a homogeneous sample of nanoparticles as its concentration is increased
for a fixed experimental setup. Furthermore, our results could be extended to other materials (cells,
tissue, micro-particles, etc) that exhibit a similar photoacoustic phenomenology.
