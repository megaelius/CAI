The Vertex Locator (VELO) is a silicon microstrip detector that surrounds the proton-proton interaction
region in the LHCb experiment. The performance of the detector during the first years of its physics
operation is reviewed. The system is operated in vacuum, uses a bi-phase CO2 cooling system, and
the sensors are moved to 7 mm from the LHC beam for physics data taking. The performance and stability
of these characteristic features of the detector are described, and details of the material budget
are given. The calibration of the timing and the data processing algorithms that are implemented
in FPGAs are described. The system performance is fully characterised. The sensors have a signal
to noise ratio of approximately 20 and a best hit resolution of 4 microns is achieved at the optimal
track angle. The typical detector occupancy for minimum bias events in standard operating conditions
in 2011 is around 0.5%, and the detector has less than 1% of faulty strips. The proximity of the detector
to the beam means that the inner regions of the n+-on-n sensors have undergone space-charge sign
inversion due to radiation damage. The VELO performance parameters that drive the experiment's
physics sensitivity are also given. The track finding efficiency of the VELO is typically above
98% and the modules have been aligned to a precision of 1 micron for translations in the plane transverse
to the beam. A primary vertex resolution of 13 microns in the transverse plane and 71 microns along
the beam axis is achieved for vertices with 25 tracks. An impact parameter resolution of less than
35 microns is achieved for particles with transverse momentum greater than 1 GeV/c.
