Accurate data on atoms is important for training and benchmarking density functionals (DF) and
their implementations. Although many programs have been published for either Hartree--Fock (HF)
or DF calculations on atoms, we are not aware of any that support hybrid DFs, which are popular within
the quantum chemistry community due to their better accuracy for many applications, or that can
be used to calculate electric properties. Here, we present an atomic finite element solver in the
HelFEM program suite that overcomes these limitations. A basis set of the type $B_{n}(r) Y_{l}^{m}(r)$
is used, where $B_{n}(r)$ are finite elements and $Y_{l}^{m}$ are spherical harmonics, which allows
for an arbitrary level of accuracy. HelFEM supports nonrelativistic HF and DF including hybrid
functionals, which are not available in other commonly available program packages. Hundreds of
functionals at the local spin density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation
(GGA), as well as the meta-GGA levels of theory are included through an interface with the Libxc library.
Electric response properties are achievable via finite field calculations. We introduce an alternative
grid that yields faster convergence to the complete basis set than commonly used alternatives.
We also show that high-order Lagrange interpolating polynomials yield the best convergence, and
that excellent agreement with literature HF limit values for electric properties, such as static
dipole polarizabilities, can be achieved with the present approach. Dipole moments and dipole
polarizabilities at finite field are reported at the PBE, PBEh, TPSS, and TPSSh levels of theory.
Finally, we show that a recently published Gaussian basis set is able to reproduce absolute energies
of neutral atoms, cations, as well as anions within a few dozen microhartrees.
