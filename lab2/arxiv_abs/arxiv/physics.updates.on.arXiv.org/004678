In this work negative-ion production on the surface of a sample negatively DC biased in a hydrogen
plasma is studied. The negative ions created under the positive ion bombardment are accelerated
towards the plasma, self-extracted and detected according to their energy and mass, by a mass spectrometer
placed in front of the sample. The use of a pulsed bias allows applying a quasi-DC bias on insulating
material during a short period of time and offers the possibility to extend the measurement method
to nonconductive samples. The pulsed-bias tests were performed first with Highly Oriented Pyrolitic
Graphite (HOPG), a conductive material, to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. By changing
the pulsed-bias frequency it was possible to obtain HOPG material with different hydrogen surface
coverages and hence different surface states leading to an increase of negative-ion production
by up to 30-50% as compared to the continuous bias case. To establish a protocol for insulating materials,
charge accumulation on the surface during the bias pulse and influence of the bias duration and frequency
were explored using microcrystalline diamond (MCD) thin layers. By using a pulse short enough (10
$\mu$s) at 1 kHz frequency, it has been possible to measure negative-ions on MCD sample at a quasi-constant
surface bias of 130 V, with only 1 V variation during the measurement. Negative-ion surface production
on MCD has been studied in pulsed mode with surface temperature from room temperature to 800{\textdegree}C.
It is shown that pulsing the bias and increasing the temperature allows limiting defect creation
on MCD which is favorable for negative-ion production. Consequently, at 400{\textdegree}C the
yield on MCD in pulsed mode is one order of magnitude higher than the yield on HOPG in continuous mode
at room temperature.
