The paper is an excursus on potential acid-base adducts formed by an unsaturated main group or transition
metal species and P atoms of phosphorene (P n ), which derives from the black phosphorus exfoliation.
Various possibilities of attaining a realistic covalent functionalization of the 2D material
have been examined via DFT solid state calculations. The distribution of neighbor P atoms at one
side of the sheet and the reciprocal directionalities of their lone pairs must be clearly understood
to foreshadow the best possible acceptor reactants. Amongst the latter, the main group BH3 or I2
species have been examined for their intrinsic acidity, which favors the periodic mono-hapto anchoring
at Pn atoms. The corresponding adducts are systematically compared with other molecular P donors
from a phosphine to white phosphorus, P4. Significant variations emerge from the comparison of
the band gaps in the adducts and the naked phosphorene with a possible electronic interpretation
being offered. Then, the Pn covalent functionalization has been analyzed in relation to unsaturated
metal fragments, which, by carrying one, two or three vacant sigma hybrids, may interact with a different
number of adjacent P atoms. For the modelling, the concept of isolobal analogy is important for predicting
the possible sets of external coligands at the metal, which may allow the anchoring at phosphorene
with a variety of hapticities. Structural, electronic, spectroscopic and energy parameters underline
the most relevant pros and cons of some new products at the 2D framework, which have never been experimentally
characterized but appear to be reasonably stable.
