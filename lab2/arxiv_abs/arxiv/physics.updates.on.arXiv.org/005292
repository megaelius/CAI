Understanding the structure of knowledge domains has been one of the foundational challenges in
the science of science. Although there have been a series of studies on the self-organized structure
of knowledge domains and their relationships, creating rich, coherent, and quantitative representation
frameworks is still an open challenge. Meanwhile, neural embedding methods, which learn continuous
vector representations of entities by using neural networks and contextual information, are emerging
as a powerful representation framework that can encode nuanced semantic relationships into geometric
ones. Here, we propose a neural embedding technique that leverages the information contained in
the paper citation network to obtain continuous representations of scientific periodicals. We
demonstrate that our embeddings encode nuanced relationships between periodicals as well as the
complex disciplinary structure of science, even allowing us to make cross-disciplinary analogies
between periodicals. Furthermore, we show that the embeddings capture meaningful "axes" that
encompass all disciplines in the knowledge domains, such as an axis from "soft" to "hard" sciences
or from "social" to "biological" sciences, which allow us to quantitatively ground a periodical
on a given spectrum. Using this new capacity, we test the hypothesis of the hierarchy of the sciences,
showing that, in most disciplines such as Social Sciences and Life Sciences, most widely cited papers
tend to appear in "harder" periodicals. Our framework may offer novel quantification methods in
science of science, which may in turn facilitate the study of how knowledge is created and organized.
