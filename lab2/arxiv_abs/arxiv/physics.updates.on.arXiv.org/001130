In this work we study morphological characteristics of the critically-sized crystalline nuclei
at initial stage of the shear-induced crystallization of a model single-component amorphous (glassy)
system. These characteristics are estimated quantitatively through statistical treatment of
the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation results for the system under steady shear at
various (fixed) values of the shear rate $\dot\gamma$ and at different temperatures. It is found
that the sheared glassy system is crystallized through nucleation mechanism. From analysis of
a time-dependent trajectories of the largest crystalline nuclei, the critical size $n_{c}$ and
the nucleation time $\tau_{c}$ were defined. It is shown that the critically-sized nuclei in the
system are oriented within the shear-gradient $xy$-plane at moderate and high shear rates; and
a tilt angle of the oriented nuclei depends on the shear rate. At extremely high shear rates and at
shear deformation of the system more than $60$\%, the tilt angle of the nuclei tends to take the value
$\simeq45^\circ$ respective to the shear direction. We found that this feature depends weakly
on the temperature. Asphericity of the nucleus shape increases with increasing shear rate, that
is verified by increasing value of the asphericity parameter and by the contour of the pair distribution
function calculated for the particles of the critically-sized nuclei. The critical size increases
with increasing shear rate according to the power-law, $n_{c}\propto(\dot\gamma\tau_{c})^{1/3}$,
whereas the shape of the critically-sized nucleus changes from spherical to the elongated ellipsoidal.
We found that the $n_{c}$-dependencies of the nuclei deformation parameter evaluated for the system
at different temperatures and shear rates are collapsed into unified master-curve.
