This paper presents an analysis of near-resonant, ro-vibrational two-photon spectroscopy and
the use of cavity ring-down spectroscopy for its detection. Expressions are derived for the photon
absorption rate of a three-level system, correct to all orders and the simpler expressions that
result from various approximations. The analysis includes the angular momentum projection degeneracies
and linear or circular polarization of the exciting field. Expressions are derived for the rate
of two-photon power loss for light inside a resonant cavity. Explicit calculations are made for
excitation of the $\nu_3$ mode of $^{12}\textrm{C}^{16}\textrm{O}_2$ for which the two-photon
excitation spectrum is dominated by a single $v_3 = 0 \rightarrow 2, Q(16)$ line at $\tilde{\nu}
= 2335.826$\,cm$^{-1}$. This transition has an intermediate $v_3 = 0 \rightarrow 1,P(16)$ one-photon
transition that is off resonance by 0.093 cm$^{-1}$ (2.8 GHz). At 1\,torr total pressure, the Q(16)
two-photon transition has a calculated cross-section of $2.99 \cdot 10^{-38}$\,cm$^4$s per CO$_2$
molecule in the $J = 16$ state or $2.24 \cdot 10^{-39}$\,cm$^4$s per CO$_2$ molecule at 300\,K is
calculated. Analysis of the sensitivity limits for 2-photon cavity ring-down spectroscopy predicts
a theoretical detection limit of 32\,ppq ($10^{-15}$) Hz$^{-1/2}$ for $^{12}\textrm{C}^{16}\textrm{O}_2$,
higher sensitivity than has been realized using one-photon absorption. The analysis predicts
that most polyatomic molecules will have sparse, Doppler-Free two-photon absorption spectra,
which will dramatically increase the selectivity of trace gas detection of samples with multiple
components with overlapping absorption bands. This is demonstrated by the predicted mid-IR two-photon
absorption spectrum of butadiene using theoretical spectroscopic constants.
