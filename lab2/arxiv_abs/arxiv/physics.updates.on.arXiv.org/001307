Nuclear quantum effects lead to an anomalous shift of the volume of hexagonal ice; heavy ice has a
larger volume than light ice. This anomaly in ice increases with temperature and persists in liquid
water up to the boiling point. We study nuclear quantum effects on the density and compressibility
of several ice-like structures and crystalline ice phases. By calculating the anisotropic contributions
to the stain tensor, we analyze how the compressibility changes along different directions in hexagonal
ice, and find that hexagonal ice is softer along the x-y plane than the z-direction. Furthermore,
by performing ab initio density functional theory calculations with a van der Waals functional
and with the quasiharmonic approximation, we find an anomalous isotope effect in the bulk modulus
of hexagonal ice: heavy ice has a smaller bulk modulus than light ice. In agreement with the experiments,
we also obtain an anomalous isotope effect for clathrate hydrate structure I. For the rest of the
ice polymorphs, the isotope effect is: i) anomalous for ice IX, Ih, Ic, clathrate, and low density
liquid-like amorphous ice; ii) normal at T=0 K and becomes anomalous with increasing temperature
for ice IX, II, high density liquid-like amorphous ices, and ice XV; iii) normal for ice VIII up to
the melting point. There is a transition from an anomalous isotope effect to a normal isotope effect
for both the volume and bulk modulus, as the density (compressibility) of the structures increases
(decreases). This result can explain the anomalous isotope effect in liquid water: as the compressibility
decreases from melting point to the compressibility minimum temperature, the difference between
the volumes of the heavy and light water rapidly decreases, but the effect stays anomalous up to the
boiling temperature as the hydrogen bond network is never completely broken by fully filling all
the interstitial sites.
