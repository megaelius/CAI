The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been emerged as a rapidly spreading pandemic. The
disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced
when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular
entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper
respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral airways result in severe,
potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2
reaches the peripheral airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the
disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid how SARS-CoV-2
from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize
the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol.
For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size distribution
and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing normal breathing through the
nose. We found that the probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation
of aerosol generated by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the
extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we concluded that in most
cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results
suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less
dangerous...
