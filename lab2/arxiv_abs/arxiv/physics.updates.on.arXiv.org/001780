The US Supreme Court throughout the 20th century has been characterized as being divided between
liberals and conservatives, suggesting that justices with similar ideologies would have voted
similarly had they overlapped in tenure. What if they had? I build an empirical, quantitative model
of this counterfactual hypothesis using pairwise maximum entropy. I infer how 36 justices from
1946-2016 would have all voted on a Super Supreme Court. The model is strikingly consistent with
a standard voting model from political science despite using $10^5$ less parameters and fitting
the observed statistics better. As with historical courts, the Super Court is dominated by consensus.
The rate at which consensus decays as more justices are included is extremely slow, nearly 100 years,
and indicates that the modern Supreme Court is an extremely stable institution. Beyond consensus,
I discover a rich structure of dissenting blocs that are distributed along a heavy-tailed Zipf's
law. The heavy tail means that dominant dissenting modes fail to capture the entire spectrum of dissent.
Thus, I find that Supreme Court voting over time is not low-dimensional despite implications to
the contrary in historical analysis of Supreme Court voting. Although it has been long presumed
that strong higher order correlations are induced by features of the cases, the institution, and
the justices, I show that such complexity can be expressed in a minimal model relying only on pairwise
correlations. From the perspective of model selection, this minimal model may generalize better
and thus be useful for prediction of Supreme Court voting over time.
