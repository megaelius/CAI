Our investigation of 353 faculty-produced multiple-choice Think-Pair-Share questions leads
to key insights into faculty members' ideas about the discipline representations and intellectual
tasks that could engage learners on key topics in physics and astronomy. The results of this work
illustrate that, for many topics, there is a lack of variety in the representations featured, intellectual
tasks posed, and levels of complexity fostered by the questions faculty develop. These efforts
motivated and informed the development of two frameworks: (1) a curriculum characterization framework
that allows us to systematically code active learning strategies in terms of the discipline representations,
intellectual tasks, and reasoning complexity that an activity offers the learner; and (2) a curriculum
development framework that guides the development of activities deliberately focused on increasing
learners' discipline fluency. We analyze the faculty-produced Think-Pair-Share questions with
our curriculum characterization framework, then apply our curriculum development framework
to generate (1) Fluency-Inspiring Questions, a more pedagogically powerful extension of a well-established
instructional strategy, and (2) Student Representation Tasks, a brand new type of instructional
activity in astronomy that shifts the responsibility for generating appropriate representations
onto the learners. We explicitly unpack and provide examples of Fluency-Inspiring Questions and
Student Representation Tasks, detailing their usage of Pedagogical Discipline Representations
coupled with novel question and activity formats.
