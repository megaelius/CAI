Metropolis nested sampling evolves a Markov chain from a current livepoint and accepts new points
along the chain according to a version of the Metropolis acceptance ratio modified to satisfy the
likelihood constraint, characteristic of nested sampling algorithms. The geometric nested sampling
algorithm we present here is a based on the Metropolis method, but treats parameters as though they
represent points on certain geometric objects, namely circles, tori and spheres. For parameters
which represent points on a circle or torus, the trial distribution is `wrapped' around the domain
of the posterior distribution such that samples cannot be rejected automatically when evaluating
the Metropolis ratio due to being outside the sampling domain. Furthermore, this enhances the mobility
of the sampler. For parameters which represent coordinates on the surface of a sphere, the algorithm
transforms the parameters into a Cartesian coordinate system before sampling which again makes
sure no samples are automatically rejected, and provides a physically intutive way of the sampling
the parameter space. \\ We apply the geometric nested sampler to two types of toy model which include
circular, toroidal and spherical parameters. We find that the geometric nested sampler generally
outperforms \textsc{MultiNest} in both cases. \\ %We also apply the algorithm to a gravitational
wave detection model which includes circular and spherical parameters, and find that the geometric
nested sampler and \textsc{MultiNest} appear to perform equally well as one another. Our implementation
of the algorithm can be found at \url{https://github.com/SuperKam91/nested_sampling}.
