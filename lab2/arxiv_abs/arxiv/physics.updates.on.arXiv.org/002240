We investigate the quantum optical torque on an atom interacting with an inhomogeneous electromagnetic
environment described by the most general linear constitutive relations. The atom is modeled as
a two-level system prepared in an arbitrary initial energy state. Using the Heisenberg equation
of motion (HEM) and under the Markov approximation, we show that the optical torque has a resonant
and non-resonant part, associated respectively with a spontaneous-emission process and Casimir-type
interactions with the quantum vacuum, which can both be written explicitly in terms of the system
Green function. Our formulation is valid for any inhomogeneous, dissipative, dispersive, nonreciprocal,
and bianisotropic structure. We apply this general theory to a scenario in which the atom interacts
with a photonic topological material with broken time-reversal symmetry. In this case, the main
decay channel of the atom energy is represented by the unidirectional surface waves launched on
the topological material-vacuum interface. To provide relevant physical insight into the role
of these unidirectional surface waves in the emergence of non-trivial optical torque, we derive
closed-form expressions for the induced torque under the quasi-static approximation. Finally,
we investigate the equilibrium states of the atom polarization, along which the atom spontaneously
tends to align due to the action of the torque. Our theoretical predictions may be experimentally
tested with cold Rydberg atoms and superconducting qubits near a photonic topological material.
We believe that our general theory may find broad application in the context of nano-mechanical
and bio-mechanical systems.
