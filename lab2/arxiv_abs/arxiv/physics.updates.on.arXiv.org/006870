We are concerned with the structural stability of conical shocks in the three-dimensional steady
supersonic flows past Lipschitz perturbed cones whose vertex angles are less than the critical
angle. The flows under consideration are governed by the steady isothermal Euler equations for
potential flow with axisymmetry so that the equations contain a singular geometric source term.
We first formulate the shock stability problem as an initial-boundary value problem with the leading
conical shock-front as a free boundary, and then establish the existence and asymptotic behavior
of global entropy solutions in $BV$ of the problem. To achieve this, we first develop a modified Glimm
scheme to construct approximate solutions via self-similar solutions as building blocks in order
to incorporate with the geometric source term. Then we introduce the Glimm-type functional, based
on the local interaction estimates between weak waves, the strong leading conical shock, and self-similar
solutions, as well as the estimates of the center changes of the self-similar solutions. To make
sure the decreasing of the Glimm-type functional, we choose appropriate weights by careful asymptotic
analysis of the reflection coefficients in the interaction estimates, when the Mach number of the
incoming flow is sufficiently large. Finally, we establish the existence of global entropy solutions
involving a strong leading conical shock-front, besides weak waves, under the conditions that
the Mach number of the incoming flow is sufficiently large and the weighted total variation of the
slopes of the generating curve of the Lipschitz perturbed cone is sufficiently small. Furthermore,
the entropy solution is shown to approach asymptotically the self-similar solution that is determined
by the incoming flow and the asymptotic tangent of the cone boundary at infinity.
