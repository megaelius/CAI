We present a computational framework for the simulation of blood flow with fully resolved red blood
cells (RBCs) using a modular approach that consists of a lattice Boltzmann solver for the blood plasma,
a novel finite element based solver for the deformable bodies and an immersed boundary method for
the fluid-solid interaction. For the RBCs, we propose a nodal projective FEM (npFEM) solver which
has theoretical advantages over the more commonly used mass-spring systems (mesoscopic modeling),
such as an unconditional stability, versatile material expressivity, and one set of parameters
to fully describe the behavior of the body at any mesh resolution. At the same time, the method is substantially
faster than other FEM solvers proposed in this field, and has an efficiency that is comparable to
the one of mesoscopic models. At its core, the solver uses specially defined potential energies,
and builds upon them a fast iterative procedure based on quasi-Newton techniques. For a known material,
our solver has only one free parameter that demands tuning, related to the body viscoelasticity.
In contrast, state-of-the-art solvers for deformable bodies have more free parameters, and the
calibration of the models demands special assumptions regarding the mesh topology, which restrict
their generality and mesh independence. We propose as well a modification to the potential energy
proposed by Skalak et al. 1973 for the red blood cell membrane, which enhances the strain hardening
behavior at higher deformations. Our viscoelastic model for the red blood cell, while simple enough
and applicable to any kind of solver as a post-convergence step, can capture accurately the characteristic
recovery time and tank-treading frequencies. The framework is validated using experimental data,
and it proves to be scalable for multiple deformable bodies.
