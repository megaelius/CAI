With limited time available in the classroom, e-learning tools can supplement in-class learning
by providing opportunities for students to study and learn outside of class. Such tools can be especially
helpful for students who lack adequate prior preparation. However, one critical issue is ensuring
that students, especially those in need of additional help, engage with the tools as intended. Here
we first discuss an empirical investigation in which students in a large algebra-based physics
course were given opportunities to work through research-validated tutorials outside of class
as self-study tools. Students were provided these optional tutorials after traditional instruction
in relevant topics and were then given quizzes that included problems that were identical to the
tutorial problems with regard to the physics principles involved but had different contexts. We
find that students who worked through the tutorials as self-study tools struggled to transfer their
learning to solve problems that used the same physics principles. On the other hand, students who
worked on the tutorials in supervised, one-on-one situations performed significantly better
than them. These empirical findings suggest that many introductory physics students may not engage
effectively with self-paced learning tools unless they are provided additional incentives and
support, e.g., to aid with self-regulation. Inspired by the empirical findings, we propose a holistic
theoretical framework to help create learning environments in which students with diverse backgrounds
are provided support to engage effectively with self-study tools.
