A discrete electrostatic/diffusion model has been developed to describe the selective permeation
of ion channels, based on ionic Coulomb blockade (ICB) and quantised dehydration (QD). It has been
applied to describe selectivity phenomena measured in the bacterial NaChBac sodium channel and
some of its mutants. Site-directed mutagenesis and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique were
used to investigate how the value $Q_f$ of the fixed charge at the selectivity filter (SF) affected
both valence and alike-charge selectivity. The new ICB/QD model predicts that increasing ${Q_f}$
should lead to a shift of selectivity sequences towards larger ion sizes and charges, a result that
agrees with the present experiments and with earlier work. Comparison of the model with experimental
data provides evidence for an {\it effective charge} $Q_f^*$ at the SF that is smaller in magnitude
than the nominal $Q_f$ corresponding to the charge on the isolated protein residues. Furthermore,
$Q_f^*$ was different for aspartate and glutamate charged rings and also depended on their position
within the SF. It is suggested that protonation of the residues within the restricted space is an
important factor in significantly reducing the effective charge of the EEEE ring. Values of $Q_f^*$
derived from experiments on the anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) agree well with expectations
based on the ICB/QD model and have led to the first clear demonstration of the expected ICB oscillations
in Ca$^{2+}$ conduction as a function of the fixed charge. Pilot studies of the dependence of Ca$^{2+}$
conduction on pH are consistent with the predictions of the model.
