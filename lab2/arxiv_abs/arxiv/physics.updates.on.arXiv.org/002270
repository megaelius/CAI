It has been more than two hundred years since the first iron filings experiment, showing us the 2D
macroscopic magnetic imprint of the field of a permanent magnet. However, latest developments
in modern nanomagnetic passive direct observation devices reveal in real-time and color a more
intriguing 3D dynamic and detailed image of the field of a magnet, with surprising new findings,
that can change our perspective for dipole magnetism forever and lead to new research. This research
is a continuation of our previous work (DOI: 10.1016/j.jmmm.2017.12.023). The magnetostatic
fields were under our scope and examined with the aid of the ferrolens. We are presenting experimental
and photographical evidence, demonstrating the true complex 3D Euclidian geometry of the quantum
field of permanent magnets that have never been seen before and the classic iron filings experiment,
apart of its 2D limitations, fails to depict. An analysis of why and what these iron filings inherent
limitations are, giving us an incomplete and also in some degree misguiding image of the magnetic
field of a magnet is carried out, whereas, as we prove the ferrolens is free of these limitations and
its far more advanced visualization capabilities is allowing it to show the quantum image with depth
of field information, of the dipole field of a permanent magnet. For the first time the domain wall
(i.e. Bloch or Neel wall) region of the field of a magnet is clearly made visible by the ferrolens along
with what phenomenon is actually taking place there, leading to the inescapable conclusion, novel
observation and experimental evidence that the field of any dipole magnet actually consists of
two distinct and separate toroidal shaped 3D magnetic bubbles, each located at either side of the
dipole around the exact spatial regions where the two poles of the magnet reside.
