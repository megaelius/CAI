We investigate classical and quantum geometric information flow theories (respectively, GIFs
and QGIFs) when the geometric flow evolution and field equations for nonholonomic Einstein systems,
NES, are derived from Perelman-Lyapunov type entropic type functionals. In this work, the term
NES encodes models of gravitational and matter fields interactions and their geometric flow evolution
subjected to nonholonomic (equivalently, non-integrable, anholonomic) constraints. There
are used canonical geometric variables which allow a general decoupling and integration of systems
of nonlinear partial differential equations describing GIFs and QGIFs and (for self-similar geometric
flows) Ricci soliton type configurations. Our approach is different from the methods and constructions
elaborated for special classes of solutions characterized by area--hypersurface entropy, related
holographic and dual gauge--gravity models, and conformal field theories, involving generalizations
of the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy and black hole thermodynamics. We formulate the theory of QGIFs
which in certain quasi-classical limits encodes GIFs and models with flow evolution of NES. There
are analysed the most important properties (inequalities) for NES and defined and computed QGIF
versions of the von Neumann, relative and conditional entropy; mutual information, (modified)
entanglement and R\'{e}nyi entropy. We construct explicit examples of generic off-diagonal exact
and parametric solutions describing stationary solitonic gravitational hierarchies and deformations
of black hole configurations. Finally, we show how Perelman's entropy and geometric thermodynamic
values, and extensions to GIF and QGIF models can be computed for various new classes of exact solutions
which can not be described following the Bekenstein-Hawking approach.
