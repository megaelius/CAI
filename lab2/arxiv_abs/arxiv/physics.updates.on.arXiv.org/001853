A two-compartment model of diffusion in white matter, which accounts for intra- and extra-axonal
spaces, is associated with two plausible mathematical scenarios: either the intra-axonal axial
diffusivity is higher than the extra-axonal (Branch 1), or the opposite (Branch 2). This duality
calls for an independent validation of compartment axial diffusivities, to determine which of
the two cases holds. The aim of the present study was to use an intracerebroventricular injection
of a gadolinium-based contrast agent to selectively reduce the extracellular water signal in the
rat brain, and compare diffusion metrics in the genu of the corpus callosum before and after gadolinium
infusion. The diffusion metrics considered were diffusion and kurtosis tensor metrics, as well
as compartment-specific estimates of the WMTI-Watson two-compartment model. A strong decrease
in genu T1 and T2 relaxation times post-Gd was observed (p < 0.001), as well as an increase of 48% in
radial kurtosis (p < 0.05), which implies that the relative fraction of extracellular water signal
was selectively decreased. This was further supported by a significant increase in intra-axonal
water fraction as estimated from the two-compartment model, for both branches (p < 0.01 for Branch
1, p < 0.05 for Branch 2). However, pre-Gd estimates of axon dispersion in Branch 1 agreed better with
literature than those of Branch 2. Furthermore, comparison of post-Gd changes in diffusivity and
dispersion between data and simulations further supported Branch 1 as the biologically plausible
solution, i.e. the intra-axonal axial diffusivity is higher than the extra-axonal one. This result
is fully consistent with other recent measurements of compartment axial diffusivities that used
entirely different approaches, such as diffusion tensor encoding.
