Predictive high-fidelity finite element simulations of human cardiac mechanics co\-mmon\-ly
require a large number of structural degrees of freedom. Additionally, these models are often coupled
with lumped-parameter models of hemodynamics. High computational demands, however, slow down
model calibration and therefore limit the use of cardiac simulations in clinical practice. As cardiac
models rely on several patient-specific parameters, just one solution corresponding to one specific
parameter set does not at all meet clinical demands. Moreover, while solving the nonlinear problem,
90\% of the computation time is spent solving linear systems of equations. We propose a novel approach
to reduce only the structural dimension of the monolithically coupled structure-windkessel system
by projection onto a lower-dimensional subspace. We obtain a good approximation of the displacement
field as well as of key scalar cardiac outputs even with very few reduced degrees of freedom while
achieving considerable speedups. For subspace generation, we use proper orthogonal decomposition
of displacement snapshots. To incorporate changes in the parameter set into our reduced order model,
we provide a comparison of subspace interpolation methods. We further show how projection-based
model order reduction can be easily integrated into a gradient-based optimization and demonstrate
its performance in a real-world multivariate inverse analysis scenario. Using the presented projection-based
model order reduction approach can significantly speed up model personalization and could be used
for many-query tasks in a clinical setting.
