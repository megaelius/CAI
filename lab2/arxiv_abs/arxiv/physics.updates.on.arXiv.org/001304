This article discusses the description of wall-bounded turbulence as a deterministic high-dimensional
dynamical system of interacting coherent structures, defined as eddies with enough internal dynamics
to behave relatively autonomously from any remaining incoherent part of the flow. The guiding principle
is that randomness is not a property, but a methodological choice of what to ignore in the flow, and
that a complete understanding of turbulence, including the possibility of control, requires that
it be kept to a minimum. After briefly reviewing the underlying low-order statistics of flows at
moderate Reynolds numbers, the article examines what two-point statistics imply for the decomposition
of the flow into individual eddies. Intense eddies are examined next, including their temporal
evolution, and shown to satisfy many of the properties required for coherence. In particular, it
is shown that coherent structures larger than the Corrsin scale are a natural consequence of the
shear. In wall-bounded turbulence, they can be classified into coherent dispersive waves and transient
bursts. The former are found in the viscous layer near the wall and as very-large structures spanning
the boundary layer thickness. Although they are shear-driven, these waves have enough internal
structure to maintain a uniform advection velocity. Conversely, bursts exist at all scales, are
characteristic of the logarithmic layer, and interact almost linearly with the shear. While the
waves require a wall to determine their length scale, the bursts are essentially independent from
it. The article concludes with a brief review of our present theoretical understanding of turbulent
structures, and with a list of open problems and future perspectives.
