Antineutrinos stream freely from rapidly decaying fission products within nuclear reactors and
from long-lived radioactive isotopes and their daughters within Earth. They carry important information
about their shrouded sources and about the fundamental properties of neutrinos themselves. The
most energetic of these global antineutrinos produce detectable signatures in large, ultra-clear
volumes of scintillating liquid, or water doped with gadolinium, viewed by photomultiplier tubes.
Information on sources and neutrino properties traditionally results from measuring the energy
spectrum rather than from mapping the directions of the antineutrinos. Isolating the spectrum
of a source of interest requires knowledge of the spectra of background sources. We introduce a web
application for modeling the rate and energy spectrum of antineutrino interactions from nuclear
power reactors as well as from the crust and mantle of Earth. Results are instantly available for
any surface location. Users may select the location of their device, choose one of 25 existing or
potential subsurface detection sites, designate a given location, or explore by moving the cursor
over the global map. There are functions for viewing and downloading the energy spectra of individual
sources, calculating the significance of observing the signal from a given source relative to the
background from the other sources, and injecting the signal from a hypothetical reactor of specified
power and location. We demonstrate the utility of the web application with several examples relevant
to remote nuclear monitoring and observational neutrino geosciences.
