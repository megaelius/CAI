Gravity-driven turbulent bedload transport has been extensively studied over the past century
in regard to its importance for Earth surface processes such as natural riverbed morphological
evolution. In the present contribution, the influence of the longitudinal channel inclination
angle on gravity-driven turbulent bedload transport is studied in an idealised framework considering
steady and uniform flow conditions. From an analytical analysis based on the two-phase continuous
equations, it is shown that : (i) the classical slope correction of the critical Shields number is
based on an erroneous formulation of the buoyancy force, (ii) the influence of the slope is not restricted
to the critical Shields number but affects the whole transport formula and (iii) pressure-driven
and gravity-driven turbulent bedload transport are not equivalent from the slope influence standpoint.
Analysing further the granular flow driving mechanisms, the longitudinal slope is shown to not
only influence the fluid bed shear stress and the resistance of the granular bed, but also to affect
the fluid flow inside the granular bed - responsible for the transition from bedload transport to
debris flow. The relative influence of these coupled mechanisms allows us to understand the evolution
of the vertical structure of the granular flow and to predict the transport rate scaling law as a function
of a rescaled Shields number. The theoretical analysis is validated with coupled fluid-discrete
element simulations of idealised gravity-driven turbulent bedload transport, performed over
a wide range of Shields number values, density ratios and channel inclination angles. In particular,
all the data are shown to collapse onto a master curve when considering the sediment transport rate
as a function of the proposed rescaled Shields number.
