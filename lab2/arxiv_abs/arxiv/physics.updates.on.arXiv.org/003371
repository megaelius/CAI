In this paper, we aim to resolve two fundamental issues in the dynamics of relativity: (i) Under what
condition, the time-column space integrals of a Lorentz four-tensor constitute a Lorentz four-vector,
and (ii) under what condition, the time-element space integral of a Lorentz four-vector is a Lorentz
scalar; namely two ``conservation laws'', which are mispresented in traditional textbooks, and
widely used in fundamental research, such as relativistic analysis of the momentum of light in a
medium, and gravitation theory. To resolve issue (i), we have developed a generalized Lorentz \emph{four-vector}
theorem from the change of variables theorem in classical mathematical analysis. We use this four-vector
theorem to verify M\o ller's theorem; we surprisingly find that M\o ller's theorem is fundamentally
wrong. We provide a corrected version of M\o ller's theorem. We also use this four-vector theorem
to analyze a plane light wave in a moving uniform medium, and find that the momentum and energy of Minkowski
quasi-photon constitute a Lorentz four-vector and Planck constant is a Lorentz invariant. To resolve
issue (ii), we have developed a generalized Lorentz \emph{scalar} theorem. We use this theorem
to verify the ``invariant conservation law'' in relativistic electrodynamics, and unexpectedly
find that it is also fundamentally wrong. Thus the two ``conservation laws'' in traditional textbooks,
which have magically attracted several generations of most outstanding scientists, turned out
to be imaginary, just like the emperor's new clothes; creating a scientific myth in the modern theoretical
and mathematical physics: Believing is seeing.
