For a large system of identical particles interacting by means of a potential, we find that a strong
large scale flow velocity can induce motions in the inertial range via the potential coupling. This
forcing lies in special bundles in the Fourier space, which are formed by pairs of particles. These
bundles are not present in the Boltzmann, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, because they are destroyed
by the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon formalism. However, measurements of the flow can
detect certain bulk effects shared across these bundles, such as the power scaling of the kinetic
energy. We estimate the scaling effects produced by two types of potentials: the Thomas-Fermi interatomic
potential (as well as its variations, such as the Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark potential), and the
electrostatic potential. In the near-viscous inertial range, our estimates yield the inverse
five-thirds power decay of the kinetic energy for both the Thomas-Fermi and electrostatic potentials.
The electrostatic potential is also predicted to produce the inverse cubic power scaling of the
kinetic energy at large inertial scales. Standard laboratory experiments confirm the scaling
estimates for both the Thomas-Fermi and electrostatic potentials at near-viscous scales. Surprisingly,
the observed kinetic energy spectrum in the Earth atmosphere at large scales behaves as if induced
by the electrostatic potential. Given that the Earth atmosphere is not electrostatically neutral,
we cautiously suggest a hypothesis that the atmospheric kinetic energy spectra in the inertial
range are indeed driven by the large scale flow via the electrostatic potential coupling.
