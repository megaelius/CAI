This contribution reviews the effects of source heterogeneities, melt-rock reactions and intracrustal
differentiation on magma chemistry across mid-ocean ridges, intraplate settings and subduction
zones using experimental studies and natural data. We compare melting behaviors of pyroxenites
and peridotites and their relative contributions to magmas as functions of composition, mantle
potential temperatures and lithospheric thickness. We also discuss the fate of chemically distinct
melts derived from heterogeneities as they travel through a peridotitic mantle. Using nearly 60,000
natural major element compositions of volcanic rocks, melt inclusions, and crystalline cumulates,
we assess broad petrogenetic trends in as large of a global dataset as possible. Consistent with
previous studies, major element chemistry of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) and their cumulates
favor a first-order control of intracrustal crystal-liquid segregation, while trace element
studies emphasize the role of melt-rock reactions, highlighting the decoupling between the two.
Ocean island basalts (OIB) show a larger compositional variability than MORB, partly attributed
to large variations of pyroxenite proportions in the mantle source. However, the estimated proportions
vary considerably with heterogeneity composition, melting model and thermal structure of the
mantle. For arcs, we highlight current views on the role of the downgoing slab into the source of primary
arc magmas, and the role of the overriding lithosphere as a magmatic chemical filter and as the repository
of voluminous arc cumulates. Our approach of simultaneously looking at a large database of volcanic
+ deep crustal rocks across diverse tectonic settings underscores the challenge of deciphering
the source signal versus intracrustal/lithospheric processes.
