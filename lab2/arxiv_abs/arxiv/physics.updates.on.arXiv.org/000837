We analyze resonances in the double photoionization of a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons. The
resonances reflect the breakup of quasi-bound electron pairs. The basic premise of this paper is
that there is a direct connection between the quasi-bound pairs and resonant peaks in the optical
absorption that are associated with doubly occupied sites on the perimeter and inside the perimeter
of the molecule. The optical absorption leading to the high-energy resonance (approximately 40
eV), calculated from a many-site one-dimensional Hubbard model, has a peak at U, the electrostatic
interaction energy for two electrons with antiparallel spins on the same carbon atom. In the model,
there are also two satellites whose separation from the main resonance is approximately +/-10 eV
suggesting that unresolved satellite structure may be contributing to the linewidth of the resonant
peak. The low energy resonances (approximately 10 eV) involve carbon atoms located inside the perimeter,
a configuration present only in pyrene and coronene (among the hydrocarbons studied). In the case
of pyrene, which has two carbon atoms inside the perimeter, we employ a two-site Hubbard model to
characterize the absorption leading to the quasi-bound state. A brief analysis of the double photoionization
resonance of the heterocyclic inorganic molecule 1,3,5-triazine presented. We also discuss recent
results for the double photoionization of the cyclic inorganic molecule tribromoborazine and
the organic molecules furan, pyrrole, selenophene, and thiophene where the 2+ ion concentration
varies linearly with the difference between the photon energy and the threshold energy. A theory
for the linear behavior is outlined.
