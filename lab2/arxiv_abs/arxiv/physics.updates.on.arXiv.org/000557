Face-to-face contacts between individuals contribute to shape social networks and play an important
role in determining how infectious diseases can spread within a population. It is thus important
to obtain accurate and reliable descriptions of human contact patterns occurring in various day-to-day
life contexts. Recent technological advances and the development of wearable sensors able to sense
proximity patterns have made it possible to gather data giving access to time-varying contact networks
of individuals in specific environments. Here we present and analyze two such data sets describing
with high temporal resolution the contact patterns of students in a high school. We define contact
matrices describing the contact patterns between students of different classes and show the importance
of the class structure. We take advantage of the fact that the two data sets were collected in the same
setting during several days in two successive years to perform a longitudinal analysis on two very
different timescales. We show the high stability of the contact patterns across days and across
years: the statistical distributions of numbers and durations of contacts are the same in different
periods, and we observe a very high similarity of the contact matrices measured in different days
or different years. The rate of change of the contacts of each individual from one day to the next is
also similar in different years. We discuss the interest of the present analysis and data sets for
various fields, including in social sciences in order to better understand and model human behavior
and interactions in different contexts, and in epidemiology in order to inform models describing
the spread of infectious diseases and design targeted containment strategies.
