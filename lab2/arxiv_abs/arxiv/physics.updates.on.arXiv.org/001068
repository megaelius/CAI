Room temperature ionic liquids (ILs) at solid surfaces have been recognized for their significant
interfacial properties in electrochemical and electronic devices. To ascertain the interface
effects, we investigate dynamical and structural properties of two ILs in nanoscale confinement
at various temperatures. Specifically, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for
ILs composed of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cations and hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim][PF6])
or tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim][BF4]) anions sandwiched between amorphous silica slabs. Density
profiles of the ionic species across the slit reveal that [PF6] and [BF4] anions tend to stay closer
to the slab wall than [Bmim] cations resulting in a bi-layered arrangement in the interfacial region.
For the cations, we observe a preferred orientation at the surface with the methyl groups pointing
towards the wall and the butyl tails projected inwards. Mean square displacements and incoherent
scattering function reveal slowed and heterogeneous dynamics of all ionic species in the slit pore.
In particular, spatially resolved analyses show that the structural relaxation times increase
by about two orders of magnitude when approaching the silica surfaces, an effect to be considered
when designing applications. The altered structural and dynamical features of the confined ILs
can be related to an existence of preferred sites for the anions on the amorphous silica surfaces.
Detailed analyses of relations between the broadly distributed site and surface properties show
that particularly stable anion sites result when triangular arrangements of silanol groups enable
multiple hydrogen bonds with the various fluorine atoms of a given anion, elucidating an important
trapping mechanism at the silica surface.
