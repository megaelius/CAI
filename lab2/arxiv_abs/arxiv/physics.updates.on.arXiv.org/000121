Social mobilization, the ability to mobilize large numbers of people via social networks to achieve
highly distributed tasks, has received significant attention in recent times. This growing capability,
facilitated by modern communication technology, is highly relevant to endeavors which require
the search for individuals that posses rare information or skill, such as finding medical doctors
during disasters, or searching for missing people. An open question remains, as to whether in time-critical
situations, people are able to recruit in a targeted manner, or whether they resort to so-called
blind search, recruiting as many acquaintances as possible via broadcast communication. To explore
this question, we examine data from our recent success in the U.S. State Department's Tag Challenge,
which required locating and photographing 5 target persons in 5 different cities in the United States
and Europe in less than 12 hours, based only on a single mug-shot. We find that people are able to consistently
route information in a targeted fashion even under increasing time pressure. We derive an analytical
model for global mobilization and use it to quantify the extent to which people were targeting others
during recruitment. Our model estimates that approximately 1 in 3 messages were of targeted fashion
during the most time-sensitive period of the challenge.This is a novel observation at such short
temporal scales, and calls for opportunities for devising viral incentive schemes that provide
distance- or time-sensitive rewards to approach the target geography more rapidly, with applications
in multiple areas from emergency preparedness, to political mobilization.
