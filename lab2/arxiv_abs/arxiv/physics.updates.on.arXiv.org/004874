In many simulations of turbulent flows the viscous forces $\nu\nabla^2 {\bf u}$ are replaced by
a hyper-viscous term $-\nu_p(-\nabla^2)^{p}{\bf u}$ in order to suppress the effect of viscosity
at the large scales. In this work we examine the effect of hyper-viscosity on decaying turbulence
for values of $p$ ranging from $p=1$ (regular viscosity) up to $p=100$. Our study is based on direct
numerical simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex for resolutions from $512^3$ to $2048^3$. Our
results demonstrate that the evolution of the total energy $E$ and the energy dissipation $\epsilon$
remain almost unaffected by the order of the hyper-viscosity used. However, as the order of the hyper-viscosity
is increased ,the energy spectrum develops a more pronounced bottleneck that contaminates the
inertial range. At the largest values of $p$ examined, the spectrum at the bottleneck range has a
positive power-law behavior $E(k)\propto k^\alpha$ with the power-law exponent $\alpha$ approaching
the value obtained in flows at thermal equilibrium $\alpha=2$. This agrees with the prediction
of Frisch et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 144501 (2008)] who suggested that at high values of $p$, the
flow should behave like the truncated Euler equations (TEE). Nonetheless, despite the thermalization
of the spectrum, the flow retains a finite dissipation rate up to the examined order, which disagrees
with the predictions of the TEE system implying suppression of energy dissipation. We reconcile
the two apparently contradictory results, predicting the value of $p$ for which the hyper-viscous
Navier-Stokes goes over to the TEE system and we discuss why thermalization appears at smaller values
of $p$.
