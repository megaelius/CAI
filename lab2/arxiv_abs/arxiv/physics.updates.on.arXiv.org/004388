The conservation of energy and momentum have been viewed as undermining Cartesian mental causation
since the 1690s. Modern discussions of the topic tend to use mid-19th century physics, neglecting
both locality and Noether's theorem and its converse. The relevance of General Relativity (GR)
has rarely been considered. But a few authors have proposed that the non-localizability of gravitational
energy and consequent lack of physically meaningful local conservation laws answers the conservation
objection to mental causation: conservation already fails in GR, so there is nothing for minds to
violate. This paper is motivated by two ideas. First, one might take seriously the fact that GR formally
has an infinity of rigid symmetries of the action and hence, by Noether's first theorem, an infinity
of conserved energies-momenta (thus answering Schr\"{o}dinger's 1918 false-negative objection).
Second, Sean Carroll has asked (rhetorically) how one should modify the Dirac-Maxwell-Einstein
equations to describe mental causation. This paper uses the generalized Bianchi identities to
show that General Relativity tends to exclude, not facilitate, such Cartesian mental causation.
In the simplest case, Cartesian mental influence must be spatio-temporally constant, and hence
0. The difficulty may diminish for more complicated models. Its persuasiveness is also affected
by larger world-view considerations. The new general relativistic objection provides some support
for realism about gravitational energy-momentum in GR (taking pseudotensor laws seriously).
Such realism also answers an objection to theories of causation involving conserved quantities,
because energies-momenta would be conserved even in GR.
