A many-body system of charged particles interacting via a pairwise Yukawa potential, the so-called
Yukawa One Component Plasma (YOCP) is a good approximation for a variety of physical systems. Such
systems are completely characterized by two parameters; the screening parameter, $\kappa$, and
the nominal coupling strength, $\Gamma$. It is well known that the collective spectrum of the YOCP
is governed by a longitudinal acoustic mode, both in the weakly and strongly coupled regimes. In
the long-wavelength limit the linear term in the dispersion (\textit{i.e.} $\omega = s k$) defines
the sound speed $s$. We study the evolution of this latter quantity from the weak through the strong
coupling regimes by analyzing the Dynamic Structure Function $S(k,\omega)$ in the low frequency
domain. Depending on the values of $\Gamma$ and $\kappa$ and $w = s/v_{\textrm{th}}$, (\textit{i.e.}
the ratio between the phase velocity of the wave and thermal speed of the particles) we identify five
domains in the $(\kappa,\Gamma)$ parameter space in which the physical behavior of the YOCP exhibits
different features. The competing physical processes are the collective Coulomb like vs. binary
collision dominated behavior and the individual particle motion vs. quasi-localization. Our
principal tool of investigation is Molecular Dynamics (MD) computer simulation from which we obtain
$S(k,\omega)$. Recent improvements in the simulation technique have allowed us to obtain a large
body of high quality data in the range $\Gamma = \{0.1 - 10,000\}$ and $\kappa = \{0.5 -5\}$. The theoretical
results based on various models are compared in order to see which one provides the most cogent physical
description and the best agreement with MD data in the different domains.
