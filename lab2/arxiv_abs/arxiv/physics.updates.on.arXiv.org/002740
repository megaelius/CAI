Here, we investigate the validity of the Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) relation in TIP4P/2005 supercooled
water using molecular dynamics simulations. To this end, we consider calculations of the translational
and rotational diffusion constants, $D_\mathrm{t}$ and $D_\mathrm{r}$, respectively, the rotational
relaxation time of the $\ell$-th degree Legendre polynomials $\tau_\ell$, and shear viscosity
$\eta$. $D_\mathrm{t}$ and $D_\mathrm{r}$ are significantly decoupled in supercooled states,
which is in agreement with previously reported simulation results. Furthermore, we reveal that
the Debye rotational diffusion model, $D_\mathrm{r}\propto {\tau_\ell}^{-1}$, breaks down
entirely. More importantly, we find that increases in $\tau_\ell$ in response to decreasing temperatures
are markedly dependent on the order, $\ell$, causing spurious arguments regarding the SED relation,
which is frequently considered by quantifying $\tau_\ell T/\eta$, $D_\mathrm{t}\tau_\ell$,
or $D_\mathrm{t}/D_\mathrm{r}$. We demonstrate that the higher-order $\tau_\ell$ values exhibit
a temperature dependence similar to that of viscosity divided by temperature, $\eta/T$, whereas
the lowest-order $\tau_\ell$ values are coupled with the translational diffusion constant $D_\mathrm{t}$,
but are decoupled with $\eta/T$. We examine the $\ell$ dependence of $\tau_\ell$ by analyzing the
displacement-angle probability and the four-point correlation functions. Our results suggest
that the translational-rotational molecular motions are coupled with large displacements and
angles due to cage effects, rather than the conventional decoupling scenario.
