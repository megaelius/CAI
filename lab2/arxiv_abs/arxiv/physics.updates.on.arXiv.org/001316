There has been growing evidence that cooperative interactions and configurational rearrangements
underpin protein functions. But in spite of vast genetic and structural data, the information-dense,
heterogeneous nature of protein has held back the progress in understanding the underlying principles.
Here we outline a general theory of protein that quantitatively links sequence, dynamics and function:
The protein is a strongly-coupled amino acid network whose interactions and large-scale motions
are captured by the mechanical propagator, also known as the Green function. The propagator relates
the gene to the connectivity of the amino acid network and the transmission of forces through the
protein. How well the force pattern conforms to the collective modes of the functional protein is
measured by the fitness. Mutations introduce localized perturbations to the propagator which
scatter the force field. The emergence of function is manifested by a topological transition when
a band of such perturbations divides the protein into subdomains. Epistasis quantifies how much
the combined effect of multiple mutations departs from additivity. We find that epistasis is the
nonlinearity of the Green function, which corresponds to a sum over multiple scattering paths passing
through the localized perturbations. We apply this mechanical framework to the simulations of
protein evolution, and observe long-range epistasis which facilitates collective functional
modes. Our model lays the foundation for understanding the protein as an evolved state of matter
and may be a prototype for other strongly-correlated living systems.
