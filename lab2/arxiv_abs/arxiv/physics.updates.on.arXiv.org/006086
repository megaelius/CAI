Two-dimensional colloidal halide perovskite nanocrystals are promising materials for light
emitting applications. In addition, they can be used as components to create a variety of materials
through physical and chemical transformations. Recent studies focused on nanoplatelets that
are able to self-assemble and transform on solid substrates. Yet, the mechanism behind the process
and the atomic arrangement of their assemblies remain unclear. Here, we present the transformation
of self-assembled stacks of CsPbBr$_3$ nanoplatelets in solution, capturing the different stages
of the process by keeping the solutions at room temperature and monitoring the nanocrystal morphology
over a period of a few months. Using ex-situ transmission electron microscopy and surface analysis,
we demonstrate that the transformation mechanism can be understood as oriented attachment, proceeding
through the following steps: i) desorption of the ligands from the particles surfaces, causing
the merging of nanoplatelet stacks, which first form nanobelts; ii) merging of neighboring nanobelts
that form more extended nanoplates; and iii) attachment of nanobelts and nanoplates, which create
objects with an atomic structure that resemble a mosaic made of broken nanotiles. We reveal that
the starting nanoplatelets merge seamlessly and defect-free on an atomic scale in small and thin
nanobelts. However, aged nanobelts and nanoplates, which are mainly stabilized by amine/ammonium
ions, link through a bilayer of CsBr. In this case, the atomic columns of neighboring perovskite
lattices shift by a half-unit-cell, forming Ruddlesden-Popper planar faults.
