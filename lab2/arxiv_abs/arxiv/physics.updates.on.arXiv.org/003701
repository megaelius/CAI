The discovery of a SM Higgs boson at the LHC brought about great opportunity to investigate the feasibility
of a Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) operating at center-of-mass energy of $\sim 240$
GeV, as a Higgs factory, with designed luminosity of about $2\times 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. The
CEPC provides a much cleaner collision environment than the LHC, it is ideally suited for studying
the properties of Higgs boson with greater precision. Another advantage of the CEPC over the LHC
is that the Higgs boson can be detected through the recoil mass method by only reconstructing Z boson
decay without examining the Higgs decays. In Concept Design Report(CDR), the circumference of
CEPC is 100km, with two interaction points available for exploring different detector design scenarios
and technologies. The baseline design of CEPC detector is an ILD-like concept, with a superconducting
solenoid of 3.0 Tesla surrounding the inner silicon detector, TPC tracker detector and the calorimetry
system. Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) have been extensively studied and used in many fields,
especially in particle physics experiments, including STAR and ALICE. The TPC detector will operate
in continuous mode on the circular machine. To fulfill the physics goals of the future circular collider
and meet Higgs/$Z$ run, a TPC with excellent performance is required. We have proposed and investigated
the ions controlling performance of a novel configuration detector module. The aim of this study
is to suppress ion backflow ($IBF$) continually. In this paper, some update results of the feasibility
and limitation on TPC detector technology R$\&$D will be given using the hybrid gaseous detector
module.
