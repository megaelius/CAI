We report results on the geometrical statistics of the vorticity vector obtained from experiments
in electromagnetically forced rotating turbulence. A range of rotation rates $\Omega$ is considered,
from non-rotating to rapidly rotating turbulence with a maximum background rotation rate of $\Omega=5$
rad/s (with Rossby number much smaller than unity). Typically, in our experiments ${\rm{Re}}_{\lambda}\approx
100$. The measurement volume is located in the centre of the fluid container above the bottom boundary
layer, where the turbulent flow can be considered locally statistically isotropic and horizontally
homogeneous for the non-rotating case, see van Bokhoven et al., Phys. Fluids 21, 096601 (2009).
Based on the full set of velocity derivatives, measured in a Lagrangian way by 3D Particle Tracking
Velocimetry, we have been able to quantify statistically the effect of system rotation on several
flow properties. The experimental results show how the turbulence evolves from almost isotropic
3D turbulence ($\Omega\lesssim 0.2$ rad/s) to quasi-2D turbulence ($\Omega\approx 5.0$ rad/s)
and how this is reflected by several statistical quantities. In particular, we have studied the
orientation of the vorticity vector with respect to the three eigenvectors of the local strain rate
tensor and with respect to the vortex stretching vector. Additionally, we have quantified the role
of system rotation on the self-amplification terms of the enstrophy and strain rate equations and
the direct contribution of the background rotation on these evolution equations. The main effect
is the strong reduction of extreme events and related (strong) reduction of the skewness of PDFs
of several quantities such as, for example, the intermediate eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor
and the enstrophy self-amplification term.
