We develop a stochastic model for the velocity gradients dynamics along a Lagrangian trajectory.
Comparing with different attempts proposed in the literature, the present model, at the cost of
introducing a free parameter known in turbulence phenomenology as the intermittency coefficient,
gives a realistic picture of velocity gradient statistics at any Reynolds number. To achieve this
level of accuracy, we use as a first modelling step a regularized self-stretching term in the framework
of the Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) approximation that was shown to give a realistic picture of
small scales statistics of turbulence only up to moderate Reynolds numbers. As a second step, we
constrain the dynamics, in the spirit of Girimaji & Pope (1990), in order to impose a peculiar statistical
structure to the dissipation seen by the Lagrangian particle. This probabilistic closure uses
as a building block a random field that fulfils the statistical description of the intermittency,
i.e. multifractal, phenomenon. To do so, we define and generalize to a statistically stationary
framework a proposition made by Schmitt (2003). These considerations lead us to propose a non-linear
and non-Markovian closed dynamics for the elements of the velocity gradient tensor. We numerically
integrate this dynamics and observe that a stationary regime is indeed reached, in which (i) the
gradients variance is proportional to the Reynolds number, (ii) gradients are typically correlated
over the (small) Kolmogorov time scale and gradients norms over the (large) integral time scale
(iii) the joint probability distribution function of the two non vanishing invariants $Q$ and $R$
reproduces the characteristic teardrop shape, (iv) vorticity gets preferentially aligned with
the intermediate eigendirection of the deformation tensor and (v) gradients are strongly non-Gaussian
and intermittent.
