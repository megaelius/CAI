Purpose: To understand the influence of various acquisition parameters on the ability of CEST MR-Fingerprinting
(MRF) to discriminate different chemical exchange parameters and to provide tools for optimal
acquisition schedule design and parameter map reconstruction. Methods: Numerical simulations
were conducted using a parallel-computing implementation of the Bloch-McConnell equations,
examining the effect of TR, TE, flip-angle, water T$_{1}$ and T$_{2}$, saturation-pulse duration,
power, and frequency on the discrimination ability of CEST-MRF. A modified Euclidean-distance
matching metric was evaluated and compared to traditional dot-product matching. L-Arginine phantoms
of various concentrations and pH were scanned at 4.7T and the results compared to numerical findings.
Results: Simulations for dot-product matching demonstrated that the optimal flip-angle and saturation
times are 30$^{\circ}$ and 1100 ms, respectively. The optimal maximal saturation power was 3.4
$\mu$T for concentrated solutes with a slow exchange-rate, and 5.2 $\mu$T for dilute solutes with
medium-to-fast exchange-rates. Using the Euclidean-distance matching metric, much lower maximum
saturation powers were required (1.6 and 2.4 $\mu$T, respectively), with a slightly longer saturation
time (1500 ms) and 90$^{\circ}$ flip-angle. For both matching metrics, the discrimination ability
increased with the repetition time. The experimental results were in agreement with simulations,
demonstrating that more than a 50% reduction in scan-time can be achieved by Euclidean-distance-based
matching. Conclusion: Optimization of the CEST-MRF acquisition schedule is critical for obtaining
the best exchange parameter accuracy. The use of Euclidean-distance-based matching of signal
trajectories simultaneously improved the discrimination ability and reduced the scan time and
maximal saturation power required.
