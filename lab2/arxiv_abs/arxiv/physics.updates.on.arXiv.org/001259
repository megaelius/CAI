The stability properties of intermediate-order climate models are investigated by computing
their Lyapunov exponents (LEs). The two models considered are PUMA (Portable University Model
of the Atmosphere), a primitive-equation simple general circulation model, and MAOOAM (Modular
Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model), a quasi-geostrophic coupled ocean-atmosphere model
on a beta-plane. We wish to to investigate the effect of the different levels of filtering on the instabilities
and dynamics of the atmospheric flows. Moreover, we assess the impact of the oceanic coupling, the
dissipation scheme and the resolution on the spectra of LEs. The PUMA Lyapunov spectrum is computed
for two different values of the meridional temperature gradient defining the Newtonian forcing.
The increase of the gradient gives rise to a higher baroclinicity and stronger instabilities, corresponding
to a larger dimension of the unstable manifold and a larger first LE. The convergence rate of the rate
functional for the large deviation law of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) is fast for
all exponents, which can be interpreted as resulting from the absence of a clear-cut atmospheric
time-scale separation in such a model. The MAOOAM spectra show that the dominant atmospheric instability
is correctly represented even at low resolutions. However, the dynamics of the central manifold,
which is mostly associated to the ocean dynamics, is not fully resolved because of its associated
long time scales, even at intermediate orders. This paper highlights the need to investigate the
natural variability of the atmosphere-ocean coupled dynamics by associating rate of growth and
decay of perturbations to the physical modes described using the formalism of the covariant Lyapunov
vectors and to consider long integrations in order to disentangle the dynamical processes occurring
at all time scales.
