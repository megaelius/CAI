Holographic wave-shaping has found numerous applications across the physical sciences, especially
since the development of digital spatial-light modulators (SLMs). A key challenge in digital holography
consists in finding optimal hologram patterns which transform the incoming laser beam into desired
shapes in a conjugate optical plane. The existing repertoire of approaches to solve this inverse
problem is built on iterative phase-retrieval algorithms, which do not take optical aberrations
and deviations from theoretical models into account. Here, we adopt a physics-free, data-driven,
and probabilistic approach to the problem. Using deep conditional generative models such as Generative-Adversarial
Networks (cGAN) or Variational Autoencoder (cVAE), we approximate conditional distributions
of holograms for a given target laser intensity pattern. In order to reduce the cardinality of the
problem, we train our models on a proxy mapping relating an 8x8-matrix of complex-valued spatial-frequency
coefficients to the ensuing 100x100-shaped intensity distribution recorded on a camera. We discuss
the degree of 'ill-posedness' that remains in this reduced problem and compare different generative
model architectures in terms of their ability to find holograms that reconstruct given intensity
patterns. Finally, we challenge our models to generalise to synthetic target intensities, where
the existence of matching holograms cannot be guaranteed. We devise a forward-interpolating training
scheme aimed at providing models the ability to interpolate in laser intensity space, rather than
hologram space and show that this indeed enhances model performance on synthetic data sets.
