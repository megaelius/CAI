Accurate and efficient aeroelastic models are critically important for enabling the optimization
and control of highly flexible aerospace structures, which are expected to become pervasive in
future transportation and energy systems. Advanced materials and morphing wing technologies
are resulting in next-generation aeroelastic systems that are characterized by highly-coupled
and nonlinear interactions between the aerodynamic and structural dynamics. In this work, we leverage
emerging data-driven modeling techniques to develop highly accurate and tractable reduced-order
aeroelastic models that are valid over a wide range of operating conditions and are suitable for
control. In particular, we develop two extensions to the recent dynamic mode decomposition with
control (DMDc) algorithm to make it suitable for flexible aeroelastic systems: 1) we introduce
a formulation to handle algebraic equations, and 2) we develop an interpolation scheme to smoothly
connect several linear DMDc models developed in different operating regimes. Thus, the innovation
lies in accurately modeling the nonlinearities of the coupled aerostructural dynamics over multiple
operating regimes, not restricting the validity of the model to a narrow region around a linearization
point. We demonstrate this approach on a high-fidelity, three-dimensional numerical model of
an airborne wind energy (AWE) system, although the methods are generally applicable to any highly
coupled aeroelastic system or dynamical system operating over multiple operating regimes. Our
proposed modeling framework results in real-time prediction of nonlinear unsteady aeroelastic
responses of flexible aerospace structures, and we demonstrate the enhanced model performance
for model predictive control. Thus, the proposed architecture may help enable the widespread adoption
of next-generation morphing wing technologies.
