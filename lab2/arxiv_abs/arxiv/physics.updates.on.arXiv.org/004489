A simple, dual-site model of bolaamphiphiles (bolaforms or bipolar amphiphiles) is developed
based on an earlier single-site model of (monopolar) amphiphiles [S. Dey, J. Saha, Phys. Rev. E 95,
023315 (2017)]. The model incorporates aqueous environment (both hydrophobic effect and hydration
force) in its anisotropic site-site interactions, thus obviating the need to simulate solvent
particles explicitly. This economy of sites and the absence of explicit solvent particles enable
molecular dynamics simulations of bolaamphiphiles to achieve mesoscopic length and time-scales
unattainable by any bead-spring model or explicit solvent computations. The model applies to generic
bolas only, since the gain in scale can only be obtained by sacrificing the resolution of detailed
molecular structure. Thanks to dual-sites, however, (as opposed to a single-site model) our model
can incorporate the essential flexibility of bolas that leads to their U-conformers. The model
bolas show successful self-assembly into experimentally observed nano-structures like micelles,
rods, lamellae etc. and retain fluidity in very stable monolayers. Presence of membrane-spanning
model bolas in bilayers of model monopolar amphiphiles increases the stability and impermeability
of the lamellar phase. Model bolas are also seen to be less diffusive and to produce thicker layers
compared to their monopolar counterparts. Rigid model bolas, though achiral themselves, show
self-assembly into helical rods. As all these observations agree with the well-known key characteristics
of archaeal lipids and synthetic bolaamphiphiles, our model promises to be effective for studies
of bolas in context of biomimetics, drug-delivery and low molecular weight hydrogelators. To the
best of our knowledge, no other single or dual-site, solvent-free model for bolas has been reported
thus far.
