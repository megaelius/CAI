A simple, yet effective method of controlling the size and size distributions of nanoparticles
produced as a result of laser ablation of target material is presented. The method employs the presence
of physical boundaries on either sides of the ablation site. In order to demonstrate the potential
of the method, experiments have been conducted with copper and titanium as the target materials
that are placed in two different liquid media (water and isopropyl alcohol). The ablation of the
target material immersed in the liquid medium has been carried out using an Nd:YAG laser. Significant
differences in the size and size distributions are observed in the cases of nanoparticles produced
with and without confining boundaries. It is seen that for any given liquid medium and the target
material, the mean size of the nanoparticles obtained with the boundary-fitted target surface
is consistently higher than that achieved in the case of open (flat) targets. The observed trend
has been attributed to the plausible role(s) of the confining boundaries in prolonging the thermalisation
time of the plasma plume. In order to ascertain that the observed differences in sizes of the nanoparticles
produced with and without the presence of the physical barriers are predominantly because of the
prolonged thermalisation of the plasma plume and not due to the possible formation of oxide layer,
select experiments with gold as the target material in water have also been performed. The experiments
also show that, irrespective of the liquid medium, the increase in the mean size of the copper-based
nanoparticles due to the presence of physical boundaries is relatively higher than that observed
in the case of titanium target material under similar experimental conditions.
