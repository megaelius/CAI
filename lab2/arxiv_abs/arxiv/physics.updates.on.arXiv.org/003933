To date, a non-controversial mechanism for the initiation and development of lightning in thunderstorm
clouds has not been formulated as a sequential chain of events that begins with the first electron
avalanches and ends with the appearance of a negative step leader. Based on experimental results
of recent years, this article presents a qualitative description of a possible mechanism (termed
the Mechanism) covering the main stages of lightning initiation, starting before and including
the initiating event, followed by the initial electric field change (IEC), followed by the first
few initial breakdown pulses (IBPs). The later transition from IBPs to a negative stepped leader
is briefly described. The Mechanism assumes initiation occurs in a region of a thundercloud of 1
km^3 with electric field E > 300 kV(m atm)^(-1), which contains, because of turbulence, numerous
small 'Eth-volumes' of 0,001 m^3 with E > 3 MV(m atm)^(-1). The Mechanism allows for lightning initiation
by two observed types of initiating events: a high power VHF event called an NBE (narrow bipolar event),
or a weak VHF event. According to the Mechanism, both types of initiating events are caused by a group
of relativistic runaway electron avalanche particles passing through many of the Eth-volumes,
thereby causing the nearly simultaneous launching of many positive streamer flashes. Due to ionization-heating
instability, unusual plasma formations (UPFs) appear along the trajectories of the streamers.
These UPFs combine into three-dimensional (3D) networks of hot plasma channels during the IEC,
resulting in its observed weak current flow. The subsequent development and combination of two
(or more) of these 3D networks of hot plasma channels then causes the first IBP. Each subsequent IBP
is caused when another 3D network of hot plasma channels combines with the chain of networks caused
by earlier IBPs.
