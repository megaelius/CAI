The nodes in communication networks are possibly and most likely equipped with different recovery
resources, which allow them to recover from a virus with different rates. In this paper, we aim to
understand know how to allocate the limited recovery resources to efficiently prevent the spreading
of epidemics. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model on directed
scale-free networks. In the classic SIS model, a susceptible node can be infected by an infected
neighbor with the infection rate $\beta$ and an infected node can be recovered to be susceptible
again with the recovery rate $\delta$. In the steady state a fraction $y_\infty$ of nodes are infected,
which shows how severely the network is infected. We propose to allocate the recovery rate $\delta_i$
for node $i$ according to its indegree and outdegree-$\delta_i\scriptsize{\sim}k_{i,in}^{\alpha_{in}}k_{i,out}^{\alpha_{out}}$,
given the finite average recovery rate $\langle\delta\rangle$ representing the limited recovery
resources over the whole network. We find that, by tuning the two scaling exponents $\alpha_{in}$
and $\alpha_{out}$, we can always reduce the infection fraction $y_\infty$ thus reducing the extent
of infections, comparing to the homogeneous recovery rates allocation. Moreover, we can find our
optimal strategy via the optimal choice of the exponent $\alpha_{in}$ and $\alpha_{out}$. Our
optimal strategy indicates that when the recovery resources are sufficient, more resources should
be allocated to the nodes with a larger indegree or outdegree, but when the recovery resource is very
limited, only the nodes with a larger outdegree should be equipped with more resources. We also find
that our optimal strategy works better when the recovery resources are sufficient but not yet able
to make the epidemic die out, and when the indegree outdegree correlation is small.
