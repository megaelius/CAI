In this work, using solutions from a local gyrokinetic flux-tube code combined with higher order
ballooning theory, a new analytical approach is developed to reconstruct the global linear mode
structure with associated global mode frequency. In addition to the isolated mode (IM), which usually
peaks on the outboard mid-plane, the higher order ballooning theory has also captured other types
of less unstable global modes: (a) the weakly asymmetric ballooning theory (WABT) predicts a mixed
mode (MM) that undergoes a small poloidal shift away from the outboard mid-plane, (b) a relatively
more stable general mode (GM) balloons on the top (or bottom) of the tokamak plasma. In this paper,
an analytic approach is developed to combine these disconnected analytical limits into a single
generalised ballooning theory (GBT). This is used to investigate how an IM behaves under the effect
of sheared toroidal flow. For small values of flow an IM initially converts into a MM where the results
of WABT are recaptured, and eventually, as the flow increases, the mode asymptotically becomes
a GM on the top (or bottom) of the plasma. This may be an ingredient in models for understanding why
in some experimental scenarios, instead of large edge localised modes (ELMs), small ELMs are observed.
Finally, our theory can have other important consequences, especially for calculations involving
Reynolds stress driven intrinsic rotation through the radial asymmetry in the global mode structures.
Understanding the intrinsic rotation is significant because external torque in a plasma the size
of ITER is expected to be relatively low.
