The energy gap between the lowest-lying singlet and triplet states is an important quantity in chemical
photocatalysis, with relevant applications ranging from triplet fusion in optical upconversion
to the design of organic light-emitting devices. The ab initio prediction of singlet-triplet (ST)
gaps is challenging due to the potentially biradical nature of the involved states, combined with
the potentially large size of relevant molecules. In this work, we show that phaseless auxiliary-field
quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) can accurately predict ST gaps for chemical systems with singlet
states of highly biradical nature, including a set of 13 small molecules and the ortho-, meta-, and
para-isomers of benzyne. With respect to gas-phase experiments, ph-AFQMC using CASSCF trial wavefunctions
achieves a mean averaged error of ~1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, we find that in the context of a spin-projection
technique, ph-AFQMC using unrestricted single-determinant trial wavefunctions, which can be
readily obtained for even very large systems, produces equivalently high accuracy. We proceed
to show that this scalable methodology is capable of yielding accurate ST gaps for all linear polyacenes
for which experimental measurements exist, i.e. naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene, and pentacene.
Our results suggest a protocol for selecting either unrestricted Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham orbitals
for the single-determinant trial wavefunction, based on the extent of spin-contamination. These
findings pave the way for future investigations of specific photochemical processes involving
large molecules with substantial biradical character.
