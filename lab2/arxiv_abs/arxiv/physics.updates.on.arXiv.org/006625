The discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) is a new finite volume (FV) scheme for continuum
and rarefied flows which combines the benefits of both Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and unified
gas kinetic scheme (UGKS). By reconstruction of gas distribution function using particle velocity
characteristic line, flux contains more detailed information of fluid flow and more concrete physical
nature. In this work, a simplified DUGKS is proposed with reconstruction stage on a whole time step
instead of half time step in original DUGKS. Using temporal/spatial integral Boltzmann Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook
(BGK) equation, the transformed distribution function with inclusion of collision effect is constructed.
The macro and mesoscopic fluxes of the cell on next time step is predicted by reconstruction of transformed
distribution function at interfaces along particle velocity characteristic lines. According
to the conservation law, the macroscopic variables of the cell on next time step can be updated through
its macroscopic flux. Equilibrium distribution function on next time step can also be updated.
Gas distribution function is updated by FV scheme through its predicted mesoscopic flux in a time
step. Compared with the original DUGKS, the computational process of the proposed method is more
concise because of the omission of half time step flux calculation. Numerical time step is only limited
by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition and relatively good stability has been preserved.
Several test cases, including the Couette flow, lid-driven cavity flow, laminar flows over a flat
plate, a circular cylinder, and an airfoil, as well as micro cavity flow cases are conducted to validate
present scheme. The numerical simulation results agree well with the references' results.
