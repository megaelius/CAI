We investigate velocity variations inside of and surrounding a gravity driven drop impacting on
and moving through a confining orifice, wherein the effects of edge geometry (round- vs. sharp-edged)
and surface wettability (hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic) of the orifice are considered. Using refractive
index matching and time-resolved PIV, we quantify the redistribution of energy in the drop and the
surrounding fluid during the drop's impact and motion through a round-edged orifice. The measurements
show the importance of a) drop kinetic energy transferred to and dissipated within the surrounding
liquid, and b) the drop kinetic energy due to internal deformation and rotation during impact and
passage through the orifice. While a rounded orifice edge prevents contact between the drop and
orifice surface, a sharp edge promotes contact immediately upon impact, changing the near surface
flow field as well as the drop passage dynamics. For a sharp-edged hydrophobic orifice, the contact
lines remain localized near the orifice edge, but slipping and pinning strongly affect the drop
propagation and outcome. For a sharp-edged hydrophilic orifice, on the other hand, the contact
lines propagate away from the orifice edge, and their motion is coupled with the global velocity
fields in the drop and the surrounding fluid. By examining the contact line propagation over a hydrophilic
orifice surface with minimal drop penetration, we characterize two stages of drop spreading that
exhibit power-law dependence with variable exponent. In the first stage, the contact line propagates
under the influence of impact inertia and gravity. In the second stage, inertial influence subsides,
and the contact line propagates mainly due to wettability.
