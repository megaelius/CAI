Purpose: In this study, procedures were developed to achieve efficient reversible conversion
of a clinical linear accelerator (LINAC) and deliver electron FLASH (eFLASH) or conventional beams
to the treatment room isocenter. Material & Methods: The LINAC was converted to deliver eFLASH beam
within 20 minutes by retracting the x-ray target from the beam's path, positioning the carousel
on an empty port, and selecting 10 MV photon beam energy in the treatment console. Dose per pulse and
average dose rate were measured in a solid water phantom at different depths with Gafchromic film
and OSLD. A pulse controller counted the pulses via scattered radiation signal and gated the delivery
for preset pulse count. A fast photomultiplier tube-based Cherenkov detector measured per pulse
beam output at 2 ns sampling rate. After conversion back to clinical mode, conventional beam output,
flatness, symmetry, field size and energy were measured for all clinically commissioned energies.
Results: Dose per pulse of 0.86 +/- 0.01 Gy (310 +/- 7 Gy/s average dose rate) were achieved at isocenter.
The dose from simultaneous irradiation of film and OSLD were within 1%. The PMT showed the LINAC required
about 5 pulses before the output stabilized and its long-term stability was within 3% for measurements
performed at 3 minutes intervals. The dose, flatness, symmetry, and photon energy were unchanged
from baseline and within tolerance (1%, 3%, 2%, and 0.1% respectively) after reverting to conventional
beams. Conclusion: 10 MeV FLASH beams were achieved at the isocenter of the treatment room. The beam
output was reproducible but requires further investigation of the ramp up time in the first 5 pulses,
equivalent to <100 cGy. The eFLASH beam can irradiate both small and large subjects in minimally
modified clinical settings and dose rates can be further increased by reducing the source to surface
distance.
