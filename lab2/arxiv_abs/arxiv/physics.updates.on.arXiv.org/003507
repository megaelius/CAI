This paper presents a first-principle and global perspective of electromagnetic chirality. It
follows for this purpose a bottom-up construction, from the description of chiral particles or
metaparticles (microscopic scale), through the electromagnetic theory of chiral media (macroscopic
scale), to the establishment advanced properties and design principles of chiral materials and
metamaterials. It preliminarily highlights the three fundamental concepts related to chirality
-- mirror asymmetry, polarization rotation and magnetodielectric coupling -- and points out the
nontrivial interdependencies existing between them. The first part (chiral particles) presents
metamaterial as the most promising technology for chirality, compares two representative particles
involving magnetoelectric coupling, namely the planar Omega particle and the twisted Omega or
helix particle, and shows that only the latter is chiral, and finally links the response of microscopic
particles to that of the medium formed by arranging them according to a subwavelength lattice structure.
The second part (electromagnetic theory) infers from the previous microscopic study the chiral
constitutive relations as a subset of the most general bianisotropic relations, derives parity
conditions for the chiral parameters, computes the chiral eigenstates as circularly polarized
waves, and finally shows that the circular birefringence of these states leads to polarization
rotation. The third part (properties and design) introduces an explicit formulation of chirality
based on spatial frequency dispersion or nonlocality, analyzes the temporal frequency dispersion
or nonlocality of chiral media, and finally provides guidelines to design a practical chiral metamaterial.
