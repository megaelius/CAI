Context. Atmospheric superrotating flows at the equator are an almost ubiquitous result of simulations
of hot Jupiters, and a theory explaining how this zonally coherent flow reaches an equilibrium has
been developed in the literature. However, this understanding relies on the existence of either
an initial superrotating or a sheared flow, coupled with a slow evolution such that a linear steady
state can be reached. Aims. A consistent physical understanding of superrotation is needed for
arbitrary drag and radiative timescales, and the relevance of considering linear steady states
needs to be assessed. Methods. We obtain an analytical expression for the structure, frequency
and decay rate of propagating waves in hot Jupiter atmospheres around a state at rest in the 2D shallow
water beta plane limit. We solve this expression numerically and confirm the robustness of our results
with a 3D linear wave algorithm. We then compare with 3D simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres and
study the non linear momentum fluxes. Results. We show that under strong day night heating the dynamics
does not transit through a linear steady state when starting from an initial atmosphere in solid
body rotation. We further show that non linear effects favour the initial spin up of superrotation
and that the acceleration due to the vertical component of the eddy momentum flux is critical to the
initial development of superrotation. Conclusions. Overall, we describe the initial phases of
the acceleration of superrotation, including consideration of differing radiative and drag timescales,
and conclude that eddy-momentum driven superrotating equatorial jets are robust, physical phenomena
in simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres.
