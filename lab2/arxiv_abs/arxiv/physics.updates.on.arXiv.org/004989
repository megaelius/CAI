Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is a powerful characterization technique to readily image
and manipulate ferroelectrics domains. PFM gives insight into the strength of local piezoelectric
coupling as well as polarization direction through PFM amplitude and phase, respectively. Converting
measured arbitrary units to physical material parameters, however, remains a challenge. While
much effort has been spent on quantifying the PFM amplitude signal, little attention has been given
to the PFM phase and it is often arbitrarily adjusted to fit expectations or processed as recorded.
This is problematic when investigating materials with unknown or potentially negative sign of
the probed effective electrostrictive coefficient or strong frequency dispersion of electromechanical
responses since assumptions about the phase cannot be reliably made. The PFM phase can, however,
provide important information on the polarization orientation and the sign of the electrostrictive
coefficient. Most notably, the orientation of the PFM hysteresis loop is determined by the PFM phase.
Moreover, when presenting PFM data as a combined signal, the resulting response can be artificially
lowered or asymmetric if the phase data has not been correctly processed. Here, we demonstrate a
path to identify the phase offset required to extract correct meaning from PFM phase data. We explore
different sources of phase offsets including the experimental setup, instrumental contributions,
and data analysis. We discuss the physical working principles of PFM and develop a strategy to extract
physical meaning from the PFM phase. The proposed procedures are verified on two materials with
positive and negative piezoelectric coefficients.
