While it is widely acknowledged that quantum theory is strange, and that the world view it implies
is elusive, there is considerably less consensus as to why this is the case. This article will explore
the possibility that the theory may be opaque because the mathematical language it employs is inarticulate.
To address this possibility, three interconnected mathematical theories will be developed, each
specifically designed to handle aspects of quantum theory's subject matter. The first will describe
dynamic systems in terms that are general enough to be applicable to any kind dynamics, including
both classical and quantum. That description will then be used to construct a theory of experiments,
with the aim of understanding what types of experiments scientific methodology allows. Finally,
the theory of experiments will found a theory of experimental probabilities applicable to any collection
of experiments, so long as their probabilities are internally consistent. The resulting over-arching
mathematical language will then be applied to quantum theory. In the initial application, it will
be used to explain the core nature and structure of quantum measurement and probability. Following
that, it will be used to explore quantum theory's models. Like any theory written in a mathematical
language, quantum theory derives its meaning from its class of models. To understand the class quantum
models, two models of central importance will be described. The first will be a conceptually simple
construction that follows almost immediately from the above theory of dynamics. It fully satisfies
both quantum theory and the above mentioned theory of experimentation; additionally, its macroscopic
objects obey classical mechanics. The second will utilize a minimal amount of mathematical structure
to satisfy the same conditions.
