Synergy, emerges from synchronized reciprocal positive feedback loops between a network of diverse
actors. For this process to proceed, compatible information from different sources synchronically
coordinates the actions of the actors resulting in a nonlinear increase in the useful work or potential
energy the system can manage. In contrast noise is produced when incompatible information is mixed.
This synergy produced from the coordination of different agents achieves non-linear gains in energy
and/or information that are greater than the sum of the parts. The final product of new synergies
is an increase in individual autonomy of an organism that achieves increased emancipation from
the environment with increases in productivity, efficiency, capacity for flexibility, self-regulation
and self-control of behavior through a synchronized division of ever more specialized labor. Synergistic
is the interdisciplinary science explaining the formation and self-organization of patterns
and structures in partially open systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Understanding the
mechanisms that produce synergy helps to increase success rates in everyday life, in business,
in science, in economics and in increasing, yet to named areas. A mechanism discovered by biological
evolution favoring the achievement of synergy in addition to division of labor is assortation:
the combination of similar or compatible agents or information, to reduce the chances of noisy mismatches.
Empirical evidence in many domains show that assortative information matching increases the probability
of achieving synergy.The roots of synergy are the features of that promote an increase the information
content or negentropy of the system, and its power to produce useful work.
