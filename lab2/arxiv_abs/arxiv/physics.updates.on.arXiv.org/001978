Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) enables for capability improvement of modern information processing
systems by replacing some of their electrical counterparts. With the miniaturization of SOI platform,
backscattering suppression is one of the central issues to avoid energy loss and signal distortion
in telecommunications. Valley, a new degree of freedom, provides an intriguing way for topologically
robust information transfer and unidirectional flow of light, in particular for subwavelength
strategy that still remains challenge in topological nanophotonics. Here, we realize topological
transport in a SOI valley photonic crystal (VPC) slab. In such inversion asymmetry slab, singular
Berry curvature near Brillouin zone corners guarantees valley-dependent topological edge states
below light cone, maintaining a balance between in-plane robustness and out-of-plane radiation.
Topologically robust transport at telecommunication wavelength is observed along two sharp-bend
VPC interfaces with a compact size (< 10 um), showing flat-top high transmission of around 10% bandwidth.
Furthermore, topological photonic routing is achieved in a bearded-stack VPC interface, originating
from broadband unidirectional excitation of the valley-chirality-locked edge state by using
a microdisk as a phase vortex generator. Control of valley in SOI platform not only shows a prototype
of integrated photonic devices with promising applications for delay line, routing, optical isolation
and dense wavelength division multiplexing for information processing based on topological nanophotonics,
but also opens a new door towards the observation of non-trivial states even in non-Hermitain systems.
