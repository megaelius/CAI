Heat and fluid flow in a rectangular channel heat sink equipped with longitudinal vortex generators
have been numerically investigated in the range of Reynolds numbers between 25 and 200. Aqueous
solutions of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with different concentrations (200-2000 ppm), which
are shear-thinning non-Newtonian liquids, have been utilised as working fluid. Three-dimensional
simulations have been performed on a plain channel and a channel with five pairs of vortex generators.
The channels have a hydraulic diameter of 8 mm and are heated by constant wall temperature. The vortex
generators have been mounted at different angles of attack and locations inside the channel. The
shear-thinning liquid flow in rectangular channels with longitudinal vortex generators are described
and the mechanisms of heat transfer enhancement are discussed. The results demonstrate a heat transfer
enhancement of 39-188% using CMC aqueous solutions in rectangular channels with LVGs with respect
to a Newtonian liquid flow (i.e. water). Additionally, it is shown that equipping rectangular channels
with LVGs results in an enhancement of 24-135% in heat transfer performance vis-\`a-vis plain channel.
However, this heat transfer enhancement is associated with larger pressure losses. For the range
of parameters studied in this paper, increasing the CMC concentration, the angle of attack of vortex
generators and their lateral distances leads to an increase in heat transfer performance. Additionally,
heat transfer performance of rectangular channels with longitudinal vortex generators enhances
with increasing the Reynolds number in the laminar flow regime.
