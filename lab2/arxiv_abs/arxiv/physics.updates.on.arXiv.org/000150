We generalize Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics by the minimization of a finite action functional
defined for variational trajectories that are required to merge continuously into given past and
future boundary segments. We prove that the boundary-value problem is well-posed for two classes
of boundary data and show that the well-posed solution in general has velocity discontinuities,
henceforth broken extrema. Along regular segments, broken extrema satisfy the Euler-Lagrange
neutral differential delay equations with state-dependent deviating arguments. At points where
velocities are discontinuous, broken extrema satisfy the Weierstrass-Erdmann corner conditions
that energies and momenta are continuous. The electromagnetic fields of the variational trajectories
are derived quantities that can be extended only to a bounded region B of space-time. For extrema
with a finite number of velocity discontinuities, extended fields are defined for all point in B
with the exception of sets of zero measure. The extended fields satisfy the integral laws of classical
electrodynamics for most surfaces and curves inside B. As an application, we study globally bounded
trajectories with vanishing far-fields for the hydrogenoid atomic models of hydrogen, muonium
and positronium. Our model uses solutions of the neutral differential delay equations along regular
segments and a variational approximation for the collisional segments (spikes). Each hydrogenoid
model predicts a discrete set of finitely measured neighbourhoods of orbits with vanishing far-fields
at the correct atomic magnitude and in quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiment
and quantum mechanics, i.e., the spacings between consecutive discrete angular momenta agree
with Planck's constant within thirty-percent, while orbital frequencies agree with a corresponding
spectroscopic line within a few percent.
