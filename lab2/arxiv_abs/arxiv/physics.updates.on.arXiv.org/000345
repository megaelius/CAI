Inflation driven by a real massless scalar inflaton field $\varphi$ whose potential is identically
equal to zero is described. Assuming that inflation takes place after the Plank scale (after quantum
gravity effects are important), zero inflaton potential is concomitant with an initial condition
for $\varphi$ that is exponentially more probable than an initial condition that assumes an initial
inflaton potential of order of the Planck mass. The Einstein gravitational field equations are
formulated on an eight-dimensional spacetime manifold of four space dimensions and four time dimensions.
The field equations are sourced by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the real massless scalar
inflaton field $\varphi$. For the case of a diagonal metric, two periodic solution classes for the
coupled Einstein field equations are obtained that exhibit temporal exponential \textbf{deflation
of three of the four time dimensions} and temporal exponential inflation of three of the four space
dimensions. For brevity this phenomenon is sometimes simply called "inflation." We show that \textbf{the
extra time dimensions do not generally induce the exponentially rapid growth of fluctuations of
quantum fields.} Comoving coordinates for the two non-inflating/deflating dimensions are chosen
to be $(x^4, x^8 )$. The $x^4$ coordinate corresponds to our universe's observed physical time dimension,
while the $x^8$ coordinate corresponds to a new spatial dimension that is assumed to be compact.
Quadratic $\partial_{x^8}\,\varphi$ terms are seen to play the role of an effective inflaton potential
in the dynamical field equations. In this model, after "inflation" the observable physical macroscopic
world appears to a classical observer to be a homogeneous, isotropic universe with three space dimensions
and one time dimension.
