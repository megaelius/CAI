As part of the effort undertaken to understand urban environments and their generation, we need
to explore models that produce statistically valid configurations of roads. These sort of models
will help us to derive plausible mechanisms for the spatial location of population. This task is
of fundamental importance, as we need to create an experimental environment that allows us to disentangle
the specificities of a spatial configuration from the ideal system. Creating statistically valid
models of road networks along with models of city generation allows to average the effects of geometry
bringing us one step closer to understanding urban environments. To completely understand road
networks we need to be able to grasp what principles of economy do their growth entail. It is therefore
of interest to explore the possible shape that a performance function would have for transportation
systems. In this work, we tackle this issue by proposing a network generation model based on a single
parameter $\alpha$ which is capable of creating any type of network from trees to quasi-surfaces
and which is shown to generate networks close to the real road networks under study. This is obtained
through the definition of local and weighted versions of centrality measures. These centrality
measures deal with distance-decay effects and nodes having different masses. We set ourselves
to determine the properties and different regimes of this $\alpha$-model and we lay out a definition
for the performance of a network taking into account factors such as robustness, construction cost,
congestion and distance. We obtain the optimal alpha from the analysis of the space of possible performance
functions, giving an intuition on the self-organisational properties of the original network.
