This paper investigates the influence of different broadband perturbations on the evolution of
a Richtmyer--Meshkov turbulent mixing layer initiated by a Mach 1.84 shock traversing a perturbed
interface separating gases with a density ratio of 3:1. Both the bandwidth of modes in the interface
perturbation, as well as their relative amplitudes, are varied in a series of carefully designed
numerical simulations at grid resolutions up to $3.2\times10^9$ cells. Three different perturbations
are considered, characterised by a power spectrum of the form $P(k)\propto k^m$ where $m=-1$, $-2$
and $-3$. The growth of the mixing layer is shown to strongly depend on the initial conditions, with
the growth rate exponent $\theta$ found to be $0.5$, $0.63$ and $0.75$ for each value of $m$ at the
highest grid resolution. The asymptotic values of the molecular mixing fraction $\Theta$ are also
shown to vary significantly with $m$; at the latest time considered $\Theta$ is $0.56$, $0.39$ and
$0.20$ respectively. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is also analysed in both the temporal and spectral
domains. The temporal decay rate of TKE is found not to match the predicted value of $n=2-3\theta$,
which is shown to be due to a time-varying {normalised dissipation rate $C_\epsilon$}. In spectral
space, the data follow the theoretical scaling of $k^{(m+2)/2}$ at low wavenumbers and tend towards
$k^{-3/2}$ and $k^{-5/3}$ scalings at high wavenumbers for the spectra of transverse and normal
velocity components respectively. The results represent a significant extension of previous
work on the Richtmyer--Meshkov instability evolving from broadband initial perturbations and
provide useful benchmarks for future research.
