In this study, a machine learning-based technique is developed to reduce the computational cost
required to explore large design spaces of substitutional alloys. The first advancement is based
on a neural network approach to predict the initial position of ions for both minority and majority
ions before ion relaxation. The second advancement is to allow the neural network to predict the
total energy for every possibility minority ion position and select the most stable configuration
in the absence of relaxing each trial position. In this study, a bismuth oxide materials system,
(Bi$_{x}$La$_{y}$Yb$_{z}$)$_2$ MoO$_6$, is used as the model system to demonstrate the developed
method and potential computational speedup. Comparing a brute force method that requires the calculation
of every possible minority concentration location and subsequent relaxation there was a 1.3x speedup
if the neural network (NN) was allowed to predict the initial position prior to relaxation. This
speedup is a result in an average decrease of 4 wall hour (64 cpu-hrs) reduction in relaxation for
individual calculations. Implementation of the second advancement allowed the NN to predict the
total energy for all possible trials prior to relaxation, resulting in a speedup of approximately
37x. Validation was done by comparing both position and energy between the NN to DFT calculations.
A maximum vector mean squared error (MSE) of 1.6x10$^{-2}$ and a maximum energy MSE of 2.3x10$^{-7}$
was predicted. This method demonstrates a significant computational speedup, which has the potential
for significant computational savings for larger compositional design spaces.
