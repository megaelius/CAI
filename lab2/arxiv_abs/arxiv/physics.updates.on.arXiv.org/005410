The propagation of Dyakonov-Tamm (DT) surface waves guided by the planar interface of two nondissipative
materials $A$ and $B$ was investigated theoretically and numerically, via the corresponding canonical
boundary-value problem. Material $A$ is a homogeneous uniaxial dielectric material whose optic
axis lies at an angle $\chi$ relative to the interface plane. Material $B$ is an isotropic dielectric
material that is periodically nonhomogeneous in the direction normal to the interface. The special
case was considered in which the propagation matrix for material $A$ is non-diagonalizable because
the corresponding surface wave-named the Dyakonov-Tamm-Voigt (DTV) surface wave-has unusual
localization characteristics. The decay of the DTV surface wave is given by the product of a linear
function and an exponential function of distance from the interface in material $A$; in contrast,
the fields of conventional DT surface waves decay only exponentially with distance from the interface.
Numerical studies revealed that multiple DT surface waves can exist for a fixed propagation direction
in the interface plane, depending upon the constitutive parameters of materials $A$ and $B$. When
regarded as functions of the angle of propagation in the interface plane, the multiple DT surface-wave
solutions can be organized as continuous branches. A larger number of DT solution branches exist
when the degree of anisotropy of material $A$ is greater. If $\chi = 0^\circ$ then a solitary DTV solution
exists for a unique propagation direction on each DT branch solution. If $\chi > 0^\circ$, then no
DTV solutions exist. As the degree of nonhomogeneity of material $B$ decreases, the number of DT
solution branches decreases.
