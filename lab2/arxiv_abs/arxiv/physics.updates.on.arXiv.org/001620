We present an adaptive variational procedure for unstructured meshes to capture fluid-fluid interfaces
in two-phase flows. The two phases are modeled by the phase-field finite element formulation, which
involves the conservative Allen-Cahn equation coupled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations. The positivity preserving variational formulation is designed to maintain the bounded
and stable solution of the Allen-Cahn equation. For the adaptivity procedure, we consider the residual-based
error estimates for the underlying differential equations of the two-phase system. In particular,
the adaptive refinement/coarsening is carried out by the newest vertex bisection algorithm by
evaluating the residual error indicators based on the error estimates of the Allen-Cahn equation.
The coarsening algorithm avoids the storage of the tree data structures for the hierarchical mesh,
thus providing the ease of numerical implementation. The proposed nonlinear adaptive partitioned
procedure aims at reducing the amount of coarsening while maintaining the convergence properties
of the underlying nonlinear coupled differential equations. We investigate the adaptive phase-field
finite element scheme through the spinodal decomposition in a complex curved geometry and the volume-conserved
interface motion driven by the mean curvature flow for two circles in a square domain. We then assess
the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed procedure by modeling the free-surface motion in a sloshing
tank. The mesh adaptivity remarkably reduces the degrees of freedom and the computational cost
by nearly half for similar accuracy and improves the mass conservation. Finally, we apply the adaptive
numerical framework to solve the application of a dam-breaking problem with topological changes.
