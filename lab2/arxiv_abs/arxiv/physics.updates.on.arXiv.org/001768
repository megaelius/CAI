Accurate specification and prediction of the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) environment, driven
by external forcing, is crucial to the space community. In this work, we present a new transformative
framework for data assimilation and calibration of the physical IT models. The framework has two
main components: (i) the development of a quasi-physical dynamic reduced order model (ROM) that
uses a linear approximation of the underlying dynamics and effect of the drivers, and (ii) data assimilation
and calibration of the ROM through estimation of the ROM coefficients that represent the model parameters.
A reduced order surrogate for thermospheric mass density from the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamic
General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) was developed in previous work. This work concentrates on
the second component of the framework - data assimilation and calibration of the TIE-GCM ROM. The
new framework has two major advantages: (i) a dynamic ROM that combines the speed of empirical models
for real-time capabilities with the predictive capabilities of physical models which has the potential
to facilitate improved uncertainty quantification (UQ) using large ensembles, and (ii) estimation
of model parameters rather than the driver(s)/input(s) which allows calibration of the model,
thus avoiding degradation of model performance in the absence of continuous data. We validate the
framework using accelerometer-derived density estimates from CHAMP and GOCE. The framework is
a first of its kind, simple yet robust and accurate method with high potential for providing real-time
operational updates to the state of the upper atmosphere in the context of drag modeling for Space
Situational Awareness and Space Traffic Management.
