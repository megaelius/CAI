Although the average population density of a city is an extremely simple indicator, it is often used
as a determinant factor for describing various aspects of urban phenomena. On the other hand, a plethora
of different measures that aim at characterizing the urban form have been introduced in the literature,
often with the risk of redundancy. Here, we argue that two measures are enough to capture a wealth
of different forms of the population density. First, fluctuations of the local density can be very
important and we should distinguish almost homogeneous cities from highly heterogeneous ones.
This is easily characterized by an indicator such as the Gini coefficient $G$, or equivalently by
the relative standard deviation or the entropy. The second important dimension is the spatial organization
of the heterogeneities in population density and we propose a dispersion index $\eta$ that characterizes
the degree of localization of highly populated areas. We argue that these two dimensions are enough
to characterize the spatial organization of cities, and we discuss this approach using a dataset
of about $4,500$ cities belonging to the $10$ largest urban areas in France, for which we have high
resolution data. Representing cities in the plane $(G,\eta)$ allows us to construct families of
cities. On average, compactness increases with heterogeneity, and we find four large categories
of cities (with population $>10,000$ inhabitants): (i) first, homogeneous and dispersed cities
with small density fluctuations, (ii) very heterogeneous cities with a compact organization of
large densities areas. The last two groups comprise heterogeneous cities with (iii) a monocentric
organization or (iv) a more delocalized, polycentric structure. Integrating these two parameters
in econometric analysis could improve our understanding of the impact of urban form on various socio-economical
aspects.
