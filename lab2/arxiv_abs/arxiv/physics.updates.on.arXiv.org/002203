A tightly focused pulsed laser can locally modify the crystal structure inside the bulk of a scintillator.
The result is incorporation of so-called optical barriers with a refractive index (RI) different
from that of the crystal bulk, that can be used to redirect the scintillation light and control the
light spread in the detector. We systematically study the scintillation light transport in detectors
fabricated using the Laser Induced Optical Barrier technique, and objectively compare their potential
performance characteristics with the two mainstream detector types: monolithic and mechanically
pixelated arrays. Among countless optical barrier patterns, we explore barriers arranged in a
pixel-like pattern extending all-way or half-way through a 20 mm thick LYSO:Ce crystal. We analyze
the performance of the detectors coupled to MPPC arrays, in terms of light response functions, position
histograms, line profiles, and light collection efficiency. Our results show that laser-processed
detectors constitute a new detector category with a behavior between the two standard detector
types. When the barrier-crystal interface is smooth, no DOI information can be obtained regardless
of barrier RI. However, with a rough barrier-crystal interface we can extract multiple DOI levels.
Lower barrier RI results in larger light confinement, leading to better transverse resolution.
Laser-processed crystals can also potentially increase the light collection efficiency, which
could lead to improved energy resolution and timing resolution due to higher signals. For a laser-processed
detector with smooth barrier-crystal interfaces the light collection efficiency is simulated
to >44%, and for rough interfaces >73%. The numbers for a monolithic crystal is 39% with polished
surfaces, and 71% with rough surfaces, and for a mechanically pixelated array 33% with polished
pixel surfaces and 51% with rough surfaces.
