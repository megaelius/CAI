The spread of COVID19 through droplets ejected by infected individuals in the air during sneezing
and coughing has been considered as a matter of key concern. Therefore, a quantitative understanding
of the propagation of droplets containing the virus assumes immense importance in formulating
the preventive strategies. In the present work we rigorously investigate the evolution of droplets
in space and time under varying external conditions of temperature, humidity, air flow by using
laws of statistical mechanics. The effects of drag, diffusion and the gravity on the droplets of
different sizes and ejection velocities have been taken into consideration during its motion in
the air. In still air it is found that bigger droplets traverse larger distance but the smaller droplets
remain suspended in the air for longer time. Therefore, in still air the horizontal distance that
a healthy individual should maintain from an infected one is determined by the bigger droplets but
the time interval to be maintained between the two is determined by the smaller droplets. Here we
show that in places with flowing air the lighter droplets travel larger distance and have the ability
to remain suspended in the air for longer time. Therefore, we conclude that both temporal as well
as the geometric distance that a healthy individual should maintain from an infected one is determined
by the smaller droplets if there is flowing air. The small droplets travel larger distance and remain
suspended in the air for long time under the influence of flow making the use of mask mandatory to prevent
the virus. The the maintenance of only stationary separation between healthy and infected individual
is not substantiated. The quantitative results obtained here will be useful to devise strategies
for preventing also the spread of other types of droplets containing microorganisms.
