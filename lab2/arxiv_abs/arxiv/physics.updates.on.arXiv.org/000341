The shock induced mixing of two gases separated by a perturbed interface is investigated through
Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). In a simulation, physical dissipation
of the velocity field and species mass fraction often compete with numerical dissipation arising
from the errors of the numerical method. In a DNS the computational mesh resolves all physical gradients
of the flow and the relative effect of numerical dissipation is small. In LES, unresolved scales
are present and numerical dissipation can have a large impact on the flow, depending on the computational
mesh. A suite of simulations explores the space between these two extremes by studying the effects
of grid resolution, Reynolds number and numerical method on the mixing process. Results from a DNS
are shown using two different codes, which use a high- and low-order numerical method and show convergence
in the temporal and spectral dependent quantities associated with mixing. Data from a coarse LES
are also presented and include a grid convergence study. A model for an effective viscosity is proposed
which allows for an a posteriori analysis of the simulation data that is agnostic to the LES model,
numerics and the physical Reynolds number of the simulation. An analogous approximation for an
effective species diffusivity is also presented. This framework can then be used to estimate the
effective Reynolds number and Schmidt number of future simulations, elucidate the impact of numerical
dissipation on the mixing process for an arbitrary numerical method and provide guidance for resolution
requirements of future calculations
