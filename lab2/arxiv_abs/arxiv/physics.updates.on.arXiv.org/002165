We examine the properties of linear electrostatic waves in unmagnetized quantum and classical
plasmas consisting of one or two populations of electrons with analytically tractable distribution
functions in the presence of a stationary neutralising ion background. Beginning with the kinetic
quantum plasma longitudinal susceptibility, we assess the effects due to increasing complexity
of the background distribution function. Firstly, we analyse dispersion and Landau damping in
one-component plasmas and consider distribution functions with a variety of analytical properties:
the Dirac delta function, the Cauchy profile with two complex first-order poles, the squared Cauchy
profile with two second order poles, and the inverse-quartic profile with four first-order poles;
we also briefly discuss the non-meromorphic totally- and arbitrarily-degenerate Fermi-Dirac
distribution. In order to study electrostatic instabilities, we then turn to plasmas with two populations
of electrons streaming relative to each other in two cases: a symmetric case of two counter-streaming
identical populations and a bump-on-tail case with a primary population and a delta-function beam.
We obtain the corresponding linear kinetic dispersion relations and evaluate the properties of
instabilities when the electron distribution functions are of the delta function, Cauchy, squared-Cauchy,
or inverse-quartic types. In agreement with other studies, we find that in general quantum effects
reduce the range of wavelengths for unstable modes at long wavelengths. We also find a second window
of instability at shorter wavelengths and elucidate its nature as being due to quantum recoil. We
note the possible implications for studies of laboratory and astrophysical quantum plasmas.
