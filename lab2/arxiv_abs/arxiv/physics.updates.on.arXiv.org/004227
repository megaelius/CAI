Microfluidic technologies are commonly used for the manipulation of red blood cell (RBC) suspensions
and analyses of flow-mediated biomechanics. To maximise the usability of microfluidic devices,
understanding the dynamics of the suspensions processed within is crucial. We report novel aspects
of the spatio-temporal dynamics of an RBC suspension flowing through a typical microchannel at
low Reynolds number. Through experiments with dilute RBC suspensions, we find an off-centre two-peak
(OCTP) profile of cells resembling the well-known "tubular pinch effect" which would arise from
inertial effects. However, given the negligible inertia under our experimental condition, an
alternative explanation is needed for this OCTP profile contrary to the centralised distribution
commonly reported for low-inertia flows. Our massively-parallel simulations of RBC flow in real-size
microfluidic dimensions using the immersed-boundary-lattice-Boltzmann method (IB-LBM) confirm
the experimental findings and elucidate the underlying mechanism for the counterintuitive RBC
pattern. By analysing the RBC migration and cell-free layer (CFL) development within a high-aspect-ratio
channel, we show that such a distribution is co-determined by the spatial decay of hydrodynamic
lift and the global deficiency of cell dispersion in dilute suspensions. We find a CFL development
length greater than 46 and 28 hydraulic diameters in the experiment and simulation, respectively,
exceeding typical lengths of microfluidic designs. Our work highlights the key role of transient
cell distribution in dilute suspensions, which may negatively affect the reliability of experimental
results if not taken into account.
