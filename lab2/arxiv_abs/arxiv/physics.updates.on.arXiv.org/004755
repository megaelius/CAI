The quantum properties of nano-objects, such as atoms or molecules, are typically manipulated
using scanning tunnelling microscopes and lateral break junctions. The resulting nanotransport
path is well established in these model devices. Societal applications require transposing this
knowledge to nano-objects embedded within vertical solid-state junctions, which advantageously
can harness spintronics to addressing these quantum properties thanks to ferromagnetic electrodes
and high-quality interfaces. Here, one challenge is to ascertain the device's effective, buried
nanotransport path. Another is to achieve a nanojunction comparising a molecular layer with high-quality
interfaces. We've developed a low-tech, resist- and solvent-free technological process that
can craft nanopillar devices from in-situ grown heterostructures, and use it to study magnetotransport
between two Fe and Co ferromagnetic electrodes across a CoPc functional magnetic molecular layer.
By identifying three magnetic units along the effective nanotransport path thanks to a macrospin
model of magnetotransport, our experiments show how spin-flip transport across CoPc molecular
spin chains promotes a specific magnetoresistance effect, and alters the nanojunction's magnetism
through spintronic anisotropy. Our work elegantly connects the until now loosely associated concepts
of spin-flip spectroscopy, magnetic exchange bias and magnetotransport due to molecular spin
chains. We notably measure a 5.9meV energy barrier for magnetic decoupling between the Fe layer's
buried atoms and those in contact with the CoPc layer forming the so-called 'spinterface'. This
provides a first insight into the experimental energetics of this promising low-power information
encoding unit.
