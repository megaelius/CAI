Natural landslides exhibit scaling properties revealed by power law relationships. These relationships
include the frequency of the size (e.g., area, volume) of the landslides, and the rainfall conditions
responsible for slope failures in a region. Reasons for the scaling behavior of landslides are poorly
known. We investigate the possibility of using the Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based
Regional Slope-Stability analysis code (TRIGRS), a consolidated, physically-based, numerical
model that describes the stability/instability conditions of natural slopes forced by rainfall,
to determine the frequency statistics of the area of the unstable slopes and the rainfall intensity
(I) - duration (D) conditions that result in landslides in a region. We apply TRIGRS in a portion of
the Upper Tiber River Basin, Central Italy. The spatially distributed model predicts the stability/instability
conditions of individual grid cells, given the local terrain and rainfall conditions. We run TRIGRS
using multiple, synthetic rainfall histories, and we compare the modeling results with empirical
evidences of the area of landslides and of the rainfall conditions that have caused landslides in
the study area. Our findings revealed that TRIGRS is capable of reproducing the frequency of the
size of the patches of terrain predicted as unstable by the model, which match the frequency size
statistics of landslides in the study area, and the mean rainfall D, I conditions that result in unstable
slopes in the study area, which match rainfall I-D thresholds for possible landslide occurrence.
Our results are a step towards understanding the mechanisms that give rise to landslide scaling
properties.
