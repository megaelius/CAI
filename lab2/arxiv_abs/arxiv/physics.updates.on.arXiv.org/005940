An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion
rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this
epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where
the epidemic started on February 25. We calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to
date (April 19, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature.
The peak occurs at day 37 (April 1) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction
ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.38 at day 22 and 0.64 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown.
The predicted death toll is almost 14000 casualties, with 2.4 million infected individuals at the
end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25
days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported
(official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice
the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed
individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more
infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider
range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher
incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more
exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate
is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic.
