The work shows that the evolution of the field of the free Klein-Gordon equation, in the hydrodynamic
representation, can be obtained by Lagrangean motion equations that can be derived by a minimum
action principle. Once the quantum hydrodynamic motion equations have been generalized in the
non-Euclidean space-time by using the physics covariance postulate, the quantum gravity equation,
determining the geometry of the space-time necessary to give full meaning to them, is obtained by
minimizing the overall action comprehending the gravitational field. The theoretical output
for a scalar uncharged field shows the spontaneous emergence of the cosmological energy impulse
tensor density (CEITD) in the gravity equation. The scalar free Klein-Gordon field coupled to the
gravity equation (GE), with the analytical dependence of the energy impulse tensor as a function
of the field, is quantized at the first order in the metric tensor. The cosmological constant (CC),
generated the quantum field, has been investigated and calculated for the vacuum. The outputs of
the theory show that the vacuum energy density of the zero point is effective for the cosmological
constant only in the volume of space where the mass is localized in particles or in high gravity bodies,
leading to a cosmological effect on the motion of the galaxies that is compatible with the astronomical
observations. The paper shows that, in the quasi-Euclidean limit, the energy-impulse tensor density
makes the GE asymptotically independent by the zero-point energy density of the vacuum, and possibly
compatible with the renormalization techniques of the QFT.
