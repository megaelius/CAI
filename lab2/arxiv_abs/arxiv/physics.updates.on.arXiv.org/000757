Purpose: To apply tracer kinetic models as temporal constraints during reconstruction of under-sampled
dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI. Methods: A library of concentration v.s time profiles is simulated
for a range of physiological kinetic parameters. The library is reduced to a dictionary of temporal
bases, where each profile is approximated by a sparse linear combination of the bases. Image reconstruction
is formulated as estimation of concentration profiles and sparse model coefficients with a fixed
sparsity level. Simulations are performed to evaluate modeling error, and error statistics in
kinetic parameter estimation in presence of noise. Retrospective under-sampling experiments
are performed on a brain tumor DCE digital reference object (DRO) at different signal to noise levels
(SNR=20-40) at (k-t) space under-sampling factor (R=20), and 12 brain tumor in- vivo 3T datasets
at (R=20-40). The approach is compared against an existing compressed sensing based temporal finite-difference
(tFD) reconstruction approach. Results: Simulations demonstrate that sparsity levels of 2 and
3 model the library profiles from the Patlak and extended Tofts-Kety (ETK) models, respectively.
Noise sensitivity analysis showed equivalent kinetic parameter estimation error statistics
from noisy concentration profiles, and model approximated profiles. DRO based experiments showed
good fidelity in recovery of kinetic maps from 20-fold under- sampled data at SNRs between 10-30.
In-vivo experiments demonstrated reduced bias and uncertainty in kinetic mapping with the proposed
approach compared to tFD at R>=20. Conclusions: Tracer kinetic models can be applied as temporal
constraints during DCE-MRI reconstruction, enabling more accurate reconstruction from under-
sampled data. The approach is flexible, can use several kinetic models, and does not require tuning
of regularization parameters.
