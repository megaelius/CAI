In this paper, sparsity-promoting regression techniques are employed to automatically identify
from data relevant triadic interactions between modal structures in large Galerkin-based models
of two-dimensional unsteady flows. The approach produces interpretable, sparsely-connected
models that reproduce the original dynamical behaviour at a much lower computational cost, as fewer
triadic interactions need to be evaluated. The key feature of the approach is that dominant interactions
are selected systematically from the solution of a convex optimisation problem, with a unique solution,
and no a priori assumptions on the structure of scale interactions are required. We demonstrate
this approach on models of two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds number $Re = 2 \times
10^4$, where fluid motion is chaotic. To understand the role of the subspace utilised for the Galerkin
projection on sparsity characteristics, we consider two families of models obtained from two different
modal decomposition techniques. The first uses energy-optimal Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
modes, while the second uses modes oscillating at a single frequency obtained from Discrete Fourier
Transform of the flow snapshots. We show that, in both cases, and despite no \textit{a-priori} physical
knowledge is incorporated into the approach, relevant interactions across the hierarchy of modes
are identified in agreement with the expected picture of scale interactions in two-dimensional
turbulence. Yet, substantial structural changes in the interaction pattern and a quantitatively
different sparsity are observed. Finally, although not directly enforced in the procedure, the
sparsified models have excellent long-term stability properties and correctly reproduce the
spatio-temporal evolution of dominant flow structures in the cavity.
