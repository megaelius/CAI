.Stochastic models based on random diffusivities, such as the diffusing-diffusivity approach,
are popular concepts for the description of non-Gaussian diffusion in heterogeneous media. Studies
of these models typically focus on the moments and the displacement probability density function.
Here we develop the complementary power spectral description for a broad class of random diffusivity
processes. In our approach we cater for typical single particle tracking data in which a small number
of trajectories with finite duration are garnered. Apart from the diffusing-diffusivity model
we study a range of previously unconsidered random diffusivity processes, for which we obtain exact
forms of the probability density function. These new processes are different versions of jump processes
as well as functionals of Brownian motion. The resulting behaviour subtly depends on the specific
model details. Thus, the central part of the probability density function may be Gaussian or non-Gaussian,
and the tails may assume Gaussian, exponential, log-normal or even power-law forms. For all these
models we derive analytically the moment-generating function for the single-trajectory power
spectral density. We establish the generic $1/f^2$-scaling of the power spectral density as function
of frequency in all cases. Moreover, we establish the probability density for the amplitudes of
the random power spectral density of individual trajectories. The latter functions reflect the
very specific properties of the different random diffusivity models considered here. Our exact
results are in excellent agreement with extensive numerical simulations.
