Most calibration schemes for reflection-based tissue spectroscopy in the mm-wave/THz-frequency
range are based on homogenized, frequency-dependent tissue models where macroscopic material
parameters have either been determined by measurement or calculated using effective material
theory. However, as the resolution of measurement at these frequencies captures the underlying
microstructure of the tissue, here we will investigate the validity limits of such effective material
models over a wide frequency range (10 MHz - 200 GHz) . Embedded in a parameterizable virtual workbench,
we implemented a numerical homogenization method using a hierarchical multiscale approach to
capture both the dispersive and tensorial electromagnetic properties of the tissue, and determined
at which frequency this homogenized model deviated from a full-wave electromagnetic reference
model within the framework of a Monte Carlo analysis. Simulations were carried out using a generic
hypodermal tissue that emulated the morphology of the microstructure. Results showed that the
validity limit occurred at surprisingly low frequencies and thus contradicted the traditional
usage of homogenized tissue models. The reasons for this are explained in detail and thus it is shown
how both the lower "allowed" and upper "forbidden" frequency ranges can be used for frequency-selective
classification/identification of specific material and structural properties employing a supervised
machine-learning approach. Using the implemented classifier, we developed a method to identify
specific frequency bands in the forbidden frequency range to optimize the reliability of material
classification. The results of this study were verified with different scenarios including 3D-simulations
and corresponding experiments.
