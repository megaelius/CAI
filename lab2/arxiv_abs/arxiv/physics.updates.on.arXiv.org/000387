An axiomatic theory of classical nondissipative waves is proposed that is constructed based on
the definition of a wave as a multidimensional oscillator. Waves are represented as abstract vectors
$|\psi\rangle$ in the appropriately defined space $\Psi$ with a Hermitian metric. The metric is
usually positive-definite but can be more general in the presence of negative-energy waves (which
are typically unstable and must not be confused with negative-frequency waves). The very form of
wave equations is derived from properties of $\Psi$. The generic wave equation is shown to be a quantumlike
Schrodinger equation; hence one-to-one correspondence with the mathematical framework of quantum
mechanics is established, and the quantum-mechanical machinery becomes applicable to classical
waves "as is". The classical wave action is defined as the density operator, $|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$.
The coordinate and momentum spaces, not necessarily Euclidean, need not be postulated but rather
emerge when applicable. Various kinetic equations flow as projections of the von Neumann equation
for $|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$. The previously known action conservation theorems for noneikonal
waves and the conventional Wigner-Weyl-Moyal formalism are generalized and subsumed under a unifying
invariant theory. Whitham's equations are recovered as the corresponding fluid limit in the geometrical-optics
approximation. The Liouville equation is also yielded as a special case, yet in a somewhat different
limit; thus ray tracing, and especially nonlinear ray tracing, is found to be more subtle than commonly
assumed. Applications of this axiomatization are also discussed, briefly, for some characteristic
equations.
