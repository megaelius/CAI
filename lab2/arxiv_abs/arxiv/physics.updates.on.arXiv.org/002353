The linear response function (LRF) of an idealized GCM, the dry dynamical core with Held-Suarez
physics, is used to accurately compute how eddy momentum and heat fluxes change in response to the
zonal wind and temperature anomalies of the annular mode at the low-frequency limit. Using these
results and knowing the parameterizations of surface friction and thermal radiation in Held-Suarez
physics, the contribution of each physical process (meridional and vertical eddy fluxes, surface
friction, thermal radiation, and meridional advection) to the annular mode dynamics is quantified.
Examining the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity balance, it is shown that the eddy feedback
is positive and increases the persistence of the annular mode by a factor of more than two. Furthermore,
how eddy fluxes change in response to only the barotropic component of the annular mode, i.e., vertically
averaged zonal wind (and no temperature) anomaly, is also calculated similarly. The response of
eddy fluxes to the barotropic-only component of the annular mode is found to be drastically different
from the response to the full (barotropic+baroclinic) annular mode anomaly. In the former, the
barotropic governor effect significantly suppresses the eddy generation leading to a negative
eddy feedback that decreases the persistence of the annular mode by nearly a factor of three. These
results suggest that the baroclinic component of the annular mode anomaly, i.e., the increased
low-level baroclinicity, is essential for the persistence of the annular mode, consistent with
the baroclinic mechanism but not the barotropic mechanism proposed in the previous studies.
