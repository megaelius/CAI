Analyzing data from paleoclimate archives such as tree rings or lake sediments offers the opportunity
of inferring information on past climate variability. Often, such data sets are univariate and
a proper reconstruction of the system's higher-dimensional phase space can be crucial for further
analyses. In this study, we systematically compare the methods of time delay embedding and differential
embedding for phase space reconstruction. Differential embedding relates the system's higher-dimensional
coordinates to the derivatives of the measured time series. For implementation, this requires
robust and efficient algorithms to estimate derivatives from noisy and possibly non-uniformly
sampled data. For this purpose, we consider several approaches: (i) central differences adapted
to irregular sampling, (ii) a generalized version of discrete Legendre coordinates and (iii) the
concept of Moving Taylor Bayesian Regression. We evaluate the performance of differential and
time delay embedding by studying two paradigmatic model systems - the Lorenz and the R\"ossler system.
More precisely, we compare geometric properties of the reconstructed attractors to those of the
original attractors by applying recurrence network analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the potential
and the limitations of using the different phase space reconstruction methods in combination with
windowed recurrence network analysis for inferring information about past climate variability.
This is done by analyzing two well-studied paleoclimate data sets from Ecuador and Mexico. We find
that studying the robustness of the results when varying the analysis parameters is an unavoidable
step in order to make well-grounded statements on climate variability and to judge whether a data
set is suitable for this kind of analysis.
