Although deceivingly simple, diatomic molecules exhibit a rich chemistry and thereby may be used
for accurate benchmarks of theoretical methods. We present the implementation of a diatomic finite
element solver in the HelFEM program, which can be employed for benchmark calculations on diatomic
systems. A basis set of the form $B_{n}(\mu)Y_{l}^{m}(\nu,\phi)$ is used, where $(\mu,\nu,\phi)$
are transformed prolate spheroidal coordinates, $B_{n}(\mu)$ are finite element functions,
and $Y_{l}^{m}$ are spherical harmonics, which allows for an arbitrary level of accuracy. HelFEM
supports nonrelativistic Hartree--Fock (HF) and density functional (DF) theory calculations,
including hybrid DFs that aren't available in other program packages. Hundreds of functionals
at the local density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as well as
the meta-GGA level through an interface with the Libxc library. Finite electric fields are also
supported, enabling access to electric properties. We introduce a powerful tool for adaptively
choosing the basis set by using the core Hamiltonian as a proxy for its completeness. The program
and the novel basis set procedure are demostrated by reproducing the restricted HF limit energies
of 66 diatomic molecules with excellent agreement. Then, the electric properties of the BH and N2
molecules under finite field is studied, again yielding excellent agreement with previous HF limit
values for energies, dipole moments, and dipole polarizabilities, even though the calculations
of the present work employed over two orders of magnitude fewer parameters for the wave function.
Finally, HF, LDA, GGA, and meta-GGA calculations of the atomization energy of N2 are performed,
demonstrating the superb accuracy of the present approach.
