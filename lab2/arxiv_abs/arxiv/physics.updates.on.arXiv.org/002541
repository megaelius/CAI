We investigate the properties of plasma turbulence by means of two-dimensional (2D) Hall-magnetohydrodynamic
(HMHD) and hybrid particle-in-cell (HPIC) numerical simulations. We find that HMHD simulations
exhibit spectral properties that are in most cases in agreement with the results of the HPIC simulations
and with solar wind observations. Once turbulence is fully developed, the energy spectra of magnetic
fluctuations exhibit a Kolmogorov cascade of spectral index $-5/3$ at MHD scales and a power-law
with a spectral index of $-3$ at kinetic scales, while velocity fluctuations exhibit a power-law
spectrum of slope $-3/2$ at MHD scales. The spectral break between the MHD and the kinetic scales
is located at the same scale in both simulations. In the MHD range the residual energy has a steeper
spectrum than that one of the total energy. Their slopes satisfy the fast Alfv\'en-dynamo balance
in both simulations. The development of a turbulent cascade is concurrently characterized by magnetic
reconnection events taking place in thin current sheets that form between large eddies. A statistical
analysis reveals that reconnection is qualitatively the same and fast in both the HMHD and HPIC models,
characterized by inverse reconnection rates much smaller than the characteristic nonlinear time
associated to the large eddies. The agreement extends to other statistical properties, such us
the kurtosis of the magnetic field. Moreover, the observation of a direct energy transfer from the
large vortices to the small sub-ion scales triggered by magnetic reconnection, further supports
the existence of a reconnection-mediated turbulent regime at kinetic scales. We conclude that
the Hall-MHD fluid description captures to a large extent the transition of the turbulent cascade
between the large MHD scales and the sub-ion scales.
