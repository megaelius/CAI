Power laws and distributions with heavy tails are common features of many experimentally studied
complex systems, like the distribution of the sizes of earthquakes and solar flares, or the duration
of neuronal avalanches in the brain. Previously, researchers surmised that a single general concept
may act as a unifying underlying generative mechanism, with the theory of self organized criticality
being a weighty contender. Consequently, a substantial amount of effort has gone into developing
new and extended models and, hitherto, three classes of models have emerged. The first line of models
is based on a separation between the time scales of drive and dissipation, and includes the original
sandpile model and its extensions, like the dissipative earthquake model. Within this approach
the steady state is close to criticality in terms of an absorbing phase transition. The second line
of models is based on external drives and internal dynamics competing on similar time scales and
includes the coherent noise model, which has a non-critical steady state characterized by heavy-tailed
distributions. The third line of models proposes a non-critical self-organizing state, being
guided by an optimization principle, such as the concept of highly optimized tolerance. We present
a comparative overview regarding distinct modeling approaches together with a discussion of their
potential relevance as underlying generative models for real-world phenomena. The complexity
of physical and biological scaling phenomena has been found to transcend the explanatory power
of individual paradigmal concepts. The interaction between theoretical development and experimental
observations has been very fruitful, leading to a series of novel concepts and insights.
