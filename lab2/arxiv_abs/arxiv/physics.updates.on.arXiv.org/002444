As an extension of previous fourth-order compact gas kinetic scheme (GKS) on structured meshes
(Ji et al. 2018), this work is about the development of a third-order compact GKS on unstructured
meshes for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes solutions. Based on the time accurate high-order
gas-kinetic evolution solution at a cell interface, the time dependent gas distribution function
in GKS provides not only the flux function and its time derivative at a cell interface, but also the
time accurate flow variables there at next time level. As a result, besides updating the conservative
flow variables inside each control volume through the interface fluxes, the cell averaged first-order
spatial derivatives of flow variables in the cell can be also obtained using the updated flow variables
at the cell interfaces around that cell through the divergence theorem. Therefore, with the flow
variables and their first-order spatial derivatives inside each cell, the Hermite WENO (HWENO)
techniques can be naturally implemented for the compact high-order reconstruction at the beginning
of a new time step. Following the reconstruction method in (Zhu et al. 2018), a new HWENO reconstruction
on triangular meshes is designed in the current scheme. Combined with a two-stage temporal discretization
and second-order gas-kinetic flux function, a third-order spatial and temporal accuracy in the
current compact scheme can be achieved. Accurate solutions can be obtained for both inviscid and
viscous flows without sensitive dependence on the quality of triangular meshes. The robustness
of the scheme has been validated as well through the cases with strong shocks in the hypersonic viscous
flow simulations.
