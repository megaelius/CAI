Individual chemically active drops suspended in a surfactant solution were observed to self-propel
spontaneously with straight, helical, or chaotic trajectories. To elucidate how these drops can
exhibit such strikingly different dynamics and `decide' what to do, we propose a minimal axisymmetric
model of a spherical active drop, and show that simple and linear interface properties can lead to
both steady self-propulsion of the droplet as well as chaotic behavior. The model includes two different
mobility mechanisms, namely, diffusiophoresis and the Marangoni effect, that convert self-generated
gradients of surfactant concentration into the flow at the droplet surface. In turn, surface-driven
flow initiates surfactant advection that is the only nonlinear mechanism and, thus, the only source
of dynamical complexity in our model. Numerical investigation of the fully-coupled hydrodynamic
and advection diffusion problems reveals that strong advection (e.g., large droplet size) may
destabilize a steadily self-propelling drop; once destabilized, the droplet spontaneously stops
and a symmetric extensile flow emerges. If advection is strengthened even further in comparison
with molecular diffusion, the droplet may perform chaotic oscillations. Our results indicate
that the thresholds of these instabilities depend heavily on the balance between diffusiophoresis
and the Marangoni effect. Using linear stability analysis, we demonstrate that diffusiophoresis
promotes the onset of high-order modes of monotonic instability of the motionless drop. We argue
that diffusiophoresis has a similar effect on the instabilities of a moving drop.
