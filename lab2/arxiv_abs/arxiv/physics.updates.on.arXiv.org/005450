We investigate, by means of two-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical
simulations, the fast collisional magnetic reconnection regime that is supported by the formation
of plasmoid chains when the Lundquist number $S$ exceeds a critical value (at magnetic Prandtl number,
$P_m = 1$). A recently developed characteristic-Galerkin finite-element code, FINMHD, that is
specifically designed for this aim in a reduced visco-resistive MHD framework, is employed. Contrary
to previous studies, a different initial setup of two repelling current channels is chosen in order
to form two quasi-singular current layers on an Alfv\'enic time scale as a consequence of the tilt
instability. If $S < 5 \times 10^3$, a subsequent stationary reconnection process is obtained with
a rate scaling as $S^{-1/2}$ as predicted by the classical Sweet-Parker model. Otherwise, a stochastic
time-dependent reconnection regime occurs, with a fast time-averaged rate independent of $S$
and having a normalized value of $0.014$. The latter regime is triggered by the formation of two chains
of plasmoids disrupting the current sheets with a sudden super-Alfv\'enic growth following a quiescent
phase, in agreement with the general theory of the plasmoid instability proposed by Comisso et al.
[Phys. Plasmas 23, 100702 (2016)]. Moreover, the non-monotonic dependence of the plasmoid growth
rate with $S$ following an asymptotically decreasing logarithmic law in the infinite $S$-limit
is confirmed. We also closely compare our results to those obtained during the development of the
coalescence instability setup in order to assess the generality of the mechanism. Finally, we briefly
discuss the relevance of our results to explain the flaring activity in solar corona and internal
disruptions in tokamaks.
