Being determined by human social behaviour, pedestrian group dynamics depends on "intrinsic properties"
of the group such as the purpose of the pedestrians, their personal relation, their gender, age,
and body size. In this work we quantitatively study the dynamical properties of pedestrian dyads
by analysing a large data set of automatically tracked pedestrian trajectories in an unconstrained
"ecological" setting (a shopping mall), whose relational group properties have been coded by three
different human observers. We observed that females walk slower and closer than males, that workers
walk faster, at a larger distance and more abreast than leisure oriented people, and that inter group
relation has a strong effect on group structure, with couples walking very close and abreast, colleagues
walking at a larger distance, and friends walking more abreast than family members. Pedestrian
height (obtained automatically through our tracking system) influences velocity and abreast
distance, both growing functions of the average group height. Results regarding pedestrian age
show as expected that elderly people walk slowly, while active age adults walk at the maximum velocity.
Groups with children have a strong tendency to walk in a non abreast formation, with a large distance
(despite a low abreast distance). A cross-analysis of the interplay between these intrinsic features,
taking in account also the effect of extrinsic crowd density, confirms these major effects but reveals
also a richer structure. An interesting and unexpected result, for example, is that the velocity
of groups with children {\it increases} with density, at least in the low-medium density range found
under normal conditions in shopping malls. Children also appear to behave differently according
to the gender of the parent.
