Turbulent flows over dense canopies of rigid filaments of small size are investigated for different
element heights and spacings using DNS. The flow can be decomposed into the element-coherent, dispersive
flow, the Kelvin--Helmholtz-like rollers typically reported over dense canopies, and the background,
incoherent turbulence. The canopies studied have spacings $s^+ = 3$--$50$, which essentially
preclude the background turbulence from penetrating within. The dispersive velocity fluctuations
are also mainly determined by the spacing, and are small deep within the canopy, where the footprint
of the Kelvin--Helmholtz-like rollers dominates. Their typical streamwise wavelength is determined
by the mixing length, which is essentially the sum of its height above and below the canopy tips. For
the present dense canopies, the former remains roughly the same in wall-units, and the latter, which
scales with the drag length, depends linearly on the spacing. This is the result of the drag being
essentially viscous and governed by the planar layout of the canopy. In shallow canopies, the proximity
of the canopy floor inhibits the formation of Kelvin--Helmholtz-like rollers, with essentially
no signature for height-to-spacing ratios $h/s \approx 1$, and no further inhibition beyond $h/s
\approx 6$. Very small spacings also inhibit the rollers, due to their obstruction by the canopy
elements. The obstruction decreases with increasing spacing and the signature of the instability
intensifies, even if for canopies sparser than those studied here the instability eventually breaks
down. Simple models based on linear stability can capture some of the above effects.
