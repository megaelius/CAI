The relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) method is a powerful many-body method, particularly in
the evaluation of electronic wave functions of heavy atoms and molecules, and can be used to calculate
various atomic and molecular properties. One such atomic property is the enhancement factor (R)
of the atomic electric dipole moment (EDM) due to an electron EDM needed in electron EDM searches.
The EDM of the electron is a sensitive probe of CP-violation, and its search could provide insights
into new physics beyond the Standard Model, as well as open questions in cosmology. Electron EDM
searches using atoms require the theoretical evaluation of R to provide an upper limit for the magnitude
of the electron EDM. In this work, we calculate R of 210Fr in the ground state using an improved RCC
method, and perform an analysis on the many-body processes occurring within the system. The RCC
method allows one to capture the effects of both the electromagnetic interaction and P- and T-violating
interactions, and our work develops this method beyond what had been implemented in the previous
works. We also perform calculations of hyperfine structure constants, electric dipole transition
matrix elements, and excitation energies, to assess the accuracy of R and the success of our improved
method. Finally, we present calculations of R with corrections due to Breit interaction effects,
approximate quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects, and some leading triple excitation terms
added perturbatively, to assess how significantly these terms contribute to the result. We obtain
a final value of R = 799, with an estimated 3% error, which is about 11% smaller than a previously reported
theoretical calculation.
