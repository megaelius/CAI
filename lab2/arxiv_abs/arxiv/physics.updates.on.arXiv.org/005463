Degradation technologies applied to emerging organic contaminants from human activities are
one of the major water challenges in the contamination legacy. Triclosan is an emerging contaminant,
commonly used as antibacterial agent in personal care products. Triclosan is stable, lipophilic
and it is proved to have ecotoxicologic effects in organics. This induces great concern since its
elimination in wastewater treatment plants is not efficient and its by-products (e.g. methyl-triclosan,
2,4-dichlorophenol or 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) are even more hazardous to several environmental
compartments. This work provides understanding of two different electrochemical reactors for
the degradation of triclosan and its derivative by-products in effluent. A batch reactor and a flow
reactor (mimicking a secondary settling tank in a wastewater treatment plant) were tested with
two different working anodes: Ti/MMO and Nb/BDD. The degradation efficiency and kinetics were
evaluated to find the best combination of current density, electrodes and set-up design. For both
reactors the best electrode combination was achieved with Ti/MMO as anode. The batch reactor at
7 mA/cm2 during 4 h attained degradation rates below the detection limit for triclosan and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol
and, 94% and 43% for 2,4-dichlorophenol and methyl triclosan, respectively. The flow reactor obtained,
in approximately 1 h, degradation efficiencies between 41% and 87% for the four contaminants. This
study suggests an alternative technology for emerging organic contaminants degradation, since
the combination of a low current density with the flow and matrix induced disturbance increases
and speeds up the compounds elimination in a real environmental matrix.
