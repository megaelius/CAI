In this study we investigated the capabilities of the mesh-free, Lagrangian particle method (Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics, SPH) to simulate the detailed hydrodynamic processes generated by both
spilling and plunging breaking waves within the surf zone. The weakly-compressible SPH code DualSPHysics
was applied to simulate wave breaking over two distinct bathymetric profiles (a plane beach and
fringing reef) and compared to experimental flume measurements of waves, flows, and mean water
levels. Despite the simulations spanning very different wave breaking conditions (including
an extreme case with violently plunging waves on an effectively dry reef slope), the model was able
to reproduce a wide range of relevant surf zone hydrodynamic processes using a fixed set of numerical
parameters. This included accurate predictions of the nonlinear evolution of wave shapes (e.g.,
asymmetry and skewness properties), rates of wave dissipation within the surf zone, and wave setup
distributions. By using this mesh-free approach, the model was able to resolve the critical crest
region within the breaking waves, which provided robust predictions of the wave-induced mass fluxes
within the surf zone responsible for the undertow. Within this breaking crest region, the model
results capture how the potential energy of the organized wave motion is initially converted to
kinetic energy and then dissipated, which reproduces the distribution of wave forces responsible
for wave setup generation across the surf zone. Overall, the results reveal how the mesh-free SPH
approach can accurately reproduce the detailed wave breaking processes with comparable skill
to state-of-the-art mesh-based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models, and thus can be applied
to provide valuable new physical insight into surf zone dynamics.
