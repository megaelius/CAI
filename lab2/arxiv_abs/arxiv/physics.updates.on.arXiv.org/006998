We present new results of measurements of reactor antineutrino flux and spectrum dependence on
the distance in the range 6-12 meters from the center of the reactor core at SM-3 reactor (Dimitrovgrad,
Russia). Additional measurements were carried out and set of data to perform statistical analysis
was almost doubled since the previous report. Using all collected data we performed the model independent
analysis on the oscillation parameters $\Delta m^2_{14}$ and $\sin^2(2\theta_{14})$. The method
of coherent summation of results of measurements allows us to directly observe the effect of oscillations.
We observed an oscillation effect in vicinity of $\Delta m^2_{14} = (7.25\pm0.13_{st}\pm1.08_{sys})
\text{eV}^2$ and $\sin^2(2\theta_{14}) =0.26\pm0.08_{st}\pm 0.05_{sys}$. We provide a comparison
of our results with results of other experiments on search for sterile neutrino. Combining the result
of the Neutrino-4 and the results of measurements of the gallium anomaly and reactor anomaly we obtained
value $\sin^2(2\theta_{14})\approx 0.19\pm0.04(4.6\sigma)$. Also was performed comparison
of Neutrino-4 experimental results with results of other reactor experiments NEOS, DANSS, STEREO,
PROSPECT and accelerator experiments MiniBooNE, LSND and the IceCube experiment also. Sterile
neutrino mass which can be calculated using the Neutrino-4 data in assumption that $m^2_4 \approx
\Delta m^2_{14}$ is $m_4 = (2.68 \pm 0.13)\text{eV}$. Considering estimations of mixing angles
obtained in other experiments we can calculate masses of electron neutrino, muon neutrino and tau
neutrino: $m^{\text{eff}}_{\nu_e} = (0.58 \pm 0.09)\text{eV}, m^{\text{eff}}_{\nu_{\mu}}
= (0.42 \pm 0.24)\text{eV}, m^{\text{eff}}_{\nu_{\tau}} \leq 0.65\text{eV}$. Extended PMNS
matrix for (3 + 1) model with one sterile neutrino is provided, neutrino flavor mixing scheme with
sterile neutrino and global fit of reactor experiments.
