We propose a magnetic resonance (MR)-based method for estimation of continuous linear attenuation
coefficients (LAC) in positron emission tomography (PET) using a physical compartmental model
and ultrashort echo time (UTE)/multi-echo Dixon (mUTE) acquisitions. Specifically, we propose
a three-dimensional (3D) mUTE sequence to acquire signals from water, fat, and short-T2 components
(e.g., bones) simultaneously in a single acquisition. The proposed mUTE sequence integrates 3D
UTE with multi-echo Dixon acquisitions and uses sparse radial trajectories to accelerate imaging
speed. Errors in the radial k-space trajectories are measured using a special k-space trajectory
mapping sequence and corrected for image reconstruction. A physical compartmental model is used
to fit the measured multi-echo MR signals to obtain fractions of water, fat and bone components for
each voxel, which are then used to estimate the continuous LAC map for PET attenuation correction.
The performance of the proposed method was evaluated via phantom and in vivo human studies, using
LACs from Computed Tomography (CT) as reference. Compared to Dixon- and atlas-based MRAC methods,
the proposed method yielded PET images with higher correlation and similarity in relation to the
reference. The relative absolute errors of PET activity values reconstructed by the proposed method
were below 5% in all of the four lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital), cerebellum, whole
white matter and gray matter regions across all subjects (n=6). The proposed mUTE method can generate
subject-specific, continuous LAC map for PET attenuation correction in PET/MR.
