Noises are common events in seismic reflection data that have very striking features in seismograms,
affecting seismic data processing and interpretation. Noise attenuation is an essential phase
in seismic processing data, usually resulting in seismic interpretation improvement that enhances
the signal to noise ratio. Groundroll presence is the major fashion of significant noise in the land
seismic survey. It is a type of coherent noise present in seismograms that appears as linear events,
in most cases overlapping the reflections and probably making it challenging to recognize. There
are several domains used in noise attenuation, Domain transformations is a complex algorithms
standard tool used commonly used during processing of seismic data and imaging processing, So a
large number methods have been developed to attenuate these types of noise. In the time-offset domain,
the noise wave such as Groundroll and random noises, overlap each other over time; a different domain
makes it easier to successfully isolate coherent, random noise and reflection events. Five steps
are introduced to attenuate coherent and random noise, these steps are FDNAT, AGORA, RADMX, SCFIL,
DDMED as well as Time-Variant band-pass Filter. The results indicate that the different domains
can actually reveal features and geological structures that have been masked by the noises present
in current data. because encourage significant improvements in the final image quality in 2-D seismic
section, so, these filtering techniques possibly give advantage to the interpreter in particularly
in structural and stratigraphic interpretation during the work of interpretation, especially
in the exploration and characterizing possible traps.
