Alfven Eigenmodes (AE) can be destabilized by energetic particles in neutral beam injection (NBI)
heated plasmas through inverse Landau damping and couplings with gap modes in the shear Alfven continua.
We describe the linear evolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal component of the vorticity
in a full 3D system using the reduced MHD equations, density and parallel velocity moments for the
energetic particles as well as the geodesic acoustic wave dynamics. A closure relation adds the
Landau damping and resonant destabilization effects in the model. We apply the model to study the
Alfven modes stability in TJ-II, performing a parametric analysis in a range of realistic values
of energetic particle $\beta$ (beta_f), ratios of thermal/Alfven velocities (Vth/VA0), energetic
particle density profiles and toroidal modes (n) including toroidal and helical couplings. The
study predicts a large helical coupling between different toroidal modes and the destabilization
of helical Alfven Eigenmodes (HAE) with frequencies similar to the AE activity measured in TJ-II,
between 50 - 400 kHz. The analysis has also revealed the destabilization of GAE (Global Alfven Eigenmodes),
TAE (Toroidal Alfven Eigenmodes) and EPM (Energetic Particle Modes). For the modes considered
here, optimized TJ-II operations require a iota profile in the range of [0.845, 0.979] to stabilize
AEs in the inner and middle plasma. AEs in the plasma periphery cannot be fully stabilized, although
for a configuration with iota = [0.945, 1.079], only n=7,11,15 AE are unstable with a growth rate
4 times smaller compared to the standard iota = [1.54,1.68] case and a frequency of 100 kHz. We reproduce
the frequency sweeping evolution of the AE frequency observed in TJ-II as the iota profile is varied.
The AE frequency sweeping is caused by consecutive changes of the instability dominant modes between
different helical families.
