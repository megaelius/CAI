Recently, halide perovskites have gained significant attention from the perspective of efficient
spintronics owing to Rashba effect. This effect occurs as a consequence of strong spin-orbit coupling
under noncentrosymmetric environ-ment, which can be dynamic and/or static. However, there exist
intense debates on the origin of broken inversion symmetry since the halide perovskites typically
crystallize into a centrosymmetric structure. In order to clarify the issue, we examine both dynamic
and static effects in all-inorganic CsPbBr3 and organic-inorganic CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) perovskite
single crystals by employing temperature- and polarization-dependent photoluminescence excitation
spec-troscopy. The perovskite single crystals manifest the dynamic effect by photon recycling
of the indirect Rashba gap, causing dual peaks in the photoluminescence. But the effect vanishes
in CsPbBr3 at low temperatures (< 50 K), accom-panied by a striking color change of the crystal, arising
presumably due to lower degrees of freedom for inversion sym-metry breaking associated with the
thermal motion of the spherical Cs cation, compared with the polar MA cation in MAPbBr3. We also show
that static Rashba effect occurs only in MAPbBr3 below 90 K due to surface reconstruction via MA-cation
ordering, which likely extends across a few layers from the crystal surface to the interior. We further
demonstrate that static Rashba effect can be completely suppressed upon surface treatment with
poly methyl methac-rylate (PMMA) coating. We believe that our results provide a general consensus
on Rashba effect in halide perovskites.
