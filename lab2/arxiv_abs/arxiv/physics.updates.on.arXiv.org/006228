Coalescence of micrometer-scale droplets is impacted by several parameters, including droplet
size, viscosities of the two phases, droplet velocity and angle of approach, as well as interfacial
tension and surfactant coverage. The dynamics and thinning of films between coalescing droplets
can be particularly complex in the presence of surfactants, due to the generation of Marangoni stresses
and reduced film mobility. In this work, a microfluidic hydrodynamic Stokes trap is used to gently
steer and trap surfactant-laden micrometer-sized droplets at the center of a cross-slot. Incoming
droplets are made to coalesce with the trapped droplet, yielding measurements of the film drainage
time. Water droplets are formed upstream using a microfluidic T-junction, in heavy and light mineral
oils and stabilized using SPAN 80, an oil-soluble surfactant. Film drainage times are measured
as a function of continuous phase viscosity, incoming droplet speed, trapped droplet size, and
surfactant concentrations above and below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). As expected,
systems with higher surfactant concentrations, higher continuous phase viscosity, and slower
droplet speed exhibit longer film drainage times. Perhaps more surprisingly, larger droplets
and high confinement also result in longer film drainage times. The results are used here to determine
critical conditions for coalescence, including both an upper and a lower critical Capillary number.
Moreover, it is shown that induced surfactant concentration gradient effects enable coalescence
events after the droplets had originally flocculated, at surfactant concentrations above the
CMC. The microfluidic hydrodynamic trap provides new insights into the role of surfactants in film
drainage and opens avenues for controlled coalescence studies at micrometer length scales and
millisecond time scales.
