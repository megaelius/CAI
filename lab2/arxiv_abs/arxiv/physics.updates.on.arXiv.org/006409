We introduce a deterministic model that partitions the total population into the susceptible,
infected, quarantined, and those traced after exposure, recovered and the deceased. We introduce
the concept of 'accessible population for transmission of the disease', which can be a small fraction
of the total population, for instance when interventions are in force. This assumption, together
with the structure of the set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the populations,
allows us to decouple the equations into just two equations. This further reduces to a logistic type
of equation for the total infected population. The equation can be solved analytically and therefore
allows for a clear interpretation of the growth and inhibiting factors in terms of the parameters
in the full model. The validity of the 'accessible population' assumption and the efficacy of the
reduced logistic model is demonstrated by the ease of fitting the United Kingdom data for the total
number of infected cases. The approach further helps us to analyze the original model equations.
We show that the original model equations provide a very good fit with the United Kingdom data for
the cumulative number of infections. The active infected population of the model is seen to exhibit
a turning point around mid-May, suggesting the beginning of a slow-down in the spread of infections.
However, the rate of slowing down beyond the turning point is small and therefore the cumulative
number of infections is likely to saturate to about $3.52 \times 10^5$ around early or mid July, provided
the lock-down conditions continue to prevail. Noting that the fits obtained from the reduced logistic
equation and the full model equations are equally good. The model and the procedure adopted here
are expected to be useful in fitting the data for other countries and forecasting the progression
of the disease.
