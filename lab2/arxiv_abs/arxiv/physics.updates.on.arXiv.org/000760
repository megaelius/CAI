The past several years have seen renewed interest in the use of symmetry-projected Hartree-Fock
for the description of strong correlations. Unfortunately, these symmetry-projected mean-field
methods do not adequately account for dynamic correlation. Presumably, this shortcoming could
be addressed if one could combine symmetry-projected Hartree-Fock with a many-body method such
as coupled cluster theory, but this is by no means straightforward because the two techniques are
formulated in very different ways. However, we have recently shown that the singlet $S^2$-projected
unrestricted Hartree-Fock wave function can in fact be written in a coupled cluster-like wave function:
that is, the spin-projected unrestricted Hartree-Fock wave function can be written as a polynomial
of a double-excitation operator acting on some closed-shell reference determinant. Here, we extend
this result and show that the spin-projected generalized Hartree-Fock wave function (which has
both $S^2$ and $S_z$ projection) is likewise a polynomial of low-order excitation operators acting
on a closed-shell determinant, and provide a closed-form expression for the resulting polynomial
coefficients. We include a few preliminary applications of the combination of this spin-projected
Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory to the Hubbard Hamiltonian, and comment on generalizations
of the methodology. Results here are not for production level, but a similarity transformed theory
that combines the two offers the promise of being accurate for both weak and strong correlation,
and particularly may offer significant improvements in the intermediate correlation regime where
neither projected Hartree-Fock nor coupled cluster is particularly accurate.
