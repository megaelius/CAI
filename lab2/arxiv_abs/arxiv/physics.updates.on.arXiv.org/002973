The problem of simulating the interaction of spacecraft travelling at velocities necessary for
starflight with the interplanetary and interstellar medium is considered. Interaction of protons,
atoms, and ions at kinetic energies relative to the spacecraft (MeV per nucleon) is essentially
a problem of sputtering. More problematic is the impact of dust grains, macroscopic objects on the
order of 10 nm ($10^{-21}$ kg) to 1 $\mu$m ($10^{-15}$ kg), the effects of which are difficult to calculate,
and thus experiments are needed. The maximum velocity of dust grains that can be achieved at present
in the laboratory using electrostatic methods is approximately 100 km/s, two orders of magnitude
below starflight velocities. The attainment of greater velocities has been previously considered
in connection with the concept of impact fusion and was concluded to be technologically very challenging.
The reasons for this are explained in terms of field emission, which limits the charge-to-mass ratio
on the macroscopic particle being accelerated as well as the voltage potential gradient of the accelerating
electrostatic field, resulting in the accelerator needing to be hundreds to thousands of kilometers
long for $\mu$m-sized grains. Use of circular accelerators (cyclotrons and synchrotrons) is not
practical due to limitations on magnetic field strength making the accelerator thousands of kilometers
in size for $\mu$m-sized grains. Electromagnetic launchers (railguns, coilguns) have not been
able to produce velocities greater than conventional gas guns (< 10 km/s). The nearest feasible
technologies (tandem accelerators, macromolecular accelerators) to reach the regime of projectile
mass and velocity of interest are reviewed. Pulsed lasers are found to be the only facilities able
to accelerate condensed phase matter to velocities approaching 1000 km/s but unlikely to be able
to reach greater speeds.
