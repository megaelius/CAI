It is shown that in low-beta plasmas, such as the solar corona, some instances of the solar wind, the
aurora, inner regions of accretion discs, their coronae, and some laboratory plasmas, Alfvenic
fluctuations produce no ion heating within the gyrokinetic approximation, i.e., as long as their
amplitudes (at the Larmor scale) are small and their frequencies stay below the ion Larmor frequency.
Thus, all low-frequency ion heating in such plasmas is due to compressive fluctuations: density
perturbations and non-Maxwellian perturbations of the ion distribution function. Because these
fluctuations energetically decouple from the Alfvenic ones already in the inertial range, the
above conclusion means that the energy partition between ions and electrons in low-beta plasmas
is decided at the outer scale, where turbulence is launched, and can in principle be determined from
MHD models of the relevant astrophysical systems. Any additional ion heating must come from non-gyrokinetic
mechanisms such as cyclotron heating or the stochastic heating owing to distortions of ions' Larmor
orbits. An exception to these conclusions occurs in the Hall limit, i.e., when the ratio of the ion
to electron temperatures is as low as the ion beta (equivalently, the electron beta is order unity).
In this regime, compressive fluctuations (slow waves) couple to Alfvenic ones above the Larmor
scale (viz., at the ion inertial or ion sound scale), the Alfvenic and compressive cascades join
and then separate again into cascades of fluctuations that linearly resemble kinetic Alfven and
(oblique) ion cyclotron waves, with the former heating electrons and the latter ions. The two cascades
are shown to decouple, scalings for them are derived, and it is argued physically that the two species
will be heated by them at approximately equal rates.
