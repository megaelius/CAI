We study the dynamical regimes demonstrated by a pair of identical 3-element ring oscillators (reduced
version of synthetic 3-gene genetic Repressilator) coupled using the design of the "quorum sensing
(QS)" process natural for interbacterial communications. In this work QS is implemented as an additional
network incorporating elements of the ring as both the source and the activation target of the fast
diffusion QS signal. This version of indirect nonlinear coupling, in cooperation with the reasonable
extension of the parameters which control properties of the isolated oscillators, exhibits the
formation of a very rich array of attractors. Using a parameter-space defined by the individual
oscillator amplitude and the coupling strength, we found the extended area of parameter-space
where the identical oscillators demonstrate quasiperiodicity, which evolves to chaos via the
period doubling of either resonant limit cycles or complex antiphase symmetric limit cycles with
five winding numbers. The symmetric chaos extends over large parameter areas up to its loss of stability,
followed by a system transition to an unexpected mode: an asymmetric limit cycle with a winding number
of 1:2. In turn, after long evolution across the parameter-space, this cycle demonstrates a period
doubling cascade which restores the symmetry of dynamics by formation of symmetric chaos, which
nevertheless preserves the memory of the asymmetric limit cycles in the form of stochastic alternating
"polarization" of the time series. All stable attractors coexist with some others, forming remarkable
and complex multistability including the coexistence of torus and limit cycles, chaos and regular
attractors, symmetric and asymmetric regimes. We traced the paths and bifurcations leading to
all areas of chaos, and presented a detailed map of all transformations of the dynamics.
