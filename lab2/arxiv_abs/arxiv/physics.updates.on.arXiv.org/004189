The interplay between concentration, flow, hydrodynamic interactions (HI), and topological
interactions governing semidilute polymer dynamics in strong flows are challenging to characterize.
Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations are particularly valuable as a way to direct visualize how molecular
interactions arise in these systems; however, BD simulations are often computationally limited
by the need to calculate the correlated Brownian noise via decomposition of the diffusion tensor.
Previously we have introduced an iterative conformational averaging (CA) method for BD simulations
which bypasses these limitations by preaveraging the HI and Brownian noise in an iterative procedure.
In this work, we generalize the CA method to flowing semidilute solutions by introducing a conformation
dependent diffusion tensor and a strain dependent approximation to the conformationally averaged
Brownian noise. We find that this approach nearly quantitatively reproduces both transient and
steady state polymer dynamics and rheology while achieving an order of magnitude computational
acceleration. We then utilize the CA method to investigate the concentration and flow rate dependence
of polymer dynamics in planar extensional flows. Our results are consistent with previous experimental
and simulation studies and provide a detailed view of broad conformational distributions in the
semidilute regime. We observe interconversion between stretched and coiled states at steady state,
which we conjecture occur due to the effect of concentration on the conformation dependent polymer
drag. Additionally, we observe transient flow-induced intermolecular hooks in the startup of
flow which lead to diverse and unique stretching pathways.
