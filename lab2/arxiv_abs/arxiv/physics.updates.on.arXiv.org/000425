One of the challenges of turbulence research applied to the ocean is the reliable determination
of the distribution of turbulence dissipation rate in space and time. The interest in this quantity
stems not only from its main role in closing the mechanical energy budget, but also from its link to
mixing. In the ocean, the turbulence dissipation rate is estimated either by means of microstructure
shear measurements, or by means of adiabatically reordering vertical profiles of density. The
latter technique leads to the estimation of a typical overturn size, the Thorpe scale, which in turn
can be used to estimate average turbulence dissipation rate by using empirical relations linking
the Thorpe scale to the Ozmidov scale of turbulence. In both cases, the turbulence dissipation rate
can be estimated using single vertical profiles from shipborne instrumentation, having limited
time resolution. We present here an alternative method to estimate the length scale of overturns
by using the Ellison length scale. The Ellison scale is estimated using frequency spectra of temperature
just beyond the internal wave band, measured by moored instruments. We apply the method to high resolution
temperature data from three moorings deployed at different locations around the Josephine seamount
(North Eastern Atlantic Ocean), in a region of bottom-intensified turbulence. It is shown that
the variance of the temperature time series at the higher end of the internal wave frequency band
and above is well correlated with the Thorpe scale. The method is based on a time-frequency decomposition
using the "maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform". The results show that the Ellison length
scale can be a viable alternative to the Thorpe scale for indirectly estimating turbulence dissipation
rate from moored instruments in the ocean if time resolution is sufficiently high...
