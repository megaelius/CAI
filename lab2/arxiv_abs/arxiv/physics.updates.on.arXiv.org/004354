Coupling between dynamic strain and magnetization in ferromagnetic thin films has attracted special
consideration as it presents both intriguing fundamental physics problems and technological
importance for potential multi-functional devices and information handling. The dynamic strain
can be generated by acoustic waves including bulk, surface or guided waves. In this work, we propose
the theoretical and experimental investigation of the interaction of pure shear horizontal (SH)
wave with a uniaxial multilayered TbCo2/FeCo thin film in a delay line configuration fabricated
on Quartz ST-90X cut. We evaluate theoretically the evolution of phase velocity as a function of
magnetic field and experimentally the variation of the transmission coefficient. A piezomagnetic
model was developed allowing us to calculate the elastic stiffness constants of the multilayer
as a function of the applied magnetic field. The model was also implemented for acoustic waves dispersion
curves calculation. We show that the evolution of phase velocity is dominated by the C66 elastic
stiffness constant variation as expected for the case of shear horizontal surface wave. The fabricated
device let us exciting both fundamental and third harmonic shear mode at 410 MHz and 1.2 GHz, respectively.
For both modes, the theoretical results corroborate very well the experimental ones. At 1.2 GHz
the mode exhibits a maximum phase velocity shift close to 2.5% and an attenuation reaching 500 dB/cm,
for a sensitivity as high as 250 ppm/Oe. The reported theoretical model and experimental results
are of tremendous interest for the development of advanced devices for magnetic field sensing applications
as well as investigating magnon-phonon interaction at a fundamental level.
