This thesis presents a newly developed theory for the formation and maintenance of eddy-driven
jets in planetary turbulence. The novelty is that jet formation and maintenance is studied as a dynamics
of the statistics of the flow rather than a dynamics of individual realizations. This is pursued
using Stochastic Structural Stability Theory (S3T), which studies the closed dynamics of the first
two cumulants of the full statistical state dynamics of the flow after neglecting or parameterizing
third and higher-order cumulants. Using this statistical closure, large-scale structure formation
is studied in barotropic turbulence on a $\beta$-plane. It is demonstrated that at analytically
predicted critical parameter values the homogeneous turbulent state undergoes a bifurcation
becoming inhomogeneous with the emergence of large-scale zonal and/or non-zonal flows. The mechanisms
by which the turbulent Reynolds stresses organize to reinforce infinitesimal mean flow inhomogeneities,
thus leading to this statistical state instability, are studied for various regimes of parameter
values. It is also demonstrated that the S3T instabilities equilibrate to turbulent states with
finite-amplitude jets. Moreover, the relation between large-scale structure formation through
modulational instability and the S3T instability of the homogeneous turbulent state is also investigated
and it is shown that the modulational instability results are subsumed by the S3T results. Finally,
the study of the S3T stability of inhomogeneous turbulent jet equilibria is presented and the relation
with the phenomenon of jet merging is investigated. Although all these phenomena cannot be predicted
by analysis of the dynamics of single realizations of the flow, it is demonstrated that the predictions
of S3T are reflected in individual realizations of the flow.
