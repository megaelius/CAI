In order to better comprehend the global carbon cycle and predict the prognosis for the response
to climate change, accurate assessment of sea-air CO2 flux is necessary. Comparing to the relative
homogeneously distribution of atmospheric CO2 , the pCO2 in the sea surface water is exposed to huge
spatio-temporal variability, which leaves a prominent uncertainty resource. Many regional studies
typically divided the observational pCO2 data into grid boxes so as to obtain enough data points
statistically for their calculatio. However, using the data inside the grid box areas to represent
its holistic property (such as standard deviation to represent spatial variance) will mix up three
different uncertainty sources. First, the analytical error in the pCO2 determination and the associated
environmental parameters used in deriving pCO2 . Second, the spatial variance because of inhomogenous
spatial pattern of sea surface pCO2 , especially the region with a dramatically dynamic circumstance
like: coastal areas, boundaries or fronts and etc. Third, the estimation process in undersampling
condition, specifically, this kind of uncertainty origins from the process that using a sparse
data to represent its holistic property of the box area. Common uncertainty quantification by Standard
Deviation will mix up the different sources of uncertainty. In this paper, it introduces an optimized
procedure to determine three sources of uncertainty (1st analytical error, 2nd spatial variance,
3rd bias from undersampling.) using the combined remote sensing-derived and field-measured pCO2
data. In order to provide a comprehensive error assessment report.
