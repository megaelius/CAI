We consider the scaling laws, second-order statistics and entropy of the consumed energy of metropolis
cities which are hybrid complex systems comprising social networks, engineering systems, agricultural
output, economic activity and energy components. We abstract a city in terms of two fundamental
variables; $s$ resource cells (of unit area) that represent energy-consuming geographic or spatial
zones (e.g. land, housing or infrastructure etc.) and a population comprising $n$ mobile units
that can migrate between these cells. We show that with a constant metropolis area (fixed $s$), the
variance and entropy of consumed energy initially increase with $n$, reach a maximum and then eventually
diminish to zero as saturation is reached. These metrics are indicators of the spatial mobility
of the population. Under certain situations, the variance is bounded as a quadratic function of
the mean consumed energy of the metropolis. However, when population and metropolis area are endogenous,
growth in the latter is arrested when $n\leq\frac{s}{2}\log(s)$ due to diminished population
density. Conversely, the population growth reaches equilibrium when $n\geq {s}\log{n}$ or equivalently
when the aggregate of both over-populated and under-populated areas is large. Moreover, we also
draw the relationship between our approach and multi-scalar information, when economic dependency
between a metropolis's sub-regions is based on the entropy of consumed energy. Finally, if the city's
economic size (domestic product etc.) is proportional to the consumed energy, then for a constant
population density, we show that the economy scales linearly with the surface area (or $s$).
