Remote detection of undeclared nuclear reactors remains one of the key goals concerning global
nuclear security. To meet this goal the WATCHMAN collaboration has proposed the construction of
a water based antineutrino detector, sited 13 to 25 kilometres from a nuclear reactor complex. Antineutrinos
from the reactor interact in the water of the detector via an inverse beta decay interaction resulting
in two distinct cones of Cherenkov light tens of milliseconds apart. Using this interaction WATCHMAN
(WATer Cherenkov Monitor for ANtineutrinos) will be the first detector to determine the active/inactive
status of a reactor complex at a stand-off greater than 10 kilometres. The water used in the detector
will be doped with gadolinium, providing the first demonstration of the potential of gadolinium
doped detectors for reactor monitoring and will confirm the potential of the technology for use
in larger multi-kiloton neutrino experiments. The proposed WATCHMAN design will be a kiloton scale
water based detector, constructed of a 16 metre diameter tank with a height of 16 metres and will comprise
approximately 3000 photomultiplier tubes. An overview of the remote monitoring goals of the WATCHMAN
collaboration will be given, with a detailed description of the proposed detector. An outline of
the two proposed WATCHMAN sites will also be detailed with a prediction of the expected antineutrino
rate and the time taken to determine the switch between the associated reactor on and off state at
each site. A brief summary of the project and the future goals non-proliferation goals of the collaboration
will also be presented.
