Dual Fabry-Perot-Cavity-based Optical Refractometry (DFCB-OR) have been shown to have excellent
potential for characterization of gases, in particular their refractivity and density. However,
its performance has in practice been found to be limited by drifts. To remedy this, drift-free DFPC-OR
(DF-DFCB-OR) has recently been proposed. Suggested methodologies for realization of a specific
type of DF-DFCB-OR, termed Fast Switching DFCB-OR (FS-DFCB-OR), have been presented in an accompanying
work. This paper scrutinizes the performance and the limitations of both DF- and FS-DFCB-OR for
assessments of refractivity and gas density, in particular their precision, accuracy, and temperature
dependence. It is shown that both refractivity and gas density can be assessed by FS-DFCB-OR with
a precision in the 10$^{-9}$ range under STP conditions. It is demonstrated that the absolute accuracy
is mainly limited by the accuracy by which the instantaneous deformation of the cavity or the higher
order virial coefficients can be assessed. It is also shown that the internal accuracy, i.e. the
accuracy by which the system can be characterized with respect to an internal standard, can be several
orders of magnitude better than the absolute. It is concluded that the temperature dependence of
FS-DFCB-OR is exceptionally small, typically in the 10$^{-8}$ to 10$^{-7}$/C range, and primarily
caused by thermal expansion of the FPC-spacer material. Finally, this paper discusses means on
how to design a FS-DFCB-or system for optimal performance and epitomizes the conclusions of this
and our accompanying works regarding both DF- and FS-DFCB-OR in terms of performance and provides
an outlook for both techniques. Our works can serve as a basis for future realizations of instrumentation
for assessments of gas refractivity and density that can fully benefit from the extraordinary potential
of FPC-OR.
