Most recently, boron-graphdiyne, a {\pi}-conjugated two-dimensional (2D) structure made from
merely sp carbon skeleton connected with boron atoms was successfully experimentally realized
through a bottom-to-up synthetic strategy. Motivated by this exciting experimental advance,
we conducted density functional theory (DFT) and classical molecular dynamics simulations to
study the mechanical, thermal conductivity and stability, electronic and optical properties
of single-layer B-graphdiyne. We particularly analyzed the application of this novel 2D material
as an anode for Li, Na, Mg and Ca ions storage. Uniaxial tensile simulation results reveal that B-graphdiyne
owing to its porous structure and flexibility can yield superstretchability. The single-layer
B-graphdiyne was found to exhibit semiconducting electronic character, with a narrow band-gap
of 1.15 eV based on the HSE06 prediction. It was confirmed that the mechanical straining can be employed
to further tune the optical absorbance and electronic band-gap of B-graphdiyne. Ab initio molecular
dynamics results reveal that B-graphdiyne can withstand at high temperatures, like 2500 K. The
thermal conductivity of suspended single-layer B-graphdiyne was predicted to be very low, ~2.5
W/mK at the room temperature. Our first-principles results reveal the outstanding prospect of
B-graphdiyne as an anode material with ultrahigh charge capacities of 808 mAh/g, 5174 mAh/g and
3557 mAh/g for Na, Ca and Li ions storage, respectively. The comprehensive insight provided by this
investigation highlights the outstanding physics of B-graphdiyne nanomembranes, and suggest
them as highly promising candidates for the design of novel stretchable nanoelectronics and energy
storage devices.
