We present a dynamic decomposition analysis of the wake flow in fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
systems under both laminar and turbulent flow conditions. Of particular interest is to provide
the significance of low-dimensional wake flow features and their interaction dynamics to sustain
the free vibration of a square cylinder at a relatively low mass ratio. To obtain the high-dimensional
data, we employ a body-conforming variational fluid-structure interaction solver based on the
recently developed partitioned iterative scheme and the dynamic subgrid-scale turbulence model
for a moderate Reynolds number. The snapshot data from high-dimensional FSI simulations are projected
to a low-dimensional subspace using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). We utilize each
corresponding POD mode for detecting features: the vortex street, the shear layer and the near-wake
bubble. We find that the vortex shedding modes contribute solely to the lift force, while the near-wake
and shear layer modes play a dominating role to the drag force. We further examine the fundamental
mechanism of this dynamical behavior and propose a force decomposition technique via low-dimensional
approximation. We ascertain quantitatively that the shear layer feeds the vorticity flux to the
wake vortices and the near-wake bubble during the wake-body synchronization. Based on the decomposition
of wake dynamics, we suggest an interaction cycle for the frequency lock-in during the wake-body
interaction, which provides the inter-relationship between the high amplitude motion and the
dominating wake features. Through our investigation of wake-body synchronization below critical
Re range, we discover that the bluff body can undergo a synchronized high-amplitude vibration due
to flexibility-induced unsteadiness. The interaction cycle for the wake-synchronization is
found to be valid for the turbulent wake flow.
