Individual magnetic wax spheres with specific gravities of 1.006, 1.054 and 1.152 were released
from rest on a smooth wall in water at friction Reynolds numbers, Re_{\tau}=680 and 1320 (d^+ = 58
and 122 viscous units, respectively). Three-dimensional tracking was conducted to understand
the effect of turbulence and wall friction on sphere motions. Spheres subjected to sufficient mean
shear initially lifted off of the wall before descending back towards it. These lifting spheres
translated with the fluid above the wall, undergoing saltation or resuspension, with minimal rotation
about any axis. By contrast, spheres that did not lift off upon release mainly slid along the wall.
These denser spheres lagged the fluid more significantly due to greater wall friction. As they slid
downstream, they began to roll forward after which small repeated lift-off events occurred. These
spheres also rotated about both the streamwise and wall-normal axes. In all cases, the sphere trajectories
were limited to the buffer and logarithmic regions, and all wall collisions were completely inelastic.
Sphere streamwise velocities fluctuated up to 20% from the mean value even after the sphere had attained
an approximate terminal velocity. In the plane parallel to the wall, the spheres migrated in the
spanwise direction about 12% of the streamwise distance traveled suggesting that spanwise forces
are important. The variations in sphere kinematics were likely induced by high and low momentum
zones in the boundary layer, vortex shedding in the sphere wakes, and wall friction. The repeated
lift-offs of the forward rolling denser sphere were attributed to a Magnus lift.
