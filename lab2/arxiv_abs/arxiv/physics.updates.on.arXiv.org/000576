The Earth has warmed in the last century with the most rapid warming occurring near the surface in
the arctic. This enhanced surface warming in the Arctic is partly because the extra heat is trapped
in a thin layer of air near the surface due to the persistent stable-stratification found in this
region. The warming of the surface air due to the extra heat depends upon the amount of turbulent mixing
in the atmosphere, which is described by the depth of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). In this
way the depth of the ABL determines the effective response of the surface air temperature to perturbations
in the climate forcing. The ABL depth can vary from tens of meters to a few kilometers which presents
a challenge for global climate models which cannot resolve the shallower layers. Here we show that
the uncertainties in the depth of the ABL can explain up to 60 percent of the difference between the
simulated and observed surface air temperature trends and 50 percent of the difference in temperature
variability for the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble mean. Previously
the difference between observed and modeled temperature was thought to be largely due to differences
in individual models treatment of large-scale circulation and other factors related to the forcing,
such as sea-ice extent. While this can be an important source of uncertainty in climate projections,
our results show that it is the representation of the ABL in these models which is the main reason global
climate models cannot reproduce the observed spatial and temporal pattern of climate change. This
highlights the need for a better description of the stably-stratified ABL in global climate models
in order to constrain the current uncertainty in climate variability and projections of climate
change in the surface layer.
