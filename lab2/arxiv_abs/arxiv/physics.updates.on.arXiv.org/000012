Information in networks is non-uniformly distributed, enabling individuals in certain network
positions to get preferential access to information. Social scientists have developed influential
theories about the role of network structure in information access. These theories were validated
through numerous studies, which examined how individuals leverage their social networks for competitive
advantage, such as a new job or higher compensation. It is not clear how these theories generalize
to online networks, which differ from real-world social networks in important respects, including
asymmetry of social links. We address this problem by analyzing how users of the social news aggregator
Digg adopt stories recommended by friends, i.e., users they follow. We measure the impact different
factors, such as network position and activity rate; have on access to novel information, which
in Digg's case means set of distinct news stories. We show that a user can improve his information
access by linking to active users, though this becomes less effective as the number of friends, or
their activity, grows due to structural network constraints. These constraints arise because
users in structurally diverse position within the follower graph have topically diverse interests
from their friends. Moreover, though in most cases user's friends are exposed to almost all the information
available in the network, after they make their recommendations, the user sees only a small fraction
of the available information. Our study suggests that cognitive and structural bottlenecks limit
access to novel information in online social networks.
