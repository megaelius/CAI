The transport equations for velocity variances are investigated using data from DNS of incompressible
channel flows at $Re_\tau$ up to 5200. Each term in the transport equation has been spectrally decomposed
to expose the contribution of turbulence at different length scales to the processes governing
the flow of energy in the wall-normal direction, in scale and among components. The outer-layer
turbulence is dominated by very large-scale streamwise elongated modes. Away from the wall, production
occurs primarily in these large-scale streamwise-elongated modes in the streamwise velocity,
but dissipation occurs nearly isotropically in both velocity components and scale. For this to
happen, the energy is transferred from the streamwise elongated modes to modes with a range of orientations
through non-linear interactions, and then transferred to other velocity components. This allows
energy to be transferred more-or-less isotropically from these large scales to the small scales
at which dissipation occurs. The VLSMs also transfer energy to the wall-region resulting in a modulation
of the autonomous near-wall dynamics. The near-wall energy flows are consistent with the well-known
autonomous near-wall dynamics. Through the overlap region between outer and inner layer turbulence,
there is a self-similar structure to the energy flows. The VLSM production occurs at spanwise scales
that grow with $y$. There is transport of energy away from the wall over a range of scales that grows
with $y$. And, there is transfer of energy to small dissipative scales which grow like $y^{1/4}$.
Finally, the small-scale near-wall processes characterised by wavelengths less that 1000 wall
units are largely Reynolds number independent, while the larger-scale outer layer process are
strongly Reynolds number dependent. The interaction between them appears to be relatively simple.
