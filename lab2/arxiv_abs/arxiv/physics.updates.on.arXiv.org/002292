Heat enhancement at the target in a High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) field is investigated
by considering the effects of the injection of microbubbles in the vicinity of the tumor to be ablated.
The interaction between the bubble cloud and the HIFU field is investigated using a three-dimensional
numerical model. The propagation of non-linear ultrasonic waves in the tissue or in a phantom medium
is modeled using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on a fixed grid, while the microbubbles
dynamics and motion are modeled as discrete singularities, which are tracked in a Lagrangian framework.
These two models are coupled to each other such that both the acoustic field and the bubbles influence
each other. The temperature rise in the field is calculated by solving a heat transfer equation applied
over a much longer time scale. The compressible continuum part of the model is validated by conducting
HIFU simulation without microbubbles and comparing the pressure and temperature fields against
available experiments. The coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is then validated against existing
experiments with a phantom tissue. The various mechanisms through which microbubbles enhance
heat deposition are then examined in detail. The effects of the initial void fraction in the cloud
are then sought by considering the changes in the attenuation of the primary ultrasonic wave and
the modifications of the enhanced heat deposition in the focal region. Finally, the effects of the
microbubble cloud size and its localization in the focal region are shown and the effects of these
parameters in altering the temperature rise and the location of the temperature peak are discussed.
