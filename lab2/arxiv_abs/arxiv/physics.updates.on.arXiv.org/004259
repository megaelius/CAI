Although they are rare elements in the Earth's mantle, noble gases (NG) owe to their strongly varying
masses contrasting physical behaviors making them important geochemical tracers. When partial
melting occurs at depth, the partitioning of NGs between phases is controlled by a distribution
coefficient that can be determined from the solubility of the NGs in each phase. Here we report quantitative
calculations of the solubility of He, Ne, Ar and Xe in carbonate melts based on molecular dynamics
simulations. The NG solubilities are first calculated in K2CO3-CaCO3 mixtures at 1 bar and favorably
compared to the only experimental data available to date. Then we investigate the effect of pressure
(up to 6 GPa), focusing on two melt compositions: a dolomitic one and a natrocarbonatitic one (modeling
the lava of Ol Doinyo Lengai). The solubility decreases with the amount of alkaline-earth cation
in the melt and with the size of the noble gas. In the natrocarbonatitic melt, Henry's law is fulfilled
at low pressures (up to ~ 0.1 GPa). At higher pressures the solubility levels off or even starts to
diminish smoothly. In contrast, in molten dolomite the effect of pressure is negligible on the studied
P range (3-6 GPa). At the pressures of the Earth's mantle, the solubilities of noble gases in carbonate
melts are still of the same order of magnitude as the ones in molten silicates (~ 1-10 mol%). This suggests
that carbonatitic melts at depth are not preferential carriers of noble gases, even if the dependence
with the melt composition is not negligible and has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Finally
we evaluate the surface tension at the interface between carbonate melts and noble gases and its
evolution with pressure. Whatever the composition of the melt and of the NG phase, the surface tension
increases when P increases from 0 to 6 GPa.
