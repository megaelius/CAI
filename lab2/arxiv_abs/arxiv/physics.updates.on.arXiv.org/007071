This paper unveils the impact of random phase distribution fomented variations on the characteristics
of hafnium zirconium oxide based ferroelectric FETs, and the implications towards the application
in neuromorphic system. TiN/HZO/TiN/SiO$_2$ ferroelectric capacitors are fabricated on silicon
substrate. Statistical distribution of coercive voltage from polarization-voltage measurements
show a two-peak distribution, which is attributed to the existence of two distinct groups of samples
, ferroelectric dominant and paraelectric dominant ones. Subsequently, ferroelectric FinFET
devices with single and multiple fins have been fabricated on SOI wafer using a gate first process,
with gate lengths down to 40nm. Ferroelectric hysteresis with enhanced static memory window up
to 3.5V in 10nm HZO based ferroelectric FET is observed. Short-channel multiple-fin devices show
particularly good ferroelectric switching characteristics and high yield. In addition, these
devices show highly linear and symmetric multi-level programming characteristics, which makes
them an excellent candidate as synaptic device. Modelling of device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle
variation is performed based on measured data and applied to system level neural network simulations
using the CIMulator software platform. Device-to-device variation is mostly compensated during
neural network online training and has virtually no impact on inference accuracy. On the other hand,
cycle-to-cycle threshold voltage variation up to 400mV can be tolerated for MNIST handwritten
digits recognition. An online training accuracy of 96.34 percent can be achieved given the measured
variability. We further demonstrate the optimization of inference-mode gate voltage considering
ferroelectric FET based neural network.
