Digital aberration measurement and removal play a prominent role in computational imaging platforms
aimed at achieving simple and compact optical arrangements. A recent important class of such platforms
is Fourier ptychography, which is geared towards efficiently creating gigapixel images with high
resolution and large field of view (FOV). In current FP implementations, pupil aberration is often
recovered at each small segment of the entire FOV. This reconstruction strategy fails to consider
the field-dependent nature of the optical pupil. Given the power series expansion of the wavefront
aberration, the spatially varying pupil can be fully characterized by tens of coefficients over
the entire FOV. With this observation, we report a Full-field Fourier Ptychography (FFP) scheme
for rapid and robust aberration metrology. The meaning of 'full-field' in FFP is referred to the
recovering of the 'full-field' coefficients that govern the field-dependent pupil over the entire
FOV. The optimization degrees of freedom are at least two orders of magnitude lower than the previous
implementations. We show that the image acquisition process of FFP can be completed in ~1s and the
spatially varying aberration of the entire FOV can be recovered in ~35s using a CPU. The reported
approach may facilitate the further development of Fourier ptychography. Since no moving part
or calibration target is needed in this approach, it may find important applications in aberration
metrology. The derivation of the full-field coefficients and its extension for Zernike modes also
provide a general tool for analyzing spatially varying aberrations in computational imaging systems.
