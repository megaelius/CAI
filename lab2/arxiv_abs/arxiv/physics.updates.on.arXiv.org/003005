The Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equations (LAD) may be the most commonly accepted equation describing
the motion of a classical charged particle in its electromagnetic field. However, it is well known
that they bare several problems. In particular, almost all solutions are dynamically unstable,
and therefore, highly questionable. The question remains whether better equations of motion than
LAD can be found to describe the dynamics of charges in the electromagnetic fields. In this paper
we present an approach to derive such equations of motions, taking as input the Maxwell equations
and a particular charge model only, similar to the model suggested by Dirac in his original derivation
of LAD in 1938. We present a candidate for new equations of motion for the case of a single charge. Our
approach is motivated by the observation that Dirac's derivation relies on an unjustified application
of Stokes' theorem and an equally unjustified Taylor expansion of terms in his evolution equations.
For this purpose, Dirac's calculation is repeated using an extended charge model that does allow
for the application of Stokes' theorem and enables us to find an explicit equation of motion by adapting
Parrott's derivation, thus avoiding a Taylor expansion. The result are second order differential
delay equations, which describe the radiation reaction force for the charge model at hand. Their
informal Taylor expansion in the radius of the charge model used in the paper reveals again the famous
triple dot term of LAD but provokes the mentioned dynamical instability by a mechanism we discuss
and, as the derived equations of motion are explicit, is unnecessary.
