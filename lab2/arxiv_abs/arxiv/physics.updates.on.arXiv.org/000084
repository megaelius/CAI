Searches for rare physics processes using particle detectors in high-luminosity colliding hadronic
beam environments require the use of multi-level trigger systems to reject colossal background
rates in real time. In analyses like the search for the Higgs boson, there is a need to maximize the
signal acceptance by combining multiple different trigger chains when forming the offline data
sample. In such statistically limited searches, datasets are often amassed over periods of several
years, during which the trigger characteristics evolve and system performance can vary significantly.
Reliable production cross-section measurements and upper limits must take into account a detailed
understanding of the effective trigger inefficiency for every selected candidate event. We present
as an example the complex situation of three trigger chains, based on missing energy and jet energy,
that were combined in the context of the search for the Higgs (H) boson produced in association with
a $W$ boson at the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). We briefly review the existing techniques
for combining triggers, namely the inclusion, division, and exclusion methods. We introduce and
describe a novel fourth in situ method whereby, for each candidate event, only the trigger chain
with the highest a priori probability of selecting the event is considered. We compare the inclusion
and novel in situ methods for signal event yields in the CDF $WH$ search. This new combination method,
by virtue of its scalability to large numbers of differing trigger chains and insensitivity to correlations
between triggers, will benefit future long-running collider experiments, including those currently
operating on the Large Hadron Collider.
