With excellent folding-induced deformability and shape reconfigurability, origami-based designs
have shown great potentials in developing deployable structures. Noting that origami deployment
is essentially a dynamic process, while its dynamical behaviors remain largely unexplored owing
to the challenges in modeling. This research aims at advancing the state of the art of origami deployable
structures by exploring the transient dynamics under free deployment, with the Miura-origami
tube being selected as the object of study because it possesses relatively simple geometry, exceptional
kinematic properties, and wide applications. In detail, a preliminary free deployment test is
performed, which indicates that the transient oscillation in the transverse direction is nonnegligible
and the tube deployment is no longer a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) mechanism. Based on experimental
observations, four assumptions are made for modeling purposes, and a 2N-DOF dynamic model is established
for an N-cell Miura-origami tube to predict the transient oscillations in both the deploying and
the transverse directions. Employing the settling times and the overshoot values as the transient
dynamic indexes, a comprehensive parameter study is then carried out. It reveals that both the physical
and geometrical parameters will significantly affect the transient deploying dynamics, with
some of the parameter dependence relationships being counter-intuitive. The results show that
the relationships between the transient dynamic behaviors and the examined parameters are sometimes
contradictory in the deploying and the transverse directions, suggesting the necessity of a compromise
in design.
