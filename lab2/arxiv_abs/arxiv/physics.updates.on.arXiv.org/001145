The goal of this study is to develop an efficient numerical algorithm applicable to a wide range of
compressible multicomponent flows. Although many highly efficient algorithms have been proposed
for simulating some particular special cases of such flows, a construction of universal solvers
is known to be challenging. Extreme cases, such as incompressible and highly compressible flows,
or inviscid and viscous flows, require different numerical treatments in order to maintain efficiency,
stability, and accuracy of the method. Linearized block implicit (LBI) factored schemes are known
to provide an efficient way of solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations implicitly, which
allows avoiding stability restrictions at low Mach number and high viscosity. However, their splitting
error has been shown to grow as the Mach number goes to zero and dominate physical fluxes. In this paper,
a splitting error reduction technique is proposed to solve the issue. A novel finite element shock-capturing
algorithm, proposed by Guermond and Popov, is reformulated in terms of finite differences, extended
to the stiffened gas equation of state (SG EOS) and combined with the LBI factored scheme to stabilize
the method around flow discontinuities at high Mach numbers. A novel stabilization term is proposed
for low Mach number applications. The resulting algorithm is shown to be efficient in both low and
high Mach number regimes. The algorithm is further extended to the multicomponent case using an
interface capturing strategy with surface tension as a continuous surface force. Special care
is taken to avoid spurious oscillations of pressure and generation of artificial acoustic waves
in the numerical mixture layer by including specific functions of the EOS parameters as flow variables.
Numerical tests are presented to verify the performance and stability properties for a wide range
of flows.
