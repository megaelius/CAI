Image processing techniques provide important assistance to physicians and relieve their workload
in different tasks. In particular, identifying objects of interest such as lesions and anatomical
structures from the image is a challenging and iterative process that can be done by computerized
approaches in a successful manner. Microaneurysms (MAs) detection is a crucial step in retinal
image analysis algorithms. The goal of MAs detection is to find the progress and at last identification
of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the retinal images. The objective of this study is to apply three
retinal vessel segmentation methods, Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG), Canny edge detector, and
Matched filter to compare results of MAs detection using a combination of unsupervised and supervised
learning either in the normal images or in the presence of DR. The steps for the algorithm are as following:
1) Preprocessing and Enhancement, 2) vessel segmentation and masking, 3) MAs detection and Localization
using a combination of Matching based approach and Convolutional Neural Networks. To evaluate
the accuracy of our proposed method, we compared the output of our method with the ground truth that
collected by ophthalmologists. By using the LoG vessel segmentation, our algorithm found a sensitivity
of more than 85% in the detection of MAs for 100 color images in a local retinal database and 40 images
of a public dataset (DRIVE). For the Canny vessel segmentation, our automated algorithm found a
sensitivity of more than 80% in the detection of MAs for all 140 images of two databases. And lastly,
using the Matched filter, our algorithm found a sensitivity of more than 87% in the detection of MAs
in both local and DRIVE datasets.
