Objective: Concurrent excitation and acquisition in MRI is a method to acquire MRI signal from tissues
with very short transverse relaxation time. Since transmit power is many orders of magnitude larger
than receive signal, a weak coupling dominates the MR signal during CEA. Thus, appropriate decoupling
between transmit and receive coils is required. In this study, two controllable decoupling designs
are investigated for achieving isolation between coils. Methods: A modified version of isolation
concept used in the full-duplex radios in communication systems is applied to acquire MRI signal
using CEA. In our new method, a small copy of RF transmit signal is attenuated and delayed to generate
the same coupling signal which is available in the receiver coil. Then it is subtracted from the receive
signal to detect the MRI signal. The proposed decoupling method is developed and implemented in
two designs: Semi-Automatic and Fully-Automatic Controllable Decoupling Designs. Results:
Using Semi-Automatic Controllable Decoupling Design, decoupling of more than 75 dB is achieved.
Fully-Automatic Controllable Decoupling Design provides more than 100 dB decoupling between
coils which is good enough for detecting MRI signals during excitation from tissues with very short
transverse relaxation time. Conclusion: This study shows feasibility of applying full duplex
electronics to decouple transmit and receive coils for CEA in a clinical MRI system. Significance:
These designs can automatically tune the cancellation circuit and it is a potential tool for recovering
signal from tissues with very short T2 in clinical MR systems with a minor hardware modification.
