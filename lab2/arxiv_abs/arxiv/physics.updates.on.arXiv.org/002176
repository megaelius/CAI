We report an experimental and numerical investigation of the fragmentation mechanisms of micrometer-sized
metal droplet irradiated by ultrashort laser pulses. The results of the experiment show that the
fast one-side heating of such a droplet may lead to either symmetric or asymmetric expansion followed
by different fragmentation scenarios. To unveil the underlying processes leading to fragmentation
we perform simulation of liquid-tin droplet expansion produced by the initial conditions similar
to those in experiment using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Simulation demonstrates
that a thin heated surface layer generates a ultrashort shock wave propagating from the frontal
side to rear side of the droplet. Convergence of such shock wave followed by a rarefaction tale to
the droplet center results in the cavitation of material inside the central region by the strong
tensile stress. Reflection of the shock wave from the rear side of droplet produces another region
of highly stretched material where the spallation may occur producing a thin spallation layer moving
with a velocity higher than expansion of the central shell after cavitation. It is shown both experimentally
and numerically that the threshold laser intensity necessary for the spallation is higher than
the threshold required to induce cavitation in the central region of droplet. Thus, the regime of
asymmetrical expansion is realized if the laser intensity exceeds the spallation threshold. The
transverse and longitudinal expansion velocities obtained in SPH simulations of different regimes
of expansion are agreed well with our experimental data.
