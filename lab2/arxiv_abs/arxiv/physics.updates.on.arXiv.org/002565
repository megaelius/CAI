Objective: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy can be used for non-invasive treatment
of kidney (renal) cancer, but the clinical outcomes have been variable. In this study, the efficacy
of renal HIFU therapy was studied using nonlinear acoustic and thermal simulations in three patients.
Methods: The acoustic simulations were conducted with and without refraction in order to investigate
its effect on the shape, size and pressure distribution at the focus. The values for the attenuation,
sound speed, perfusion and thermal conductivity of the kidney were varied over the reported ranges
to determine the effect of variability on heating. Furthermore, the phase aberration was studied
in order to quantify the underlying phase shifts using a second order polynomial function. Results:
The ultrasound field intensity was found to drop on average 11.1 dB with refraction and 6.4 dB without
refraction. Reflection at tissue interfaces was found to result in a loss less than 0.1 dB. Focal
point splitting due to refraction significantly reduced the heating efficacy. Perfusion did not
have a large effect on heating during short sonication durations. Small changes in temperature
were seen with varying attenuation and thermal conductivity, but no visible changes were present
with sound speed variations. The aberration study revealed an underlying trend in the spatial distribution
of the phase shifts. Conclusion: The results show that the efficacy of HIFU therapy in the kidney
could be improved with aberration correction. Significance: A method is proposed by which patient
specific pre-treatment calculations could be used to overcome the aberration and therefore make
ultrasound treatment possible.
