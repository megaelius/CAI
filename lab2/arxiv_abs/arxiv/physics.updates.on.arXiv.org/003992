Microfluidic systems are usually fabricated with soft materials that deform due to the fluid stresses.
The prediction and control of fluid flow inside these channels thus requires solving fluid-structure
interaction problems. Recent experimental and theoretical studies on the steady flow in shallow
deformable microchannels have shown that the flow rate is a nonlinear function of the pressure drop
due to the deformation of the upper wall. Here, we extend the steady theory of Christov et al. (J. Fluid
Mech. 841, 267-286, 2018) by considering the start-up flow from rest, both in pressure-controlled
and in flow-rate-controlled configurations. The characteristic scales and relevant parameters
governing the flow are first identified, followed by the development of an unsteady lubrication
theory assuming that the upper wall can be modeled as a plate under pure bending satisfying the Kirchhoff-Love
equation. The model is governed by three dimensionless numbers: a compliance parameter $\beta$,
which compares the characteristic displacement of the upper wall with the undeformed channel height,
a Womersley number $\alpha$, that compares the local inertia of the fluid with the viscous forces,
and a parameter $\gamma$ that compares the inertia of the solid with its bending stiffness. In the
limit of negligible solid and liquid inertia, $\alpha \to 0$ and $\gamma \to 0$, the fluid pressure
satisfies a nonlinear diffusion equation, with $\beta$ as the only parameter, which admits a self-similar
solution under pressure-controlled conditions. This simplified lubrication model is validated
with 3D numerical simulations of the full Navier and Navier-Stokes equations for the elastic wall
and the fluid, respectively. The agreement is very good when the hypotheses behind the model are
satisfied. Unexpectedly, we find fair agreement even in cases where the solid and liquid inertia
cannot be neglected.
