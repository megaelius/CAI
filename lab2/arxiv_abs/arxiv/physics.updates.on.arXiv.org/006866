The dependence of the diffusion MRI signal on the diffusion time $t$ is a hallmark of tissue microstructure
at the scale of the diffusion length. Here we measure the time-dependence of the mean diffusivity
$D(t)$ and mean kurtosis $K(t)$ in cortical gray matter and in 25 gray matter sub-regions, in 10 healthy
subjects. Significant diffusivity and kurtosis time-dependence is observed for $t=21.2$-100
ms, and is characterized by a power-law tail $\sim t^{-\vartheta}$ with dynamical exponent $\vartheta$.
To interpret our measurements, we systematize the relevant scenarios and mechanisms for diffusion
time-dependence in the brain. Using effective medium theory formalisms, we derive an exact relation
between the power-law tails in $D(t)$ and $K(t)$. The estimated power-law dynamical exponent $\vartheta\simeq1/2$
in both $D(t)$ and $K(t)$ is consistent with one-dimensional diffusion in the presence of randomly
positioned restrictions along neurites. We analyze the short-range disordered statistics of
synapses on axon collaterals in the cortex, and perform one-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations
of diffusion restricted by permeable barriers with a similar randomness in their placement, to
confirm the $\vartheta=1/2$ exponent. In contrast, the K\"arger model of exchange is less consistent
with the data since it does not capture the diffusivity time-dependence, and the estimated exchange
time from $K(t)$ falls below our measured $t$-range. Although we cannot exclude exchange as a contributing
factor, we argue that structural disorder along neurites is mainly responsible for the observed
time-dependence of diffusivity and kurtosis. Our observation and theoretical interpretation
of the $t^{-1/2}$ tail in $D(t)$ and $K(t)$ alltogether establish the sensitivity of a macroscopic
MRI signal to micrometer-scale structural heterogeneities along neurites in human gray matter
in vivo.
