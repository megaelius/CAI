Lipid interfaces not only compartmentalize but also connect different reaction centers within
a cell architecture. These interfaces have well defined specific heats and compressibilities,
hence energy can propagate along them analogous to sound waves. Lipid monolayers prepared at the
air-water interface of a Langmuir trough present an excellent model system to study such propagations.
Here we propose that recent observations of two-dimensional shock waves observed in lipid monolayers
also provide the evidence for the detonation of shock waves at such interfaces, i.e. chemical energy
stored in the interface can be absorbed by a propagating shock front reinforcing it in the process.
To this end, we apply the classical theory in shock waves and detonation in the context of a lipid interface
and its thermodynamic state. Based on these insights it is claimed that the observed self-sustaining
waves in lipid monolayers represent a detonation like phenomena that utilizes the latent heat of
phase transition of the lipids. However, the general nature of these equations allows that other
possible sources of chemical energy can contribute to the propagating shock wave in a similar manner.
Consequently, the understanding is applied to the nerve pulse propagation that is believed to represent
a similar phenomenon, to obtain a qualitative understanding of the pressure and temperature dependence
of amplitude and threshold for action potentials. While we mainly discuss the case of a stable detonation,
the problem of initiation of detonation at interfaces and corresponding heat exchange is briefly
discussed, which also suggests a role for thunder like phenomena in pulse initiation.
