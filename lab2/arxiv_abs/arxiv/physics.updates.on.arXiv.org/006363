We present a numerical study on the transverse flow-induced vibration (FIV) of an elastically mounted
sphere in the vicinity of a free surface at subcritical Reynolds numbers. To begin, We verify and
analyze the mode transitions and the motion trajectories of a fully submerged sphere vibrating
freely in all directions for the Reynolds number up to $30\,000$. Next, the response dynamics of
a transversely vibrating sphere is studied for three values of normalized immersion ratio ($h^*=h/D$,
where $h$ is the distance from the top of the sphere to undisturbed free-surface level and $D$ is the
sphere diameter), at $h^*=1$ (fully submerged sphere with no free-surface effect), $h^*=0$ (where
the top of the sphere touches the free surface) and $h^*=-0.25$ (where the sphere pierces the free
surface). At the lock-in range, we observe that the amplitude response at $h^*=0$ is decreased significantly
compared to the case at $h^*=1$. It is found that the vorticity flux is diffused due to the free-surface
boundary and the free surface acts as a sink of energy that leads to a reduction in the transverse force
and amplitude response. When the sphere pierces the free surface at $h^*=-0.25$, the amplitude
response at the lock-in state is found to be greater than all the submerged cases studied with the
maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of $\sim2D$. We find that the interaction of the piercing sphere
with the air-water interface causes a relatively large surface deformation and has a significant
impact on the synchronization of the vortex shedding and the vibration frequency. Increased streamwise
vorticity gives rise to a relatively larger transverse force to the piercing sphere at $h^*=-0.25$,
resulting in greater positive energy transfer per cycle to sustain the large-amplitude vibration.
Lasty, we study the sensitivity of FIV response on the mass ratio, $m^*$, and Froude number, $Fr$,
at the lock-in state.
