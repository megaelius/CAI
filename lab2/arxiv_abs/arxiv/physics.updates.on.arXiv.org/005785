We present a method to probe molecular and nanoparticle diffusion within thin, solvated polymer
coatings. The device exploits the confinement with well-defined geometry that forms at the interface
between a planar and a hemi-spherical surface (of which at least one is coated with polymers) in close
contact, and uses this confinement to analyse diffusion processes without interference of exchange
with and diffusion in the bulk solution. With this method, which we call plane-sphere confinement
microscopy (PSCM), information regarding the partitioning of molecules between the polymer coating
and the bulk liquid is also obtained. Thanks to the shape of the confined geometry, diffusion and
partitioning can be mapped as a function of compression and concentration of the coating in a single
experiment. The method is versatile and can be integrated with conventional optical microscopes,
and thus should find widespread use in the many application areas exploiting functional polymer
coatings. We demonstrate the use of PSCM using brushes of natively unfolded nucleoporin domains
rich in phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG domains). A meshwork of FG domains is known to be responsible
for the selective transport of nuclear transport receptors (NTR) and their macromolecular cargos
across the nuclear envelope that separates the cytosol and the nucleus of living cells. We find that
the selectivity of NTR uptake by FG domain films depends sensitively on FG domain concentration,
and that the interaction of NTRs with FG domains obstructs NTR movement only moderately. These observations
contribute important information to better understand the mechanisms of selective NTR transport.
