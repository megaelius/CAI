Statistical iterative reconstruction is expected to improve the image quality of megavoltage
computed tomography (MVCT). However, one of the challenges of iterative reconstruction is its
large computational cost. The purpose of this work is to develop a fast iterative reconstruction
algorithm by combining several iterative techniques and by optimizing reconstruction parameters.
Megavolt projection data was acquired from a TomoTherapy system and reconstructed using our statistical
iterative reconstruction. Total variation was used as the regularization term and the weight of
the regularization term was determined by evaluating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise
ratio (CNR), and visual assessment of spatial resolution using Gammex and Cheese phantoms. Gradient
decent with an adaptive convergence parameter, ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM),
and CPU/GPU parallelization were applied in order to accelerate the present reconstruction algorithm.
The SNR and CNR of the iterative reconstruction were several times better than that of filtered back
projection (FBP). The GPU parallelization code combined with the OSEM algorithm reconstructed
an image several hundred times faster than a CPU calculation. With 500 iterations, which provided
good convergence, our method produced a 512$\times$512 pixel image within a few seconds. The image
quality of the present algorithm was much better than that of FBP for patient data. An image from the
iterative reconstruction in TomoTherapy can be obtained within few seconds by fine-tuning the
parameters. The iterative reconstruction with GPU was fast enough for clinical use, and largely
improve the MVCT images.
