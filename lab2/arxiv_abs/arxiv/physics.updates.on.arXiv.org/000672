Landau damping/growing at boundary condition of excitation of a harmonic wave in collisionless
ion-electron plasma contradicts to the law of energy conservation of a wave damping/growing in
space. There is also no criterion of a choice damping or growing unphysical divergent solutions
unlike always non-damping in the direction of propagation Vlasov waves. Variety of other incongruities
as consequence of Landau damping is specified also. Absence of explicit positivity and finiteness
of wave solutions for electron distribution function near singularity point leads to need of imposing
additional cutting off constraints with resulting positivity and finiteness of the electron distribution
function at the singularity points and finiteness of the complex dispersion integral. Landau damping
as a real physical phenomenon of collisionless damping does not exist. A relation is established
for the real dispersion equation with real waves (see Appendices 2,4) between the averaged over
period wave damping decrement and the collision energy-exchange term of kinetic equation. Collisionless
Vlasov-Landau damping is explained finally by the usual inadequate using mathematically correct
results of transformations the nonlinear complex expressions. All used solution of the complex
dispersion equation for the simultaneously existing collisionless exponentially damping and
growing nonlinear complex waves is entirely, quantitatively and in its sense, different from the
solution of initially real dispersion equation for real either damping or growing waves and should
be discarded (see Appendices 2,4,5,6). Collisionless damping is caused by unreasonable use of
wave functions with complex frequency or complex wave number. All it transfers finding roots of
the complex dispersion equation to the field of only abstract mathematical interest.
