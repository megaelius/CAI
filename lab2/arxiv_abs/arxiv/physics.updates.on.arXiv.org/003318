Electromagnetics has an important role to play in solving the next generation of geoscience problems.
These problems are multidisciplinary, complex, and require collaboration. This is especially
true at the base scientific level where the underlying physical equations need to be solved, and
data, associated with physical experiments, need to be inverted. In this paper, we present arguments
for adopting an open-source methodology for geophysics and provide some background about open-source
software for electromagnetics. Immediate benefits are the reduced time required to carry out research,
being able to collaborate, having reproducible results, and being able to disseminate results
quickly. To illustrate the use of an open-source methodology in electromagnetics, we present two
challenges. The first is to simulate data from a time domain airborne system over a conductive plate
buried in a more resistive earth. The second is to jointly invert airborne TDEM and FDEM data with
ground TDEM. SimPEG, Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics, (https://simpeg.xyz)
is used for the open-source software. The figures in this paper can be reproduced by downloading
the Jupyter Notebooks we provide with this paper (https://github.com/simpeg-research/oldenburg-2018-AEM).
Access to the source code allows the researcher to explore the simulations and inversions by changing
model and inversion parameters, plot fields and fluxes to gain further insight about the EM phenomena,
and solve a new research problem by using open-source software as a base. By providing results in
a manner that allows others to reproduce, further explore, and even extend them, we hope to demonstrate
that an open-source paradigm has the potential to enable more rapid progress of the geophysics community
as a whole.
