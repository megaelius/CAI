It has recently been claimed by Baccini and coauthors that due to ANVUR's bibliometric evaluations
of individuals, departments, and universities, in Italy there has been a surge in self-citations
in the last ten years, thus increasing the "inwardness" of Italian research more than has happened
abroad. We have studied the database of Ioannidis et al. published on 12 August 2019 of the one hundred
thousand most "highly cited" scientists, including about two thousand Italians, and we found that
the problem of self-citations in relation to this scientific elite is not significant in Italy,
while perhaps observing a small deviation in the low scores in the rankings. The effect indicated
by Baccini et al. consequently, does not seem worrying for the scientific elite (we quantified it
in 2 percent of the total of scientists of the "best" one hundred thousand), and is probably largely
concentrated in the further less cited scientists. Evaluation agencies like ANVUR should probably
exclude self-citations in future evaluations, for the noise introduced by the young researchers.
The overall state of health of the Italian research system and the positive effect of the ANVUR assessments
are demonstrated by the number of Italian researchers in the top one hundred thousand, which has
increased by comparing the "career" databased of 22 years, with that of the "young" researchers
in the "2017" database. Italy, looking at the elite researchers, not only is not the most indulgent
in self-citations, but has shown the best improvements, proving that the introduction of ANVUR
had a positive effect. Indeed, all countries apart from Italy have suffered a decline, even substantial
(-20 percent on a national Japan scale), of the number of researchers present in the 2017 data sets
compared to career data. Italy instead shows a +0.2 percent on a global basis and an impressive +11.53
percent on a national basis.
