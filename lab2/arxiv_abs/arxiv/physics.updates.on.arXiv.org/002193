Data-driven methods for improving turbulence modeling in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)
simulations have gained significant interest in the computational fluid dynamics community.
Modern machine learning models have opened up a new area of black-box turbulence models allowing
for the tuning of RANS simulations to increase their predictive accuracy. While several data-driven
turbulence models have been reported, the quantification of the uncertainties introduced has
mostly been neglected. Uncertainty quantification for such data-driven models is essential since
their predictive capability rapidly declines as they are tested for flow physics that deviate from
that in the training data. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven framework that not only improves
RANS predictions but also provides probabilistic bounds for fluid quantities such as velocity
and pressure. The uncertainties capture include both model form uncertainty as well as epistemic
uncertainty induced by the limited training data. An invariant Bayesian deep neural network is
used to predict the anisotropic tensor component of the Reynolds stress. This model is trained using
Stein's variational gradient decent algorithm. The computed uncertainty on the Reynolds stress
is propagated to the quantities of interest by vanilla Monte Carlo simulation. Results are presented
for two test cases that differ geometrically from the training flows at several different Reynolds
numbers. The prediction enhancement of the data-driven model is discussed as well as the associated
probabilistic bounds for flow properties of interest. Ultimately this framework allows for a quantitative
measurement of model confidence and uncertainty quantification for flows in which no high-fidelity
observations or prior knowledge is available.
