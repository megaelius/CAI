Finite-temperature effects can be included by calculating the vibrations properties and this
can greatly improve the fidelity of computational screening. An important challenge for DFT-based
screening is the sensitivity of the predictions to the choice of the exchange correlation function.
In this work, we rigorously explore the sensitivity of finite temperature thermodynamic properties
to the choice of the exchange correlation functional using the built-in error estimation capabilities
within the Bayesian Error Estimation Functional. The vibrational properties are estimated using
the Debye model and we quantify the uncertainty associated with finite-temperature properties
for a diverse collection of materials. We find good agreement with experiment and small spread in
predictions over different exchange correlation functionals for Mg, Al$_2$O$_3$, Al, Ca, and
GaAs. In the case of Li, Li$_2$O, and NiO, however, we find a large spread in predictions as well as
disagreement between experiment and functionals due to complex bonding environments. While the
energetics generated by BEEF-vdW ensemble is typically normal, the complex mapping through the
Debye model leads to the derived finite temperature properties having non-Gaussian behavior.
We test a wide variety of probability distributions that best represent the finite temperature
distribution and find that properties such as specific heat, Gibbs free energy, entropy, and the
thermal expansion coefficient are well described by normal or transformed normal distributions,
while the prediction spread of volume at a given temperature does not appear to be drawn from a single
distribution.
