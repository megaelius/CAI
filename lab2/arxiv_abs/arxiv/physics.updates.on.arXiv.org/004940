Tellurium allows attaining heavy n-type doping levels in GaAs, which is suited to achieve very low
contact resistivities in solar cells. Besides, it modifies the energy bandgap of MOVPE-grown GaInP
by reducing the group-III sublattice ordering and presents a strong memory effect which induces
residual n-type doping in subsequent layers, potentially detrimental to the performance of the
solar cell. In this work, we present an inverted rear-heterojunction GaInP solar cell that employs
a thick Te-doped GaInP layer as absorber, with a doping profile obtained exclusively by controlling
the memory effect of Te coming from the preceding growth of a heavily doped GaAs contact layer. In
this way, GaInP is partially disordered with the use of no additional surfactant, leading to an increase
in the solar cell bandgap of around 35 meV as compared to traditional samples doped with silicon.
In the proof-of-concept experimental devices developed so far, the use of a rear-heterojunction
configuration and the bandgap increase results in a global open-circuit voltage enhancement of
109 mV. The photocurrent decreases by 1.32 mA/cm2, mostly due to the bandgap blue-shift, with about
0.35 mA/cm2 attributable to lower carrier collection efficiencies. These preliminary results
are discussed by analyzing the I-V curve parameters and quantum efficiencies of a Te-doped rear-heterojunction,
a Si-doped rear-heterojunction and a Si-doped front-junction solar cell. An additional advantage
is that the emitter sheet resistance is reduced from 551 to 147 ohms/sq, which offers potential for
higher efficiencies through lower front grid shadowing factors, as demonstrated with the concentrator
measurements presented.
