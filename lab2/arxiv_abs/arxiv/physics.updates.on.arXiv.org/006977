Industrial dynamical systems often exhibit multi-scale response due to material heterogeneities,
operation conditions and complex environmental loadings. In such problems, it is the case that
the smallest length-scale of the systems dynamics controls the numerical resolution required
to effectively resolve the embedded physics. In practice however, high numerical resolutions
is only required in a confined region of the system where fast dynamics or localized material variability
are exhibited, whereas a coarser discretization can be sufficient in the rest majority of the system.
To this end, a unified computational scheme with uniform spatio-temporal resolutions for uncertainty
quantification can be very computationally demanding. Partitioning the complex dynamical system
into smaller easier-to-solve problems based of the localized dynamics and material variability
can reduce the overall computational cost. However, identifying the region of interest for high-resolution
and intensive uncertainty quantification can be a problem dependent. The region of interest can
be specified based on the localization features of the solution, user interest, and correlation
length of the random material properties. For problems where a region of interest is not evident,
Bayesian inference can provide a feasible solution. In this work, we employ a Bayesian framework
to update our prior knowledge on the localized region of interest using measurements and system
response. To address the computational cost of the Bayesian inference, we construct a Gaussian
process surrogate for the forward model. Once, the localized region of interest is identified,
we use polynomial chaos expansion to propagate the localization uncertainty. We demonstrate our
framework through numerical experiments on a three-dimensional elastodynamic problem.
