Optical frequency comb synthesizers (FCs) [1] are laser sources covering a broad spectral range
with a number of discrete, equally spaced and highly coherent frequency components, fully controlled
through only two parameters: the frequency separation between adjacent modes and the carrier offset
frequency. Providing a phase-coherent link between the optical and the microwave/radio-frequency
regions [2], FCs have become groundbreaking tools for precision measurements[3,4]. Despite these
inherent advantages, developing miniaturized comb sources across the whole infrared (IR), with
an independent and simultaneous control of the two comb degrees of freedom at a metrological level,
has not been possible, so far. Recently, promising results have been obtained with compact sources,
namely diode-laser-pumped microresonators [5,6] and quantum cascade lasers (QCL-combs) [7,8].
While both these sources rely on four-wave mixing (FWM) to generate comb frequency patterns, QCL-combs
benefit from a mm-scale miniaturized footprint, combined with an ad-hoc tailoring of the spectral
emission in the 3-250 {\mu}m range, by quantum engineering [9]. Here, we demonstrate full stabilization
and control of the two key parameters of a QCL-comb against the primary frequency standard. Our technique,
here applied to a far-IR emitter and open ended to other spectral windows, enables Hz-level narrowing
of the individual comb modes, and metrological-grade tuning of their individual frequencies,
which are simultaneously measured with an accuracy of 2x10^-12, limited by the frequency reference
used. These fully-controlled, frequency-scalable, ultra-compact comb emitters promise to pervade
an increasing number of mid- and far-IR applications, including quantum technologies, due to the
quantum nature of the gain media [10].
