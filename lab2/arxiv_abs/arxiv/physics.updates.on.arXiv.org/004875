Mechanical heart valve replacement is the preferred alternative in younger patients with severe
symptomatic aortic valve disease. However, thrombus and pannus formations are common complications
associated with bileaflet mechanical heart valves. This leads to risks of valve leaflet dysfunction,
a life threatening event. In this experimental study, we investigate, using time resolved planar
particle image velocimetry, the flow characteristics in the ascending aorta in the presence of
a dysfunctional bileaflet mechanical heart valve. Several configurations of leaflet dysfunction
are investigated and the induced flow disturbances in terms of velocity fields, viscous energy
dissipation, wall shear stress, and accumulation of viscous shear stresses are evaluated. We also
explore the ability of a new set of parameters, solely based on the analysis of the normalized axial
velocity profiles in the ascending aorta, to detect bileaflet mechanical heart valve dysfunction
and differentiate between the different configurations tested in this study. Our results show
that a bileaflet mechanical heart valve dysfunction leads to a complex spectrum of flow disturbances
with each flow characteristic evaluated having its own worst case scenario in terms of dysfunction
configuration. We also show that the suggested approach based on the analysis of the normalized
axial velocity profiles in the ascending aorta has the potential to clearly discriminate not only
between normal and dysfunctional bilealfet heart valves but also between the different leaflet
dysfunction configurations. This approach could be easily implemented using phase contrast MRI
to follow up patients with bileaflet mechanical heart valves.
