When the heat released by a flame is sufficiently in phase with the acoustic pressure, a self-excited
thermoacoustic oscillation can arise. These nonlinear oscillations are one of the biggest challenges
faced in the design of safe and reliable gas turbines and rocket motors. In the worst-case scenario,
uncontrolled thermoacoustic oscillations can shake an engine apart. Reduced-order thermoacoustic
models, which are nonlinear and time-delayed, can only qualitatively predict thermoacoustic
oscillations. To make reduced-order models quantitatively predictive, we develop a data assimilation
framework for state estimation. We numerically estimate the most likely nonlinear state of a Galerkin-discretized
time delayed model of a horizontal Rijke tube, which is a prototypical combustor. Data assimilation
is an optimal blending of observations with previous state estimates (background) to produce optimal
initial conditions. A cost functional is defined to measure the statistical distance between the
model output and the measurements from experiments; and the distance between the initial conditions
and the background knowledge. Its minimum corresponds to the optimal state, which is computed by
Lagrangian optimization with the aid of adjoint equations. We study the influence of the number
of Galerkin modes, which are the natural acoustic modes of the duct, with which the model is discretized.
We show that decomposing the measured pressure signal in a finite number of modes is an effective
way to enhance state estimation, especially when nonlinear modal interactions occur during the
assimilation window. This work represents the first application of data assimilation to nonlinear
thermoacoustics, which opens up new possibilities for real-time calibration of reduced-order
models with experimental measurements.
