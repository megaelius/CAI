Over the past decades, several computer codes were developed for simulation and analysis of thermal-hydraulics
of system behaviors in nuclear reactors under operating, abnormal transient and accident conditions.
However, simulation errors and uncertainties still inevitably exist even while these codes have
been extensively assessed and used to support design, licensing, and safety analysis of nuclear
power plants. In this work, a data-driven framework (Optimal Mesh/Model Information System, OMIS)
for the optimization of mesh and model in system-level thermal-hydraulic simulation is formulated
and demonstrated. The OMIS framework is developed to estimate simulation error and suggest optimal
selection of coarse mesh size and models for computationally efficient low-fidelity simulation,
such as coarse-mesh Computational Fluid Dynamics-like (CFD-like) codes, to achieve accuracy
comparable to that of high-fidelity simulation, such as high-resolution CFD. It takes advantages
of computational efficiency of coarse-mesh simulation codes and regression capability of machine
learning algorithms. A cluster of case running are performed to obtain the error database between
low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. The error database is used to train a machine learning model
and find the relationship between local simulation error and local physical features, then generate
insight and help correct low-fidelity simulations for similar physical conditions. Specific
closure models, local mesh sizes and numerical solvers are treated as an integrated model that is
used to identify the local similarities in different global physical conditions. OMIS framework
is completed as a six-step procedure; each step is independent and accomplished with methods and
algorithms in the state of the art. A mixed convection case study was designed and performed to illustrate
the entire framework.
