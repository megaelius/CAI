Understanding the origin, nature, and functional significance of complex patterns of neural activity,
as recorded by diverse electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques, is a central challenge
in neuroscience. Such patterns include collective oscillations emerging out of neural synchronization
as well as highly heterogeneous outbursts of activity interspersed by periods of quiescence, called
"neuronal avalanches." Much debate has been generated about the possible scale invariance or criticality
of such avalanches and its relevance for brain function. Aimed at shedding light onto this, here
we analyze the large-scale collective properties of the cortex by using a mesoscopic approach following
the principle of parsimony of Landau-Ginzburg. Our model is similar to that of Wilson-Cowan for
neural dynamics but crucially, includes stochasticity and space; synaptic plasticity and inhibition
are considered as possible regulatory mechanisms. Detailed analyses uncover a phase diagram including
down-state, synchronous, asynchronous, and up-state phases and reveal that empirical findings
for neuronal avalanches are consistently reproduced by tuning our model to the edge of synchronization.
This reveals that the putative criticality of cortical dynamics does not correspond to a quiescent-to-active
phase transition as usually assumed in theoretical approaches but to a synchronization phase transition,
at which incipient oscillations and scale-free avalanches coexist. Furthermore, our model also
accounts for up and down states as they occur (e.g., during deep sleep). This approach constitutes
a framework to rationalize the possible collective phases and phase transitions of cortical networks
in simple terms, thus helping to shed light on basic aspects of brain functioning from a very broad
perspective.
