Introspection into the classical and quantum mechanical analyses reveals that the essential consideration
for seamlessly bridging the two is to optimize the relaxation loss in the field-particle interaction
on classically defined stationary action paths. This study thus points out that the Lagrangian
dynamics though considers stationary action ignores the optimum power loss criterion in the interactive
negotiation for the dynamic passage. Taking the radiation loss optimization as the additional
criterion in the accelerated motion of a charged particle it is shown that the dynamics is necessarily
executed by a family of nonlocally entangled paths. In the coherent entanglement the paths unitarily
evolves in space-time conserving the instant energy and momentum integrally over the volume. The
evolution dictates quantized energy and momentum, and defines the rationale behind decoherence
with radiation relaxation. Under the sustained interaction the nonlocal field incessantly attempt
defending the unitary evolutions at the cost of the relaxation loss from the external field. The
nonlocally mediated electrodynamics is free of issues like acceleration runaway in the decohered
interaction of moving charge with external field, where relaxation occurs both in ordered (Larmor
radiation) and disordered (thermal radiation) forms, the latter generally being insignificant
in proportion. The thermal relaxation rate is shown to be akin to that in Hawking-Unruh radiations.
The classically derived formulation proves its versatility in revealing all the nonlocal characteristics
of the micro-world and more. It reveals the nonlocal interplay in setting the signal speed limit,
the nonlocal entanglement limit and the disentanglement mechanism. It provides the estimates
of macroscopic and cosmic phenomena.
