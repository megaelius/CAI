We present a simple and computationally efficient coarse-grained and solvent-free model for simulating
lipid bilayer membranes. In order to be used in concert with particle-based reaction-diffusion
simulations, the model is purely based on interacting and reacting particles, each representing
a coarse patch of a lipid monolayer. Particle interactions include nearest-neighbor bond-stretching
and angle-bending, and are parameterized so as to reproduce the local membrane mechanics given
by the Helfrich energy density over a range of relevant curvatures. In-plane fluidity is implemented
with Monte Carlo bond-flipping moves. The physical accuracy of the model is verified by four tests:
(i) Power spectrum analysis of equilibrium thermal undulations is used to verify that the particle-based
representation correctly captures the dynamics predicted by the continuum model of fluid membranes.
(ii) It is verified that the input bending stiffness, against which the potential parameters are
optimized, is accurately recovered. (iii) Simulation of two-dimensional shear flow under a gravity
force is employed to measure the effective in-plane viscosity of the membrane model, and show the
possibility of modeling membranes with specified viscosities. (iv) Interaction of the bilayer
membrane with a spherical nanoparticle is modeled as a test case for large membrane deformations
and budding involved in cellular processes such as endocytosis. The results are shown to coincide
well with the predicted behavior of continuum models, and the membrane model successfully mimics
the expected budding behavior. We expect our model to be of high practical usability for ultra coarse-grained
molecular dynamics or particle-based reaction-diffusion simulations of biological systems.
