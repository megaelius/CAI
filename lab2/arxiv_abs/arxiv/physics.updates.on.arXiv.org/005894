The concept of time series irreversibility -- the degree by which the statistics of signals are not
invariant under time reversal -- naturally appears in non-equilibrium physics in stationary systems
which operate away from equilibrium and produce entropy. This concept has not been explored to date
in the realm of musical scores as these are typically short sequences whose time reversibility estimation
could suffer from strong finite size effects which preclude interpretability. Here we show that
the so-called Horizontal Visibility Graph method -- which recently was shown to quantify such statistical
property even in non-stationary signals -- is a method that can estimate time reversibility of short
symbolic sequences, thus unlocking the possibility of exploring such properties in the context
of musical compositions. Accordingly, we analyse over 8000 musical pieces ranging from the Renaissance
to the early Modern period and certify that, indeed, most of them display clear signatures of time
irreversibility. Since by construction stochastic processes with a linear correlation structure
(such as 1/f noise) are time reversible, we conclude that musical compositions have a considerably
richer structure, that goes beyond the traditional properties retrieved by the power spectrum
or similar approaches. We also show that musical compositions display strong signs of nonlinear
correlations, that nonlinearity is correlated to irreversibility, and that these are also related
to asymmetries in the abundance of musical intervals, which we associate to the narrative underpinning
a musical composition. These findings provide tools for the study of musical periods and composers,
as well as criteria related to music appreciation and cognition.
