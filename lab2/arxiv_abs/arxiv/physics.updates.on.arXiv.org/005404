The kinetics of MgO$^+$ + CH$_4$ was studied experimentally using the variable ion source, temperature
adjustable selected ion flow tube (VISTA-SIFT) apparatus from 300 $-$ 600 K and computationally
by running and analyzing reactive atomistic simulations. Rates and product branching fractions
were determined as a function of temperature. The reaction proceeded with a rate of $k = 5.9 \pm 1.5
10^{-10}(T/300 $ K$)^{-0.5 \pm 0.2}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$. MgOH$^+$ was the dominant product at all
temperatures, but Mg$^+$, the co-product of oxygen-atom transfer to form methanol, was observed
with a product branching fraction of $0.08 \pm 0.03 (T / 300 $ K$)^{-0.8 \pm 0.7}$. Reactive molecular
dynamics simulations using a reactive force field, as well as a neural network yield rate coefficients
about one order of magnitude lower. This underestimation of the rates is traced back to the multireference
character of the transition state [MgOCH$_4$]$^+$. Statistical modeling of the temperature-dependent
kinetics provides further insight into the reactive potential surface. The rate limiting step
was found to be consistent with a four-centered activation of the C-H bond, consistent with previous
calculations. The product branching was modeled as a competition between dissociation of an insertion
intermediate directly after the rate-limiting transition state, and traversing a transition
state corresponding to a methyl migration leading to a Mg-CH$_3$OH$^+$ complex, though only if
this transition state is stabilized significantly relative to the dissociated MgOH$^+$ + CH$_3$
product channel. An alternative non-statistical mechanism is discussed, whereby a post-transition
state bifurcation in the potential surface could allow the reaction to proceed directly from the
four-centered TS to the Mg-CH$_3$OH$^+$ complex thereby allowing a more robust competition between
the product channels.
