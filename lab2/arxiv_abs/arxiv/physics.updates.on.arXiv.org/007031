Identifying the source of the material within coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and understanding
CME onset mechanisms are fundamental issues in solar and space physics. Parameters relating to
plasma composition, such as charge states and He abundance (\ahe), may be different for plasmas
originating from differing processes or regions on the Sun. Thus, it is crucial to examine the relationship
between in-situ measurements of CME composition and activity on the Sun. We study the CME that erupted
on 2014 September 10, in association with an X1.6 flare, by analyzing AIA imaging and IRIS spectroscopic
observations and its in-situ signatures detected by Wind and ACE. We find that during the slow expansion
and intensity increase of the sigmoid, plasma temperatures of 9 MK, and higher, first appear at the
footpoints of the sigmoid, associated with chromospheric brightening. Then the high-temperature
region extends along the sigmoid. IRIS observations confirm that this extension is caused by transportation
of hot plasma upflow. Our results show that chromospheric material can be heated to 9 MK, and above,
by chromospheric evaporation at the sigmoid footpoints before flare onset. The heated chromospheric
material can transport into the sigmoidal structure and supply mass to the CME. The aforementioned
CME mass supply scenario provides a reasonable explanation for the detection of high charge states
and elevated \ahe\ in the associated ICME. The observations also demonstrate that the quasi-steady
evolution in the precursor phase is dominated by magnetic reconnection between the rising flux
rope and the overlying magnetic field structure.
