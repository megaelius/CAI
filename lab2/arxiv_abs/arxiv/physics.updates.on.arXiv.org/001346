Modification of nuclear reactions due to impurities in plasma is investigated. The hindering effect
of Coulomb repulsion between reacting particles, that is effective in direct reactions, can practically
disappear if Coulomb interaction of the reacting particles with impurities embedded in plasma
is taken into account. The change of the wavefunction of reacting particles in nuclear range due
to their Coulomb interaction with impurity is determined using standard time independent perturbation
calculation of quantum mechanics. The result can be interpreted as if a slow, quasi-free particle
(e.g. a proton) were pushed by a heavy, assisting particle (impurity) of the surroundings and can
get (virtually) such a great magnitude of momentum which significantly increases the nuclear contact
probability density and also the probability of its capture by an other nucleus. As a sample reaction
the process, called impurity assisted nuclear $% pd$ reaction is investigated and the rate and power
densities produced by the reaction are numerically calculated. With the aid of astrophysical factors
the rate and power densities of the impurity assisted $% d(d,n)_{2}^{3}He$, $d(d,p)t$, $d(t,n)_{2}^{4}He$,
$_{2}^{3}He(d,p)_{2}^{4}He$% , $_{3}^{6}Li(p,\alpha )_{2}^{3}He$, $_{3}^{7}Li(p,\alpha
)_{2}^{4}He$, $%_{4}^{9}Be(p,\alpha )_{3}^{6}Li$, $_{4}^{9}Be(p,d)_{4}^{8}Be$, $%_{4}^{9}Be(\alpha
,n)_{6}^{12}C$, $_{5}^{10}B(p,\alpha )_{4}^{7}Be$ and $%_{5}^{11}B(p,\alpha )_{4}^{8}Be$
reactions are also estimated. The affect of plasma-wall interaction on the process is also considered.
A partial survey of impurity assisted nuclear reactions which may have practical importance in
energy production is also presented.
