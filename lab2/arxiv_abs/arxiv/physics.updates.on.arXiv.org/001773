Domain wall probes (DW-probes) were custom-made by modifying standard commercial magnetic force
microscopy (MFM) probes using focused ion beam lithography. Excess of magnetic coating from the
probes was milled out, leaving a V-shaped nanostructure on one face of the probe apex. Owing to the
nanostructure's shape anisotropy, such probe has four possible magnetic states depending on the
direction of the magnetization along each arm of the V-shape. Two states of opposite polarity are
characterised by the presence of a geometrically constrained DW, pinned at the corner of the V-shape
nanostructure. In the other two states, the magnetization curls around the corner with opposite
chirality. Electron holography studies, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrate that
a strong stray field emanates from the pinned DW, whilst a much weaker stray field is generated by
the curling configurations. Using in situ MFM, we show that the magnetization states of the DW-probe
can be easily controlled by applying an external magnetic field, thereby demonstrating that this
type of probe can be used as a switchable tool with a low or high stray field intensity. We demonstrate
that DW-probes enable acquiring magnetic images with a negligible interference with the sample
magnetization, similar to that of commercial low moment probes, but with a higher magnetic contrast.
In addition, the DW-probe in the curl state provides complementary information about the in-plane
component of the sample's magnetization, which is not achievable by standard methods and provides
additional information about the stray fields, e.g. as when imaging DWs.
