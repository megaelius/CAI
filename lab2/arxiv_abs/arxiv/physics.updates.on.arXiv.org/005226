We analyzed properties of waves excited by mildly relativistic electron beams propagating along
magnetic field with a ring-shape perpendicular momentum distribution in neutral and current-free
solar coronal plasmas. These plasmas are subject to both the beam and the electron cyclotron maser
(ECM) instabilities driven by the positive momentum gradient of the ring-beam electron distribution
in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, respectively. To explore
the related kinetic processes self-consistently, 2.5-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell
(PIC) simulations were carried out. To quantify excited wave properties in different coronal conditions,
we investigated the dependence of their energy and polarization on the ring-beam electron density
and magnetic field. In general, electrostatic waves dominate the energetics of waves and nonlinear
waves are ubiquitous. In weakly magnetized plasmas, where the electron cyclotron frequency $\omega_{ce}$
is lower than the electron plasma frequency $\omega_{pe}$, it is difficult to produce escaping
electromagnetic waves with frequency $\omega > \omega_{pe}$ and small refractive index $|c k /
\omega| < 1$ ($k$ and $c$ are the wavenumber and the light speed, respectively). Highly polarized
and anisotropic escaping electromagnetic waves can, however, be effectively excited in strongly
magnetized plasmas with $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe} \geq 1$. The anisotropy of the energy, circular
polarization degree (CPD), and spectrogram of these escaping electromagnetic waves strongly
depend on the number density ratio of the ring-beam electrons to the background electrons. In particular,
their CPDs can vary from left-handed to right-handed with the decrease of the ring-beam density,
which may explain some observed properties of solar radio bursts (e.g., radio spikes) from the solar
corona.
