Advances in hyperspectral imaging modes including electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) bring forth the challenges of exploratory and
subsequently physics-based analysis of multidimensional data sets. The (by now common) multivariate
unsupervised linear unmixing methods and their nonlinear analogs generally explore similarities
in the energy dimension but ignore correlations in the spatial domain. At the same time, Gaussian
process (GP) methods that explicitly incorporate spatial correlations in the form of kernel functions
tend to be extremely computationally intensive, while the use of inducing point-based sparse methods
often leads to reconstruction artefacts. Here, we suggest and implement a parallel GP method operating
on the full spatial domain and reduced representations in the energy domain. In this parallel GP,
the information between the components is shared via a common spatial kernel structure while allowing
for variability in the relative noise magnitude or image morphology. We explore the role of common
spatial structures and kernel constraints on the quality of the reconstruction and suggest an approach
for estimating these factors from the experimental data. Application of this method to an example
EELS dataset demonstrates that spatial information contained in higher-order components can
be reconstructed and spatially localized. This approach can be further applied to other hyperspectral
and multimodal imaging modes. The notebooks developed in this manuscript are freely available
