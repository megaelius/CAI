Cloud detection is the first step of any complex satellite-based cloud retrieval. No instrument
detects all clouds, and analyses that use a given satellite climatology can only discuss a specific
subset of clouds. We attempt to clarify which subsets of clouds are detected in a robust way by passive
sensors, and which require active sensors. To do so, we identify where retrievals of Cloud Amounts
(CAs), based on numerous sensors and algorithms, differ the most. We investigate large uncertainties,
and confront retrievals from the CALIOP lidar, which detects semitransparent clouds and directly
measures their vertical distribution, whatever the surface below. We document the cloud vertical
distribution, opacity and seasonal variability where CAs from passive sensors disagree most.
CALIOP CAs are larger than the passive average by +0.05 (AM) and +0.07 (PM). Over land, the +0.1 average
difference rises to +0.2 over the African desert, Antarctica and Greenland, where large passive
disagreements are traced to unfavorable surface conditions. Over oceans, CALIOP retrievals are
closer to the average of passive retrievals except over the ITCZ (+0.1). Passive CAs disagree more
in tropical areas associated with large-scale subsidence, where CALIOP observes a specific multi-layer
cloud population: optically thin, high-level clouds and opaque (z>7km), shallow boundary layer
clouds (z<2km). We evaluate the CA and cloud vertical distribution from 8 General Circulation Models
where passive retrievals disagree and CALIOP provides new information. We find that modeled clouds
are not more realistic where cloud detections from passive observations have long been robust,
than where active sensors provide more reliable information.
