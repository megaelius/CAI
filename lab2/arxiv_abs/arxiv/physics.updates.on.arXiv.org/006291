Detection of Barrett's esophagus (BE) at points of care outside the endoscopy suite may improve
screening access and reduce esophageal adenocarcinoma mortality. Tethered capsule optical coherence
tomography (OCT) can volumetrically image esophageal mucosa and detect BE in unsedated patients.
We investigated ultrahigh-speed tethered capsule, swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) in unsedated patients,
improved device design, developed procedural techniques, measured how capsule contact and longitudinal
pullback non-uniformity affect coverage, and assessed patient toleration. OCT was performed
in 16 patients prior to endoscopic surveillance/treatment. Unsedated patients swallowed the
capsule with small sips of water and the esophagus imaged by retracting the tether. Ultrahigh-speed
SS-OCT at 1,000,000 A-scans/second imaged ~40cm$^2$ esophageal areas in 10 seconds with 30um transverse
and 8um axial resolution. Nine patients had non-dysplastic BE, 3 had ablative treatment-naive
neoplasia, and 4 had prior ablation for history of dysplasia. The capsule procedure was well tolerated.
Ultrahigh-speed SS-OCT enabled the generation of cross-sectional and sub-surface en face images.
BE could be rapidly identified in cross-sectional and en face images, while assessment of the gastro-esophageal
junction (GEJ) required subsurface en face views. Capsule esophageal contact was worse in long-segment
BE and sliding hiatal hernia, and longitudinal image coverage was worse in short-segment BE. OCT
candidate features of dysplasia are reported. Ultrahigh-speed tethered capsule SS-OCT enabled
en face and cross-sectional imaging of mucosal features over wide areas. Device and procedure optimization
led to improved imaging performance. Areas of BE could be readily identified, but limited capsule
contact and longitudinal image coverage can yield sampling errors.
