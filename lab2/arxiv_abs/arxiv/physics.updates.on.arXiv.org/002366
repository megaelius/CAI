We numerically examine solutal convection in porous media, driven by the dissolution of carbon
dioxide (CO2) into water---an effective mechanism for CO2 storage in saline aquifers. Dissolution
is associated with slow diffusion of free-phase CO2 into the underlying aqueous phase followed
by density-driven convective mixing of CO2 throughout the water-saturated layer. We study the
fluid dynamics of CO2 convection in the single aqueous-phase region. A comparison is made between
two different boundary conditions in the top of the formation: (i) a constant, maximum aqueous-phase
concentration of CO2, and (ii) a constant, low injection-rate of CO2, such that all CO2 dissolves
instantly and the system remains in single phase. The latter model is found to involve a nonlinear
evolution of CO2 composition and associated aqueous-phase density, which depend on the formation
permeability. We model the full nonlinear phase behavior of water-CO2 mixtures in a confined domain,
consider dissolution and fluid compressibility, and relax the common Boussinesq approximation.
We discover new flow regimes and present quantitative scaling relations for global characteristics
of spreading, mixing, and a dissolution flux in two- and three-dimensional media for both boundary
conditions. We also revisit the scaling behavior of Sherwood number (Sh) with Rayleigh number (Ra),
which has been under debate for porous-media convection. Our measurements from the solutal convection
in the range 1, 500<Ra<135, 000 show that the classical linear scaling Sh ~ Ra is attained asymptotically
for the constant-concentration case. Similarly linear scaling is recovered for the constant-flux
model problem.
