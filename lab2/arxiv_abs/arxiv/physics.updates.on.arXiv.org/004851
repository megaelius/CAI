Gravitational Waves (GWs) were observed for the first time in 2015, one century after Einstein predicted
their existence. There is now growing interest to extend the detection bandwidth to low frequency.
The scientific potential of multi-frequency GW astronomy is enormous as it would enable to obtain
a more complete picture of cosmic events and mechanisms. This is a unique and entirely new opportunity
for the future of astronomy, the success of which depends upon the decisions being made on existing
and new infrastructures. The prospect of combining observations from the future space-based instrument
LISA together with third generation ground based detectors will open the way towards multi-band
GW astronomy, but will leave the infrasound (0.1 Hz to 10 Hz) band uncovered. GW detectors based on
matter wave interferometry promise to fill such a sensitivity gap. We propose the European Laboratory
for Gravitation and Atom-interferometric Research (ELGAR), an underground infrastructure based
on the latest progress in atomic physics, to study space-time and gravitation with the primary goal
of detecting GWs in the infrasound band. ELGAR will directly inherit from large research facilities
now being built in Europe for the study of large scale atom interferometry and will drive new pan-European
synergies from top research centers developing quantum sensors. ELGAR will measure GW radiation
in the infrasound band with a peak strain sensitivity of $4.1 \times 10^{-22}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$
at 1.7 Hz. The antenna will have an impact on diverse fundamental and applied research fields beyond
GW astronomy, including gravitation, general relativity, and geology.
