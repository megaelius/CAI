Evaluated nuclear data uncertainties are often perceived as unrealistic, most often because they
are thought to be too small. The impact of this issue in applied nuclear science has been discussed
widely in recent years. Commonly suggested causes are: poor estimates of specific error components,
neglect of uncertainty correlations, and overlooked known error sources. However, instances
have been reported where very careful, objective assessments of all known error sources have been
made with realistic error magnitudes and correlations provided, yet the resulting evaluated uncertainties
still appear to be inconsistent with observed scatter of predicted mean values. These discrepancies
might be attributed to significant unrecognized sources of uncertainty (USU) that limit the accuracy
to which these physical quantities can be determined. The objective of our work has been to develop
procedures for revealing and including USU estimates in nuclear data evaluations involving experimental
input data. We conclude that the presence of USU may be revealed, and estimates of magnitudes made,
through quantitative analyses. This paper identifies several specific clues that can be explored
by evaluators in identifying the existence of USU. It then describes numerical procedures to generate
quantitative estimates of USU magnitudes. Key requirements for these procedures to be viable are
that sufficient numbers of data points be available, for statistical reasons, and that additional
supporting information about the measurements be provided by the experimenters. Realistic examples
are described to illustrate these procedures and demonstrate their outcomes as well as limitations.
Our work strongly supports the view that USU is an important issue in nuclear data evaluation, with
significant consequences for applications, and that this topic warrants further investigation
by the nuclear science community.
