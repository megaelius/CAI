The Beam Dump Facility (BDF) project is a proposed general-purpose facility at CERN, dedicated
to beam dump and fixed target experiments. In its initial phase, the facility is foreseen to be exploited
by the Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) experiment. Physics requirements call for a pulsed 400
GeV/c proton beam as well as the highest possible number of protons on target (POT) each year of operation,
in order to search for feebly interacting particles. The target/dump assembly lies at the heart
of the facility, with the aim of safely absorbing the full high intensity Super Proton Synchrotron
(SPS) beam, while maximizing the production of charmed and beauty mesons. High-Z materials are
required for the target/dump, in order to have the shortest possible absorber and reduce muon background
for the downstream experiment. The high average power deposited on target (305 kW) creates a challenge
for heat removal. During the BDF facility Comprehensive Design Study (CDS), launched by CERN in
2016, extensive studies have been carried out in order to define and assess the target assembly design.
These studies are described in the present contribution, which details the proposed design of the
BDF production target, as well as the material selection process and the optimization of the target
configuration and beam dilution. One of the specific challenges and novelty of this work is the need
to consider new target materials, such as a molybdenum alloy (TZM) as core absorbing material and
Ta2.5W as cladding. Thermo-structural and fluid dynamics calculations have been performed to
evaluate the reliability of the target and its cooling system under beam operation. In the framework
of the target comprehensive design, a preliminary mechanical design of the full target assembly
has also been carried out, assessing the feasibility of the whole target system.
