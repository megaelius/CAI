We examined how introductory physics students' attitudes and approaches to problem solving compare
to those of introductory astronomy students, using a previously validated survey, the Attitudes
and Approaches to Problem Solving (AAPS) survey. In addition, we compared the performance of the
introductory physics and astronomy students on the factors which were identified in a factor analysis
in the original validation study. We found that introductory astronomy students' overall average
AAPS score was significantly more favorable than that of introductory physics students (p < 0.01),
and the effect size was large (Cohen's d = 0.81). We also found that introductory astronomy students'
scores were more favorable in all clusters of questions except for one factor involving drawing
diagrams and writing scratchwork while solving problems. We also found that introductory physics
and astronomy students were equally capable of solving two isomorphic problems posed to them, and
that the majority of introductory physics and introductory astronomy students reported that the
problem posed in the astronomy context was more interesting to them. Interviews suggest that the
context of astronomy in problem solving may be more interesting for students and could be one possible
explanation for the more favorable AAPS scores amongst introductory astronomy students compared
to introductory physics students. Instructors of introductory physics courses should heed these
findings which indicate that it may be beneficial for instructors of introductory physics courses
to incorporate problems into their instruction which contain real-world contexts, which may serve
to increase student interest-level, and which could help create more favorable attitudes and approaches
towards problem solving.
