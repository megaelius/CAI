Forming the Moon by a high-angular momentum impact may explain the Earth-Moon isotopic similarities,
however, the post-impact angular momentum needs to be reduced by a factor of 2 or more to the current
value (1 L_EM) after the Moon forms. Capture into the evection resonance, occurring when the lunar
perigee precession period equals one year, could remove the angular momentum excess. However the
appropriate angular momentum removal appears sensitive to the tidal model and chosen tidal parameters.
In this work, we use a constant-time delay tidal model to explore the Moon's orbital evolution through
evection. We find that exit from formal evection occurs early and that subsequently, the Moon enters
a quasi-resonance regime, in which evection still regulates the lunar eccentricity even though
the resonance angle is no longer librating. Although not in resonance proper, during quasi-resonance
angular momentum is continuously removed from the Earth-Moon system and transferred to Earth's
heliocentric orbit. The final angular momentum, set by the timing of quasi-resonance escape, is
a function of the ratio of tidal strength in the Moon and Earth and the absolute rate of tidal dissipation
in the Earth. We consider a physically-motivated model for tidal dissipation in the Earth as the
mantle cools from a molten to a partially molten state. We find that as the mantle solidifies, increased
terrestrial dissipation drives the Moon out of quasi-resonance. For post-impact systems that
contain >2 L_EM, final angular momentum values after quasi-resonance escape remain significantly
higher than the current Earth-Moon value.
