Geomagnetic secular acceleration is a unique window on the dynamics taking place in Earth's core.
In this study, the behaviours of the secular acceleration and underlying core dynamics are examined
in new numerical simulations of the geodynamo that reside on a theoretical path in parameter space
connecting the region where most classical models are found to the natural conditions. The typical
time scale for geomagnetic acceleration is found to be invariant along this path, at a value close
to 10 years that matches Earth's core estimates. Despite this invariance, the spatio-temporal
properties of secular acceleration show significant variability along the path, with an asymptotic
regime of rapid rotation reached after 30% of this path (corresponding to a model Ekman number $E=3~10^{-7}$).
In this regime, the energy of secular acceleration is entirely found at periods longer than that
of planetary rotation, and the underlying flow acceleration patterns acquire a two-dimensional
columnar structure representative of the rapid rotation limit. The spatial pattern of the secular
acceleration at the core-mantle boundary shows significant localisation of energy within an equatorial
belt. Rapid hydromagnetic wave dynamics is absent at the start of the path but can be clearly exhibited
in the asymptotic regime. This study reports on ubiquitous axisymmetric geostrophic torsional
waves of weak amplitude relatively to convective transport, and also stronger, laterally limited,
quasi-geostrophic Alfv\'en waves propagating in the cylindrical radial direction from the tip
of convective plumes towards the core-mantle boundary. Quasi-geostrophic Alfv\'en waves are
shown to be an important carrier of flow acceleration to the core surface that links with the generation
of strong, short-lived and intermittent equatorial pulses in the secular acceleration energy.
