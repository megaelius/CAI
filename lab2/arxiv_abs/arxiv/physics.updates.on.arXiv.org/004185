Topological insulators (TIs) are materials that are insulating in the bulk but have zero band gap
surface states with linear dispersion and are protected by time reversal symmetry. These unique
characteristics could pave the way for many promising applications that include spintronic devices
and quantum computations. It is important to understand and theoretically describe TIs as accurately
as possible in order to predict properties. Quantum mechanical approaches, specifically first
principles density functional theory (DFT) based methods, have been used extensively to model
electronic properties of TIs. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of a variety of DFT formalisms
and how these capture the electronic structure of TIs. We concentrate on Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$
as examples of prototypical TI materials. We find that the generalized gradient (GGA) and kinetic
density functional (metaGGA) produce displacements increasing the thickness of the TI slab, whereas
we see an opposite behavior in DFT computations using LDA. Accounting for van der Waals (vdW) interactions
overcomes the apparent over-relaxations and retraces the atomic positions towards the bulk. Based
on an intensive computational study, we show that GGA with vdW treatment is the most appropriate
method for structural optimization. Electronic structures derived from GGA or metaGGA employing
experimental lattice parameters are also acceptable. In this regard, we express a slight preference
for metaGGA in terms of accuracy, but an overall preference for GGA due to compensatory improvements
in computability in capturing TI behavior.
