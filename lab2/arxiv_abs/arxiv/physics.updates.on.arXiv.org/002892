HELicon Experiment for Negative ion source (HELEN-I) with single driver is developed with a focus
on the production of negative hydrogen ions. In the Helicon wave heated plasmas, very high plasma
densities ($\sim10^{19} m^{-3}$) can be attained with electron temperatures as low as $\sim$1
eV in the downstream region. These conditions favor the production of negative hydrogen ions. In
HELEN-I device at IPR, helicon plasma is produced using Hydrogen gas in a diverging magnetic field,
created by a permanent ring magnet. RF Power ($P_{RF}$) of 800-1000W at 13.56 MHz frequency is applied
to a Nagoya-III antenna to excite m = 1 helicon mode in the plasma. The plasma is confined by a multi-cusp
field configuration in the expansion chamber. The transition from inductively coupled mode to
Helicon mode is observed near $P_{RF}$ 700W with plasma density $\sim 10^{18} m^{-3}$ and electron
temperature $\sim$ 5 eV in the driver and $\sim$ 1eV in the expansion volume. Line integrated negative
hydrogen ion density is measured in the expansion chamber by employing an Optical Emission Spectroscopy
(OES) diagnostic technique using $H_\alpha/H_\beta$ ratio and Laser photo-detachment based
Cavity Ring Down spectroscopic (CRDS) diagnostic technique. The measured value of negative hydrogen
ion density is in the order of $10^{16} m^{-3}$ at 6 mTorr pressure and does not vary significantly
with power in the helicon mode, pressure and downstream axial magnetic field variation. The negative
ion density measurements are compared with theoretically estimated values calculated using particle
balance method considering different reaction rates responsible for negative hydrogen ion creation
and destruction. It is to be noted that at present Caesium (Cs) is not injected in the plasma discharge
to enhance $H^-$ ion density.
