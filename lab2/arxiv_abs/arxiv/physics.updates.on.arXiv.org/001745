This paper presents an experimental study on the transition from smooth to rough walls, and back
to the smooth one, in turbulent closed-conduit flows. These transitions cause a shift on flow velocity
profiles that changes their parameters when compared to the flow over a smooth wall. Different water
flow rates were imposed in a closed conduit of rectangular cross section, where rough elements consisting
of cavities of d- and k-type were positioned covering a part of the bottom wall of the test section.
Reynolds numbers based on the channel half-height were moderate, varying between 7800 and 9600,
and the regime upstream of the rough elements was hydraulically smooth. Experimental data for this
specific case remain scarce and the involved physics rests to be understood. The flow field was measured
by low frequency PIV (particle image velocimetry) and by flow visualization, the latter using a
continuous 0.1 W laser, a high-speed camera, and scripts written by the authors. From the instantaneous
fields measured with PIV, the mean velocities, fluctuations, shear stresses and turbulence production
were computed. The results show the presence of oscillations in Reynolds stress and turbulence
production, that are higher for the k-type roughness and were not shown in previous experimental
works. From the high-speed movies, the angular velocities and frequencies of vortices in the cavities
were computed, and the occurrence of fluid ejection from the cavities to upper layers of the flow
was observed. A relation between the angular velocities of inner-cavities vortices and the oscillations
in Reynolds stress and turbulence production is proposed.
