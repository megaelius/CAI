Field patterns, first proposed by the authors in [Milton, Mattei. Proc R Soc A. 2017], are orderly
patterns of characteristic lines that arise in specific space-time microstructures whose geometry
in one spatial dimension plus time is somehow commensurate to the slope of the characteristic lines.
In particular, in [Milton, Mattei. Proc R Soc A. 2017] the authors propose two examples of space-time
geometries in which field patterns occur: they are two-phase microstructures in which rectangular
space-time inclusions of one material are embedded in another material. After a sufficient large
period of time, the field patterns in both microstructures have local periodicity both in time and
space, due to the PT-symmetry of the chosen space-time geometries. This allows one to focus only
on solving the problem on a discrete network and to define a suitable transfer matrix that, given
the solution at a certain time, provides the solution after one time period. Many of the eigenvalues
of this transfer matrix have unit norm and hence the corresponding eigenvectors correspond to propagating
modes. However, there are also modes that blow up exponentially with time coupled with modes that
decrease exponentially with time. The question as to whether there are space-time microstructures
such that the transfer matrix only has eigenvalues on the unit circle finds answer in this paper where
we see that certain space-time checkerboards have the property that all the modes are propagating
modes, within a certain range of the material parameters. Interestingly, when there is no blow-up,
the waves generated by an instantaneous disturbance at a point look like shocks with a wake of oscillatory
waves. This sets an arrow of time in the sense that it would be extremely difficult to produce the initial
conditions necessary to create the corresponding time-reversed waves.
