Computational thinking is a way of reasoning about the world in terms of data. This mindset channels
number crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations.
Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure
of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case
study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided
by: (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex
systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed forma mentis highlighted a positive mindset
about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering
nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived "computation"
as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world
discovery. Students' mindsets around "data", "model" and "simulations" critically revealed
no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence
of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that
are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up
being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous
mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by
training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering
nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing
its development through mindset reconstruction.
