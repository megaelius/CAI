Purpose: Safety limits for the permitted Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) place restrictions on
pulse sequence design, especially at ultra-high fields ($\geq 7$ tesla). Due to inter-subject
variability, the SAR is usually conservatively estimated based on standard human models that include
an applied safety margin to ensure safe operation. One approach to reducing the restrictions is
to create more accurate subject-specific models from their segmented MR images. This study uses
electromagnetic simulations to investigate the minimum number of tissue groups required to accurately
determine SAR in the human head. Methods: Tissue types from a fully characterized electromagnetic
human model with 47 tissue types in the head and neck region were grouped into different tissue clusters
based on the conductivities, permittivities, and mass densities of the tissues. Electromagnetic
simulations of the head model inside a parallel transmit (pTx) head coil at 7T were used to determine
the minimum number of required tissue clusters to accurately determine the subject-specific SAR.
The identified tissue clusters were then evaluated using two additional well-characterized electromagnetic
human models. Results: A minimum of 4 clusters plus air was found to be required for accurate SAR estimation.
These tissue clusters are centered around gray matter, fat, cortical bone, and cerebrospinal fluid.
For all three simulated models the pTx maximum 10gSAR was consistently determined to within an error
of <12% relative to the full 47-tissue model. Conclusion: A minimum of 4 clusters plus air are required
to produce accurate personalized SAR simulations of the human head when using pTx at 7T.
