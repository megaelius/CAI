In a social network individuals or nodes connect to other nodes by choosing one of the channels of
communication at a time to re-establish the existing social links. Since available data sets are
usually restricted to a limited number of channels or layers, these autonomous decision making
processes by the nodes constitute the sampling of a multiplex network leading to just one (though
very important) example of sampling bias caused by the behavior of the nodes. We develop a general
setting to get insight and understand the class of network sampling models, where the probability
of sampling a link in the original network depends on the attributes $h$ of its adjacent nodes. Assuming
that the nodal attributes are independently drawn from an arbitrary distribution $\rho(h)$ and
that the sampling probability $r(h_i , h_j)$ for a link $ij$ of nodal attributes $h_i$ and $h_j$ is
also arbitrary, we derive exact analytic expressions of the sampled network for such network characteristics
as the degree distribution, degree correlation, and clustering spectrum. The properties of the
sampled network turn out to be sums of quantities for the original network topology weighted by the
factors stemming from the sampling. Based on our analysis, we find that the sampled network may have
sampling-induced network properties that are absent in the original network, which implies the
potential risk of a naive generalization of the results of the sample to the entire original network.
We also consider the case, when neighboring nodes have correlated attributes to show how to generalize
our formalism for such sampling bias and we get good agreement between the analytic results and the
numerical simulations.
