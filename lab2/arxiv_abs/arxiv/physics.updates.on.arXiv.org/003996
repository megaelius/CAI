A unified understanding of interfacial thermal transport is missing due to the complicated nature
of interfaces which involves complex factors such as interfacial bonding, interfacial mixing,
surface chemistry, crystal orientation, roughness, contamination, and interfacial disorder.
This is especially true for metal nonmetal interfaces which incorporate multiple fundamental
heat transport mechanisms such as elastic and inelastic phonon scattering as well as electron phonon
coupling in the metal and across the interface. All these factors jointly affect thermal boundary
conductance (TBC). As a result, the experimentally measured interfaces may not be the same as the
ideally modelled interfaces, thus obfuscating any conclusions drawn from experimental and modeling
comparisons. This work provides a systematic study of interfacial thermal conductance across
well controlled and ultraclean epitaxial (111) Al parallel (0001) sapphire interfaces, known
as harmonic matched interface. A comparison with thermal models such as atomistic Green s function
(AGF) and a nonequilibrium Landauer approach shows that elastic phonon scattering dominates the
interfacial thermal transport of Al sapphire interface. By scaling the TBC with the Al heat capacity,
a nearly constant transmission coefficient is observed, indicating that the phonons on the Al side
limits the Al sapphire TBC. This nearly constant transmission coefficient validates the assumptions
in AGF and nonequilibrium Landauer calculations. Our work not only provides a benchmark for interfacial
thermal conductance across metal nonmetal interfaces and enables a quantitative study of TBC to
validate theoretical thermal carrier transport mechanisms, but also acts as a reference when studying
how other factors impact TBC.
