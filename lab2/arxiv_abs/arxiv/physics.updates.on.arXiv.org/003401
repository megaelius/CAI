Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) are the 6th most common cancer and the diagnosis is often belated
for a curative treatment. The reliable and early differentiation between healthy and diseased
cells is the main aim of this study in order to improve the quality of the treatment and to understand
tumour pathogenesis. Here, the optical stretcher is used to analyse mechanical properties of cells
and their potential to serve as a marker for malignancy. Stretching experiments revealed for the
first time that cells of primary OSCCs were deformed by 2.9 % rendering them softer than cells of healthy
mucosa which were deformed only by 1.9 %. Furthermore, the relaxation behaviour of the cells revealed
that these malignant cells exhibit a faster contraction than their benign counterparts. This suggests
that deformability as well as relaxation behaviour can be used as distinct parameters to evaluate
emerging differences between these benign and malignant cells. Since many studies in cancer research
are performed with cancer cell lines rather than primary cells, we have compared the deformability
and relaxation of both types, showing that long time culturing leads to softening of cells. The higher
degree of deformability and relaxation behaviour can enable cancer cells to traverse tissue emphasizing
that changes in cell architecture may be a potential precondition for malignant transformation.
Respecting the fact that even short culture times have an essential effect on the significance of
the results, the use of primary cells for further research is recommended. The distinction between
malignant and benign cells would enable an early confirmation of cancer diagnoses by testing cell
samples of suspect oral lesions.
