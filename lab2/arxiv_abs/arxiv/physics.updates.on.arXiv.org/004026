We report the temporal and spatio-temporal stability analyses of anti-symmetric, free shear,
viscoelastic flows obeying the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation in the limit of low to moderate
Reynolds number and Weissenberg number. The resulting fourth order Orr-Sommerfeld equation is
reduced to a set of six auxiliary equations which are numerically integrated starting from the rescaled
far-field conditions, i.~e., via the Compound Matrix Method. Numerical results indicate that
with increasing Weissenberg number: (a) the peak of the maximal growth rate (i. e., the maximum value
of the imaginary component of the growth rate) is reduced, (b) the entire range of unstable spectrum
is shifted towards longer waves (i.~e., the entire region of temporal instability is gradually
concentrated near zero wavenumber), (c) the vorticity structure contours are dilated and (d) the
residual Reynolds stresses are diminished. All these observations suggest that viscoelasticity
reduces the temporal instability but does not completely suppress it. The Briggs idea of analytic
continuation is deployed to classify regions of temporal stability, absolute and convective instabilties
as well as evanescent (false) modes, in a finite range of Reynolds number, Weissenberg number and
the viscosity coefficient. The main result is that, unlike Newtonian fluids, the free shear flow
of dilute polymeric liquids are either (absolutely/convectively) unstable for all Reynolds number
or the transition to instability occurs at very low Reynolds number, a finding attributed to the
fact that viscoelasticity aggravates free surface flow instabilities. Although this transitional
pathway connecting the temporally stable state to the elastoinertially unstable state have been
identified by some in-vitro experiments, but until now, has not been quantified theoretically
via linear stability analysis.
