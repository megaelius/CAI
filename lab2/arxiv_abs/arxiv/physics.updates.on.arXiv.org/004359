The World Health Organization describes zoonotic diseases as a major pandemic threat, and modeling
the behavior of such diseases is a key component of their control. Many emerging zoonoses, such as
SARS, Nipah, and Hendra, mutated from their wild type while circulating in an intermediate host
population, usually a domestic species, to become more transmissible among humans, and moreover,
this transmission route will only become more likely as agriculture and trade intensifies around
the world. Passage through an intermediate host enables many otherwise rare diseases to become
better adapted to humans, and so understanding this process with mathematical epidemiological
models is necessary to prevent epidemics of emerging zoonoses, guide policy interventions in public
health, and predict the behavior of an epidemic. In this paper, we account for spillovers of a zoonotic
disease mutating in an intermediate host by means of modeling transmission dynamics within and
between three host species, namely, wild reservoir, intermediate domestic animals, and humans.
We calculate the basic reproductive number of the pathogen, present critical conditions for the
emergence dynamics of zoonosis, and perform stability analysis of admissible disease equilibria.
Our analytical results agree well with long-term simulations of the system. We find that in the presence
of biologically realistic interspecies transmission parameters, a zoonotic disease can establish
itself in humans even if it fails to persist in its reservoir and intermediate host species. Our model
and results can be used to understand the dynamic behavior of any zoonosis with intermediate hosts
and assist efforts to protect public health.
