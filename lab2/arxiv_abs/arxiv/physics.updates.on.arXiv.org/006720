Quantitative studies of the evolution and cosmological consequences of networks of cosmic strings
(or other topological defects) require a combination of numerical simulations and analytic modeling
with the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model. In previous work, we demonstrated that a GPU-accelerated
code for local Abelian-Higgs string networks enables a statistical separation of key dynamical
processes affecting the evolution of the string networks and thus a precise calibration of the VOS
model. Here we further exploit this code in a detailed study of two important aspects connecting
the simulations with the VOS model. First, we study the sensitivity of the model calibration to the
presence (or absence) of thermal oscillations due to high gradients in the initial conditions.
This is relevant since in some Abelian-Higgs simulations described in the literature a period of
artificial (unphysical) dissipation---usually known as cooling---is introduced with the goal
of suppressing these oscillations and accelerating the convergence to scaling. We show that a small
amount of cooling has no statistically significant impact on the VOS model calibration, while a
longer dissipation period does have a noticeable effect. Second, in doing this analysis we also
introduce an improved Markov Chain Monte Carlo based pipeline for calibrating the VOS model, Comparison
to our previous bootstrap based pipeline shows that the latter accurately determined the best-fit
values of the VOS model parameter, but underestimated the uncertainties in some of the parameters.
Overall, our analysis shows that the calibration pipeline is robust and can be applied to future
much larger field theory simulations.
