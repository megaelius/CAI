The specific form of one electrode capacitive discharge was studied in long tubes filled with high
purity neon or argon at pressure 1-4 Torr. The main feature of the discharge is the low rate (less than
10 kHz) of the voltage pulses of given polarity which are applied to only one electrode of the tube,
while another one remains free or missing. This type of the discharge was named one-electrode discharge
(OED), and seems not to be described in previous studies. The discharge is observed as a glowing plasma
column which occupies either entire tube or its part dependent on actual voltage amplitude and on
its rate. Current-volt characteristics, ignition thresholds and the OED length changing patterns
demonstrate features unknown for RF discharges. It was found that the plasma generation mechanism
in OED consists in formation and traveling of the set of ionization waves (IW). It was shown that the
wave motion is characterized by a pronounced attenuation the patterns of which were investigated
by the time-position diagrams method. The attenuation specifies the length of the occupied plasma
area as well as other OED parameters. Kinematic model of the wave propagation is proposed. This model
allows to estimate the electric field in different OED points as well as average electron concentration
via the current measurements; the typical values of the above parameters are $5 V/cm$ and $10^9-10^{10}$
$cm^{-3}$. It was shown that nonhomogeneous electric field behind the IW front creates the conditions
for appearance of plasma channel striations observed in the experiment. The stationary striations
found in neon are more distinctive for negative polarity OED. It was shown that ionization-drift
mechanism with account of metastable states existence in plasma seems to be much adequate for the
OED striation description.
