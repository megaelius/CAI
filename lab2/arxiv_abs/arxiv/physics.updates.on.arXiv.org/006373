We test the reliability of two neural network interpretation techniques, backward optimization
and layerwise relevance propagation, within geoscientific applications by applying them to a
commonly studied geophysical phenomenon, the Madden-Julian Oscillation. The Madden-Julian
Oscillation is a multi-scale pattern within the tropical atmosphere that has been extensively
studied over the past decades, which makes it an ideal test case to ensure the interpretability methods
can recover the current state of knowledge regarding its spatial structure. The neural networks
can, indeed, reproduce the current state of knowledge and can also provide new insights into the
seasonality of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and its relationships with atmospheric state variables.
The neural network identifies the phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation twice as accurately as
linear regression, which means that nonlinearities used by the neural network are important to
the structure of the Madden-Julian Oscillation. Interpretations of the neural network show that
it accurately captures the spatial structures of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, suggest that
the nonlinearities of the Madden-Julian Oscillation are manifested through the uniqueness of
each event, and offer physically meaningful insights into its relationship with atmospheric state
variables. We also use the interpretations to identify the seasonality of the Madden-Julian Oscillation,
and find that the conventionally defined extended seasons should be shifted later by one month.
More generally, this study suggests that neural networks can be reliably interpreted for geoscientific
applications and may there
