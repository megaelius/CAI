The quantum photodynamics of a simple diatomic molecule with a permanent dipole immersed within
an optical cavity containing a quantized radiation field is studied in detail. The chosen molecule
under study, lithium fluoride (LiF), is characterized by the presence of an avoided crossing between
the two lowest $^1\Sigma$ potential energy curves (covalent-ionic diabatic crossing). Without
field, after prompt excitation from the ground state $1\; ^1\Sigma$, the excited nuclear wave packet
moves back and forth in the upper $2\; ^1\Sigma$ state, but in the proximity of the avoided crossing,
the non-adiabatic coupling transfers part of the nuclear wave packet to the lower $1\; ^1\Sigma$
state, which eventually leads to dissociation. The quantized field of a cavity also induces an additional
light crossing in the modified dressed potential energy curves with similar transfer properties.
To understand the entangled photonic-nuclear dynamics we solve the time dependent Schr\"odinger
equation by using the multiconfigurational time dependent Hartree method (MCTDH). The single
mode quantized field of the cavity is represented in the coordinate space instead of in the Fock space,
which allows us to deal with the field as an additional vibrational mode within the MCTDH procedure
on equal footing. We prepare the cavity with different quantum states of light, namely, Fock states,
coherent states and squeezed coherent states. Our results reveal pure quantum light effects on
the molecular photodynamics and the dissociation yields of LiF, which are quite different from
the light-undressed case and that cannot be described in general by a semiclassical approach using
classical electromagnetic fields.
