We present derivation and implementation of the Multi-Configurational Strong-Field Approximation
with Gaussian nuclear Wave Packets (MC-SFA-GWP) -- a version of the molecular strong-field approximation
which treats all electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, including their correlations, quantum-mechanically.
The technique allows, for the first time, realistic simulation of high-harmonic emission in polyatomic
molecules without invoking reduced-dimensionality models for the nuclear motion or the electronic
structure. We use MC-SFA-GWP to model isotope effects in high-harmonics generation (HHG) spectroscopy
of methane. The HHG emission in this molecule transiently involves strongly vibronically-coupled
$^2F_2$ electronic state of the $\rm CH_4^+$ cation. We show that the isotopic HHG ratio in methane
contains signatures of: a) field-free vibronic dynamics at the conical intersection (CI); b) resonant
features in the recombination cross-sections; c) laser-driven bound-state dynamics; as well
as d) the well-known short-time Gaussian decay of the emission. We assign the intrinsic vibronic
feature (a) to a relatively long-lived ($\ge4$ fs) vibronic wave packet of the singly-excited $\nu_4$
($t_2$) and $\nu_2$ ($e$) vibrational modes, strongly coupled to the components of the $^2F_2$
electronic state. We demonstrate that these physical effects differ in their dependence on the
wavelength, intensity, and duration of the driving pulse, allowing them to be disentangled. We
thus show that HHG spectroscopy provides a versatile tool for exploring both conical intersections
and resonant features in photorecombination matrix elements in the regime not easily accessible
with other techniques.
