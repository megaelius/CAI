Silica-coated gold nanoparticles are commonly employed in biomedical photoacoustic (PA) imaging
applications. We investigate theoretically and experimentally the PA signal generation by silica-coated
gold nanospheres in water. Our theoretical model considers thermoelastic expansion in the long-pulse
illumination regime, and the PA signals are determined based on a semi-analytical solution to the
thermal diffusion equations and a finite-difference in time domain (FDTD) solution to the thermoelastic
equations. Both the influence of interfacial thermal (Kapitza) resistance at the gold-water boundary
and the influence of the silica coating on PA signal generation were investigated. Our results indicate
that for the nanosecond pulses commonly employed in PA imaging, Kapitza resistance has a negligible
effect on photoacoustic signal generation. Moreover, our model shows that the presence of a silica
coating causes a reduction in the PA signal amplitude, with the level of signal reduction increasing
with thicker silica coating. Our theoretical predictions are qualitatively consistent with our
experimental results, where suspensions of in-house-synthesized and commercially available
silica-coated gold nanosphere suspensions were excited with nanosecond-pulsed laser illumination
at 532 nm. The PA signal amplitudes from silica-coated nanospheres were lower than the signal amplitudes
for uncoated gold nanospheres of the same core gold diameter. The amount of reduction of the experimentally
PA signal amplitude due to the silica coating was found to increase with thicker silica coating,
in agreement with our theoretical predictions.
