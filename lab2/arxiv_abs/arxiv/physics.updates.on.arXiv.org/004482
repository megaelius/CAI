Antennas, i.e., elements transforming localized or waveguide modes into freely propagating fields
and vice versa, are vital components for wireless technologies across the entire spectrum of electromagnetic
waves, including microwaves and optics. Although optical antennas are usually fed by either a single
source or many sources incoherently, recent studies demonstrate an ability of resonant nanostructures
to cause the synchronization of quantum source spontaneous emission, i.e., Dicke superradiance
effect. What remains poorly explored is how the coherent excitation can affect antenna performance:
its multipole composition, directivity, efficiency, and Purcell effect. In this paper, we investigate
an antenna excited by two coherent sources and demonstrate that this approach can boost antenna
performance. To make the discussion independent of the frequency range, we restrict the consideration
by all-dielectric antennas, which attract significant interest in both microwaves and optics.
We explore that coherent excitation of a dielectric antenna by two dipole sources makes it feasible
to control the multipoles resulting in boosted superradiance and enhanced directivity. Interestingly,
it makes possible excitation of nonradiative field configuration, anapole state, and turning
it on and off on demand. Remarkably, this approach also allows reducing the quenching effect and
enhancing the radiation efficiency without changing the antenna geometry. We design a dielectric
subwavelength coherently driven antenna operating in both superdirective and superradiative
regimes simultaneously with the total enhancement factor over 2000.
