Simulations of strongly stratified turbulence often exhibit coherent large-scale structures
called vertically sheared horizontal flows (VSHFs). VSHFs emerge in both two-dimensional (2D)
and three-dimensional (3D) stratified turbulence with similar vertical structure. The mechanism
responsible for VSHF formation is not fully understood. In this work, the formation and equilibration
of VSHFs in a 2D Boussinesq model of stratified turbulence is studied using statistical state dynamics
(SSD). In SSD, equations of motion are expressed directly in the statistical variables of the turbulent
state. Restriction to 2D turbulence makes available an analytically and computationally attractive
implementation of SSD referred to as S3T, in which the SSD is expressed by coupling the equation for
the horizontal mean structure with the equation for the ensemble mean perturbation covariance.
This second order SSD produces accurate statistics, through second order, when compared with fully
nonlinear simulations. In particular, S3T captures the spontaneous emergence of the VSHF and associated
density layers seen in simulations of turbulence maintained by homogeneous large-scale stochastic
excitation. An advantage of the S3T system is that the VSHF formation mechanism, which is wave-mean
flow interaction between the emergent VSHF and the stochastically excited large-scale gravity
waves, is analytically understood in the S3T system. Comparison with fully nonlinear simulations
verifies that S3T solutions accurately predict the scale selection, dependence on stochastic
excitation strength, and nonlinear equilibrium structure of the VSHF. These results facilitate
relating VSHF theory and geophysical examples of turbulent jets such as the ocean's equatorial
deep jets.
