In this paper we consider the operator properties of various phononic eigenvalue problems. We aim
to answer some fundamental questions about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of phononic operators.
These include questions about the potential real and complex nature of the eigenvalues, whether
the eigenvectors form a complete basis, what are the right orthogonality relationships, and how
to create a complete basis when none may exist at the outset. In doing so we present a unified understanding
of the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors which would emerge from any numerical method
employed to compute such quantities. We show that the phononic problem can be cast into linear eigenvalue
forms from which such quantities as frequencies ($\omega(\boldsymbol{\beta})$), wavenumbers
($\beta(\omega,\mathbf{n})$), and desired components of wavevectors ($\beta_3(\omega,\beta_\alpha)$)
can be directly ascertained without resorting to searches or quadratic eigenvalue problems and
that the relevant properties of such quantities can be determined apriori through the analysis
of the associated operators. We further show how the Plane Wave Expansion (PWE) method may be extended
to solve each of these eigenvalue forms, thus extending the applicability of the PWE method to cases
beyond what have been considered till now. For the cases considered, we discuss relevant and important
properties of the eigenvalue forms. The theoretical discussions are supplemented with supporting
numerical calculations. The techniques and results presented here directly apply to wave propagation
in other periodic systems such as photonics.
