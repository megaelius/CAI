The accuracy of hadrontherapy treatment is currently limited by ion-range uncertainties. In order
to fully exploit the potential of this technique, we propose the development of a novel system for
online control of particle therapy, based on TOF-resolved (time-of-flight) Prompt Gamma (PG)
imaging with 100 ps time resolution. Our aim is to detect a possible deviation of the proton range
with respect to treatment planning within the first few irradiation spots at the beginning of the
session. The system consists of a diamond-based beam hodoscope for single proton tagging, operated
in time coincidence with one or more gamma detectors placed downstream of the patient. The TOF between
the proton time of arrival in the hodoscope and the PG detection time provides an indirect measurement
of the proton range in the patient with a precision strictly related to the system time resolution.
With a single ~38 cm$^{3}$ BaF2 detector placed at 15 cm from a heterogeneous PMMA target, we obtained
a coincidence time resolution of 101 ps (rms). This system allowed us to measure the thickness and
position of an air cavity within a PMMA target, and the associated proton range shift: a 3 mm shift
can be detected at 2$\sigma$ confidence level within a single large irradiation spot (~10$^{8}$
protons). We are currently conceiving a multi-channel PG timing detector with 3D target coverage.
Each pixel will provide the PG detection time and its hit position, that can be used to reconstruct
the 3D distribution of PG vertices in the patient. Our approach does not require collimation and
allows to dramatically increase the detection efficiency. Since both signal detection and background
rejection are based on TOF, the constraints on energy resolution can be relaxed to further improve
time resolution.
