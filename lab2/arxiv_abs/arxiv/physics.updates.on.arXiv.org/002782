The morphological dynamics, instabilities and transitions of elastic filaments in viscous flows
underlie a wealth of biophysical processes from flagellar propulsion to intracellular streaming,
and are also key to deciphering the rheological behavior of many complex fluids and soft materials.
Here, we combine experiments and computational modeling to elucidate the dynamical regimes and
morphological transitions of elastic Brownian filaments in a simple shear flow. Actin filaments
are employed as an experimental model system and their conformations are investigated through
fluorescence microscopy in microfluidic channels. Simulations matching the experimental conditions
are also performed using inextensible Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and non-local slender-body
hydrodynamics in the presence of thermal fluctuations, and agree quantitatively with observations.
We demonstrate that filament dynamics in this system is primarily governed by a dimensionless elasto-viscous
number comparing viscous drag forces to elastic bending forces, with thermal fluctuations only
playing a secondary role. While short and rigid filaments perform quasi-periodic tumbling motions,
a buckling instability arises above a critical flow strength. A second transition to strongly-deformed
shapes occurs at a yet larger value of the elasto-viscous number and is characterized by the appearance
of localized high-curvature bends that propagate along the filaments in apparent "snaking" motions.
A theoretical model for the so far unexplored onset of snaking accurately predicts the transition
and explains the observed dynamics. For the first time, we present a complete characterization
of filament morphologies and transitions as a function of elasto-viscous number and scaled persistence
length and demonstrate excellent agreement between theory, experiments and simulations.
