Mesoscale phenomena -- involving a level of description between the finest atomistic scale and
the macroscopic continuum -- can be studied by a variation on the usual atomistic-level molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation technique. In mesodynamics, the mass points, rather than being atoms,
are mesoscopic in size, for instance representing the centers of mass of polycrystalline grains
or molecules. In order to reproduce many of the overall features of fully atomistic MD, which is inherently
more expensive, the equations of motion in mesodynamics must be derivable from an interaction potential
that is faithful to the compressive equation of state, as well as to tensile de-cohesion that occurs
along the boundaries of the mesoscale units. Moreover, mesodynamics diffrers from Newton's equations
of motion in that dissipation -- the exchange of energy between mesoparticles and their internal
degrees of freedom (DoFs) -- must be described, and so should the transfer of energy between the internal
modes of neighboring mesoparticles. We present a formulation where energy transfer between the
internal modes of a mesoparticle and its external center-of-mass DoFs occurs in the phase space
of mesoparticle coordinates, rather than momenta, resulting in a Galilean invariant formulation
that conserves total linear momentum and energy (including the energy internal to the mesoparticles).
We show that this approach can be used to describe, in addition to mesoscale problems, conduction
electrons in atomic-level simulations of metals, and we demonstrate applications of mesodynamics
to shockwave propagation and thermal transport.
