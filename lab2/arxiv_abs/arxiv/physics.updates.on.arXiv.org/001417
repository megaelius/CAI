The injection, propagation and arrival of solar energetic particles (SEPs) during eruptive solar
events is an important and current research topic of heliospheric physics. During the largest solar
events, particles may have energies up to a few GeVs and sometimes even trigger ground-level enhancements
(GLEs) at Earth. We study the first GLE-event of solar cycle 24, from 17th May 2012, using data from
multiple spacecraft (SOHO, GOES, MSL, STEREO-A, STEREO-B and MESSENGER). These spacecraft are
located throughout the inner heliosphere, at heliocentric distances between 0.34 and 1.5 astronomical
units (au), covering nearly the whole range of heliospheric longitudes. We present and investigate
sub-GeV proton time profiles for the event at several energy channels, obtained via different instruments
aboard the above spacecraft. We investigate issues due to magnetic connectivity, and present results
of three-dimensional SEP propagation simulations. We gather virtual time profiles and perform
qualitative and quantitative comparisons with observations, assessing longitudinal injection
and transport effects as well as peak intensities. We distinguish different time profile shapes
for well-connected and weakly connected observers, and find our onset time analysis to agree with
this distinction. At select observers, we identify an additional low-energy component of Energetic
Storm Particles (ESPs). Using well-connected observers for normalisation, our simulations are
able to accurately recreate both time profile shapes and peak intensities at multiple observer
locations. This synergetic approach combining numerical modeling with multi-spacecraft observations
is crucial for understanding the propagation of SEPs within the interplanetary magnetic field.
Our novel analysis provides valuable proof of the ability to simulate SEP propagation throughout
the inner heliosphere, at a wide range of longitudes.
