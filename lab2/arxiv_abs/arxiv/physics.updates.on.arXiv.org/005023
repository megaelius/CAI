Morphological accelerators, such as the MORFAC (MORphological acceleration FACtor) approach,
are widely adopted techniques for the acceleration of the bed evolution, which reduces the computational
cost of morphodynamic numerical simulations. In this work we apply a non-uniform acceleration
to the one-dimensional morphodynamic problem described by the de Saint Venant-Exner model by multiplying
all the spatial derivatives by an individual constant (>1) acceleration factor. The final goal
is to identify the best combination of the three accelerating factors for which i) the bed responds
linearly to hydrodynamic changes; ii) a consistent decrease of the computational cost is obtained.
The sought combination is obtained by studying the behaviour of an approximate solution of the three
eigenvalues associated with the flux matrix of the accelerated system. This approach allows to
derive a new linear morphodynamic acceleration technique, the MASSPEED (MASs equations SPEEDup)
approach, and the a priori determination of the highest acceleration allowed for a given simulation.
In this new approach both mass conservation equations (water and sediment) are accelerated by the
same factor, differently from the MORFAC approach where only the sediment mass equation is modified.
The analysis shows that the MASSPEED gives a larger validity range for linear acceleration and requires
smaller computational costs than that of the classical MORFAC approach. The MASSPEED approach
is implemented within an example code, using an adaptive approach that applies the maximum linear
acceleration similarly to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition. Finally, numerical
simulations have been performed in order to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the new approach.
Results obtained in the long-term propagation of a sediment hump demonstrate the advantages of
the new approach.
