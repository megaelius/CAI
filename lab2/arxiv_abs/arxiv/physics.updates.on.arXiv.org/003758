When the flow is sufficiently rarefied, a temperature gradient, for example, between two walls
separated by a few mean free paths, induces a gas flow---an observation attributed to the thermo-stress
convection effects at microscale. The dynamics of the overall thermo-stress convection process
is governed by the Boltzmann equation---an integro-differential equation describing the evolution
of the molecular distribution function in six-dimensional phase space---which models dilute
gas behavior at the molecular level to accurately describe a wide range of flow phenomena. Approaches
for solving the full Boltzmann equation with general inter-molecular interactions rely on two
perspectives: one stochastic in nature often delegated to the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
method; and the others deterministic by virtue. Among the deterministic approaches, the discontinuous
Galerkin fast spectral (DGFS) method has been recently introduced for solving the full Boltzmann
equation with general collision kernels, including the variable hard/soft sphere models---necessary
for simulating flows involving diffusive transport. In this work, the deterministic DGFS method;
Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK), Ellipsoidal statistical BGK, and Shakhov kinetic models; and the
widely-used stochastic DSMC method, are utilized to assess the thermo-stress convection process
in MIKRA---Micro In-Plane Knudsen Radiometric Actuator---a microscale compact low-power pressure
sensor utilizing the Knudsen forces. BGK model under-predicts the heat-flux, shear-stress, and
flow speed; S-model over-predicts; whereas ESBGK comes close to the DSMC results. On the other hand,
both the statistical/DSMC and deterministic/DGFS methods, segregated in perspectives, yet,
yield inextricable results.
