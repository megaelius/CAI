The lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper metalloenzymes that can enhance polysaccharide
depolymerization through an oxidative mechanism and hence boost generation of biofuel from e.g.
cellulose. By employing density functional theory in a combination of quantum mechanics and molecular
mechanics (QM/MM), we report the complete description of the molecular mechanism of LPMOs. The
QM/MM scheme allows us to describe all reaction steps with a detailed protein environment and we
show that this is necessary. Several active species capable of abstracting a hydrogen from the substrate
have been proposed previously and starting from recent crystallographic work on a substrate-LPMO
complex, we investigate previously suggested paths as well as new ones. We describe the generation
of the reactive intermediates, the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the polysaccharide substrate,
as well as the final recombination step in which OH is transferred back to the substrate. We show that
a superoxo [CuO2]+ complex can be protonated by a nearby histidine residue (suggested by recent
mutagenesis studies and crystallographic work) and, provided an electron source is available,
leads to formation of an oxyl-complex after cleavage of the O-O bond and dissociation of water. The
oxyl complex either reacts with the substrate or is further protonated to a hydroxyl complex. Both
the oxyl and hydroxyl complexes are also readily generated from a reaction with H2O2, which was recently
suggested to be the true co-substrate, rather than O2. The C-H abstraction by the oxyl and hydroxy
complexes is overall favorable with activation barriers of 69 and 94 kJ/mol, compared to the much
higher barrier (156 kJ/mol) obtained for the copper-superoxo species.
