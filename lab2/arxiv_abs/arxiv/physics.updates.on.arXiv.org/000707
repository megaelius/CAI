The celebrated Sommerfeld wedge diffraction solution is reexamined from a null interior field
perspective. Exact surface currents provided by that solution, when considered as disembodied
half-plane laminae radiating into an ambient, uniform space both inside and outside the wedge proper,
do succeed in reconstituting both a specular, mirror field above the exposed face, and a shielding
plane-wave field of a sign opposite to that of the incoming excitation which, under superposition,
creates both the classical, geometric-optics shadow, and a strictly null interior field at the
dominant, plane-wave level. Both mirror and shadow radiated fields are controlled by the residue
at just one simple pole encountered during a spectral radiative field assembly, fixed in place by
incidence direction $\phi_{0}$ as measured from the exposed face. The radiated fields further
provide diffractive contributions drawn from two saddle points that track observation angle $\phi.$
Even these, more or less asymptotic contributions, are found to cancel exactly within the wedge
interior, while, on the outside, they recover in its every detail the canonical structure lying
at the base of GTD (geometric theory of diffraction). It is earnestly hoped that this revised scattering
viewpoint, while leaving intact all details of the existing solution, will impart to it a fresh,
physically robust meaning. Moreover, since this viewpoint confirms, admittedly in an extreme
limit, the concept of field self-consistency (Ewald-Oseen extinction in more picturesque language),
perhaps such explicit vindication may yet encourage efforts to seek exact solutions to scattering/diffraction
by electromagnetically permeable (dielectric) wedges, efforts that harness integral equations
with polarization/ohmic currents distributed throughout wedge volumes as sources radiating
into an ambient, uniform reference medium.
