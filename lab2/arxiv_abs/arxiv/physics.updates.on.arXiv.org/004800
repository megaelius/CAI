Ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) has proven to be an accurate approach for calculating thermal
rate coefficients of various chemical reactions. For wider application of this methodology, efficient
ways to generate the underlying full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) and the corresponding
energy gradients are required. Recently, we have proposed a fully automated procedure based on
combining the original RPMDrate code with active learning for PES on-the-fly using moment tensor
potential and successfully applied it to two representative thermally activated chemical reactions
[I. S. Novikov, Y. V. Suleimanov, A. V. Shapeev, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 29503-29512 (2018)]. In
this work, using a prototype insertion chemical reaction S + H$_2$, we show that this procedure works
equally well for another class of chemical reactions. We find that the corresponding PES can be generated
by fitting to less than 1500 automatically generated structures while the RPMD rate coefficients
show deviation from the reference values within the typical convergence error of RPMDrate. We note
that more structures are accumulated during the real-time propagation of the dynamic factor (the
recrossing factor) as opposed to the previous study. We also observe that relatively flat free energy
profile of the along the reaction coordinate before entering the complex-formation well can cause
issues with locating the maximum of the free energy surface for less converged PESs. However, the
final RPMD rate coefficient is independent of the position of the dividing surface that makes it
invulnerable to this problem, keeping the total number of necessary structures within a few thousand.
Our work concludes that, in future, the proposed methodology can be applied to realistic complex
chemical reactions with various energy profiles.
