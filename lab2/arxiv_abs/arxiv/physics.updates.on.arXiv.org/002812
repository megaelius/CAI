A scheme was developed by Lepping, Berdichevsky, and Wu (Solar Phys., doi.10. 1007/ s11207-016-1040-9,
2017) [called the LBW article here] to approximate the average magnetic field magnitude (B-) profile
of a "typical" magnetic cloud (MC) at/near 1AU. It was based on actual Wind MC data, taken over 21 years,
that was used to modify a time shifted Bessel function (force-free) magnetic field, where shifted
refers to a field that was adjusted for typical MC self-similar expansion. This was developed in
the context of the Lepping, Jones, and Burlaga (J. Geophys. Res. vol. 95, p.11957, 1990) [called
LJB here] MC parameter fitting model and should provide more realistic future representations
of the MC's B-profile in most cases. In the LBW article, through testing, it was shown that on average
it can be expected that in about 80% of the MC cases (but it varies according to the spacecrafts' actual
closest approach distances) the modified model's B-profile of the MC should be significantly improved
by use of this scheme. We describe how this scheme can be employed practically in modifying the LJB
MC fitting model, and we test a new and slightly better (and less unwieldy) version of the scheme,
the non-shifted (of Bessel functions) version, which is the one actually used in the LJB model modification.
The new scheme is based on modification formulae that are slightly more accurate than the old scheme,
and it is expected to improve the B-profile in approximately 83% of the cases on average. The schemes
are applicable for use with data originating only at/near 1 AU, since the magnetic field and plasma
data used in the development of the associated formulae were from only the Wind spacecraft, which
was and is at 1 AU.
