In this paper, a hypothesis that the cosmological gravitational potential can be measured with
the use of high-precision atomic clocks is proposed and substantiated. It is assumed that the cosmological
potential is formed by all matter of the Universe (including dark matter and dark energy) and that
it is spatially uniform on planet scales. It is obvious that the cosmological potential, $\Phi_\text{CP}$,
is several orders of magnitude greater than Earth's gravitational potential $\varphi_\text{E}$
(where $|\varphi_\text{E}/c^2|\sim 10^{-9}$ on Earth's surface). In our method, the tick rates
of identical atomic clocks are compared at two points with different gravitational potentials,
i.e. at different heights. In this case, the information on $\Phi_\text{CP}$ is contained in the
cosmological correction $\alpha\neq 0$ in the relationship $\Delta\omega/\omega=(1+\alpha)\Delta
\varphi/c^2$ between the relative change of the frequencies $\Delta \omega/\omega$ (in atomic
clocks) and the difference of the gravitational potential $\Delta \varphi$ at the measurement
points. The consideration is made both in the case of a quasi-classical description of the gravitational
shift and within general relativity theory. It is shown that using a modern atomic clock of the optical
range it is possible to measure $\alpha$ in earth-based experiments if $|\alpha| > 10^{-5}$. The
obtained results, if confirmed experimentally, will open up new unique possibilities for investigation
of the Universe: measurement of the components of the cosmological metric tensor, determination
of the size and age of the Universe, and testing of various cosmological models. These results will
also increase the measurement accuracy in relativistic geodesy, chronometric gravimetry, global
navigation systems, and global networks of atomic clocks.
