The clustering coefficient quantifies the abundance of connected triangles in a network and is
a major descriptive statistics of networks. For example, it finds an application in the assessment
of small-worldness of brain networks, which is affected by attentional and cognitive conditions,
age, psychiatric disorders and so forth. However, it remains unclear how the clustering coefficient
should be measured in a correlation-based network, which is among major representations of brain
networks. In the present article, we propose clustering coefficients tailored to correlation
matrices. The key idea is to use three-way partial correlation or partial mutual information to
measure the strength of the association between the two neighbouring nodes of a focal node relative
to the amount of pseudo-correlation expected from indirect paths between the nodes. Our method
avoids the difficulties of previous applications of clustering coefficient (and other) measures
in defining correlational networks, i.e., thresholding on the correlation value, discarding
of negative correlation values, the pseudo-correlation problem and full partial correlation
matrices whose estimation is computationally difficult. For proof of concept, we apply the proposed
clustering coefficient measures to functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from
healthy participants of various ages and compare them with conventional clustering coefficients.
We show that the clustering coefficients decline with the age. The proposed clustering coefficients
are more strongly correlated with age than the conventional ones are. We also show that the local
variants of the proposed clustering coefficients are useful in characterising individual nodes.
In contrast, the conventional local clustering coefficients were strongly correlated with and
therefore may be confounded by the node's connectivity.
