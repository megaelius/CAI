Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder and widening the upper airway is often used
in clinical practice. However, the success rate of this surgery is limited; the failed surgery would
even make the situation worse, indicating the widened airway is not the unique criterion to evaluate
the breathing quality. Therefore, we carried out both experimental measurement and numerical
simulation on OSA upper airways and found that there existed an intrinsic dominant 3-5 Hz signal
and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 3-5 Hz is inversely correlated with apnea-hypopnea index
(AHI). Firstly, to validate the suitability of simulation methods, we carried out Laser Doppler
measurement in 3D-printing OSA upper airway models, and found excellent agreement between the
measured and calculated velocity profiles in two upper airway models for the first time. Then we
carried out large eddy simulation (LES) to investigate four pairs of OSA upper airway models with
8 different AHI values for both pre- and post-surgery; among them, three surgeries were successful
and one failed. The decreased the pressure drop for failed case, proving that only widening airway
cannot guarantee to improve OSA. In our analysis, it is indicating that a dominant recirculation
downstream of the minimum cross-section should be a main feature of a successful surgery, and the
strength of 3-5 Hz signal induced by flow separation in the upper airway plays an important role in
appraising breathing quality. This provides a new guideline for surgery planning. Furthermore,
we found a strong correlation between AHI and the area ratio of minimum cross-section near the retro-palate
to the maximum cross-section behind the tongue base, and this correlation is highly significant,
r = - 0.833, p = 0.01 < 0.05.
