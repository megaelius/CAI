Scientific knowledge and advances are a cornerstone of modern society. They improve our understanding
of the world we live in and help us navigate global challenges including emerging infectious diseases,
climate change and the biodiversity crisis. For any scientist, whether they work primarily in fundamental
knowledge generation or in the applied sciences, it is important to understand how science fits
into a decision-making framework. Decision science is a field that aims to pinpoint evidence-based
management strategies. It provides a framework for scientists to directly impact decisions or
to understand how their work will fit into a decision process. Decision science is more than undertaking
targeted and relevant scientific research or providing tools to assist policy makers; it is an approach
to problem formulation, bringing together mathematical modelling, stakeholder values and logistical
constraints to support decision making. In this paper we describe decision science, its use in different
contexts, and highlight current gaps in methodology and application. The COVID-19 pandemic has
thrust mathematical models into the public spotlight, but it is one of innumerable examples in which
modelling informs decision making. Other examples include models of storm systems (eg. cyclones,
hurricanes) and climate change. Although the decision timescale in these examples differs enormously
(from hours to decades), the underlying decision science approach is common across all problems.
Bridging communication gaps between different groups is one of the greatest challenges for scientists.
However, by better understanding and engaging with the decision-making processes, scientists
will have greater impact and make stronger contributions to important societal problems.
