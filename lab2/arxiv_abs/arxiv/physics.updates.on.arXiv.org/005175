Plasma-based accelerators sustain accelerating gradients which are several orders greater than
obtained in conventional accelerators. Focusing of electron and positron beams by wakefield,
excited in plasma, in electron-positron collider is very important. The focusing mechanism in
the plasma, in which all electron bunches of a sequence are focused identically, has been proposed
by authors earlier. The mechanism of focusing of a sequence of relativistic positron bunches in
plasma, in which all positron bunches of sequence are focused identically and uniformly, has been
investigated in this paper by numerical simulation by 2.5D code LCODE. We numerically simulate
the self-consistent radial dynamics of lengthy positron bunches in homogeneous plasma. In simulation
we use the hydrodynamic description of plasma. In other words, the plasma is considered to be cold
electron liquid, and positron bunches are aggregate of macroparticles. Positron bunches are considered
to be homogeneous cylinders in the longitudinal direction. Positrons in bunches are distributed
in radial direction according to Gaussian distribution. It is shown that in this case only first
bunch is in the finite longitudinal electrical wakefield notequal to zero. Other bunches are in
zero longitudinal electrical wakefield Ez=0. Between bunches of this sequence longitudinal electrical
wakefield and radial force are not zero. The focusing radial force in regions, occupied by bunches,
is constant along each bunch Fr=const. Between bunches the radial force is inhomogeneous. All positron
bunches of sequence are focused identically and uniformly.
