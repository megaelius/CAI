We describe the impact of physics education research-based pedagogical techniques in flipped
and active-engagement non-flipped courses on student performance on validated conceptual surveys.
We compare student performance in courses that make significant use of evidence-based active engagement
(EBAE) strategies with courses that primarily use lecture-based (LB) instruction. All courses
had large enrollment and often had 100-200 students. The analysis of data for validated conceptual
surveys presented here includes data from large numbers of students from two-semester sequences
of introductory algebra-based and calculus-based introductory physics courses. The conceptul
surveys used to assess student learning in the first and second semester courses were the Force Concept
Inventory and the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism, respectively. In the research
discussed here, the performance of students in EBAE courses at a particular level is compared with
LB courses in two situations: (i) the same instructor taught two courses, one of which was a flipped
course involving EBAE methods and the other an LB course, while the homework, recitations, and final
exams were kept the same; (ii) student perforamnce in all of the EBAE courses taught by different
instructors was averaged and compared with LB courses of the same type also averaged over different
instructors. In all classes, we find that students in courses that make significant use of active-engagement
strategies, on average, outperformed students in courses using primarily LB instruction of the
same type on conceptual surveys even though there was no statistically significant difference
on the pretest before instruction. We also discuss correlation between the performance on the validated
conceptual surveys and the final exam, which typically placed a heavy weight on quantitative problem
solving.
