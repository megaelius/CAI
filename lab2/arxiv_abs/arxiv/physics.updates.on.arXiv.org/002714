No consensus regarding the universal validity of any particular interpretation of the measurement
problem has been reached so far. The problem manifests strongly in various Wigner's Friend type
gedankenexperiments, of which the extended Wigner's Friend gedankenexperiment devised by Daniela
Frauchiger and Renato Renner is the most striking so far. Since these gedankenexperiments involve
comparing classical information obtained during single measurements of pure, zero entropy quantum
states (quantum information), they should, especially if rescaled to large quantum registers,
also be considered in an infinite (at least in a future direction) time interval. Only dissipative
structures provide one, of which only living organisms are capable of performing and reacting to
measurements. I conjecture that biological cell is the smallest agent capable of processing quantum
information through its cytoplasmic membrane through which it performs measurements and reacts
to the environment. I also assume that this mechanism must have been extended by natural evolution
to endo- and exosemiosis in multicellular organisms, and further to language of Homo sapiens. On
the other hand classical information is finite and obeys the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore
it relates to spatially and temporary distinguishable phenomena above the uncertainty principle
threshold and can be compared in an observer-independent theoretical framework only if the information
decay with respect to the recording medium and the storage capacity this medium provides is taken
into account. These factors were to a certain account neglected so far. I also discuss universal
Turing machines, though capable of performing measurements, yet unable to perform them infinitively,
as well as viruses, though capable of providing the infinite time interval, yet unable to perform
measurements.
