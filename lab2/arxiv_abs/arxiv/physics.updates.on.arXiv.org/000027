Nanoscale thermal properties are becoming of extreme importance for modern electronic circuits
that dissipate increasing power on the length scale of few tens of nanometers, and for chemical and
physical properties sensors and biosensors using nanoscale sized features. While Scanning Thermal
Microscopy (SThM) is known for its ability to probe thermal properties and heat generation with
nanoscale resolution, until today it was perceived impossible to use it in the liquid environment
due to dominating direct heat exchange between microfabricated thermal probe and surrounding
liquid that would deteriorate spatial resolution. Nonetheless, our theoretical analysis of SThM
in liquids showed that for certain design of SThM probe with resistive heater located near the probe
tip, their thermal signal is only moderately affected, by less than half on immersion in a dodecane
environment. More significantly, its spatial resolution, surprisingly, would remain practically
unaffected, and the thermal contact between the tip apex and the studied sample would be beneficially
improved. Our experimental trials of such immersion SThM, or iSThM, were fully successful and here
we report for the first time nanoscale SThM measurements of thermal conductivity of Ultra Large
Scale Integration polymerceramic metal interconnects with the spatial thermal resolution down
to 50 nm. Further studies of heat transport in nanoscale graphite flakes in iSThM suggested, in particular,
that highly anisotropic thermal conductivity in graphene layers may play significant role in the
nanoscale thermal transport in liquid environment. New iSThM opens a wide range of applications
from noncontact measurements of thermal transport in semiconductor devices to exploring graphene
energy storage, catalytic reactions and heat generation in biological systems.
