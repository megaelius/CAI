Organic-inorganic perovskites have shown great promise towards their application in optoelectronics.
The success of this class of material is dictated by the complex interplay between various underlying
microscopic phenomena. The structural dynamics of organic cations and the inorganic sublattice
after photoexcitation is hypothesized to have a direct effect on the material properties, thereby
affecting the overall device performance. Here, we use two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy
to reveal impulsively excited vibrational modes of methylammonium (MA) lead iodide perovskite,
which drive the structural distortion after photoexcitation. The vibrational analysis of the
measured data allows us to directly monitor the time evolution of the librational motion of the MA
cation along with the vibrational coherences of inorganic sublattice. Wavelet analysis of the
observed vibrational coherences uncovers the interplay between these two types of phonons. It
reveals the coherent generation of the librational motion of the MA cation within ~300 fs, which
is complemented by the coherent evolution of the skeletal motion of the inorganic sublattice. We
have employed time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to study the atomic motion of the
MA cation and the inorganic sublattice during the process of photoexcitation. The TDDFT calculations
support our experimental observations of the coherent generation of librational motions in the
MA cation and highlight the importance of the anharmonic interaction between the MA cation and the
inorganic sublattice. Our calculations predict the transfer of the photoinduced vibrational
coherence from the MA cation to the inorganic sublattice, which drives the skeleton motion to form
a polaronic state leading to long lifetimes of the charge carriers. This work may lead to novel design
principles for next generation of solar cell materials.
