The brain has the phenomenal ability to reorganize itself by forming new connections among neurons
and by pruning others. The so-called neural or brain plasticity facilitates the modification of
brain structure and function over different time scales. Plasticity might occur due to external
stimuli received from the environment, during recovery from brain injury, or due to modifications
within the body and brain itself. In this paper, we study the combined effect of short-term (STP)
and spike-timing-dependent plasticities (STDP) on the synaptic strength of excitatory coupled
Hodgkin-Huxley neurons and show that plasticity can facilitate the formation of modular neural
networks with complex topologies that resemble those of networks with preferential attachment
properties. In particular, we use an STDP rule that alters the synaptic coupling intensity based
on time intervals between spikes of postsynaptic and presynaptic neurons. Previous works have
shown that STDP may induce the appearance of directed connections from high to low-frequency spiking
neurons. On the other hand, STP is attributed to the release of neurotransmitters in the synaptic
cleft of neurons that alter its synaptic efficiency. Our results suggest that the combined effect
of STP and STDP with high recovery time facilitates the formation of connections among neurons with
similar spike frequencies only, a kind of preferential attachment. We then pursue this further
and show that, when starting with all-to-all neural configurations, depending on the STP recovery
time and distribution of neural frequencies, modular neural networks can emerge as a direct result
of the combined effect of STP and STDP.
