Fundamental working mechanisms of perovskite solar cells remain an elusive topic of research.
Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) application to perovskite-based devices generates uncommon features
and misleading outputs, mainly due to the lack of a stablished model for the interpretation of the
results. In this work we control the perovskite precursor concentration to fabricate a series of
perovskite-based solar cells with different amounts of perovskite absorber. Low concentration
devices present the well-known dye sensitized solar cell (DSSCs) impedance pattern. As the amount
of perovskite is increased, the characteristic impedance spectra of thin-film perovskite solar
cells (PSCs) arises. This transition is characterized by a change in the working principles, determined
by an evolution of the dominant capacitance: from the intermediate frequency chemical capacitance
of TiO2 in devices with isolated perovskite domains, to a large low-frequency capacitance signal
which divides the spectra in two sections, yet with no direct influence in final device performance.
This study allows to link experimentally, in terms of impedance behavior, PSCs with the rest of solar
cell devices via DSSCs. We observe that it is not possible to assign a single physical origin to the
different resistances determined in the impedance spectra except for the series resistance. In
contrast, resistive element present contributions from different physical processes, observing
a transport-recombination coupling. Based on this analysis we provide an equivalent circuit model
to evaluate the impedance pattern of PSCs in terms of the processes directly affecting the final
performance (i.e. considering transport-related and recombination-related losses), a crucial
tool for further development of perovskite photovoltaics.
