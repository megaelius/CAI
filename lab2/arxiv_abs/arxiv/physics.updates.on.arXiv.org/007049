Structural changes in a network representation of a system (e.g.,different experimental conditions,
time evolution), can provide insight on its organization, function and on how it responds to external
perturbations. The deeper understanding of how gene networks cope with diseases and treatments
is maybe the most incisive demonstration of the gains obtained through this differential network
analysis point-of-view, which lead to an explosion of new numeric techniques in the last decade.
However, {\it where} to focus ones attention, or how to navigate through the differential structures
can be overwhelming even for few experimental conditions. In this paper, we propose a theory and
a methodological implementation for the characterization of shared "structural roles" of nodes
simultaneously within and between networks, whose outcome is a highly {\em interpretable} map.
The main features and accuracy are investigated with numerical benchmarks generated by a stochastic
block model. Results show that it can provide nuanced and interpretable information in scenarios
with very different (i) community sizes and (ii) total number of communities, and (iii) even for
a large number of 100 networks been compared (e.g., for 100 different experimental conditions).
Then, we show evidence that the strength of the method is its "story-telling"-like characterization
of the information encoded in a set of networks, which can be used to pinpoint unexpected differential
structures, leading to further investigations and providing new insights. We provide an illustrative,
exploratory analysis of four gene co-expression networks from two cell types $\times$ two treatments
(interferon-$\beta$ stimulated or control). The method proposed here allowed us to elaborate
and test a set of very specific hypotheses related to {\em unique} and {\em subtle} nuances of the
structural differences between these networks.
