McDougall (1989) proved that neutral surfaces possess an exact geostrophic streamfunction, but
its form has remained unknown. The exact geostrophic streamfunction for neutral surfaces is derived
here. It involves a path integral of the specific volume along a neutral trajectory. On a neutral
surface, the specific volume is a multivalued function of the pressure on the surface, $\underset{\sim}{p}$.
By decomposing the neutral surface into regions where the specific volume is a single-valued function
of $\underset{\sim}{p}$, the path integral is simply a sum of integrals of these single-valued
functions. The regions are determined by the Reeb graph of $\underset{\sim}{p}$, and the neutral
trajectory is encoded by a walk on this graph. Islands, and other holes in the neutral surface, can
create cycles in the Reeb graph, causing the exact geostrophic streamfunction on a neutral surface
to be multivalued. Moreover, neutral surfaces are ill-defined in the real ocean. Hence, the topobaric
geostrophic streamfunction is presented: a single-valued approximation of the exact geostrophic
streamfunction for neutral surfaces, for use on any well-defined, approximately neutral surface.
Numerical tests on several approximately neutral surfaces reveal that the topobaric geostrophic
streamfunction estimates the geostrophic velocity with an error that is about an order of magnitude
smaller than that for any previously known geostrophic streamfunction. Also, the Montgomery potential
is generalized, leading to an alternate form of the exact geostrophic streamfunction for neutral
surfaces. This form is used to construct the orthobaric Montgomery potential, an easily computable
geostrophic streamfunction that estimates the geostrophic velocity more accurately than any
previously known geostrophic streamfunction, but less so than the topobaric geostrophic streamfunction.
