With a noticeable increase in research centered on modeling micro fluid interfaces in the framework
of mesoscopic methods, we conduct an exhaustive study of discrete unified gas-kinetics scheme
(DUGKS) in handling complicated interface deformations. High-order isotropic finite-difference
schemes are first utilized in DUGKS to improve its capability in tracking interfaces. The performance
of third-stage third-order DUGKS where source term is incorporated has also been assessed for the
first time and a series of numerical tests have been conducted to investigate their capability.
The comparative analysis have revealed the reason why the performance of lattice Boltzmann method
is superior to that of discrete velocity method and DUGKS in general condition from an informed perspective.
The mechanism behind the performance distinction between the central scheme and upwind scheme
utilized in meso-flux construction in DUGKS have also been clarified. Numerical results have shown
that the employment of high-order schemes in DUGKS does have an effect on the reduction of numerical
dissipation, but the overall accuracy of this method is limited by the precision of prediction of
source terms on mesh interface. The capability of third-stage third-order DUGKS is severely inhibited
by its intrinsic limitation of the ratio of time step to particle collision time. Among the various
kinds of DUGKS employed with different reconstruction methods, the most promising scheme is the
one with third-order isotropic reconstruction and upwind-based meso-flux evaluation, which
is able to ensure an unique balance between efficiency and accuracy.
