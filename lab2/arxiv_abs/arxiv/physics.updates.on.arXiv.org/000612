An optimisation scheme is developed to accurately represent the sub-grid scale forcing of a high
dimensional chaotic ocean system. Using a simple parameterisation scheme, the velocity components
of a 30km resolution shallow water ocean model are optimised to have the same climatological mean
and variance as that of a less viscous 7.5km resolution model. The 5 day lag-covariance is also optimised,
leading to a more accurate estimate of the high resolution response to forcing using the low resolution
model. The system considered is an idealised barotropic double gyre that is chaotic at both resolutions.
Using the optimisation scheme, we find and apply the constant in time, but spatially varying, forcing
term that is equal to the time integrated forcing of the sub-mesoscale eddies. A linear stochastic
term, independent of the large-scale flow, with no spatial correlation but a spatially varying
amplitude and time scale is used to represent the transient eddies. The climatological mean, variance
and 5 day lag-covariance of the velocity from a single high resolution integration is used to provide
an optimisation target. No other high resolution statistics are required. Additional programming
effort, for example to build a tangent linear or adjoint model, is not required either. The focus
of this paper is on the optimisation scheme and the accuracy of the optimised flow. The method can
be applied in future investigations into the physical processes that govern barotropic turbulence
and it can perhaps be applied to help understand and correct biases in the mean and variance of a more
realistic coarse or eddy-permitting ocean model. The method is complementary to current parameterisations
and can be applied at the same time without modification.
