Classical microscopy, regardless if photons or electrons are used, is based on incoherent optics
and the microscopic record represents a distribution of added intensities. Local information
of the sample is thus mapped onto local information at the detector. The resultant image exhibits
a resolution ultimately limited by the Abbe criterion respectively by the numerical aperture of
the microscope for a given wavelength. A number of super-resolution techniques in near as well as
in the far-field have been proposed which allow imaging beyond the Abbe resolution limit. In contrast
to classical optical microscopy in coherent microscopy, like holography or coherent diffraction,
the superposition principle of waves holds, implying that field amplitudes are added, not intensities.
The superposition of waves, be it light or deBroglie waves, leads to a non-local representation
of the microscopic object information, an interference pattern spread out in space beyond the scattering
object. Here we show a novel super-resolution technique based on the fact that this interference
information combined with the wave continuity allows wave extrapolation beyond the detected area
and thus circumventing the resolution limit imposed by the Abbe criterion. It is a generally accepted
notion that once a microscopy experiment has been carried out, the resolution of the experimental
record is an intrinsic property of the various experimental parameters and thus fixed once the experiment
has been completed. We show that this notion is not valid when coherent radiation is used. In fact,
fine details, originally not available in the actual experimental record can retrospectively
be recovered from just a fraction of an interference pattern. Our technique can be applied to images
obtained by any coherent imaging technique, and by any coherent type of radiation, be it light, X-rays
or electrons.
