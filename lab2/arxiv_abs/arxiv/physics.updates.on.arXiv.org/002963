Electromagnetic cyclotron waves (ECWs) near the proton cyclotron frequency are frequently observed
in the solar wind, yet their generation mechanism is still an open question. Based on the Wind data
during the years 2005$-$2015, this paper carries out a statistical study on plasma characteristics
associated with the occurrence of ECWs. The probability density distributions (PDDs) of proton
temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel$) and proton parallel beta ($\beta_\parallel$)
are investigated, where $\perp$ and $\parallel$ refer to perpendicular and parallel to the background
magnetic field, respectively. The PDDs depend on solar wind types as well as wave polarizations,
and those for ECWs with left-handed (LH) polarization exhibit considerable differences from the
PDDs for ambient solar winds. The distributions of occurrence rates of LH ECWs in ($\beta_\parallel$,
$T_\perp/T_\parallel$) space show a tendency that the occurrence rates increase with proton temperature
anisotropies. The $\beta_\parallel$ with maximum of occurrence rates is near 0.1 when $T_\perp/T_\parallel
> 1$ while it is around 1 when $T_\perp/T_\parallel < 1$. The presence of alpha$-$proton differential
flow with large kinetic energy corresponds to a much high occurrence rate as well as the domination
of LH polarization of ECWs. Based on these observations and existing theories, we propose that the
proton cyclotron and parallel firehose instabilities with effects of alpha$-$proton differential
flow are likely responsible for the local generation of LH ECWs in the solar wind. The generation
mechanism of right-handed ECWs seems to be complicated and more discussions are needed in future
researches.
