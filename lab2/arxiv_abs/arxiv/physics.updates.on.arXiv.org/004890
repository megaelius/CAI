Vertical stacking of atomically thin layered materials opens new possibilities for the fabrication
of heterostructures with favorable optoelectronic properties. The combination of graphene,
hexagonal boron nitride and semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides allows fabrication
of electroluminescence (EL) devices, compatible with a wide range of substrates. Here, we demonstrate
a full integration of an electroluminescent van der Waals heterostructure in a monolithic optical
microcavity made of two high reflectivity dielectric distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). Owing
to the presence of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride protecting the WSe$_2$ during the top mirror
deposition, we fully preserve the optoelectronic behaviour of the device. Two bright cavity modes
appear in the EL spectrum featuring Q-factors of 250 and 580 respectively: the first is attributed
directly to the monolayer area, while the second is ascribed to the portion of emission guided outside
the WSe$_2$ island. By embedding the EL device inside the microcavity structure, a significant
modification of the directionality of the emitted light is achieved, with the peak intensity increasing
by nearly two orders of magnitude at the angle of the maximum emission compared with the same EL device
without the top DBR. Furthermore, the coupling of the WSe$_2$ EL to the cavity mode with a dispersion
allows a tuning of the peak emission wavelength exceeding 35 nm (80 meV) by varying the angle at which
the EL is observed from the microcavity. This work provides a route for the development of compact
vertical-cavity surface-emitting devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.
