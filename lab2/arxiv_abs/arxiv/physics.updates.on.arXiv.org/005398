We extracted a Martian water-ice cloud climatology from OMEGA data covering 7 Martian years (MY
26-32). We derived two products, the Reversed Ice Cloud Index (ICIR) and the Percentage of Cloudy
Pixels (PCP), indicating the mean cloud thickness and nebulosity over a regular grid (1{\deg} longitude
x 1{\deg} latitude x 1{\deg} Ls x 1 h Local Time). The ICIR has been shown to be a proxy of the water-ice
column derived from the Mars Climate Database. The PCP confirms the location of the main cloud structures
mapped with the ICIR, and gives a more accurate image of the cloud cover. We observed a denser cloud
coverage over Hellas Planitia, Lunae Planum and over large volcanoes in the aphelion belt. For the
first time, thanks to the fact that Mars Express is not in Sun-synchronous orbit, we can explore the
cloud diurnal cycle at a given season by combining 7 years of observations. However, because of the
eccentric orbit, the temporal coverage remains limited. Other limitations of the dataset are its
small size, the difficult distinction between ice clouds and frosts, and the impact of surface albedo
on data uncertainty. We could nevertheless study the diurnal cloud life cycle by averaging the data
over larger regions: from specific topographic features (covering a few degrees in longitude and
latitude) up to large climatic bands (all longitudes). We found that in the tropics around northern
summer solstice, the diurnal thermal tide modulates the abundance of clouds, which is reduced around
noon. At northern midlatitudes, clouds corresponding to the edge of the north polar hood are observed
mainly in the morning and around noon during northern winter (Ls=260-30{\deg}). Over Chryse Planitia,
low lying morning fogs dissipate earlier and earlier in the afternoon during northern winter. Over
Argyre, clouds are present over all daytime during two periods, around Ls = 30 and 160{\deg}.
