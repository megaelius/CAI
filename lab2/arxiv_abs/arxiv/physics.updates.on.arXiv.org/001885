We combine three-dimensional (3D) large-eddy simulations (LES) and resolvent analysis to design
active separation control techniques on a NACA 0012 airfoil. Spanwise-periodic flows over the
airfoil at a chord-based Reynolds number of $23,000$ and a free-stream Mach number of $0.3$ are considered
at two post-stall angles of attack of $6^\circ$ and $9^\circ$. Near the leading edge, localized
unsteady thermal actuation is introduced in an open-loop manner with two tunable parameters of
actuation frequency and spanwise wavelength. For the most successful control case that achieves
full reattachment, we observe a reduction in drag by up to $49\%$ and increase in lift by up to $54\%$.
To provide physics-based guidance for the effective choice of these control input parameters,
we conduct global resolvent analysis on the baseline turbulent mean flows to identify the actuation
frequency and wavenumber that provide high energy amplification. The present analysis also considers
the use of a temporal filter to limit the time horizon for assessing the energy amplification to extend
resolvent analysis to unstable base flows. We incorporate the amplification and response mode
from resolvent analysis to provide a metric that quantifies momentum mixing associated with the
modal structure. By comparing this metric from resolvent analysis and the LES results of controlled
flows, we demonstrate that resolvent analysis can predict the effective range of actuation frequency
as well as the global response to the actuation input. Supported by the agreements between the results
from resolvent analysis and LES, we believe that this study provides insights for the use of resolvent
analysis in guiding future active flow control.
