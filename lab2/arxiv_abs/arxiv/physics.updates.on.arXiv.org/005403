Online social network (OSN) applications provide different experiences; for example, posting
a short text on Twitter and sharing photographs on Instagram. Multiple OSNs constitute a multiplex
network. For privacy protection and usage purposes, accounts belonging to the same user in different
OSNs may have different usernames, photographs, and introductions. Interlayer link prediction
in multiplex network aims at identifying whether the accounts in different OSNs belong to the same
person, which can aid in tasks including cybercriminal behavior modeling and customer interest
analysis. Many real-world OSNs exhibit a scale-free degree distribution; thus, neighbors with
different degrees may exert different influences on the node matching degrees across different
OSNs. We developed an iterative degree penalty (IDP) algorithm for interlayer link prediction
in the multiplex network. First, we proposed a degree penalty principle that assigns a greater weight
to a common matched neighbor with fewer connections. Second, we applied node adjacency matrix multiplication
for efficiently obtaining the matching degree of all unmatched node pairs. Thereafter, we used
the approved maximum value method to obtain the interlayer link prediction results from the matching
degree matrix. Finally, the prediction results were inserted into the priori interlayer node pair
set and the above processes were performed iteratively until all unmatched nodes in one layer were
matched or all matching degrees of the unmatched node pairs were equal to 0. Experiments demonstrated
that our advanced IDP algorithm significantly outperforms current network structure-based methods
when the multiplex network average degree and node overlapping rate are low.
