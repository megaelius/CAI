The present thesis deals with the non-modal linear analysis of 3D perturbations in wall flows. In
the first part,a solution to the Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire IVP, in the form of orthogonal functions
expansion, is researched. The Galerkin method is successfully implemented to numerically compute
approximate solutions for bounded flows. The Chandrasekhar functions revealed to ensure a fifth
order of accuracy. The focus of the subsequent analysis is on the transient behavior of the perturbation
frequency and phase velocity. The results confirm recent observations about a jump in the temporal
evolution of the frequency of the wall-normal velocity signal, considered as the end of an Early
Transient. After this jump, the wave frequency for Plane Couette flow experiences a periodic modulation
about the asymptotic value, which is motivated and investigated in detail. A new result is the presence
of a second frequency jump for the wall-normal vorticity. This fact, together with the possibility
for different values of the signals asymptotic frequency, shows the existence of an Intermediate
Transient. Moreover, a connection between the frequency jumps and the establishing of a self-similarity
condition in time for both the velocity and vorticity profiles is found and investigated for both
Plane Couette flow and Plane Poiseuille flow. Eventually, through superposition of waves with
limited wavenumber range, a wave packet is reconstructed for Plane Couette flow and Blasius boundary-layer
flow . The linear spot evolution revealed to have many common features with the early stages of a turbulent
spot, particularly the streaky structure and the spot shape.
