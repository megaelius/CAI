Temporal-dissipative Kerr solitons are self-localized light pulses sustained in driven nonlinear
optical resonators. Their realization in microresonators has enabled compact sources of coherent
optical frequency combs as well as the study of dissipative solitons. A key parameter of their dynamics
is the effective-detuning of the pump laser to the thermally- and Kerr-shifted cavity resonance.
Together with the free spectral range and dispersion, it governs the soliton-pulse duration, as
predicted by an approximate analytical solution of the Lugiato-Lefever equation. Yet, a precise
experimental verification of this relation was lacking so far. Here, by measuring and controlling
the effective-detuning, we establish a new way of stabilizing solitons in microresonators and
demonstrate that the measured relation linking soliton width and detuning deviates by less than
1 % from the approximate expression, validating its excellent predictive power. Furthermore,
a detuning-dependent enhancement of specific comb lines is revealed, due to linear couplings between
mode-families. They cause deviations from the predicted comb power evolution, and induce a detuning-dependent
soliton recoil that modifies the pulse repetition-rate, explaining its unexpected dependence
on laser-detuning. Finally, we observe that detuning-dependent mode-crossings can destabilize
the soliton, leading to an unpredicted soliton breathing regime (oscillations of the pulse) that
occurs in a normally-stable regime. Our results test the approximate analytical solutions with
an unprecedented degree of accuracy and provide new insights into dissipative-soliton dynamics.
