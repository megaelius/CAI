This paper examines the Standard Model under the strong-electroweak gauge group $SU_S(3)\times
U_{EW}(2)$ subject to the condition $u_{EW}(2)\not\cong su_I(2)\oplus u_Y(1)$. Physically,
the condition ensures that all electroweak gauge bosons interact with each other prior to symmetry
breaking --- as one might expect from $U(2)$ invariance. This represents a crucial shift in the notion
of physical gauge bosons: Unlike the Standard Model which posits a change of Lie algebra basis induced
by spontaneous symmetry breaking, here the basis is unaltered and $A,\,Z^0,\,W^\pm$ represent
(modulo $U_{EW}(2)$ gauge transformations) the physical bosons both \emph{before} and after
spontaneous symmetry breaking. Our choice of $u_{EW}(2)$ basis requires some modification of
the matter field sector of the Standard Model. Careful attention to the product group structure
calls for strong-electroweak degrees of freedom in the $(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2})$ and the $(\mathbf{3},\overline{\mathbf{2}})$
of $SU_S(3)\times U_{EW}(2)$ that possess integer electric charge just like leptons. These degrees
of freedom play the role of quarks, and they lead to a modified Lagrangian that nevertheless reproduces
transition rates and cross sections equivalent to the Standard Model. The close resemblance between
quark and lepton electroweak doublets in this picture suggests a mechanism for a phase transition
between quarks and leptons that stems from the product structure of the gauge group. Our hypothesis
is that the strong and electroweak bosons see each other as a source of decoherence. In effect, leptons
get identified with the $SU_S(3)$-trace of quark representations. This mechanism allows for possible
extensions of the Standard Model that don't require large inclusive multiplets of matter fields.
As an example, we propose and investigate a model that turns out to have some promising cosmological
implications.
