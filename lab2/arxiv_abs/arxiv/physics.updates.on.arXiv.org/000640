We develop an efficient hierarchy of methods that approximate the chemical master equation for
systems that are assumed to be translationally invariant and have finite spatial correlations.
The system size of each method within the hierarchy scales with the range of spatial correlations.
In principle, this hierarchy will converge to the master equation as the system size grows, and we
demonstrate this in one- and two-dimensional numerical examples. In the one-dimensional system,
we demonstrate that lower levels within the hierarchy are both significantly faster than tradition
kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) methods, by as much as three orders of magnitude for one-dimensional systems,
and predict identical system dynamics and steady states as KMC methods. We also test this methodology
on the realistic test case of oxidation of CO on RuO_2(110). In the realistic example, it is observed
that a relatively small system size within the hierarchy captures many of the important system dynamics.
We note that in the current exposition, we have found no a priori method of determining the necessary
system size of the method in the hierarchy needed to accurately approximate the master equation.
The hierarchy may be thought of as a class of generalized phenomenological kinetic models since
each element of the hierarchy approximates the master equation and the lowest level in the hierarchy
is identical to simple existing phenomenological kinetic models. In addition to the hierarchy's
efficiency, it also provides a framework in which to test whether each individual method has converged
to the correct system dynamics. We also discuss the utility of this hierarchy for predicting transition
rates from experimental data in the discussion.
