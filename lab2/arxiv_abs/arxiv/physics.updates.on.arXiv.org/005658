Many mature bacterial colonies and biofilms are complex three-dimensional (3D) structures. One
key step in their developmental program is a transition from a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer into
a 3D architecture. Despite the importance of controlling the growth of microbial colonies and biofilms
in a variety of medical and industrial settings, the underlying physical mechanisms behind single-cell
dynamics, collective behaviors of densely-packed cells, and 3D complex colony expansion remain
largely unknown. In this work, we explore the mechanisms behind the 2D-to-3D transition of motile
Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies; we provide a new motility-induced, rate-dependent buckling
mechanism for their out-of-plane growth. We find that swarming of motile bacterial colonies generate
sustained in-plane flows. We show that the viscous shear stresses and dynamic pressures arising
from these flows allow cells to overcome cell-substrate adhesion, leading to buckling of bacterial
monolayers and growth into the third dimension. Modeling bacterial monolayers as 2D fluid films,
we identify universal relationships that elucidate the competition between in-plane viscous
stresses, pressure and cell-substrate adhesion. Furthermore, we show that bacterial monolayers
can exhibit crossover from swarming to kinetically-arrested, glassy-like states above an onset
density, resulting in distinct 2D-to-3D transition mechanisms. Combining experimental observations
of P. aeruginosa colonies at single-cell resolution, molecular dynamics simulations of active
systems, and theories of glassy dynamics and 2D fluid films, we develop a dynamical state diagram
that predicts the state of the colony, and the mechanisms governing their 2D-to-3D transitions.
