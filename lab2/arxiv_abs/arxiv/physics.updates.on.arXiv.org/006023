Stochastic reduced models are an important tool in climate systems whose many spatial and temporal
scales cannot be fully discretized or underlying physics may not be fully accounted for. One form
of reduced model, the linear inverse model (LIM), has been widely used for regional climate predictability
studies - typically focusing more on tropical or mid-latitude studies. However, most LIM fitting
techniques rely on point estimation techniques deriving from fluctuation-dissipation theory.
In this methodological study we explore the use of Bayesian inference techniques for LIM parameter
estimation of sea surface temperature (SST), to quantify the skillful decadal predictability
of Bayesian LIM models at high latitudes. We show that Bayesian methods, when compared to traditional
point estimation methods for LIM-type models, provide better calibrated probabilistic skill,
while simultaneously providing better point estimates due to the regularization effect of the
prior distribution in high-dimensional problems. We compare the effect of several priors, as well
as maximum likelihood estimates, on (1) estimating parameter values on a perfect model experiment
and (2) producing calibrated 1-year SST anomaly forecast distributions using a pre-industrial
control run of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Finally, we employ a host of probabilistic
skill metrics to determine the extent to which a LIM can forecast SST anomalies at high latitudes.
We find that the choice of prior distribution has an appreciable impact on estimation outcomes,
and priors that emphasize physically relevant properties enhance the model's ability to capture
variability of SST anomalies.
