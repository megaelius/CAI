In this two-part article series we provide a generalized description of the scattering geometry
of Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) experiments, the shear distortion effects inherent
to the resulting three-dimensional (3D) image from current phase retrieval methods and strategies
to mitigate this distortion. In this Part I, we derive in general terms the real-space coordinate
transformation to correct this shear, which originates in the more fundamental relationship between
the representations of mutually conjugate 3D spaces. Such a transformation, applied as a final
post-processing step following phase retrieval, is crucial for arriving at an un-distorted and
physically meaningful image of the 3D scatterer. As the relevance of BCDI grows in the field of materials
characterization, we take this opportunity to generalize the available sparse literature that
addresses the geometric theory of BCDI and the subsequent analysis methods. This aspect, specific
to coherent Bragg diffraction and absent in two-dimensional transmission CDI experiments, gains
particular importance concerning spatially-resolved characterization of 3D crystalline materials
in a realiable, non-destructive manner. These articles describe this theory, from the diffraction
in Bragg geometry, to the corrections needed to obtain a properly rendered digital image of the 3D
scatterer. Part I provides the experimental BCDI communitcy with the theoretical underpinnings
of the 3D real-space distortions in the phase-retrieved object, along with the necessary post-retrieval
correction method. Part II builds upon the geometric theory developed in Part I with the formalism
to correct the shear distortions directly on an orthogonal grid within the phase retrieval algorithm
itself, allowing more physically realistic constraints to be applied.
