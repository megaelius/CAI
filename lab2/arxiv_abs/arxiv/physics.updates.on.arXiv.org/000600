One of the most impressive features of moving animal groups is their ability to perform sudden coherent
changes in travel direction. While this collective decision can be a response to an external perturbation,
such as the presence of a predator, recent studies show that such directional switching can also
emerge from the intrinsic fluctuations in the individual behaviour. However, the cause and the
mechanism by which such collective changes of direction occur are not fully understood yet. Here,
we present an experimental study of spontaneous collective turns in natural flocks of starlings.
We employ a recently developed tracking algorithm to reconstruct three-dimensional trajectories
of each individual bird in the flock for the whole duration of a turning event. Our approach enables
us to analyze changes in the individual behavior of every group member and reveal the emergent dynamics
of turning. We show that spontaneous turns start from individuals located at the elongated edges
of the flocks, and then propagate through the group. We find that birds on the edges deviate from the
mean direction of motion much more frequently than other individuals, indicating that persistent
localized fluctuations are the crucial ingredient for triggering a collective directional change.
Finally, we quantitatively show that birds follow equal radius paths during turning allowing the
flock to change orientation and redistribute risky locations among group members. The whole process
of turning is a remarkable example of how a self-organized system can sustain collective changes
and reorganize, while retaining coherence.
