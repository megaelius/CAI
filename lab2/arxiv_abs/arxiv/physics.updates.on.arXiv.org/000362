The relativistically induced transparency acceleration (RITA) scheme of proton and ion acceleration
using laser-plasma interactions is introduced, modeled, and compared to the existing schemes.
Protons are accelerated with femtosecond relativistic pulses to produce quasimonoenergetic
bunches with controllable peak energy. The RITA scheme works by a relativistic laser inducing transparency
to densities higher than the cold-electron critical density, while the background heavy ions are
stationary. The rising laser pulse creates a traveling acceleration structure at the relativistic
critical density by ponderomotively driving a local electron density inflation, creating an electron
snowplow and a co-propagating electrostatic potential. The snowplow advances with a velocity
determined by the rate of the rise of the laser's intensity envelope and the heavy-ion-plasma density
gradient scale length. The rising laser is incrementally rendered transparent to higher densities
such that the relativistic-electron plasma frequency is resonant with the laser frequency. In
the snowplow frame, trace density protons reflect off the electrostatic potential and get snowplowed,
while the heavier background ions are relatively unperturbed. Quasimonoenergetic bunches of
velocity equal to twice the snowplow velocity can be obtained and tuned by controlling the snowplow
velocity using laser-plasma parameters. An analytical model for the proton energy as a function
of laser intensity, rise time, and plasma density gradient is developed and compared to 1D and 2D
PIC OSIRIS simulations. We model the acceleration of protons to GeV energies with tens-of-femtoseconds
laser pulses of a few petawatts. The scaling of proton energy with laser power compares favorably
to other mechanisms for ultrashort pulses.
