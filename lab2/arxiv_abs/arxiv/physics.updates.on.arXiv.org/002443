We develop a physical and computational model for performing fully coupled, particle-resolved
Direct Numerical Simulations of cohesive sediment, based on the Immersed Boundary Method. The
model distributes the cohesive forces over a thin shell surrounding each particle, thereby allowing
for the spatial and temporal resolution of the cohesive forces during particle-particle interactions.
The influence of the cohesive forces is captured by a single dimensionless parameter in the form
of a cohesion number, which represents the ratio of cohesive and gravitational forces acting on
a particle. We test and validate the cohesive force model for binary particle interactions in the
Drafting-Kissing-Tumbling (DKT) configuration. The DKT simulations demonstrate that cohesive
particle pairs settle in a preferred orientation, with particles of very different sizes preferentially
aligning themselves in the vertical direction, so that the smaller particle is drafted in the wake
of the larger one. To test this mechanism in a system of higher complexity, we perform large simulations
of 1,261 polydisperse settling particles starting from rest. These simulations reproduce several
earlier experimental observations by other authors, such as the accelerated settling of sand and
silt particles due to particle bonding. The simulations demonstrate that cohesive forces accelerate
the overall settling process primarily because smaller grains attach to larger ones and settle
in their wakes. For the present cohesion number values, we observe that settling can be accelerated
by up to 29%. We propose physically based parametrization of classical hindered settling functions
proposed by earlier authors, in order to account for cohesive forces. An investigation of the energy
budget shows that the work of the collision forces can substantially modify the relevant energy
conversion processes.
