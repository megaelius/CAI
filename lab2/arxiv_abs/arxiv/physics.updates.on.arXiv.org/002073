Using the techniques of optomechanics, a high-$Q$ mechanical oscillator may serve as a link between
electromagnetic modes of vastly different frequencies. This approach has successfully been exploited
for the frequency conversion of classical signals and has the potential of performing quantum state
transfer between superconducting circuitry and a traveling optical signal. Such transducers
are often operated in a linear regime, where the hybrid system can be described using linear response
theory based on the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. While mathematically straightforward to
solve, this approach yields little intuition about the dynamics of the hybrid system to aid the optimization
of the transducer. As an analysis and design tool for such electro-optomechanical transducers,
we introduce an equivalent circuit formalism, where the entire transducer is represented by an
electrical circuit. Thereby we integrate the transduction functionality of optomechanical systems
into the toolbox of electrical engineering allowing the use of its well-established design techniques.
This unifying impedance description can be applied both for static (DC) and harmonically varying
(AC) drive fields, accommodates arbitrary linear circuits, and is not restricted to the resolved-sideband
regime. Furthermore, by establishing the quantized input-output formalism for the equivalent
circuit, we obtain the scattering matrix for linear transducers using circuit analysis, and thereby
have a complete quantum mechanical characterization of the transducer. Hence, this mapping of
the entire transducer to the language of electrical engineering both sheds light on how the transducer
performs and can at the same time be used to optimize its performance by aiding the design of a suitable
electrical circuit.
