We investigate the electrohydrodynamics of an initially spherical droplet under the influence
of an external alternating electric field by conducting axisymmetric numerical simulations using
a charge-conservative volume-of-fluid based finite volume flow solver. The mean amplitude of
shape oscillations of a droplet subjected to an alternating electric field for leaky dielectric
fluids is the same as the steady-state deformation under an equivalent root mean squared direct
electric field for all possible electrical conductivity ratio $(K_r)$ and permittivity ratio
$(S)$ of the droplet to the surrounding fluid. In contrast, our simulations for weakly conducting
media show that this equivalence between alternating and direct electric fields does not hold for
$K_r \ne S$. Moreover, for a range of parameters, the deformation obtained using the alternating
and direct electric fields is qualitatively different, i.e. for low $K_r$ and high $S$, the droplet
becomes prolate under alternating electric field but deforms to an oblate shape in the case of the
equivalent direct electric field. A parametric study is conducted by varying the time period of
the applied alternating electric field, the permittivity and the electrical conductivity ratios.
It is observed that while increasing $K_r$ has a negligible effect on the deformation dynamics of
the droplet for $K_r<S$, it enhances the deformation of the droplet when $K_r>S$ for both alternating
and direct electric fields. We believe that our results may be of immense consequence in explaining
the morphological evolution of droplets in a plethora of scenarios ranging from nature to biology.
