Composites are ideally suited to achieve desirable multifunctional effective properties, since
the best properties of different materials can be judiciously combined with designed microstructures.
Here we establish the first cross-property relations for two-phase composite media that link effective
elastic and electromagnetic wave characteristics to one another, including effective wave speeds
and attenuation coefficients. This is achieved by deriving accurate formulas for the effective
elastodynamic properties that depend on the microstructure via the spectral density and utilizing
previous analogous results for effective electromagnetic properties. Our formulas enable us
to explore the wave characteristics of a broad class of disordered microstructures, including
exotic disordered "hyperuniform" varieties, that can have advantages over crystalline ones,
such as nearly optimal, direction-independent properties and robustness against defects. We
specifically show that disordered "stealthy" hyperuniform/nonhyperuniform microstructures
exhibit novel elastic wave characteristics that have the potential for future applications, e.g.,
low-pass or narrow-band-pass (using negative Poisson ratio materials) filters that transmit
or absorb elastic waves "isotropically" for a range of wavenumbers. We also demonstrate that two-phase
media with engineered disorder and phase properties can exhibit "anomalous dispersion" with resonance-like
attenuation. Our cross-property relations for effective wave characteristics can be applied
to design multifunctional composites via inverse techniques, including exterior components
of spacecraft or building materials, and heat-sinks for CPUs, and nondestructive evaluation of
the elastic moduli of materials from the effective dielectric response.
