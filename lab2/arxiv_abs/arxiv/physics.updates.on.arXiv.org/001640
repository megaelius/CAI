Direct numerical simulations (DNS) indicate that at large values of the Rayleigh number ($Ra$)
convection in porous media self-organizes into narrowly-spaced columnar flows, with more complex
spatiotemporal features being confined to boundary layers near the top and bottom walls. In this
investigation of high-$Ra$ porous media convection in a minimal flow unit, two reduced modeling
strategies are proposed that exploit these specific flow characteristics. Both approaches utilize
the idea of decomposition since the flow exhibits different dynamics in different regions of the
domain: small-scale cellular motions generally are localized within the thermal and vorticity
boundary layers near the upper and lower walls, while in the interior, the flow exhibits persistent
large-scale structures and only a few low (horizontal) wavenumber Fourier modes are active. Accordingly,
in the first strategy, the domain is decomposed into two near-wall regions and one interior region.
Our results confirm that suppressing the interior high-wavenumber modes has negligible impact
on the essential structural features and transport properties of the flow. In the second strategy,
a hybrid reduced model is constructed by using Galerkin projection onto a fully \emph{a priori}
eigenbasis drawn from energy stability and upper bound theory, thereby extending the model reduction
strategy developed by Chini \emph{et al.} (\emph{Physica~D}, vol. 240, 2011, pp. 241--248) to
large $Ra$. The results indicate that the near-wall upper-bound eigenmodes can economically represent
the small-scale rolls within the exquisitely-thin thermal boundary layers. Relative to DNS, the
hybrid algorithm enables over an order-of-magnitude increase in computational efficiency with
only a modest loss of accuracy.
