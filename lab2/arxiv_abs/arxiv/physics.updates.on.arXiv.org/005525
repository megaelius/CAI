In order to ask for future concepts of relativity, one has to build upon the original concepts instead
of the nowadays common formalism only, and as such recall and reconsider some of its roots in geometry.
So in order to discuss 3-space and dynamics, we recall briefly Minkowski's approach in 1910 implementing
the nowadays commonly used 4-vector calculus and related tensorial representations as well as
Klein's 1910 paper on the geometry of the Lorentz group. To include microscopic representations,
we discuss few aspects of Wigner's and Weinberg's 'boost' approach to describe 'any spin' with respect
to its reductive Lie algebra and coset theory, and we relate the physical identification to objects
in $P^{5}$ based on the case $(1,0)\oplus(0,1)$ of the electromagnetic field. So instead of following
this -- in some aspects -- special and misleading 'old' representation theory, based on 4-vector
calculus and tensors, we provide and use an alternative representation based on line geometry which
-- besides comprising known representation theory -- is capable of both describing (classical)
projective geometry of 3-space as well as it yields spin matrices and the classical Lie transfer.
In addition, this geometry is capable of providing a more general route to known Lie symmetries,
especially of the su(2)$\oplus$i~su(2) Lie algebra of special relativity, as well as it comprises
gauge theories and affine geometry. Thus it serves as foundation for a future understanding of more
general representation theory of relativity based, however, on roots known from classical projective
geometry and $P^{5}$. As an application, we discuss Lorentz transformations in point space in terms
of line and Complex geometry, where we can identify them as...
