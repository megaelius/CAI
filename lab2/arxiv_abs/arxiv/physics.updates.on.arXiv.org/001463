We experimentally optimize mixing of a turbulent round jet using machine learning control (MLC)
following Li et al (2017). The jet is manipulated with one unsteady minijet blowing in wall-normal
direction close to the nozzle exit. The flow is monitored with two hotwire sensors. The first sensor
is positioned on the centerline 5 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle exit, i.e. the end of the
potential core, while the second is located 3 jet diameters downstream and displaced towards the
shear-layer. The mixing performance is monitored with mean velocity at the first sensor. A reduction
of this velocity correlates with increased entrainment near the potential core. Machine Learning
Control (MLC) is employed to optimize sensor feedback, a general open-loop broadband frequency
actuation and combinations of both. MLC has identified the optimal periodic forcing with a small
duty cycle as the best control policy employing only 400 actuation measurements, each lasting for
5 seconds. This learning rate is comparable if not faster than typical optimization of periodic
forcing with two free parameters (frequency and duty cycle). In addition, MLC results indicate
that neither new frequencies nor sensor feedback improves mixing further-contrary to many of other
turbulence control experiments. The optimality of pure periodic actuation may be attributed to
the simple jet flapping mechanism in the minijet plane. The performance of sensor feedback is shown
to face a challenge for small duty cycles. The jet mixing results demonstrate the untapped potential
of MLC in quickly learning optimal general control policies, even deciding between open- and closed-loop
control.
