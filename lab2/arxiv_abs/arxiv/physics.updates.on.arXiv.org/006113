The climatic controls on the stable carbon isotopic composition (d13C) of speleothem carbonate
are less often discussed in the scientific literature in contrast to the frequently used stable
oxygen isotopes. Various local processes influence speleothem d13C values and confident and detailed
interpretations of this proxy are often complex. A better understanding of speleothem d13C values
is critical to improving the amount of information that can be gained from existing and future records.
This contribution aims to disentangle the various processes governing speleothem d13C values
and assess their relative importance. Using a large data set of previously published records we
examine the spatial imprint of climate-related processes in speleothem d13C values deposited
post-1900 CE, a period during which global temperature and climate data is readily available. Additionally,
we investigate the causes for differences in average d13C values and growth rate under identical
climatic conditions by analysing pairs of contemporaneously deposited speleothems from the same
caves. This approach allows to focus on carbonate dissolution and fractionation processes during
carbonate precipitation, which we evaluate using existing geochemical models. Our analysis of
a large global data set of records reveals evidence for a temperature control, likely driven by vegetation
and soil processes, on d13C values in recently deposited speleothems. Moreover, data-model intercomparison
shows that calcite precipitation occurring along water flow paths prior to reaching the top of the
speleothem can explain the wide d13C range observed for concurrently deposited samples from the
same cave. We demonstrate that using the combined information of contemporaneously growing speleothems
is a powerful tool to decipher controls on d13C values ...
