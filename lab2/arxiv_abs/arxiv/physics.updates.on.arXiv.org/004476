Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has long been considered to be among "the gold standards" of diagnostic
medical imaging. The long acquisition times, however, render MRI prone to motion artifacts, let
alone their adverse contribution to the relative high costs of MRI examination. Over the last few
decades, multiple studies have focused on the development of both physical and post-processing
methods for accelerated acquisition of MRI scans. These two approaches, however, have so far been
addressed separately. On the other hand, recent works in optical computational imaging have demonstrated
growing success of concurrent learning-based design of data acquisition and image reconstruction
schemes. In this work, we propose a novel approach to the learning of optimal schemes for conjoint
acquisition and reconstruction of MRI scans, with the optimization carried out simultaneously
with respect to the time-efficiency of data acquisition and the quality of resulting reconstructions.
To be of a practical value, the schemes are encoded in the form of general k-space trajectories, whose
associated magnetic gradients are constrained to obey a set of predefined hardware requirements
(as defined in terms of, e.g., peak currents and maximum slew rates of magnetic gradients). With
this proviso in mind, we propose a novel algorithm for the end-to-end training of a combined acquisition-reconstruction
pipeline using a deep neural network with differentiable forward- and back-propagation operators.
We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in application to both image reconstruction
and image segmentation, reporting substantial improvements in terms of acceleration factors
as well as the quality of these end tasks.
