The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) threatens the lives of millions of people around the world,
making it the largest health threat in recent times. Billions of people around the world are asked
to adhere to strict shelter-in-place rules, finalised to slow down the spread of the virus. Appeals
and messages are being used by leaders and policy-makers to promote pandemic response. Given the
stakes at play, it is thus important for social scientists to explore which messages are most effective
in promoting pandemic response. In fact, some papers in the last month have explored the effect of
several messages on people's intentions to engage in pandemic response behaviour. In this paper,
we make two contributions. First, we explore the effect of messages on people's actual engagement,
and not on intentions. Specifically, our dependent variables are the level of understanding of
official COVID-19 pandemic response governmental informative panels, measured through comprehension
questions, and the time spent on reading these rules. Second, we test a novel set of appeals built
through the theory of norms. One message targets the personal norm (what people think is the right
thing to do), one targets the descriptive norm (what people think others are doing), and one targets
the injunctive norm (what people think others approve or disapprove of). Our experiment is conducted
online with a representative (with respect to gender, age, and location) sample of Italians. Norms
are made salient using a flier. We find that norm-based fliers had no effect on comprehension and
on time spent on the panels. These results suggest that norm-based interventions through fliers
have very little impact on people's reading and understanding of COVID-19 pandemic response governmental
rules.
