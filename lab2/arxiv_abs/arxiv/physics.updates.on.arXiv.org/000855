We examine the momentum and angular-momentum (AM) properties of monochromatic optical fields
in dispersive and inhomogeneous isotropic media, using the Abraham- and Minkowski-type approaches,
as well as the kinetic (Poynting-like) and canonical (with separate spin and orbital degrees of
freedom) pictures. While the kinetic Abraham-Poynting momentum describes the energy flux and
the group velocity of the wave, the Minkowski-type quantities, with proper dispersion corrections,
describe the actual momentum and angular momentum carried by the wave. The kinetic Minkowski-type
momentum and AM densities agree with phenomenological results derived by Philbin. Using the canonical
spin-orbital decomposition, previously used for free-space fields, we find the corresponding
canonical momentum, spin and orbital AM of light in a dispersive inhomogeneous medium. These acquire
a very natural form analogous to the Brillouin energy density and are valid for arbitrary structured
fields. The general theory is applied to a non-trivial example of a surface plasmon-polariton (SPP)
wave at a metal-vacuum interface. We show that the integral momentum of the SPP per particle corresponds
to the SPP wave vector, and hence exceeds the momentum of a photon in the vacuum. We also provide the
first accurate calculation of the transverse spin and orbital AM of the SPP. While the intrinsic
orbital AM vanishes, the transverse spin can change its sign depending on the SPP frequency. Importantly,
we present both macroscopic and microscopic calculations, thereby proving the validity of the
general phenomenological results. The microscopic theory also predicts a transverse magnetization
in the metal (i.e., a magnetic moment for the SPP) as well as the corresponding direct magnetization
current, which explains the difference between the Abraham and Minkowski momenta.
