Oxidation strongly influences the properties of magnetic layers employed in spintronic devices.
We study the effect of oxidation on the structural, magnetic, and electrical properties as well
as current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in Pt/Co/AlOx, Pt/CoOx/Co/AlOx, and PtOx/Co/AlOx
layers. We show how the saturation magnetization, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, anomalous
Hall resistance, and SOT are systematically affected by the degree of oxidation of both the Pt/Co
and Co/Al interfaces. Oxidation of the Co/Al interface results in a 21% and 42% variation of the dampinglike
and fieldlike SOT efficiencies, which peak at 0.14 and 0.07, respectively. The insertion of a paramagnetic
CoOx layer between Pt and Co maintains a very strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and improves
the dampinglike and fieldlike SOT efficiencies, up to 0.26 and 0.20, respectively. In contrast
with recent reports, we do not find that the oxidation of Pt leads to a significant enhancement of
the torques. Rather, we find that oxygen migrates from Pt to the Co and Al layers, leading to a time-dependent
oxidation profile and an effective spin Hall conductivity that decreases with increasing oxygen
concentration. Finally, we study current-induced switching in Pt/Co/AlOx with different degrees
of oxidation and find a linear relationship between the critical switching current and the effective
magnetic anisotropy controlled by the oxidation of Al. These results highlight the importance
of interfaces and oxidation effects on the SOT and magnetotransport properties of heavy metal/ferromagnet/oxide
trilayers and provide information on how to improve the SOT efficiency and magnetization-switching
characteristics of these systems.
