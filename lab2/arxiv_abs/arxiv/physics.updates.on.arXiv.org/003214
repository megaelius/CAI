The resolvent formulation of the Navier$\text{--}$Stokes equations gives a means for the characterization
and prediction of features of turbulent flows$\text{---}$such as statistics, structures and
their nonlinear interactions$\text{---}$using the singular value decomposition of the resolvent
operator based on the appropriate turbulent mean, following the framework developed by McKeon
& Sharma (2010). This work will describe a methodology for approximating leading resolvent (i.e.,
pseudospectral) modes for shear-driven turbulent flows using prescribed analytic functions.
We will demonstrate that these functions, which arise from the consideration of wavepacket pseudoeigenmodes
of simplified linear operators (Trefethen 2005), in particular give an accurate approximation
of the class of nominally wall-detached modes that are centered about the critical layer. Focusing
in particular on modeling wall-normal vorticity modes, we present a series of simplifications
to the governing equations that result in scalar differential operators that are amenable to such
analysis. We demonstrate that the leading wall-normal vorticity response mode for the full Navier$\text{--}$Stokes
equations may be accurately approximated by considering a second order scalar operator, equipped
with a non-standard inner product. The variation in mode shape as a function of wavenumber and Reynolds
number may be captured by evolving a low dimensional differential equation in parameter space.
This characterization provides a theoretical framework for understanding the origin of observed
structures, and allows for rapid estimation of dominant resolvent mode characteristics without
the need for operator discretization or large numerical computations. We relate our findings to
classical lift-up and Orr amplification mechanisms in shear-driven flows.
