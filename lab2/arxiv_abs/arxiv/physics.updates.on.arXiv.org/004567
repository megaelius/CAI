Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase) is a large dodecameric enzyme with six active sites that
exhibits allostery: its catalytic rate is modulated by the binding of various substrates at distal
points from the active sites. A recently developed method, bond-to-bond propensity analysis,
has proven capable of predicting allosteric sites in a wide range of proteins using an energy-weighted
atomistic graph obtained from the protein structure and given knowledge only of the location of
the active site. Bond-to-bond propensity establishes if energy fluctuations at given bonds have
significant effects on any other bond in the protein, by considering their propagation through
the protein graph. In this work, we use bond-to-bond propensity analysis to study different aspects
of ATCase activity using three different protein structures and sources of fluctuations. First,
we predict key residues and bonds involved in the transition between inactive (T) and active (R)
states of ATCase by analysing allosteric substrate binding as a source of energy perturbations
in the protein graph. Our computational results also indicate that the effect of multiple allosteric
binding is non linear: a switching effect is observed after a particular number and arrangement
of substrates is bound suggesting a form of long range communication between the distantly arranged
allosteric sites. Second, cooperativity is explored by considering a bisubstrate analogue as
the source of energy fluctuations at the active site, also leading to the identification of highly
significant residues to the T-R transition that enhance cooperativity across active sites. Finally,
the inactive (T) structure is shown to exhibit a strong, non linear communication between the allosteric
sites and the interface between catalytic subunits, rather than the active site.
