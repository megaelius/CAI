The Neutron and its mirror counterpart, a sterile state degenerate in mass, could spontaneously
mix in a process much faster than the neutron $\beta$-decay. Two separate groups have performed
series of experiments in search of mirror-neutron oscillations and reported having found no evidence,
setting stringent limits on the oscillation time $\tau_{nn'}$. Recently, these data sets have
been further analyzed, and statistically significant signals compatible with neutron mirror-neutron
oscillations in the presence of mirror magnetic fields, have been found. The current leading constraint
on $\tau_{nn'}$ does not exclude these signals. The neutron Electric Dipole Moment Collaboration
based at the Paul Scherrer Institute performed a new series of experiments to test these signals.
In this paper, we describe and motivate our choice of run configurations with an optimal filling
time of $29~$s, storage times of $180~$s and $380~$s, and applied magnetic fields of $10~\mu$T and
$20~\mu$T. The choice of these run configurations provide for a reliable overlap in performance
with the previous efforts and also optimizes the sensitivity to test the signals. We also elaborate
upon the technique of normalizing the neutron counts, making such a counting experiment based on
the ultra-cold neutron source at Paul Scherrer Institute possible. Furthermore, the magnetic
field characterization has been demonstrated to meet the requirements of this neutron mirror-neutron
search. Finally, we show that this effort has a statistical sensitivity comparable to the current
leading constraints for neutron mirror-neutron oscillation.
