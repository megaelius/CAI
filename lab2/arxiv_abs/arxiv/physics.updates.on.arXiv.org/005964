A high sensitivity force sensor based on dielectric microspheres in vacuum, optically trapped
by a single, upward-propagating laser beam is described. Off-axis parabolic mirrors are used both
to focus the 1064~nm trapping beam and to recollimate it to provide information on the horizontal
position of the microsphere. The vertical degree of freedom is readout by forming an interferometer
between the light retroreflected by the microsphere and a reference beam, hence eliminating the
need for auxiliary beams. The focus of the trapping beam has a 1/e$^2$ radius of 3.2 $\mu$m and small
non-Gaussian tails, suitable for bringing devices close to the trapped microsphere without disturbing
the optical field. Electrodes surrounding the trapping region provide excellent control of the
electric field, which can be used to drive the translational degrees of freedom of a charged microsphere
and the rotational degrees of freedom of a neutral microsphere, coupling to its electric dipole
moment. With this control, the charge state can be determined with single electron precision, the
mass of individual microspheres can be measured, and empirical calibrations of the force sensitivity
can be made for each microsphere. A force noise of $<1\times10^{-17}$ N/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ is measured
on all three degrees of freedom for 4.7 $\mu$m diameter, 84 pg silica microspheres. Various devices
have been brought within $1.6~\mu$m of the surface of a trapped microsphere. Metrology in the trapping
region is provided by two custom-designed microscopes providing views in the horizontal and one
of the vertical planes. The apparatus opens the way to performing high sensitivity three-dimensional
force measurements at short distance.
