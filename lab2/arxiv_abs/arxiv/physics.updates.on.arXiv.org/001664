High overpotentials, particularly an issue of common anode materials, hamper the process of water
electrolysis for clean energy generation. Thanks to immense research efforts up to date oxygen
evolution electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements work efficiently and stably in neutral
and alkaline regimes. However, non-noble metal-based anode materials that can withstand low pH
regimes are considered to be an indispensable prerequisite for the water splitting to succeed in
the future. All oxygen evolving electrodes working durably and actively in acids contain Ir at least
as an additive. Due to its scarcity and high acquisition costs noble elements like Pt, Ru and Ir need
to be replaced by earth abundant elements. We have evaluated a Ni containing stainless steel for
use as an oxygen-forming electrode in diluted H2SO4. Unmodified Ni42 steel showed a significant
weight loss after long term OER polarization experiments. Moreover, a substantial loss of the OER
performance of the untreated steel specimen seen in linear sweep voltammetry measurements turned
out to be a serious issue. However, upon anodization in LiOH, Ni42 alloy was rendered in OER electrocatalysts
that exhibit under optimized synthesis conditions stable overpotentials down to 445 mV for 10 mA
cm-2 current density at pH 0. Even more important: The resulting material has proven to be robust
upon long-term usage (weight loss: 20 mug/mm2 after 50 ks of chronopotentiometry at pH 1) towards
OER in H2SO4. Our results suggest that electrochemical oxidation of Ni42 steel in LiOH (sample Ni42Li205)
results in the formation of a metal oxide containing outer zone that supports solution route-based
oxygen evolution in acidic regime accompanied by a good stability of the catalyst.
