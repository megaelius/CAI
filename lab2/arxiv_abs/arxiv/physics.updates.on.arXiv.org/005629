Biologically, for any organism life does not start at birth but at fertilization of the embryo. Embryonic
development is of great importance because it determines congenital anomalies and influences
their severity. Whereas there is detailed qualitative knowledge of the successive steps of embryonic
development, little is known about their probabilities of success or failure. Embryonic mortality
as a function of post fertilization time provides a simple (albeit crude) way to identify major defects.
We find that, in line with the few other species for which data are available, the embryonic mortality
of zebrafish has a prominent peak shortly after fertilization. This is called the early embryonic
mortality (EEM) effect. Although a number of immediate causes of death (e.g. infection, excess
of carbon dioxide or of lactic acid, chromosomal defects) can be cited, the common underlying factor
remains unknown. After reviewing embryonic mortality data available for chicken and a few other
farm animals, we explain that zebrafish are particularly suited for such a study because embryogenesis
can be followed from its very beginning and can be observed easily thanks to transparent egg shells.
We report the following findings. (i) The mortality peak occurs in the first 15% of the 75-80 hours
of embryogenesis and it is about 50 times higher than the low plateau which follows. (ii) The shape
of the age-specific death rate is largely independent of the death level. Presently, little is known
about the nature of embryonic defects. However, by reviewing two special cases we show that even
small initial defects, e.g. spatial cellular asymmetries or irregularities in the timing of development,
carry with them lethal effects in later stages of embryogenesis.
