In this paper, we develop a model to describe the generalized wave-particle instability in a quasi-neutral
plasma. We analyze the quasi-linear diffusion equation for particles by expressing an arbitrary
unstable and resonant wave mode as a Gaussian wave packet, allowing for an arbitrary direction of
propagation with respect to the background magnetic field. We show that the localized energy density
of the Gaussian wave packet determines the velocity-space range in which the dominant wave-particle
instability and counter-acting damping contributions are effective. Moreover, we derive a relation
describing the diffusive trajectories of resonant particles in velocity space under the action
of such an interplay between the wave-particle instability and damping. For the numerical computation
of our theoretical model, we develop a mathematical approach based on the Crank-Nicolson scheme
to solve the full quasi-linear diffusion equation. Our numerical analysis solves the time evolution
of the velocity distribution function under the action of a dominant wave-particle instability
and counter-acting damping, and shows a good agreement with our theoretical description. As an
application, we use our model to study the oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability, which
is proposed as a scattering mechanism for strahl electrons in the solar wind. In addition, we numerically
solve the full Fokker-Planck equation to compute the time evolution of the electron-strahl distribution
function under the action of Coulomb collisions with core electrons and protons after the collisionless
action of the oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability.
