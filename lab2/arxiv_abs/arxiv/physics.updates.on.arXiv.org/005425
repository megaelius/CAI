The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe, the dynamics of the supernovae
that produced the heavy elements necessary for life, and whether protons eventually decay -- these
mysteries at the forefront of particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early
evolution of our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. The Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE) is an international world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions
as it searches for leptonic charge-parity symmetry violation, stands ready to capture supernova
neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified theory underlying
the standard model. The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE physics
program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE liquid argon TPC far detector
modules. Volume III of this TDR describes how the activities required to design, construct, fabricate,
install, and commission the DUNE far detector modules are organized and managed. This volume details
the organizational structures that will carry out and/or oversee the planned far detector activities
safely, successfully, on time, and on budget. It presents overviews of the facilities, supporting
infrastructure, and detectors for context, and it outlines the project-related functions and
methodologies used by the DUNE technical coordination organization, focusing on the areas of integration
engineering, technical reviews, quality assurance and control, and safety oversight. Because
of its more advanced stage of development, functional examples presented in this volume focus primarily
on the single-phase (SP) detector module.
