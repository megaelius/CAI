We present a systematically improvable tensor hypercontraction (THC) factorization based on
interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF). We illustrate algorithmic details to achieve
this within the framework of Becke's atom-centered quadrature grid. A single ISDF parameter $c_\text{ISDF}$
controls the tradeoff between accuracy and cost. In particular, $c_\text{ISDF}$ sets the number
of interpolation points used in THC, $N_\text{IP} = c_\text{ISDF}\times N_\text{X}$ with $N_\text{X}$
being the number of auxiliary basis functions. In conjunction with the resolution-of-the-identity
(RI) technique, we develop and investigate the THC-RI algorithms for cubic-scaling exact exchange
for Hartree-Fock and range-separated hybrids (e.g., $\omega$B97X-V) and quartic-scaling second-
and third-order M{\o}ller-Plesset theory (MP2 and MP3). These algorithms were evaluated over
the W4-11 thermochemistry (atomization energy) set and A24 non-covalent interaction benchmark
set with standard Dunning basis sets (cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVDZ, and aug-cc-pVTZ). We demonstrate
the convergence of THC-RI algorithms to numerically exact RI results using ISDF points. Based on
these, we make recommendations on $c_\text{ISDF}$ for each basis set and method. We also demonstrate
the utility of THC-RI exact exchange and MP2 for larger systems such as water clusters and $\text{C}_{20}$.
We stress that more challenges await in obtaining accurate and numerically stable THC factorization
for wavefunction amplitudes as well as the space spanned by virtual orbitals in large basis sets
and implementing sparsity-aware THC-RI algorithms.
