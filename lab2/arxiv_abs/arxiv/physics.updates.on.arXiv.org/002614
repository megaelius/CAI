The creation of delocalized coherent superpositions of quantum systems experiencing different
relativistic effects is an important milestone in future research at the interface of gravity and
quantum mechanics. This could be achieved by generating a superposition of quantum clocks that
follow paths with different gravitational time dilation and investigating the consequences on
the interference signal when they are eventually recombined. Light-pulse atom interferometry
with elements employed in optical atomic clocks is a promising candidate for that purpose, but suffers
from major challenges including its insensitivity to the gravitational redshift in a uniform field.
All these difficulties can be overcome with a novel scheme presented here which is based on initializing
the clock when the spatially separate superposition has already been generated and performing
a doubly differential measurement where the differential phase shift between the two internal
states is compared for different initialization times. This can be exploited to test the universality
of the gravitational redshift with delocalized coherent superpositions of quantum clocks and
it is argued that its experimental implementation should be feasible with a new generation of 10-meter
atomic fountains that will soon become available. Interestingly, the approach also offers significant
advantages for more compact set-ups based on guided interferometry or hybrid configurations.
Furthermore, in order to provide a solid foundation for the analysis of the various interferometry
schemes and the effects that can be measured with them, a general formalism for a relativistic description
of atom interferometry in curved spacetime is developed. It can deal with freely falling atoms,
but also include the effects of external forces and guiding potentials, and can be applied to a very
wide range of situations.
