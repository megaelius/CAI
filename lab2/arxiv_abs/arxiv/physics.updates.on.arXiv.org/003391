We present a direct numerical simulation to investigate the dynamics and statistics of reorientations
of large-scale circulation (LSC) in turbulent rotating Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection (RRBC)
for air ($Pr=0.7$) contained in a cylindrical cell with unit aspect ratio. A wide range of rotation
rates ($0\leq Ro^{-1}\leq 30$) is considered for two different Rayleigh numbers $Ra=2\times10^6$
and $2\times10^7$. Using the Fourier mode analysis of time series data obtained from the different
probes placed in the azimuthal direction of the container at the mid-plane, the orientation and
associated dynamics of LSC are characterized. The amplitude of the first Fourier mode quantifies
the strength of LSC and its phase $\Phi_1$ gives the information of the azimuthal orientation of
LSC. Based on the energy contained in the Fourier modes different flow regimes are identified as
the rotation rate is varied for a given Rayleigh number. LSC structure is observed in the low rotation
regime ( $Ro^{-1} \lesssim 1$). A strong correlation between the orientation of LSC structure and
the heat transfer and boundary layer dynamics is observed. In the LSC regime, the dissipation rates
follow the log-normal behaviour, while at higher rotation rates, a clear departure from log-normality
is noticed. Different types of reorientations, namely, rotation-led, cessation-led, partial
and complete reversal are identified. The distribution of change in orientation of LSC follows
a power law behaviour as $P(|\Delta \Phi_1|) \propto |\Delta \Phi_1|^{-m}$, with the exponent
$m\approx 3.7$. In addition, the statistics of time interval between successive reorientations
follow a Poisson distribution. These observations are in good agreement with earlier experimental
results.
