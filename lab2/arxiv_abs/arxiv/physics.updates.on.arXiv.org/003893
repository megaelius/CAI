The concept of a next-generation spallation-driven ultracold neutron (UCN) source capable of
delivering an integrated flux of $\sim 10^{9}\,{\rm UCN\,s^{-1}}$ is presented. A novel "inverse
geometry" design is used with 40 liters of superfluid $^4$He (He-II) as converter cooled with state-of-the-art
sub-cooled cryogenic technology to $\sim$1.6 K. Our design is optimized for a 100 W maximum thermal
heat load constraint on the He-II and its vessel. We use a modified Lujan-Center Mark-3 target for
UCN production as a benchmark, then present our baseline inverse geometry source design that gives
a total UCN production rate of $P_{\rm UCN} = 2.4\times 10^{8}\,{\rm s^{-1}}$. In our geometry,
the spallation target is wrapped symmetrically around the He-II volume and moderators to permit
raster scanning the proton beam over a relatively large volume of tungsten spallation target to
reduce the demand on the cooling requirements, which makes it reasonable to assume water edge-cooling
is sufficient. Our design is refined in several steps to reach $P_{\rm UCN} = 2.1\times 10^{9}\,{\rm
s^{-1}}$ under our other restriction of 1 MW maximum proton beam power. We also study effects of the
He-II scattering kernel used and reductions in $P_{\rm UCN}$ due to pressurization to reach $P_{\rm
UCN} = 1.8\times 10^{9}\,{\rm s^{-1}}$. Finally, we estimate the UCN transport efficiency to show
that the total extracted rate out of the source can be $R_{\rm ex} \approx 6 \times 10^{8}\,{\rm s^{-1}}$
from a 18 cm diameter guide. These extracted rates are around an order of magnitude higher than the
strongest proposed sources so far, and is around three orders of magnitude higher than existing
sources.
