Nonequispaced discrete Fourier transformation (NDFT) is widely applied in all aspects of computational
science and engineering. The computational efficiency and accuracy of NDFT has always been a critical
issue in hindering its comprehensive applications both in intensive and in extensive aspects of
scientific computing. In our previous work (2018, S.-C. Yang et al., Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal.
44, 273), a CUNFFT method was proposed and it shown outstanding performance in handling NDFT at intermediate
scale based on CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) technology. In the current work, we further
improved the computational efficiency of the CUNTTF method using an efficient MPI-CUDA hybrid
parallelization (HP) scheme of NFFT to achieve a cutting-edge treatment of NDFT at super extended
scale. Within this HP-NFFT method, the spatial domain of NDFT is decomposed into several parts according
to the accumulative feature of NDFT and the detailed number of CPU and GPU nodes. These decomposed
NDFT subcells are independently calculated on different CPU nodes using a MPI process-level parallelization
mode, and on different GPU nodes using a CUDA threadlevel parallelization mode and CUNFFT algorithm.
A massive benchmarking of the HP-NFFT method indicates that this method exhibit a dramatic improvement
in computational efficiency for handling NDFT at super extended scale without loss of computational
precision. Furthermore, the HP-NFFT method is validated via the calculation of Madelung constant
of fluorite crystal structure, and thereafter verified that this method is robust for the calculation
of electrostatic interactions between charged ions in molecular dynamics simulation systems.
