We test the ability of a low-dimensional turbulence model to predict how dynamics of large-scale
coherent structures such as convection rolls depend on cell geometry. We test the model using Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection experiments in a cubic container, in which there is a single convection roll (a.k.a.
the large-scale circulation (LSC)). The stochastic ordinary differential equation model describes
diffusive motion of the orientation $\theta_0$ of the LSC in a potential determined by the cell geometry.
The model predicts advected oscillation modes. We observe the corresponding lowest-wavenumber
predicted advected oscillation mode in a cubic cell, in which $\theta_0$ oscillates around a corner,
and a slosh angle $\alpha$ rocks back and forth, which is distinct from the higher-wavenumber advected
twisting and sloshing oscillations found in cylindrical cells. We find that the potential has quadratic
minima near each corner with the same curvature in both $\theta_0$ and $\alpha$, as predicted. We
report values of diffusivities and damping time scales for both the LSC orientation $\theta_0$
and temperature amplitude for the Rayleigh number range $8\times10^7 \le Ra \le 3\times 10^9$.
The new oscillation mode around corners is found above a critical Ra $=4\times10^8$. This critical
Ra appears in the model as a crossing of an underdamped-overdamped transition. The natural frequency
of the potential, oscillation period, power spectrum, and critical Ra for oscillations are consistent
with the model if we adjust the model parameters by up to a factor of 2.9, and values are all within a
factor of 3 of model predictions. However, these uncertainties in model parameters are too large
to correctly predict whether resonance exists at a given Ra. The success of the model suggests that
such a modeling approach could be applied more generally to different cell geometries.
