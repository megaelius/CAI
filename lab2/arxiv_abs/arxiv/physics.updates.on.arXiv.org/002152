Studies on Voyager 1 using the CRS instrument have shown the presence of sub-MeV electrons in the
interstellar medium beyond the heliopause. We believe that these electrons are the very low energy
tail of the distribution of galactic GeV cosmic ray electrons produced in the galaxy. If so this observation
places constraints on the origin and possible source distribution of these electrons in the galaxy.
The intensities of these electrons as well as MeV protons and other higher energy electrons and nuclei
have been followed outward from the Earth to beyond the heliopause during the 40 years of the Voyager
mission. Among the other new features found in this study of the radial dependence of the electron
intensity in the heliosphere are: 1. The heliosheath is a source of sub-MeV electrons as well as the
already known anomalous cosmic rays of MeV and above, none of which appear to escape from the heliosphere
because of an almost impenetrable heliopause at these lower energies; 2. Solar modulation effects
are observed for these MeV electrons throughout the heliosphere. These modulation effects are
particularly strong for electrons in the heliosheath and comprise over 90 percent of the observed
intensity change of these electrons of 10-60 MeV between the Earth and the heliopause. Even for nuclei
of 1 GV in rigidity, over 30 percent of the total intensity difference between the Earth and the LIM
occurs in the heliosheath; 3. The 2 MeV protons studied here for the first time beyond the heliopause
are also part of the low energy tail of the spectrum of galactic cosmic ray protons, similar to the
tail noted above for sub MeV galactic cosmic ray electrons.
