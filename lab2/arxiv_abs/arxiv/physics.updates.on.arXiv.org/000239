The central question of this paper is: are deterministic and indeterministic descriptions observationally
equivalent in the sense that they give the same predictions? I tackle this question for measure-theoretic
deterministic systems and stochastic processes, both of which are ubiquitous in science. I first
show that for many measure-theoretic deterministic systems there is a stochastic process which
is observationally equivalent to the deterministic system. Conversely, I show that for all stochastic
processes there is a measure-theoretic deterministic system which is observationally equivalent
to the stochastic process. Still, one might guess that the measure-theoretic deterministic systems
which are observationally equivalent to stochastic processes used in science do not include any
deterministic systems used in science. I argue that this is not so because deterministic systems
used in science even give rise to Bernoulli processes. Despite this, one might guess that measure-theoretic
deterministic systems used in science cannot give the same predictions at every observation level
as stochastic processes used in science. By proving results in ergodic theory, I show that also this
guess is misguided: there are several deterministic systems used in science which give the same
predictions at every observation level as Markov processes. All these results show that measure-theoretic
deterministic systems and stochastic processes are observationally equivalent more often than
one might perhaps expect. Furthermore, I criticise the claims of the previous philosophy papers
Suppes (1993, 1999), Suppes and de Barros (1996) and Winnie (1998) on observational equivalence.
