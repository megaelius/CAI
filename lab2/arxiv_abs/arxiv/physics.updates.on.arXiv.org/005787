Since the first recording of what we now call Covid-19 infection in Wuhan, Hubei province, China
on Dec 31, 2019, the disease has spread worldwide and met with a wide variety of social distancing
and quarantine policies. The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify
as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without
themselves being detected. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly
available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural
network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales:
Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine
and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number
$R_{t}$ of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government
interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented
were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially.
We test the predictive ability of our model by matching predictions in the duration 3 March - 1 April
2020 for Wuhan and in the duration 25 March - 1 April 2020 for Italy and South Korea. In the case of the
US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection
spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures
right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role
played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.
