Convection and magnetic field generation in the Earth and planetary interiors are driven by both
thermal and compositional gradients. In this work numerical simulations of finite-amplitude
double-diffusive convection and dynamo action in rapidly rotating spherical shells full of incompressible
two-component electrically-conducting fluid are reported. Four distinct regimes of rotating
double-diffusive convection identified in a recent linear analysis (Silva et al., 2019, Geophys.
Astrophys. Fluid Dyn., doi:10.1080/03091929.2019.1640875) are found to persist significantly
beyond the onset of instability while their regime transitions remain abrupt. In the semi-convecting
and the fingering regimes characteristic flow velocities are small compared to those in the thermally-
and compositionally-dominated overturning regimes, while zonal flows remain weak in all regimes
apart from the thermally-dominated one. Compositionally-dominated overturning convection
exhibits significantly narrower azimuthal structures compared to all other regimes while differential
rotation becomes the dominant flow component in the thermally-dominated case as driving is increased.
Dynamo action occurs in all regimes apart from the regime of fingering convection. While dynamos
persist in the semi-convective regime they are very much impaired by small flow intensities and
very weak differential rotation in this regime which makes poloidal to toroidal field conversion
problematic. The dynamos in the thermally-dominated regime include oscillating dipolar, quadrupolar
and multipolar cases similar to the ones known from earlier parameter studies. Dynamos in the compositionally-dominated
regime exhibit subdued temporal variation and remain predominantly dipolar due to weak zonal flow
in this regime. These results significantly enhance our understanding of the primary drivers of
planetary core flows and magnetic fields.
