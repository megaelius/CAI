This investigation is based on a DNS of a steady self-preserving incompressible axisymmetric turbulent
jet at a Reynolds number of 2400. The DNS data enable accurate maps of the outer irrotational flow
field, and also the vorticity field in the turbulent core of the jet. It is found necessary to define
two separate boundaries of the jet. The first is an inner boundary (turbulent/nonturbulent, T/NT),
from where vorticity rises steeply towards to the core. The second is an outer rotational/irrotational
boundary, beyond which the flow may be considered irrotational. The velocity field beyond the outer
boundary often has ordered, nearly irrotational circulatory motions. These can be shown, in simpler
cases, to be the velocity field induced by one or more vorticity elements in a coherent structure
in the turbulent core. A detailed examination of axial and diametral sections indicates that there
are periods when there is a large inrush of ambient fluid into parts of the T/NT interface, which gets
distorted into a gulf or well that can be both twisted and deep. Sections of these wells often appear
as what may be called as lakes of irrotational fluid in diametral sections of the jet flow. Part of
the inrushing fluid crosses the T/NT interface within the well and is entrained into the turbulent
core, by a process that can legitimately be called nibbling. The duration of such an inrush process
can be of the order up to 20 flow units and suggests that entrainment can be an episodic process in which
an inrush event accelerates ambient fluid even as it is pushed into a narrowing gulf, where it penetrates
the T/NT interface of the gulf by nibbling. In the turbulent round jet, the entrainment burstiness
is found to be of order 0.75, comparable to the momentum flux burstiness found in a turbulent boundary
layer.
