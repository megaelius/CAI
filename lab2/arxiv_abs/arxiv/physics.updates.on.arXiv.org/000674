This paper introduces a new approach to Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) where subgrid-scale (SGS)
dissipation is applied proportionally to the degree of local spectral broadening, hence mitigated
or deactivated in regions dominated by large-scale and/or laminar vortical motion. The proposed
Coherent vorticity preserving (CvP) LES methodology is based on the evaluation of the ratio of the
test-filtered to resolved (or grid-filtered) enstrophy $\sigma$. Values of $\sigma$ close to
1 indicate low sub-test-filter turbulent activity, justifying local deactivation of the SGS dissipation.
The intensity of the SGS dissipation is progressively increased for $\sigma < 1$ which corresponds
to a small-scale spectral broadening. The SGS dissipation is then fully activated in developed
turbulence characterized by $\sigma \le \sigma_{eq}$, where the value $\sigma_{eq}$ is derived
assuming a Kolmogorov spectrum. The proposed approach can be applied to any eddy-viscosity model,
is algorithmically simple and computationally inexpensive. LES of Taylor-Green vortex breakdown
demonstrates that the CvP methodology improves the performance of traditional, non-dynamic dissipative
SGS models, capturing the peak of total turbulent kinetic energy dissipation during transition.
Similar accuracy is obtained by adopting Germano's dynamic procedure albeit at more than twice
the computational overhead. A CvP-LES of a pair of unstable periodic helical vortices is shown to
predict accurately the experimentally observed growth rate using coarse resolutions. The ability
of the CvP methodology to dynamically sort the coherent, large-scale motion from the smaller, broadband
scales during transition is demonstrated via flow visualizations. LES of compressible channel
are carried out and show a good match with a reference DNS.
