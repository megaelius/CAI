We present a refined statistical analysis based on interplanetary coronal mass ejections as well
as co-rotating interaction regions for the time period 2003-2015 to estimate the impact of different
solar wind types on the geomagnetic activity and the neutral density in the Earth's thermosphere.
For the time-based delimitation of the events, we rely on the catalog maintained by Richardson and
Cane and the CIR-lists provided by S. Vennerstroem and Jian et al. [2011]. These archives are based
on in-situ measurements from the ACE and/or the Wind spacecraft. On this basis, we thoroughly investigated
196 Earth-directed ICME and 195 CIR events. To verify the impact on the Earth's thermosphere we determined
neutral mass densities by using accelerometer measurements collected by the low-Earth orbiting
satellites GRACE and CHAMP. Subsequently, the atmospheric densities are related to characteristic
ICME parameters. In this process a new calibration method has been examined. Since increased solar
activity may lead to a decrease of the satellites orbital altitude we additionally assessed the
orbital decay for each of the events and satellites. The influence of CIR events is in the same range
of magnitude as the majority of the ICMEs (186 out of 196). Even though, the extended investigation
period between 2011 and 2015 has a lack of extreme solar events the combined analysis reveals comparable
correlation coefficients between the neutral densities and the various ICME and geomagnetic parameters
(mostly > 0.85). The evaluation of orbit decay rates at different altitudes revealed a high dependency
on the satellite actual altitude.
