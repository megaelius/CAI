Sucralose is a commonly employed artificial sweetener that appears to destabilize protein native
structures. This is in direct contrast to the bio-preservative nature of its natural counterpart,
sucrose, which enhances the stability of biomolecules against environmental stress. We have further
explored the molecular interactions of sucralose as compared to sucrose to illuminate the origin
of the differences in their bio-preservative efficacy. We show that the mode of interactions of
sucralose and sucrose in bulk solution differ subtly using hydration dynamics measurement and
computational simulation. Sucralose does not appear to disturb the native state of proteins for
moderate concentrations (<0.2 M) at room temperature. However, as the concentration increases,
or in the thermally stressed state, sucralose appears to differ in its interactions with protein
leading to the reduction of native state stability. This difference in interaction appears weak.
We explored the difference in the preferential exclusion model using time-resolved spectroscopic
techniques and observed that both molecules appear to be effective reducers of bulk hydration dynamics.
However, the chlorination of sucralose appears to slightly enhance the hydrophobicity of the molecule,
which reduces the preferential exclusion of sucralose from the protein-water interface. The weak
interaction of sucralose with hydrophobic pockets on the protein surface differs from the behavior
of sucrose. We experimentally followed up upon the extent of this weak interaction using isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. We propose this as a possible origin for the difference
in their bio-preservative properties.
