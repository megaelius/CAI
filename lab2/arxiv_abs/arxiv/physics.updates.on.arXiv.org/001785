Monthly precipitation climatologies at 1 km resolution have been produced over the Norwegian mainland
for 1981-2010. The observed station normals are interpolated over a regular grid by applying a multi-linear
local regression kriging (MLRK). The statistical method aims at modeling the influence of the main
geographical features, such as: latitude, longitude, elevation and sea nearness on the precipitation
field at a local scale. The MLRK is composed of two steps, (i) a background precipitation field is
computed through a multi-linear local regression based on the geographical information, then
(ii) a kriging interpolation is applied to adjust the field so to better fit the station residuals
(i.e., the difference between the observed normals and the background field). The interpolation
accuracy is evaluated by reconstructing the station normals with a leave-one-out approach and
by comparing the model performances with those of other interpolation methods. The poor observation
coverage over remote and mountainous regions in Norway has motivated us to consider precipitation
fields produced by numerical models. In fact, numerical model output provides a reference field
for the evaluation of MLRK that is not dependent on the station density, though it is not as accurate
as the observations. Specifically, a regional climate simulation with a resolution of 2.5 km, based
on the dynamical downscaling of the global reanalysis ERAInterim and available for the time period
2003-2016, has been used. In addition to the MLRK validation, the combination of numerical model
fields and observed climatologies has been investigated and the results show that this integrated
approach provides more accurate high-resolution climatologies over the Country. The numerical
background introduces valuable information over remote and mountainous regions, whereas in-situ
data correct for model biases.
