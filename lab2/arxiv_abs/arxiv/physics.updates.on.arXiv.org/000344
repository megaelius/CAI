Strong seismic motions in soils generally lead to both a stiffness reduction and an increase of the
energy dissipation in the surficial layers. In order to study such phenomena, several nonlinear
constitutive models were proposed and were generally implemented for 1D soil columns. However,
one of the main difficulties of complex rheologies is the large number of parameters needed to describe
the model. In this sense, the multi-surface cyclic plasticity approach, developed by Iwan in 1967
but linked to Prandtl or Preisach theoretical work, is an interesting choice: the only data needed
is the modulus reduction curve. Past studies have generally implemented such models for one-directional
shear wave propagation in a "1D" soil column considering one motion component only ("1C"). Conversely,
this work aims at studying strong motion amplification by considering seismic wave propagation
in a "1D" soil column accounting for the influence of the 3D loading path on the nonlinear behavior
of each soil layer. In the "1D-3C" approach, the three components (3C) of the outcrop motion are simultaneously
propagated into a horizontally layered soil for which a three-dimensional constitutive relation
is used (Finite Element Method). The alluvial site considered in this study corresponds to the Tiber
River Valley, close to the historical centre of Rome (Italy). The computations are performed considering
the waveforms referred as the 14th October 1997 Umbria-Marche earthquake, recorded on outcropping
bedrock. Time histories and stress-strain hysteretic loops are computed all along the soil column.
The octahedral stress, the strain-depth profiles and the transfer functions in acceleration (surface/outcrop
spectral ratios) are estimated for the 1D-1C and the 1D-3C approaches, evidencing the influence
of the three-dimensional loading path.
