NMR spectral datasets, especially in systems with limited samples, can be difficult to interpret
if they contain multiple chemical components (phases, polymorphs, molecules, crystals, glasses,
etc...) and the possibility of overlapping resonances. In this paper, we benchmark several blind
source separation techniques for analysis of NMR spectral datasets containing negative intensity.
For benchmarking purposes, we generated a large synthetic datasbase of quadrupolar solid-state
NMR-like spectra that model spin-lattice T1 relaxation or nutation tip/flip angle experiments.
Our benchmarking approach focused exclusively on the ability of blind source separation techniques
to reproduce the spectra of the underlying pure components. In general, we find that FastICA (Fast
Independent Component Analysis), SIMPLISMA (SIMPLe-to-use-Interactive Self-modeling Mixture
Analysis), and NNMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) are top-performing techniques. We demonstrate
that dataset normalization approaches prior to blind source separation do not considerably improve
outcomes. Within the range of noise levels studied, we did not find drastic changes to the ranking
of techniques. The accuracy of FastICA and SIMPLISMA degrades quickly if excess (unreal) pure components
are predicted. Our results indicate poor performance of SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) methods,
and we propose alternative techniques for matrix initialization. The benchmarked techniques
are also applied to real solid state NMR datasets. In general, the recommendations from the synthetic
datasets agree with the recommendations and results from the real data analysis. The discussion
provides some additional recommendations for spectroscopists applying blind source separation
to NMR datasets, and for future benchmark studies.
