The COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges for continuing economic activity while reducing health
risk to individuals and preventing uncontrolled outbreaks. These challenges can be mitigated
by extensive testing. We study testing policies that optimize a fixed budget of tests within a single
institution (e.g., business, school, nursing home, etc.) by varying the number of batches that
the tests are split into. We prove that, in an exponential spread model and for reasonable parameter
values, the expected size of an outbreak at initial detection is smaller when random subgroups of
the population are tested frequently, as opposed to periodic testing of the entire population.
We also simulate the effect of different policies in a network SEIR model taking into account factors
such as variable connectivity between individuals, incubation period, and inaccurate testing
results. We show that under a broad set of early-outbreak scenarios, given a certain budget of tests,
increasing testing frequency of random samples of the population will reduce the societal risk,
defined as the number of infection opportunities until first detection. For example, testing a
quarter of the institution members every week is generally better than testing the entire institution
every month. In fact, in many settings, sufficiently frequent testing (combined with mitigation
once an outbreak is detected) can decrease the risk even compared to the baseline when the institution
is closed and testing is not conducted. The bottom-line is a simple policy prescription for institutions:
distribute the total tests over several batches instead of using them all at once.
