The conventional mathematical methods are based characteristic scales, while urban form has no
characteristic scale in many aspects. Urban area is a measure of scale dependence, which indicates
the scale-free distribution of urban patterns. In this case, the urban description based on characteristic
scales should be replaced by urban characterization based on scaling. Fractal geometry is one of
powerful tools for scaling analysis of cities, thus the concept of fractal cities emerged. However,
how to understand city fractals is a still pending question. By means of logic deduction and ideas
from fractal theory, this paper is devoted to discussing fractals and fractal dimensions of urban
form. The main points of this work are as follows. First, urban form can be treated as pre-fractals
rather than real fractals, and fractal properties of cities are only valid within certain scaling
ranges. Second, the topological dimension of city fractals based on urban area is 0, thus the minimum
fractal dimension value of fractal cities is equal to or greater than 0. Third, fractal dimension
of urban form is used to substitute urban area, and it is better to define city fractals in a 2-dimensional
embedding space, thus the maximum fractal dimension value of urban form is 2. A conclusion can be
reached that urban form can be treated as fractals within certain ranges of scales and fractal geometry
can be applied to the spatial analysis of the scale-free aspects of urban morphology. Based on fractal
dimension, topological dimension, and embedding space dimension, a set of fractal indexes can
be constructed to characterize urban form and growth.
