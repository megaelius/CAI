We consider the Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning (EBC) via repeated presentation of paired conditioned
stimulus (tone) and unconditioned stimulus (airpuff). The influence of various temporal recoding
of granule cells on the EBC is investigated in a cerebellar network where the connection probability
$p_c$ from Golgi to granule cells is changed. In an optimal case of $p_c^*~(=0.029)$, individual
granule cells show various well- and ill-matched firing patterns relative to the unconditioned
stimulus. Then, these variously-recoded signals are fed into the Purkinje cells (PCs) through
parallel-fibers (PFs). In the case of well-matched PF-PC synapses, their synaptic weights are
strongly depressed through strong long-term depression (LTD). On the other hand, practically
no LTD occurs for the ill-matched PF-PC synapses. This type of "effective" depression at the PF-PC
synapses coordinates firings of PCs effectively, which then make effective inhibitory coordination
on cerebellar nucleus neuron [which elicits conditioned response (CR; eyeblink)]. When the learning
trial passes a threshold, acquisition of CR begins. In this case, the timing degree ${\cal T}_d$
of CR becomes good due to presence of the ill-matched firing group which plays a role of protection
barrier for the timing. With further increase in the trial, strength $\cal S$ of CR (corresponding
to the amplitude of eyelid closure) increases due to strong LTD in the well-matched firing group.
Thus, with increasing the learning trial, the (overall) learning efficiency degree ${\cal L}_e$
(taking into consideration both timing and strength of CR) for the CR is increased, and eventually
it becomes saturated. By changing $p_c$ from $p_c^*$, we also investigate the influence of various
temporal recoding on the EBC. It is thus found that, the more various in temporal recoding, the more
effective in learning for the Pavlovian EBC.
