Large bottlebrush complexes formed from the polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) and the proteoglycan
aggrecan contribute to cartilage compression resistance and are necessary for healthy joint function.
A variety of mechanical forces act on these complexes in the cartilage extracellular matrix, motivating
the need for a quantitative description which links their structure and mechanical response. Studies
using electron microscopy have imaged the HA-aggrecan brush but require adsorption to a surface,
dramatically altering the complex from its native conformation. We use magnetic tweezers force
spectroscopy to measure changes in extension and mechanical response of an HA chain as aggrecan
monomers bind and form a bottlebrush. This technique directly measures changes undergone by a single
complex with time and under varying solution conditions. Upon addition of aggrecan, we find a large
swelling effect manifests when the HA chain is under very low external tension (i.e. stretching
forces less than ~1 pN). We use models of force-extension behavior to show that repulsion between
the aggrecans induces an internal tension in the HA chain. Through reference to theories of bottlebrush
polymer behavior, we demonstrate that the experimental values of internal tension are consistent
with a polydisperse aggrecan population, likely caused by varying degrees of glycosylation. By
enzymatically deglycosylating aggrecan, we show that aggrecan glycosylation is the structural
feature which causes HA stiffening. We then construct a simple stochastic binding model to show
that variable glycosylation leads to a wide distribution of internal tensions in HA, causing variations
in the mechanics at much longer length-scales. Our results provide a mechanistic picture of how
flexibility and size of HA and aggrecan lead to the brush architecture and mechanical properties
of this important component of cartilage.
