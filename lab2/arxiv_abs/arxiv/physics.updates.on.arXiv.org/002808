The density functional theory (DFT)+$U$ method is a pragmatic and effective approach for calculating
the ground-state properties of strongly-correlated systems, and linear response calculations
are widely used to determine the requisite Hubbard parameters from first principles. We provide
a detailed treatment of spin within this linear response approach, demonstrating that the conventional
Hubbard $U$ formula, unlike the conventional DFT+$U$ corrective functional, incorporates interactions
that are off-diagonal in the spin indices and places greater weight on one spin channel over the other.
We construct alternative definitions for Hubbard and Hund's parameters that are consistent with
the contemporary DFT+$U$ functional, expanding upon the minimum-tracking linear response method.
This approach allows Hund's $J$ and spin-dependent $U$ parameters to be calculated with the same
ease as for the standard Hubbard $U$. Our methods accurately reproduce the experimental band gap,
local magnetic moments, and the valence band edge character of manganese oxide, a canonical strongly-correlated
system. We also apply our approach to a complete series of transition-metal complexes [M(H$_2$O)$_6$]$^{n+}$
(for M = Ti to Zn), showing that Hubbard corrections on oxygen atoms are necessary for preserving
bond lengths, and demonstrating that our methods are numerically well-behaved even for near-filled
subspaces such as in zinc. However, spectroscopic properties appear beyond the reach of the standard
DFT+$U$ approach. Collectively, these results shed new light on the role of spin in the calculation
of the corrective parameters $U$ and $J$, and point the way towards avenues for further development
of DFT+$U$-type methods.
