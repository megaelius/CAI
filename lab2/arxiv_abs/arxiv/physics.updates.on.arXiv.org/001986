Computing is not understanding. This is exemplified by the multiple and discordant interpretations
of Landau damping still present after seventy years. For long deemed impossible, the mechanical
N-body description of this damping, not only enables its rigorous and simple calculation, but makes
unequivocal and intuitive its interpretation as the synchronization of almost resonant passing
particles. This synchronization justifies mechanically why a single formula applies to both Landau
growth and damping. As to the electrostatic potential, the phase mixing of many beam modes produces
Landau damping, but it is unexpectedly essential for Landau growth too. Moreover, collisions play
an essential role in collisionless plasmas. In particular, Debye shielding results from a cooperative
dynamical self-organization process, where "collisional" deflections due to a given electron
diminish the apparent number of charges about it. The finite value of exponentiation rates due to
collisions is crucial for the equivalent of the van Kampen phase mixing to occur in the N-body system.
The N-body approach incorporates spontaneous emission naturally, whose compound effect with
Landau damping drives a thermalization of Langmuir waves. O'Neil's damping with trapping typical
of initially large enough Langmuir waves results from a phase transition. As to collisional transport,
there is a smooth connection between impact parameters where the two-body Rutherford picture is
correct, and those where a collective description is mandatory. The N-body approach reveals two
important features of the Vlasovian limit: it is singular and it corresponds to a renormalized description
of the actual N-body dynamics.
