The superhydrophobic leaves of a lotus plant and other natural surfaces with self-cleaning function
have been studied intensively for the development of artificial biomimetic surfaces. Surface
roughness generated by hierarchical structures is a crucial property required for superhydrophobicity
and self-cleaning. Here, we demonstrate a novel self-cleaning mechanism of textured surfaces
attributed to a spontaneous coalescence-induced wetting transition. We focus on the wetting transition
as it represents a new mechanism, which can explain why droplets on rough surfaces are able to change
from the highly adhesive Wenzel state to the low-adhesion Cassie-Baxter state and achieve self-cleaning.
In particular, we perform many-body dissipative particle dynamics simulations of liquid droplets
sitting on mechanically textured substrates. We quantitatively investigate the wetting behavior
of an isolated droplet as well as coalescence of droplets for both Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states.
Our simulation results reveal that droplets in the Cassie-Baxter state have much lower contact
angle hysteresis and smaller hydrodynamic resistance than droplets in the Wenzel state. When small
neighboring droplets coalesce into bigger ones on textured hydrophobic substrates, we observe
a spontaneous wetting transition from a Wenzel state to a Cassie-Baxter state, which is powered
by the surface energy released upon coalescence of the droplets. For superhydrophobic surfaces,
the released surface energy may be sufficient to cause a jumping motion of droplets off the surface,
in which case adding one more droplet to coalescence may increase the jumping velocity by one order
of magnitude. When multiple droplets are involved, we find that the spatial distribution of liquid
components in the coalesced droplet can be controlled by properly designing the overall arrangement
of droplets and the distance between them.
