Methods for brain microstructure imaging use biophysical models aiming to estimate the neurite
density from dMRI. However, the approach relies on important assumptions. The 'neurite assumption'
holds that both axons and dendrites exhibit fully anisotropic diffusion and can be represented
by a 'stick' compartment. The 'density assumption' holds that proton density and relaxation properties
are approximately equal across tissue compartments. In this study, we investigate these assumptions
in healthy brain tissue and in white matter lesions. Data were acquired by going beyond conventional
multi-shell dMRI to use 'b-tensor encoding' and multiple echo times. To test the neurite assumption,
we compared signal representations of b-tensor data with knowledge from histology. Results showed
that microscopic diffusion anisotropy is associated with myelin, and thus axons, rather than with
neurites. To test the density assumption, we attempted to estimate separate compartment T2 and
diffusion properties. Results showed that compartment-specific T2 times were ambiguous in the
healthy brain, impeding unbiased 'density' estimations. Meanwhile, different compartment T2
times were estimated in white matter lesions. Finally, we tested whether the 'stick' fraction of
constrained biophysical models could serve as a 'neurite density index'. Results showed that different
constraints yielded different rankings of the same brain regions, wherefore most constrained
'stick' fractions cannot be indices across the healthy brain and white matter lesions. In conclusion,
the results indicate that the neurite density cannot be estimated, or even indexed, over a useful
range of conditions with clinical dMRI. Until the advent of models with well-validated constraints,
we recommend using multidimensional encoding to improve specificity and signal representations
for data analysis.
