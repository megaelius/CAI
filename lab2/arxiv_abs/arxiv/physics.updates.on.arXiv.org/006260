The notion that the whole is more than the sum of its parts has a long tradition in science. This, of
course, also applies to the Earth system. With its myriad of processes, spanning from purely physical
to life and human activity, the Earth is a vastly complex system. It may thus seem that there is nothing
simple and general to say because of this overwhelming complexity. What I want to show here is that
by formulating the Earth as a thermodynamic system, one can identify general directions and infer
simple functioning because thermodynamics imposes fundamental limits on the dynamics. At the
center of this description are energy conversions and states of disequilibrium, which are at the
core of the dynamics of Earth system processes, from convection cells to living organisms and human
societies. They are linked to each other and interact by their exchanges of energy and mass, and ultimately
affect how much of the input of low entropy solar radiation from the Sun is converted into free energy,
energy able to perform work, before the energy gets re-emitted by the Earth as high entropy terrestrial
radiation. The emergent thermodynamic behavior of the Earth then becomes simple because the dynamics
evolve to and operate at thermodynamic limits. Such behavior of Earth system processes operating
at the edge of their limit can then be linked to previously described holistic theories, such as the
Gaia hypothesis, with similarities in the described emergent behavior. Such a thermodynamic view,
however, can go further, as it can also be used to understand the role of human societies in the Earth
system and the potential pathways to a sustainable future. Thermodynamics taken together with
the energy conversions and interactions within the Earth system can thus provide a basis to understand
why the whole Earth system is more, and simpler, than the sum of its spheres.
