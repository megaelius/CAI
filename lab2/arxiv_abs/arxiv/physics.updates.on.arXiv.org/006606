Many pairwise additive force fields parameterized to reproduce folded protein structures are
in active use for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs), most of which are
found to disagree with solution experiments for the disordered states. Recent modifications of
protein-water and water-water energetic interactions in these standard force fields have sought
to increase agreement with solution experiments of IDPs and IDRs while also maintaining the ability
to describe folded protein structures. Many-body potentials that include polarization should
provide a better physical model for capturing proteins with and without intrinsic disorder, but
in this case testing has been more limited for proteins of either class. We have evaluated representative
non-polarizable and polarizable protein and water force fields against experimental data on the
histatin 5 intrinsically disordered protein, the disorder-to-order temperature transition
for the (AAQAA)3 repeat peptide, the TSR4 domain of F-spondin which has both folded and intrinsically
disordered regions, and seven globular folded proteins ranging in size from 130-266 amino acids.
We find that force fields with the largest statistical fluctuations consistent with the radius
of gyration and universal Lindemann values for folded states are simultaneously valuable for describing
IDPs and IDRs and disorder to order transitions. Hence the crux of what a force field should exhibit
to well describe IDRs/IDPs is not just the balance between protein and water energetics, but the
balance between energetic effects and configurational entropy of folded states of globular proteins.
