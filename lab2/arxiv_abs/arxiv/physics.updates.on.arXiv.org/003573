Two types of high-strength composite hydrogels possessing the structure of interpenetrating
polymer networks were synthesized via free-radical polymerization of acrylamide carried out
straight within the matrix of plant or bacterial cellulose swollen in the reactive solution. The
mechanical behavior of synthesized hydrogels subjected to the action of compressive deformations
with different amplitude values was studied. The analysis of the stress-strain curves of compression
tests of the hydrogels of both types obtained in different test conditions demonstrates the substantial
difference in their mechanical behavior. Both the plant cellulose-based and bacterial cellulose-based
hydrogels withstand successfully the compression with the amplitude up to 80 %, but the bacterial
cellulose-based compositions demonstrate in the multiple compression tests the substantial
decrease of the mechanical stiffness caused by the action of compressions. This effect takes place
straightly during the multiple cyclic compression tests or in the course of relaxation of previously
compressed samples in water in unloaded state during 2-3 days after the first compressive tests.
Being subjected to the action of the extremely sever compression (up to 80 %) the bacterial cellulose-based
hydrogel varies greatly its mechanical behavior: during the subsequent compressions the stiffness
of the material keeps extremely small (as compared to that registered in the first compression)
up to the deformations as high as 50-60 % with the dramatic increase of the stiffness during the further
loading. Submicron- and micron-scale specific features of structures of composite hydrogels
of both types were studied by cryo-scanning electron microscopy to explain the peculiarities of
observed mechanical effects.
