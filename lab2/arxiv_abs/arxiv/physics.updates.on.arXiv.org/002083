Standard unit of information Bit generates any natural process through discrete yes-no interactions
including interactive macro impulses in classical physics and elementary micro impulses of quantum
interactions. In natural interactive process, each impulse step-down action cuts correlations
of the process prior interactive events. This cuts the process entropy defined by probability memorizing
the cutting entropy as information hidden in the correlation. Memory freezes information impulse
bit in the cutting correlation. The interactive impulse reveals information as phenomenon of interaction.
The interacting actions curve impulse whose curvature creates asymmetry lowering energy cost
for encoding qubits in memorized bit. Each Bit is naturally extracted at the cost of minimal energy
and encoding information in the interacting physical state by the impulse step-up action energy.
The impulse sequential natural encoding merges memory with the time of memorizing information
and compensates the cutting cost by running time intervals of encoding. The information process,
preserving invariant impulse cutting information, binds the inner impulse reversible microprocesses
and multiple impulses macroprocess in information irreversible dynamics. The encoding process
unites the information path functional integrating observer geometrical cellular information
structure which composes rotating helix of the sequencing cells Bits. This natural encoding satisfied
Landauer principle and compensates for the cost of Maxwell Demon. Energy of specific interaction
limits the universal code length and density.The increasing correlation connections of interacting
events speeds their time course, while decreasing correlation slowing their time course. These
conditions and results validate computer simulation, multiple experiments in coding genetic
information, experimental encoding by spiking neurons, others.
