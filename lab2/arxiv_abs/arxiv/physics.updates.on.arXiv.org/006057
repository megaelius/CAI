This study derives a complete set of equatorially confined wave solutions from an anelastic equation
set with the complete Coriolis terms, which include both the vertical and meridional planetary
vorticity. The propagation mechanism can change with the effective static stability. When the
effective static stability reduces to neutral, buoyancy ceases, but the role of buoyancy as an eastward-propagation
mechanism is replaced by the compressional beta-effect, i.e., vertical density-weighted advection
of the meridional planetary vorticity. For example, the Kelvin mode becomes a compressional Rossby
mode. Compressional Rossby waves are meridional vorticity disturbances that propagate eastward
owing to the compressional beta-effect. The compressional Rossby wave solutions can serve as a
benchmark to validate the implementation of the nontraditional Coriolis terms (NCTs); with an
effectively neutral condition and initial large-scale disturbances given a half vertical wavelength
spanning the troposphere on Earth, compressional Rossby waves are expected to propagate eastward
at a phase speed of 0.24 m s${}^{-1}$. The phase speed increases with the planetary rotation rate
and the vertical wavelength and also changes with the density scale height. Besides, the compressional
beta-effect and the meridional vorticity tendency are reconstructed using reanalysis data and
regressed upon tropical precipitation filtered for the Madden$-$Julian oscillation (MJO). The
results suggest that the compressional beta-effect contributes 10.8% of the meridional vorticity
budget associated with the MJO in terms of the ratio of the minimum values. The complete set of statically
neutral equatorial waves may be significant in the interiors of stars and giant planets.
