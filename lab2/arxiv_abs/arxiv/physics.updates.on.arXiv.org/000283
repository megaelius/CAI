We report the conceptual inventory results of a large-scale assessment project at a large university.
We studied an attempt at introducing materials and instructional methods informed by physics education
research (PER-informed materials) into a department where most instruction has been traditional
and a significant number of faculty are hesitant, ambivalent or even resistant about the introduction
of such reforms. The changes were made in the laboratories and recitation sections of the introductory
classes, both calculus-based and algebra-based, introducing PER-informed materials and training
the teaching assistants in student-centered instructional methods. In addition to the results
found in the large lecture classes, we present the results of a small PER-informed, inquiry-based,
laboratory-based class that has been taught as a special section of the algebra-based course for
about 10 years. The assessment reported in this paper was done using available PER-developed assessment
instruments. The results of other assessment instruments used in the project, such as free-response
pre- and post-tests, are reported in subsequent papers. The results in this paper inform researchers
in PER of the use of PER-informed materials and instructional methods in a department not unified
in the introduction and implementation of these materials and the results of the implementation
as assessed by PER-based conceptual inventories. We found that our conceptual inventory scores
were lower than many results reported elsewhere in the literature. However, we did see a statistically
significant increase in the conceptual inventory scores with the implementation of PER-informed
laboratories and the use of student-centered pedagogy in the labs and recitations. The increase
was much greater, if the lecture instructor also used PER-informed materials.
