The detonation wave stability is addressed using Fickett's equation, i.e., the reactive form of
Burgers' equation. This serves as a simple analogue to the reactive Euler equations, permitting
one to gain insight into the nonlinear dynamics of detonation waves. Chemical kinetics were modeled
using a two-step reaction with distinct induction and reaction zones. An evolution equation for
the detonation structure was derived using the method of matched asymptotics for large activation
energy and slow rate of energy release. While the first order solution was found unconditionally
unstable, the second order evolution equation predicted both stable and unstable solutions. The
neutral stability boundary was found analytically, given by $\chi=4$, where $\chi$ is the product
of activation energy and the ratio of induction to reaction time. This reproduces accurately what
has been previously established for the reactive Euler equations and verified experimentally.
The evolution equation also captures stable limit cycle oscillations in the unstable regime and
offers unique insight into the instability mechanism. The mechanism amplifying the perturbations
lies within the induction zone, where the Arrhenius-type rate equation provides a large change
in induction times for small perturbations. The mechanism attenuating the perturbations arises
from acoustic effects, which delays the amplification of the shock front. The longer the detonation
wave, the more time it takes for the amplification from the reaction zone to reach the shock front,
creating gradients that counter-act the amplification from the flame acceleration. The results
agree with direct numerical simulation, as well as recovering many similarities with the reactive
Euler equation.
