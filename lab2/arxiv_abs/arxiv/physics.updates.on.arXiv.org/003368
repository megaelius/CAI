Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) are increasingly popular
and attractive methods that propose efficient multiphase formulations, each one with its own strengths
and weaknesses. In this context, when it comes to study a given multi-fluid problem, it is helpful
to rely on a quantitative comparison to decide which approach should be used and in which context.
In particular, the simulation of intermittent two-phase flows in pipes such as slug flows is a complex
problem involving moving and intersecting interfaces for which both SPH and LBM could be considered.
It is a problem of interest in petroleum applications since the formation of slug flows that can occur
in submarine pipelines connecting the wells to the production facility can cause undesired behaviors
with hazardous consequences. In this work, we compare SPH and LBM multiphase formulations where
surface tension effects are modeled respectively using the continuum surface force and the color
gradient approaches on a collection of standard test cases, and on the simulation of intermittent
flows in 2D. This paper aims to highlight the contributions and limitations of SPH and LBM when applied
to these problems. First, we compare our implementations on static bubble problems with different
density and viscosity ratios. Then, we focus on gravity driven simulations of slug flows in pipes
for several Reynolds numbers. Finally, we conclude with simulations of slug flows with inlet/outlet
boundary conditions. According to the results presented in this study, we confirm that the SPH approach
is more robust and versatile whereas the LBM formulation is more accurate and faster.
