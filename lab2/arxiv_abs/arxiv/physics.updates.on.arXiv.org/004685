This paper presents a re-formulation of the boundary integral method (BIM) for the Debye-Huckel
model of molecular and colloidal electrostatics that removes the mathematical singularities
that have been accepted as an intrinsic part of the conventional BIM. The essence of the present boundary
regularized integral equation formulation consists of subtracting a known solution from the conventional
BIM in such a way as to cancel out the singularities associated with the Green's function. This approach
better reflects the non-singular physical behavior of the systems on boundaries with the benefits
of (i) the surface integrals can be evaluated accurately using quadrature without any need to devise
special numerical integration procedures, (ii) being able to use quadratic or spline function
surface elements to represent the surface more accurately and the variation of the functions within
each element is represented to a consistent level of precision by appropriate interpolation functions,
(iii) being able to calculate electric fields, even at boundaries, accurately and directly from
the potential without having to solve hypersingular integral equations and this imparts high precision
in calculating the Maxwell stress tensor and consequently, intermolecular or colloidal forces,
(iv) a reliable way to handle geometric configurations in which different parts of the boundary
can be very close together without being affected by numerical instabilities, therefore potentials,
fields and forces between surfaces can be found accurately at surface separations down to near contact,
and (v) having the simplicity of a formulation that does not require complex algorithms to handle
singularities will result in significant savings in coding effort and in the reduction of opportunities
for coding errors. These advantages are illustrated using examples drawn from molecular and colloidal
electrostatics.
