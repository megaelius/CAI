Ultrafine particle behavior in electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) flow induced by corona discharge is
studied experimentally and numerically. The EHD flow serves as a primary particle aspiration/sampling
mechanism, the collector does not require any additional flow generation. Multiphysics numerical
model couples the ion transport equation and the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) to solve for the
spatiotemporal distribution of electric field, charge density, and flow field, the results are
compared with experimental velocity profiles at the exit. The computed velocity and flow rate data
are in good agreement with the experimental data; the maximum velocity is located at the axis and
ranges from 1 m/s to 4 m/s as a function of corona voltage. Experimentally evaluated particle transmission
trends for ambient and NaCl nanoparticles particles in the 20 nm - 150 nm range are in good agreement
with the theoretical models. However, for particles in the 10 nm - 20 nm size range, the transmission
is lower due to the increased particle charging resulted from their exposure to the high-intensity
electric field and high charge density in the EHD driven flow. These conditions yield a high probability
of particles below 20 nm to acquire and hold a unit charge. The transmission is lower for smaller particle
(10 nm) due to their high charge to mass ratio, and it increases as the single-charged particles grow
in mass up to 20 nm, resulting in their lower electrical mobility. For particles larger than 20 nm,
the electrical mobility increases again as they can acquire multiple charges. The results shed
insight into interaction of nanoparticle and ions in high electrical field environment, that occur
in primary EHD driven flows and in the secondary flows generated by corona discharge.
