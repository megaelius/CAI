The purpose of this work is to generalize the frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA) theory to solve
the 3-D elastic wave equation and use it as the forward modeling tool for seismic tomography with
high-frequency data. FGA has been previously developed and verified as an efficient solver for
high-frequency acoustic wave propagation (P-wave). The main contribution of this paper consists
of three aspects: 1. We derive the FGA formulation for the 3-D elastic wave equation. Rather than
standard ray-based methods (e.g. geometric optics and Gaussian beam method), the derivation requires
to do asymptotic expansion in the week sense (integral form) so that one is able to perform integration
by parts. Compared to the FGA theory for acoustic wave equation, the calculations in the derivation
are much more technically involved due to the existence of both P- and S-waves, and the coupling of
the polarized directions for SH- and SV-waves. In particular, we obtain the diabatic coupling terms
for SH- and SV-waves, with the form closely connecting to the concept of Berry phase that is intensively
studied in quantum mechanics and topology (Chern number). The accuracy and parallelizability
of the FGA algorithm is illustrated by comparing to the spectral element method for 3-D elastic wave
equation in homogeneous media; 2. We derive the interface conditions of FGA for 3-D elastic wave
equation based on an Eulerian formulation and the Snell's law. We verify these conditions by simulating
high-frequency elastic wave propagation in a 1-D layered Earth model. In this example, we also show
that it is natural to apply the FGA algorithm to geometries with non-Cartesian coordinates; 3. We
apply the developed FGA algorithm for 3-D seismic { wave-equation-based traveltime tomography
and full waveform inversion, respectively
