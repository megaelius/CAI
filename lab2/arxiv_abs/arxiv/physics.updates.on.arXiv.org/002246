Many medical imaging techniques utilize fitting approaches for quantitative parameter estimation
and analysis. Common examples are pharmacokinetic modeling in DCE MRI/CT, ADC calculations and
intra-voxel incoherent motion modeling in diffusion MRI and Z-spectra analysis in chemical exchange
saturation transfer. Most available software tools are limited to a special purpose and thus do
not allow for own developments and extensions. Furthermore, they are mostly designed as stand-alone
solutions using external frameworks and thus cannot be easily incorporated natively in the analysis
workflow. We present a framework for medical image fitting tasks that is included in the medical
imaging interaction toolkit MITK, following a rigorous open-source, well-integrated and OS independent
policy. Software engineering-wise, the local models, fitting infrastructure and results representation
are abstracted and thus can be easily adapted to any model fitting task on image data, independent
of image modality or model. Several ready-to-use libraries for model fitting and use cases including
fit evaluation and visualization were implemented. Their embedding into MITK allows for easy data
loading, pre- and post-processing and thus a natural inclusion of model fitting into an overarching
workflow. As an example, we present a comprehensive set of plugins for the analysis of DCE MRI data,
which we validated on existing and novel digital phantoms, yielding competitive deviations between
fit and ground truth. Providing a very flexible environment, our software mainly addresses developers
of medical imaging software that includes model fitting algorithms and tools. In addition, the
framework is of high interest to users in the domain of perfusion MRI, as it offers feature-rich,
freely available, validated tools to perform pharmacokinetic analysis, with both interactive
and automatized batch processing workflows.
