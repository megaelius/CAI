We describe a semi-structured method for the generation of high-order hybrid meshes suited for
the simulation of high Reynolds number flows. This is achieved through the use of highly stretched
elements in the viscous boundary layers near the wall surfaces. CADfix is used to first repair any
possible defects in the CAD geometry and then generate a medial object based decomposition of the
domain that wraps the wall boundaries with partitions suitable for the generation of either prismatic
or hexahedral elements. The latter is a novel distinctive feature of the method that permits to obtain
well-shaped hexahedral meshes at corners or junctions in the boundary layer. The medial object
approach allows greater control on the "thickness" of the boundary-layer mesh than is generally
achievable with advancing layer techniques. CADfix subsequently generates a hybrid straight
sided mesh of prismatic and hexahedral elements in the near-field region modelling the boundary
layer, and tetrahedral elements in the far-field region covering the rest of the domain. The mesh
in the near-field region provides a framework that facilitates the generation, via an isoparametric
technique, of layers of highly stretched elements with a distribution of points in the direction
normal to the wall tailored to efficiently and accurately capture the flow in the boundary layer.
The final step is the generation of a high-order mesh using NekMesh, a high-order mesh generator
within the Nektar++ framework. NekMesh uses the CADfix API as a geometry engine that handles all
the geometrical queries to the CAD geometry required during the high-order mesh generation process.
We will describe in some detail the methodology using a simple geometry, a NACA wing tip, for illustrative
purposes. Finally, we will present two examples of application to reasonably complex geometries
proposed by NASA as CFD validation cases.
