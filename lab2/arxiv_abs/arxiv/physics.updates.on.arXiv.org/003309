We use a hierarchy of numerical models (a 3-D Global Climate Model, a 1-D radiative-convective model
and a 2-D Mantle Dynamics model) to explore the environmental effects of very large impacts on the
atmosphere, surface and interior of early Mars. Using a combination of 1-D and 3-D climate simulations,
we show that the environmental effects of the largest impact events recorded on Mars are characterized
by: (i) a short impact-induced warm period; (ii) a low amount of hydrological cycling of water; (iii)
deluge-style precipitation; and (iv) precipitation patterns that are uncorrelated with the observed
regions of valley networks. We show that the impact-induced stable runaway greenhouse state predicted
by Segura et al. 2012 is physically inconsistent. We confirm the results of Segura et al. 2008 and
Urata & Toon 2013 that water ice clouds can significantly extend the duration of the post-impact
warm period, and even for cloud coverage lower than predicted in Ramirez & Kasting 2017. However,
the range of cloud microphysical properties for which this scenario works is very narrow. Using
2-D Mantle Dynamics simulations we find that large impacts can raise the near-surface internal
heat flux up to several hundreds of mW/m$^2$ (i.e. up to $\sim$ 10 times the ambient flux) for several
millions years at the edges of the impact crater. However, such internal heat flux is insufficient
to keep the martian surface above the melting point of water. Our numerical results support the prediction
of Palumbo & Head 2018 that very large impact-induced rainfall could have caused degradation of
craters and formed smooth plains, potentially erasing much of the previously visible morphological
surface history. Such hot rainfalls may have also led to the formation of aqueous alteration products
on Noachian-aged terrains.
