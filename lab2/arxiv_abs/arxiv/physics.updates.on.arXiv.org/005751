This paper develops a community resilience optimization method subject to power flow constraints
in the Cyber-Physical-Social Systems in Power Engineering, which is solved using a multi-agent-based
algorithm. The tool that makes the nexus between electricity generation on the physical side and
the consumers and the critical loads on the social side is the power flow algorithm. Specifically,
the levels of emotion, empathy, cooperation, and the physical health of the consumers, prosumers
are modeled in the proposed community resilience optimization approach while accounting for the
electric power system constraints and their impact on the critical loads, which include hospitals,
shelters, and gas stations, to name a few. The optimization accounts for the fact that the level of
satisfaction of the society, the living standards, and the social well-being are depended on the
supply of energy, including electricity. Evidently, the lack of electric energy resulting from
load shedding has an impact on both the mental and the psychical quality of life, which in turn affects
the community resilience. The developed constrained community resilience optimization method
is applied to two case studies, including a two-area 6-buses system and a modified IEEE RTS 24-bus
system. Simulation results reveal that a decrease in the initial values of the emotion, the risk
perception, and the social media platform effect factor entails an increase in load shedding, which
in turn results in a decrease in community resilience. In contrast, an increase in the initial values
of cooperation, empathy, physical health, the capacity of microgrids and distributed energy resources
results in a decrease in the load shedding, which in turn induces an enhancement of the community
resilience.
