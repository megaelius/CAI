The driving concept behind one of the most successful statistical forecasting models, the ETAS
model, has been that the seismicity is driven by spontaneously occurring background earthquakes
that cascade into multitudes of triggered earthquakes. In nearly all generalizations of the ETAS
model, the magnitudes of the background and the triggered earthquakes are assumed to follow Gutenberg-Richter
law with the same exponent (\b{eta}-value). Furthermore, the magnitudes of the triggered earthquakes
are always assumed to be independent of the magnitude of the triggering earthquake. Using an EM algorithm
applied to the Californian earthquake catalogue, we show that the distribution of earthquake magnitudes
exhibits three distinct \b{eta}-values: \b{eta}_b for background events; \b{eta}_a-{\delta}
and \b{eta}_a+{\delta}, respectively, for triggered events below and above the magnitude of the
triggering earthquake; the two last values express a correlation between the magnitudes of triggered
events with that of the triggering earthquake, a feature so far absent in all proposed operational
generalizations of the ETAS model. The ETAS model incorporating this kinked magnitude distribution
provides by far the best description of seismic catalogs and could thus have the best forecasting
potential. We speculate that the kinked magnitude distribution may result from the system tending
to restore the symmetry of the regional displacement gradient tensor that has been broken by the
initiating event. The general emerging concept could be that while the background events occur
primarily to accommodate the symmetric stress tensor at the boundaries of the system, the triggered
earthquakes are quasi-Goldstone fluctuations of a self-organized critical deformation state.
