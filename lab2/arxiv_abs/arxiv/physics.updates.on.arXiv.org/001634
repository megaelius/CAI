Biodegradability and environmental sustainability are key features that give natural fibre reinforced
composites the potential to be used in different sectors of structural application. However, efficient
conversion of the fibre properties into their corresponding composite properties has been a challenge,
due to the conventional textile processing methods that are utilised for the processing of flax
fibres. These techniques impart disadvantageous features into the flax fibre preforms at both
micro, and meso scale level, which severely degrade the mechanical performances of flax fibre reinforced
composites (FFRC). Undulation of the fibres, which is also known as crimp, is one of the detrimental
features that is derived from the traditional fabric manufacturing route. This performance degradation
due to fibre waviness is amplified when flax fibres are concerned. The waviness instigates micro
compressive defects, known as kink bands in elementary flax fibres, which significantly undermine
the performance of flax fibre reinforced composites. Manufacturing flax fabric with minimal undulation
could diminish the micro compressive defects to a significant extent. In this research, nonwoven
flax tapes of highly aligned flax fibres have been manufactured deploying a novel technique, and
composites reinforced from those nonwoven tapes have been compared with flax composites reinforced
with woven matt fabrics and warp knitted unidirectional (UD) fabrics, comprising undulating fibres.
The composites reinforced with the highly aligned tape show significantly higher fibre bundle
strength and fibre bundle stiffness in comparison with that of the Matt fabric reinforced composites.
The results have been discussed in respect of fibre undulation, elementary fibre individualisation,
homogeneity of fibre distribution, extent of resin rich areas, and impregnation of the fibre lumens.
