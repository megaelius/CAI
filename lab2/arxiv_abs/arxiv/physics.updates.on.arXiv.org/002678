Many open problems in the Earth sciences can only be understood by modelling the porous flow of melt
through a viscously deforming solid rock matrix. However, the system of equations describing this
process becomes mathematically degenerate in the limit of vanishing melt fraction. Numerical
methods that do not consider this degeneracy or avoid it solely by regularising specific material
properties generally become computationally expensive as soon as the melt fraction approaches
zero in some part of the domain. Here, we present a new formulation of the equations for coupled magma/mantle
dynamics that addresses this problem, and allows it to accurately compute large-scale 3-D magma/mantle
dynamics simulations with extensive regions of zero melt fraction. We achieve this by rescaling
one of the solution variables, the compaction pressure, which ensures that for vanishing melt fraction,
the equation causing the degeneracy becomes an identity and the other two equations revert to the
Stokes system. This allows us to split the domain into two parts, and to solve the coupled magma/mantle
dynamics system only in cells where melt is present. We have implemented this formulation in the
open source geodynamic modelling code ASPECT and illustrate the improved performance compared
to the previous three-field formulation, showing numerically that the new formulation is optimal
in terms of problem size and only minimally sensitive to model parameters. Beyond that, we demonstrate
the applicability to realistic problems by showing large-scale 2-D and 3-D models of mid-ocean
ridges with complex rheology. Hence, we believe that our new formulation and its implementation
in ASPECT will prove a valuable tool for studying the interaction of melt segregating through and
interacting with a solid host rock in the Earth and other planetary bodies using high-resolution,
three-dimensional simulations.
