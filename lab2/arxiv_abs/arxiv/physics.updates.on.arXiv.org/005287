In the experiment that first demonstrated gyrotactic behaviour of bottom-heavy swimming microalgae
(e.g. Chlamydomonas), Kessler (Nature, vol. 313, 1985, pp. 218-220) showed that a beam-like structure,
often referred to as a gyrotactic plume, would spontaneously appear from a suspension of gyrotactic
swimmers in a downflowing pipe. Such a plume is prone to an instability to form blips. This work models
the gyrotactic plume as a steady parallel basic state and its subsequent breakdown into blips as
an instability, employing both the Generalised Taylor Dispersion (GTD) theory and the Fokker-Planck
model for comparison. Upon solving for the basic state, it is discovered that the steady plume solution
undergoes sophisticated bifurcations. When there is no net flow, there exists a non-trivial solution
of the plume structure other than the stationary uniform suspension, stemming from a transcritical
bifurcation with the average cell concentration. When a net downflow is prescribed, there exists
a cusp bifurcation. Furthermore, there is a critical concentration, at which the cell concentration
at the centre would blow up for the GTD model. The subsequent stability analysis using the steady
plume solution shows that the Fokker-Planck model is inconsistent with what was experimentally
observed, as it predicts stabilisation of axisymmetric blips at high concentration of the plume
and destabilisation of the first non-axisymmetric mode at low flow rates. Finally, it is proposed
that the discovery of the steady plume solution emerging with the complicated bifurcation scenario
may offer new perspectives to interpret previous experimental observations of 'train-like' disturbances
in the plume.
