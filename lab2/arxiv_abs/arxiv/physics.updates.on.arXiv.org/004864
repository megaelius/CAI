Explicit quantification of uncertainty in engineering simulations is being increasingly used
to inform robust and reliable design practices. In the aerospace industry, computationally-feasible
analyses for design optimization purposes often introduce significant uncertainties due to deficiencies
in the mathematical models employed. In this paper, we discuss two recent improvements in the quantification
and combination of uncertainties from multiple sources that can help generate probabilistic aerodynamic
databases for use in aerospace engineering problems. We first discuss the eigenspace perturbation
methodology to estimate model-form uncertainties stemming from inadequacies in the turbulence
models used in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Computational Fluid Dynamics (RANS CFD) simulations.
We then present a multi-fidelity Gaussian Process framework that can incorporate noisy observations
to generate integrated surrogate models that provide mean as well as variance information for Quantities
of Interest (QoIs). The process noise is varied spatially across the domain and across fidelity
levels. Both these methodologies are demonstrated through their application to a full configuration
aircraft example, the NASA Common Research Model (CRM) in transonic conditions. First, model-form
uncertainties associated with RANS CFD simulations are estimated. Then, data from different sources
is used to generate multi-fidelity probabilistic aerodynamic databases for the NASA CRM. We discuss
the transformative effect that affordable and early treatment of uncertainties can have in traditional
aerospace engineering practices. The results are presented and compared to those from a Gaussian
Process regression performed on a single data source.
