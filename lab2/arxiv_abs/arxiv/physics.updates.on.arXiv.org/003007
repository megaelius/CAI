We exploit a lesser-known connection between the (temporal) Reynolds transport theorem, Reynolds
averaging and the Liouville equation for the flow of a conserved quantity, to derive new spatial
and parametric forms of these theorems and associated evolution operators, which provide maps
between different domains (in various spaces) associated with a conserved quantity in a vector
or tensor field. First, for a time-independent continuous flow field described by Eulerian velocity
and position coordinates $(\u,\x)$, we derive spatial analogs of the Reynolds transport theorem
and Liouville equation -- the latter based on the joint-conditional probability density function
$f(\u | \x)$ -- and spatial analogs of the Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators. These provide
spatial maps between different positions within a velocity gradient field. For intrinsic motion
(with a fixed tensorial frame of reference), the spatial mapping is induced by the shear stress tensor
field. The analysis is then generalized to derive parametric Reynolds transport theorems and Liouville
equations -- the latter based either on a probability differential form (using a generalized Lie
derivative and other operators) or probability density function -- and generalized parametric
Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators. The analyses reveal the existence of multivariate Lie
symmetries (in time, space or general parametric coordinates) induced by a vector or tensor field
associated with the flow of a conserved quantity. The findings are illustrated by application to
a variety of fluid flow and dynamical systems, including turbulent flow, two-point and $n$-point
correlation, Lagrangian, phase space, spectral and chemical reaction systems.
