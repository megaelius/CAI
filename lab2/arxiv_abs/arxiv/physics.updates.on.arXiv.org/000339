Human mobility is influenced by environmental change and natural disasters. Researchers have
used trip distance distribution, radius of gyration of movements, and individuals' visited locations
to understand and capture human mobility patterns and trajectories. However, our knowledge of
human movements during natural disasters is limited owing to both a lack of empirical data and the
low precision of available data. Here, we studied human mobility using high-resolution movement
data from individuals in New York City during and for several days after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
We found the human movements followed truncated power-law distributions during and after Hurricane
Sandy, although the {\beta} value was noticeably larger during the first 24 hours after the storm
struck. Also, we examined two parameters: the center of mass and the radius of gyration of each individual's
movements. We found that their values during perturbation states and steady states are highly correlated,
suggesting human mobility data obtained in steady states can possibly predict the perturbation
state. Our results demonstrate that human movement trajectories experienced significant perturbations
during hurricanes, but also exhibited high resilience. We expect the study will stimulate future
research on the perturbation and inherent resilience of human mobility under the influence of natural
disasters. For example, mobility patterns in coastal urban areas could be examined as tropical
cyclones approach, gain or dissipate in strength, and as the path of the storm changes. Understanding
nuances of human mobility under the influence of disasters will enable more effective evacuation,
emergency response planning and development of strategies and policies to reduce fatality, injury,
and economic loss.
