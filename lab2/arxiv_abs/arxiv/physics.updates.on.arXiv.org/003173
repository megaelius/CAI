The work shows that the evolution of the field of the free Klein-Gordon equation (KGE), in the hydrodynamic
representation, can be represented by the motion of a mass density subject to the Bohm-type quantum
potential, whose equation can be derived by a minimum action principle. Once the quantum hydrodynamic
motion equations have been covariantly extended to the curved space-time, the gravity equation
(GE), determining the geometry of the space-time, is obtained by minimizing the overall action
comprehending the gravitational field. The derived Einstein-like gravity for the KGE field shows
an energy-impulse tensor density (EITD) that is a function of the field with the spontaneous emergence
of the cosmological pressure tensor density (CPTD) that in the classical limit leads to the cosmological
constant(CC). The energy-impulse tensor of the theory shows analogies with the modified Brans-Dick
gravity with an effective gravity constant G divided by the field squared. Even if the classical
cosmological constant is set to zero, the model shows the emergence of a theory-derived quantum
CPTD that, in principle, allows to have a stable quantum vacuum (out of the collapsed branched polymer
phase) without postulating a non-zero classical CC. In the classical macroscopic limit, the gravity
equation of the KGE field leads to the Einstein equation. Moreover, if the boson field of the photon
is considered, the EITD correctly leads to its electromagnetic energy-impulse tensor density.
The outputs of the theory show that the expectation value of the CPTD is independent by the zero-point
vacuum energy density and that it tends to zero as the space-time approaches to the flat vacuum, leading
to an overall cosmological effect on the motion of the galaxies that may possibly be compatible with
the astronomical observations.
