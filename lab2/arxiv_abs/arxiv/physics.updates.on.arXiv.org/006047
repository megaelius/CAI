This paper presents a general synthetic iteration scheme (GSIS) for efficient steady-state solution
of the non-linear gas-kinetic equation. The GSIS has been recently developed to accelerate the
iterative convergence speed of solving steady-state linearized Boltzmann equation, and demonstrated
its computational efficiency for multiscale rarefied flow. Using GSIS for linear flows, converged
solutions can be obtained within a few dozens of iteration steps. The key ingredient of GSIS is to
synthetically couple the solving of a set of macroscopic equations after each iteration step of
the gas-kinetic equation, usually by the discrete velocity method (DVM). The synthetic macroscopic
equations explicitly include the Newton's law and Fourier's law in the diffusive fluxes, as well
as high-order contribution of the velocity distribution function from DVM. While the solution
of synthetic macroscopic equations is used to inform the next DVM iteration step. By such a synthetic
coupling strategy, the long-standing problems of the conventional DVM schemes for low-Kn flows,
i.e. extremely slow convergence and requirement of ultra-fine grids are resolved. In this paper,
the GSIS is extended to solve the non-linear gas-kinetic equation. The corresponding non-linear
synthetic macroscopic equations are implicitly solved after each DVM step to steady-state using
matured compressible CFD techniques. The spatial discretization in both the DVM and macroscopic
solvers uses the existing conventional schemes without complex evaluation of numerical fluxes
at the cell interfaces. Although the non-linear GSIS presented here uses the Shakhov model equation
as an example, it can be used to solve the full Boltzmann equation and other model equations. The high
efficiency and accuracy of the non-linear GSIS are demonstrated by a range of (pseudo) two-dimensional
flows in various regimes.
