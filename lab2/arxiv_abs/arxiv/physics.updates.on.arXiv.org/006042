In high mountains, the effects of climate change are manifesting most rapidly. This is especially
critical for the high-altitude carbon cycle, for which new feedbacks could be triggered. However,
mountain carbon dynamics is only partially known. In particular, models of the processes driving
carbon fluxes in high-altitude grasslands and Alpine tundra need to be improved. Here, we propose
a comparison of three empirical approaches using systematic statistical analysis, to identify
the environmental variables controlling $CO_2$ fluxes. The methods were applied to a complete
dataset of simultaneous in situ measurements of the net $CO_2$ exchange, ecosystem respiration
and basic environmental variables in three sampling sites in the same catchment. Large year-to-year
variations in the gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) dependences on
solar irradiance and temperature were observed,. We thus implemented a multi regression model
in which additional variables were introduced as perturbations of the standard exponential and
rectangular hyperbolic functions for ER and GPP, respectively. A comparison of this model with
other common modelling strategies, showed the benefits of this approach, resulting in large explained
variances (83% to 94%). The optimum ensemble of variables explaining the inter- and intra-annual
flux variability included solar irradiance, soil moisture and day of the year for GPP, and air temperature,
soil moisture, air pressure and day of the year for the ER, in agreement with other studies. The modelling
approach discussed here provides a basis for selecting drivers of carbon fluxes and understanding
their role in high-altitude Alpine ecosystems, also allowing for future short-range assessments
of local trends.
