On-chip optical waveguides with low propagation losses and precisely engineered group velocity
dispersion (GVD) are important to nonlinear photonic devices such as soliton microcombs. Yet,
despite intensive research efforts, nonlinear integrated photonic platforms still feature propagation
losses orders of magnitude higher than in standard optical fiber. The tight confinement and high
index contrast of integrated waveguides make them highly susceptible to fabrication induced surface
roughness. Therefore, microresonators with ultra-high Q factors are, to date, only attainable
in polished bulk crystalline, or chemically etched silica based devices, that pose however challenges
for full photonic integration. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of silicon nitride ($\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$)
waveguides with unprecedentedly smooth sidewalls and tight confinement with record low propagation
losses. This is achieved by combining the photonic Damascene process with a novel reflow process,
which reduces etching roughness, while sufficiently preserving dimensional accuracy. This leads
to previously unattainable \emph{mean} microresonator Q factors larger than $5\times10^6$ for
tightly confining waveguides with anomalous dispersion. Via systematic process step variation
and two independent characterization techniques we differentiate the scattering and absorption
loss contributions, and reveal metal impurity related absorption to be an important loss origin.
Although such impurities are known to limit optical fibers, this is the first time they are identified,
and play a tangible role, in absorption of integrated microresonators. Taken together, our work
provides new insights in the origins of propagation losses in $\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$ waveguides and
provides the technological basis for integrated nonlinear photonics in the ultra-high Q regime.
