Building on the successful experience in operating the DarkSide-50 detector, the DarkSide Collaboration
is going to construct DarkSide-20k, a direct WIMP search detector using a two-phase Liquid Argon
Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) with an active (fiducial) mass of 23 t (20 t). The DarkSide-20k
LArTPC will be deployed within a shield/veto with a spherical Liquid Scintillator Veto (LSV) inside
a cylindrical Water Cherenkov Veto (WCV). Operation of DarkSide-50 demonstrated a major reduction
in the dominant $^{39}$Ar background when using argon extracted from an underground source, before
applying pulse shape analysis. Data from DarkSide-50, in combination with MC simulation and analytical
modeling, shows that a rejection factor for discrimination between electron and nuclear recoils
of $\gt3\times10^9$ is achievable. This, along with the use of the veto system, is the key to unlocking
the path to large LArTPC detector masses, while maintaining an "instrumental background-free"
experiment, an experiment in which less than 0.1 events (other than $\nu$-induced nuclear recoils)
is expected to occur within the WIMP search region during the planned exposure. DarkSide-20k will
have ultra-low backgrounds than can be measured in situ. This will give sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon
cross sections of $1.2\times10^{-47}$ cm$^2$ ($1.1\times10^{-46}$ cm$^2$) for WIMPs of $1$ TeV$/c^2$
($10$ TeV$/c^2$) mass, to be achieved during a 5 yr run producing an exposure of 100 t yr free from any
instrumental background. DarkSide-20k could then extend its operation to a decade, increasing
the exposure to 200 t yr, reaching a sensitivity of $7.4\times10^{-48}$ cm$^2$ ($6.9\times10^{-47}$
cm$^2$) for WIMPs of $1$ TeV$/c^2$ ($10$ TeV$/c^2$) mass.
