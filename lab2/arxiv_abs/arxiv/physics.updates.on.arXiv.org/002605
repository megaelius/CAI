A work recently published experimentally demonstrates an increase in the radiobiological efficacy
of clinical proton beams when a tumour is treated in the presence of a concentration of 11B. The paper,
for the first time, demonstrates the potential role of the p+11B to 3{\alpha} (for brevity, p-B)
reaction in the biological enhancement of proton therapy effectiveness. The work reports robust
experimental data in terms of clonogenic cell survival and chromosomal aberrations and unambiguously
shows the presence of an enhancement when cells were exposed to a clinical proton beam subject to
treatment with sodium boroncaptate (BSH). Moreover, the greater occurrence of complex-type chromosomal
exchanges points to the effect as due radiation of a LET (Linear Energy Transfer) greater than that
of protons alone, possibly the alpha particles generated by the reaction. At the same time, we emphasized
that analytical calculations, performed on the basis of the well-known total production cross
section data, are not able to explain the effect in a macroscopic way, i.e. solely in terms of a trivial
increase in the total dose released in the cells by the alpha-particles. In this paper, thanks to
simulations and analytical calculations, we will discuss the theoretically expected alpha particle
yield and the corresponding LET and RBE (Relative Biological Effectiveness) increase related
to the 11B presence. We conclude that a mere calculation based on the classical concepts of integral
Dose, and average LET and RBE cannot be used to justify the observed radiobiological phenomena.
We, therefore, suggest that micro- and nano-dosimetric aspects must be taken into account.
