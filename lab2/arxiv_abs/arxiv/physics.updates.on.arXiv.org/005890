Many real networks in social sciences, biological and biomedical sciences or computer science
have an inherent structure of simplicial complexes reflecting many-body interactions. Therefore,
to analyse topological and dynamical properties of simplicial complex networks centrality measures
for simplices need to be proposed. Many of the classical complex networks centralities are based
on the degree of a node, so in order to define degree centrality measures for simplices (which would
characterise the relevance of a simplicial community in a simplicial network), a different definition
of adjacency between simplices is required. The aim of these notes is threefold: first we will use
the recently introduced notions of higher order simplicial degrees to propose new degree based
centrality measures in simplicial complexes. These theoretical centrality measures, such as
the simplicial degree centrality or the eigenvector centrality would allow not only to study the
relevance of a simplicial community and the quality of its higher-order connections in a simplicial
network, but also they might help to elucidate topological and dynamical properties of simplicial
networks; sencond, we define notions of walks and distances in simplicial complexes in order to
study connectivity of simplicial networks and to generalise, to the simplicial case, the well known
closeness and betweenness centralities (needed for instance to study the relevance of a simplicial
community in terms of its ability of transmitting information); third, we propose a new clustering
coefficient for simplices in a simplicial network, different from the one knows so far and which
generalises the standard graph clustering of a vertex. This measure should be essential to know
the density of a simplicial network in terms of its simplicial communities.
