Single cell and regularly cells docking inside the microstructure of microfluidic systems are
advantageous in different analyses of single cells exposed to equal drug concentration and mechanical
stimulus. In this study, we investigated bottom wall microgrooves with semicircular and rectangular
geometries with different sizes which are suitable for single cell docking along the length of the
microgroove in x direction and numerous cells docking regularly in one line inside the microgroove
in a 3D microchannel. We used computational fluid dynamics to analyze the fluid recirculation area
inside different microgrooves. The height of recirculation area in the bottom of microgroove can
affect the cell attachment, and also materials delivery to attached cells, so the height of recirculation
area has to be optimum amount. In addition, we analyzed the fluid drag force on cell movement toward
the microgroove. This parameter was proportional to the fluid velocities in x and y directions changing
in different microgrooves geometries. In different microgrooves geometries the fluid velocity
in y direction does not change. If the fluid velocity in x direction decreases inside the microgroove,
the cell movement time inside the microgroove will increase, and also the drag force in y direction
can push the cells toward the bottom due to the lower drag force in x direction. The percentages of
negative shear stress and average shear stress on the adhered cell surface were also calculated.
The lower average shear stress, and negative shear stress around 50% on the cell surface are against
cell detachment from the substrate. The results indicated that at the constant fluid inlet velocity
and microchannel height, microgroove geometry and ratio of cell size to the microgroove size play
pivotal roles in the cell initial adhesion to the substrate as well as the cell detachment.
