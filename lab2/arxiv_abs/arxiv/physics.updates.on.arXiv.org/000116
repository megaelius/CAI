This paper describes an all-electron implementation of the self-consistent GW (sc-GW) approach
-- i.e. based on the solution of the Dyson equation -- in an all-electron numeric atom-centered orbital
(NAO) basis set. We cast Hedin's equations into a matrix form that is suitable for numerical calculations
by means of i) the resolution of identity technique to handle 4-center integrals; and ii) a basis
representation for the imaginary-frequency dependence of dynamical operators. In contrast to
perturbative G0W0, sc-GW provides a consistent framework for ground- and excited-state properties
and facilitates an unbiased assessment of the GW approximation. For excited-states, we benchmark
sc-GW for five molecules relevant for organic photovoltaic applications: thiophene, benzothiazole,
1,2,5-thiadiazole, naphthalene, and tetrathiafulvalene. At self-consistency, the quasi-particle
energies are found to be in good agreement with experiment and, on average, more accurate than G0W0
based on Hartree-Fock (HF) or density-functional theory with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
exchange-correlation functional. Based on the Galitskii-Migdal total energy, structural properties
are investigated for a set of diatomic molecules. For binding energies, bond lengths, and vibrational
frequencies sc-GW and G0W0 achieve a comparable performance, which is, however, not as good as that
of exact-exchange plus correlation in the random-phase approximation (EX+cRPA) and its advancement
to renormalized second-order perturbation theory (rPT2). Finally, the improved description
of dipole moments for a small set of diatomic molecules demonstrates the quality of the sc-GW ground
state density.
