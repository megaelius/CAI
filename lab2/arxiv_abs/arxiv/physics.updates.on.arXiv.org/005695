This is the first of two papers which attempt to comprehensively analyse superdeterministic hidden-variables
models of Bell correlations. We first give an overview of superdeterminism and discuss various
criticisms of it raised in the literature. We argue that the most common criticism, the violation
of `free-will', is incorrect. We take up Bell's intuitive criticism that these models are `conspiratorial'.
To develop this further, we introduce nonequilibrium extensions of superdeterministic models.
We show that the measurement statistics of these extended models depend on the physical system used
to determine the measurement settings. This suggests a fine-tuning in order to eliminate this dependence
from experimental observation. We also study the signalling properties of these extended models.
We show that although they generally violate the formal no-signalling constraints, this violation
cannot be equated to physical signalling, in the sense of information transfer between the wings.
We therefore suggest that the so-called no-signalling constraints be more appropriately named
the marginal-independence constraints. We discuss the mechanism by which marginal-independence
is violated in superdeterministic models. We use this to delineate the superdeterministic contribution
to the net change in marginals for a hybrid nonlocal superdeterministic model (in nonequilibrium).
Lastly, we consider a hypothetical scenario where two experimenters use the apparent-signalling
of a superdeterministic model to communicate with each other. This scenario suggests another conspiratorial
feature peculiar to superdeterminism. These suggestions are quantitatively developed in the
second paper.
