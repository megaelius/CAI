The electronic spectra of cold benzylium (C6H5-CH2+) and 1-phenylethyl (C6H5-CH-CH3+)cations
have been recorded via photofragment spectroscopy. Benzylium and 1-phenylethyl cations produced
from electrosprayed benzylamine and phenylethylamine solutions, respectively, were stored
in a cryogenically cooled quadrupole ion trap and photodissociated by an OPO laser, scanned in parts
of the UV and visible regions (600-225 nm). The electronic states and active vibrational modes of
the benzylium and 1-phenylethyl cations as well as those of their tropylium or methyl tropylium
isomers have been calculated with ab initio methods for comparison with the spectra observed. Sharp
vibrational progressions are observed in the visible region while the absorption features are
much broader in the UV. The visible spectrum of the benzylium cation is similar to that obtained in
an argon tagging experiment [V. Dryza, N. Chalyavi, J.A. Sanelli, and E.J. Bieske, J. Chem. Phys.
137, 204304 (2012)], with an additional splitting assigned to Fermi resonances. The visible spectrum
of the 1-phenylethyl cation also shows vibrational progressions. For both cations, the second
electronic transition is observed in the UV, around 33 000 cm-1 (4.1 eV), and shows a broadened vibrational
progression. In both cases the S2 optimized geometry is non planar. The third electronic transition
observed around 40 000 cm-1 (5.0 eV) is even broader with no apparent vibrational structures, which
is indicative of either a fast non-radiative process or a very large change in geometry between the
excited and the ground states. The oscillator strengths calculated for tropylium and methyl tropylium
are weak. Therefore, these isomeric structures are most likely not responsible for these absorption
features. Finally, the fragmentation pattern changes in the second and third electronic states:
C2H2 loss becomes predominant at higher excitation energies, for both cations.
