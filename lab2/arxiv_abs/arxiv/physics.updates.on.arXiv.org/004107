The prediction of complex nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of machine learning techniques
has become increasingly popular. In particular, reservoir computing turned out to be a very promising
approach especially for the reproduction of the long-term properties of a nonlinear system. Yet,
a thorough statistical analysis of the forecast results is missing. Using the Lorenz and R\"ossler
system we statistically analyze the quality of prediction for different parametrizations - both
the exact short-term prediction as well as the reproduction of the long-term properties (the "climate")
of the system as estimated by the correlation dimension and largest Lyapunov exponent. We find that
both short and longterm predictions vary significantly among the realizations. Thus special care
must be taken in selecting the good predictions as predictions which deliver better short-term
prediction also tend to better resemble the long-term climate of the system. Instead of only using
purely random Erd\"os-Renyi networks we also investigate the benefit of alternative network topologies
such as small world or scale-free networks and show which effect they have on the prediction quality.
Our results suggest that the overall performance with respect to the reproduction of the climate
of both the Lorenz and R\"ossler system is worst for scale-free networks. For the Lorenz system there
seems to be a slight benefit of using small world networks while for the R\"ossler system small world
and Erd\"os -Renyi networks performed equivalently well. In general the observation is that reservoir
computing works for all network topologies investigated here.
