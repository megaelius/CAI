Turbulence small-scale behavior has been commonly investigated in literature by decomposing
the velocity-gradient tensor ($A_{ij}$) into the symmetric strain-rate ($S_{ij}$) and anti-symmetric
rotation-rate ($W_{ij}$) tensors. To develop further insight, we revisit some of the key studies
using a triple decomposition of the velocity-gradient tensor. The additive triple decomposition
formally segregates the contributions of normal-strain-rate ($N_{ij}$), pure-shear ($H_{ij}$)
and rigid-body-rotation-rate ($R_{ij}$). The decomposition not only highlights the key role
of shear, but it also provides a more accurate account of the influence of normal-strain and pure
rotation on important small-scale features. First, the local streamline topology and geometry
are described in terms of the three constituent tensors in velocity-gradient invariants' space.
Using DNS data sets of forced isotropic turbulence, the velocity-gradient and pressure field fluctuations
are examined at different Reynolds numbers. At all Reynolds numbers, shear contributes the most
and rigid-body-rotation the least toward the velocity-gradient magnitude ($A^2$). Especially,
shear contribution is dominant in regions of intermittency (high values of $A^2$). It is also shown
that the high-degree of enstrophy intermittency reported in literature is due to the shear contribution
toward vorticity rather than that of rigid-body-rotation. The study also provides an explanation
for the absence of intermittency of the pressure-Laplacian, despite the strong intermittency
of enstrophy and dissipation fields. Overall, it is demonstrated that triple decomposition offers
unique and deeper understanding of velocity-gradient behavior in turbulence.
