In this paper, we show that Stokes drift may be significantly affected when an incident intermediate
or shallow water surface wave travels over a corrugated sea-floor. The underlying mechanism is
Bragg resonance -- reflected waves generated via nonlinear resonant interactions between an incident
wave and a rippled bottom. We theoretically explain the fundamental effect of two counter-propagating
Stokes waves on Stokes drift and then perform numerical simulations of Bragg resonance using High-order
Spectral method. A monochromatic incident wave on interaction with a patch of bottom ripple yields
a complex interference between the incident and reflected waves. When the velocity induced by the
reflected waves exceeds that of the incident, particle trajectories reverse, leading to a backward
drift. Lagrangian and Lagrangian-mean trajectories reveal that surface particles near the up-wave
side of the patch are either trapped or reflected, implying that the rippled patch acts as a non-surface-invasive
particle trap or reflector. On increasing the length and amplitude of the rippled patch; reflection,
and thus the effectiveness of the patch, increases. The inclusion of realistic constant current
shows noticeable differences between Lagrangian-mean trajectories with and without the rippled
patch. Theoretical analysis reveals additional terms in the Stokes drift arising from the particular
solution due to mean-current--bottom-ripple interactions, irrespective of whether Bragg resonance
condition is met. Our analyses may be useful for designing artificial, corrugated sea-floor patches
for mitigating microplastics and other forms of ocean pollution. We also expect that sea-floor
corrugations, especially in the nearshore region, may significantly affect oceanic tracer transport.
