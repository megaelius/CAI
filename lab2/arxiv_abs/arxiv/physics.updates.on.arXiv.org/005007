Spectral fingerprints of molecules are mostly accessible in the terahertz and mid-infrared ranges,
such that efficient molecular-detection technologies rely on broadband coherent light sources
at such frequencies. THz Quantum Cascade Lasers can achieve octave-spanning bandwidths. However,
their tunability and wavelength selectivity is often constrained by the geometry of their cavity.
The recently introduced Quantum Cascade Random Lasers represent alternative sources of THz light,
in which random scattering provides the required field confinement. The random resonator geometry
greatly relaxes wavelength selectivity, thus producing radiation that is both spectrally broadband
and collimated in the far-field. Yet, the intrinsic randomness of these devices' spectral emission
strongly restricts the scope of their potential applications. In this work, we demonstrate the
all-optical adaptive control and tuning of Quantum Cascade Random Lasers. The specificity of our
random-laser sources is exploited to locally modify the system's permittivity with a near-infrared
(NIR) laser beam and thereby substantially reconfigure the distribution of disorder. Using a spatial
light modulator combined with an optimization procedure, the NIR illumination is spatially modulated
to reshape the spectral emission and transform the initially multimode laser into a single mode
source, which could be harnessed to perform self-referenced spectroscopic measurements. Moreover,
we show that local NIR perturbations can be used to sense linear and nonlinear interactions amongst
modes in the near field. Our work points the way towards the design of broadly tunable THz sources
with greatly relaxed fabrication constraints.
