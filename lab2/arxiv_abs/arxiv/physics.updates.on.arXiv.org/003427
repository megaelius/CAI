Purpose: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) reconstruction is a challenging inverse
problem driven by poor conditioning of the field to susceptibility transformation. State-of-art
QSM reconstruction methods either suffer from image artifacts or long computation times, which
limits QSM clinical translation efforts. To overcome these limitations, a deep-learning-based
approach is proposed and demonstrated. Methods: An encoder-decoder neural network was trained
to infer susceptibility maps on volume parcellated regions. The training data consisted of fabricated
susceptibility distributions modeled to mimic the spatial frequency patterns of in-vivo brain
susceptibility distributions. Inferred volume parcels were recombined to form composite QSM.
This approach is denoted as ASPEN, standing for Approximated Susceptibility through Parcellated
Encoder-decoder Networks. ASPEN performance was evaluated relative to several well-established
approaches on a gold-standard challenge dataset and on cohort of 200 study subjects. Results: ASPEN
provided similar levels of quantitative accuracy compared to the evaluated established approaches
on the gold standard ISMRM Challenge dataset, but qualitatively showed marked reductions in streaking
artifacts and map blurring. On the large-cohort dataset, ASPEN achieved the highest score compared
with other methods in a multi-rater evaluation of streaking artifacts and map resolution. Conclusion:
The proposed ASPEN approach can robustly infer susceptibility maps in near real-time on routine
computational hardware. This preliminary study establishes ASPEN's parity with existing approaches
for quantitative accuracy on a well-curated gold standard dataset and further demonstrates its
robustness to streaking artifacts across a large cohort of subjects.
