Atmospheric pressure arcs have recently found application in the production of nanoparticles.
Distinguishing features of such arcs are small length and hot ablating anode characterized by intensive
electron emission and radiation from its surface. We performed one-dimensional modeling of argon
arc, which shows that near-electrode effects of thermal and ionization non-equilibrium play important
role in operation of a short arc, because the non-equilibrium regions are up to several millimeters
long and are comparable with the arc length. The near-anode region is typically longer than the near-cathode
region and its length depends more strongly on the current density. The model was extensively verified
and validated against previous simulation results and experimental data. Volt-Ampere characteristic
(VAC) of the near-anode region depends on the anode cooling mechanism. The anode voltage is negative.
In case of strong anode cooling (water-cooled anode) when anode is cold, temperature and plasma
density gradients increase with current density resulting in decrease of the anode voltage (absolute
value increases). Falling VAC of the near-anode region suggests the arc constriction near the anode.
Without anode cooling, the anode temperature increases significantly with current density, leading
to drastic increase in the thermionic emission current from the anode. Correspondingly, the anode
voltage increases to suppress the emission - and the opposite trend in the VAC is observed. The results
of simulations were found to be independent of sheath model used: collisional (fluid) or collisionless
model gave the same plasma profiles for both near-anode and near-cathode regions.
