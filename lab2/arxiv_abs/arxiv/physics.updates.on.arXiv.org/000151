This study is focused on the effects of cosmic rays (solar activity) and halogenated molecules (mainly
chlorofluorocarbons-CFCs) on atmospheric O3 depletion and global climate change. Brief reviews
are first given on the cosmic-ray-driven electron-induced-reaction (CRE) theory for O3 depletion
and the warming theory of CFCs for climate change. Then natural and anthropogenic contributions
are examined in detail and separated well through in-depth statistical analyses of comprehensive
measured datasets. For O3 loss, new statistical analyses of the CRE equation with observed data
of total O3 and stratospheric temperature give high linear correlation coefficients >=0.92.
After removal of the CR effect, a pronounced recovery by 20~25% of the Antarctic O3 hole is found,
while no recovery of O3 loss in mid-latitudes has been observed. These results show both the dominance
of the CRE mechanism and the success of the Montreal Protocol. For global climate change, in-depth
analyses of observed data clearly show that the solar effect and human-made halogenated gases played
the dominant role in Earth climate change prior to and after 1970, respectively. Remarkably, a statistical
analysis gives a nearly zero correlation coefficient (R=-0.05) between global surface temperature
and CO2 concentration in 1850-1970. In contrast, a nearly perfect linear correlation with R=0.96-0.97
is found between global surface temperature and total amount of stratospheric halogenated gases
in 1970-2012. Further, a new theoretical calculation on the greenhouse effect of halogenated gases
shows that they (mainly CFCs) could alone lead to the global surface temperature rise of ~0.6 deg
C in 1970-2002. These results provide solid evidence that recent global warming was indeed caused
by anthropogenic halogenated gases. Thus, a slow reversal of global temperature to the 1950 value
is predicted for coming 5~7 decades.
