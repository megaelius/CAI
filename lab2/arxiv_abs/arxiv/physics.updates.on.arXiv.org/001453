Dual THz comb spectroscopy has the potential to be used as universal THz spectroscopy with high spectral
resolution, high spectral accuracy, and broad spectral coverage; however, the requirement for
dual stabilized femtosecond lasers hampers its versatility due to the bulky size, high complexity,
and high cost. We here report the first demonstration of dual THz comb spectroscopy using a single
free-running fibre laser. By tuning the cavity-loss-dependent gain profile with an intracavity
Lyot filter together with precise management of the cavity length and dispersion, dual-wavelength
pulsed light beams with slightly detuned repetition frequencies are generated in a single laser
cavity. Due to sharing of the same cavity, such pulsed light beams suffer from common-mode fluctuation
of the repetition frequency, and hence the corresponding frequency difference between them is
passively stable around a few hundred hertz within millihertz fluctuation. This considerably
stable frequency difference enables dual THz comb spectroscopy with a single free-running fibre
laser. While greatly reducing the size, complexity, and cost of the laser source by use of a single
free-running fibre laser, the dual THz comb spectroscopy system maintains a spectral bandwidth
and dynamic range of spectral power comparable to a system equipped with dual stabilized fibre lasers,
and can be effectively applied to high-precision spectroscopy of acetonitrile gas at atmospheric
pressure. The demonstrated results indicate that this system is an attractive solution for practical
applications of not only THz spectroscopy but also THz-pulse-based measurements.
