We study extrema with velocity discontinuities of the variational two-body problem with boundary
conditions in past and future. Along $C^2$ segments, these broken extrema satisfy Euler-Lagrange
equations which are neutral differential delay equations with state-dependent deviating arguments.
At points where velocities are discontinuous, broken extrema (spiky orbits) satisfy the Weierstrass-Erdmann
corner conditions that energies and momenta are continuous. We construct periodic broken extrema
near some $C^{\infty}$ circular orbits, using solutions of the neutral differential delay equations
along regular segments and a variational approximation for the spiky boundary-layer segments.
Finitely measured families of spiky periodic orbits result from the Weierstrass-Erdmann stabilization
of the explosive tangent modes near some discrete circular orbits, with scales defined by the Weierstrass-Erdmann
conditions. The Weierstrass-Erdmann conditions are further compatible with the requirement
of vanishing far-fields, thus creating finitely measured periodic orbits with vanishing far-fields
right at the atomic magnitude (small finite volumes in phase space). We vary the mass ratio by three
orders of magnitude, i.e., the hydrogen, muonium and positronium atoms. In each case the broken
extrema have magnitudes in quantitative agreement with nature and quantum mechanics, i.e., the
spacings between consecutive discrete orbital angular momenta agree with Planck's constant within
thirty-percent, while orbital frequencies agree with a corresponding circular line of quantum
mechanics within a few percent. The agreement is surprisingly better for the decay from the deepest
quantum levels. Last, we discuss the extension of Wheeler-Feynman classical electrodynamics
of point charges to variational electrodynamics.
