The air entrainment due to the turbulence in a free surface boundary layer shear flow created by a
horizontally moving vertical surface-piercing wall is studied through experiments and direct
numerical simulations. In the experiments, a laboratory-scale device was built that utilizes
a surface-piercing stainless steel belt that travels in a loop around two vertical rollers, with
one length of the belt between the rollers acting as a horizontally-moving flat wall. To complement
the experiments, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the two-phase boundary layer problem were
carried out with the domain including a streamwise belt section simulated with periodic boundary
conditions. Cinematic Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) measurements of water surface profiles
in two vertical planes oriented parallel to the belt surface (wall-parallel profiles) are presented
and compared to previous measurements of profiles in a vertical plane oriented normal to the belt
surface (wall-normal profiles). Additionally, photographic observations of air entrainment
and measurements of air bubble size distributions and motions are reported herein. The bubble entrainment
mechanisms are studied in detail through the results obtained by the DNS simulations. Free surface
features resembling breaking waves and traveling parallel to the belt are observed in the wall-parallel
LIF movies. These breaking events are thought to be one of the mechanisms by which the air is entrained
into the underlying flow. The bubble size distribution is found to have a characteristic break in
slope, similar to the Hinze scale previously observed in breaking waves. Finally, several entrainment
mechanisms are found in the simulations and their prevalence in the free surface boundary layer
is assessed.
