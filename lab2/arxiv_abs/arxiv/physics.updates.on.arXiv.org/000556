For development of compact ultrafast electron source system, we are currently designing a short-pulse
RF-gun with RF focusing structure by means of a series of comprehensive modeling analysis processes.
EM design of a 2.5 cell resonant cavity with input coupler, acceleration dynamics of photo-emitted
electron bunch, EM design of RF-lens with input coupler, and phasespace analysis of focused electron
bunch are systematically examined with multi-physics simulators. All the features of the 2.856
GHz cavity geometry were precisely engineered for acceleration energies ranging from 100 keV to
500 keV (safety limited) to be powered by our 5 MW S-band klystron. The klystron (Thales TH2163) and
modulator system (ScandiNova K1 turnkey system) were successfully installed and tested. Performance
tests of the klystron system show peak output power > 5 MW, as per operation specifications. At
the quasi-relativistic energies, the electron source is capable of generating 100fC -- 1 pC electron
bunch with pulse duration close to 30 fs -- 1 ps and transverse size of a few hundred microns. PIC simulations
have shown that the electron bunch undergoes fast RF acceleration, rapidly reaching the desired
energies, which can be controlled by tuning RF injection phase and input driving power. It has been
shown that it is possible to also focus/compress the bunch longitudinally using a RF-lens, which
would allow us to control the temporal resolution of the system as well. While our primary analysis
has been performed on a 2.5 cell design, we are also looking into half-cell (single cavity) design
that is expected to provide the same range of beam energy with a simple configuration.
