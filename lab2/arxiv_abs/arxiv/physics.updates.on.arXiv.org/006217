Lack of methodical support, low level of teachers' awareness of existing effective teaching technologies
such as computer modeling does not allow students to form their own individual trajectory for development
as well as their competence in natural and mathematical education. The model of use of the computer
modeling system for developing students' competences in natural and mathematical subjects has
been developed. The peculiarities of this model include its use on the basis of child-centric, systemic,
activity, differentiated approaches with the purpose of forming natural and mathematical subject
students' competences. An important result of the study is the justification of CMODS selection
criteria (variability, accessibility, tooling, interactivity, intuition, complexity, data
visuality, scientific ground of models, independence, realism); forms and methods of applying
CMODS in the educational process, allocating the aspect of cognitive tasks application (research,
creative, applied) for the students competences formation; the justification of such forms of
evaluation as reflection, formative evaluation, final evaluation. Computer modeling systems
become an alternative to conventional drawings in paper course books and posters. Imitation processes,
interactive exercises of various types, animation support as well as formative assessment give
each student the opportunity of developing competence and exploring the world with enthusiasm.
The use of CMODS diversifies the process of obtaining knowledge, allows transfer from passive to
active teaching methods, activates educational and cognitive activity of students, as well as
the creation of an individual trajectory for development for each student in the process of studying
natural and mathematical subjects.
