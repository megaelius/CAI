Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) taking place in mass spectrometry (MS) can provide in-depth insights
into the fragmental behaviors of compounds in MS. Yet the mechanisms of KIEs in collision-induced
dissociation (CID) in tandem MS are unclear, and information about chlorine KIEs (Cl-KIEs) of organochlorines
in MS is particularly scarce. This study investigated the Cl-KIEs of dichloromethane, trichloroethylene
and tetrachloroethylene during CID using gas chromatography-electron ionization triple-quadrupole
tandem MS. Cl-KIEs were measured with MS signal intensities, and their validity was confirmed in
terms of chromatograms, crosstalk effects and background subtraction influences. All the organochlorines
presented large inverse Cl-KIEs, showing the largest values of 0.492, 0.910 and 0.892 at the highest
collision energy for dichloromethane, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, respectively.
For dichloromethane, both intra-ion and inter-ion Cl-KIEs were studied, within the ranges of 0.492-1.020
and 0.614-1.026, respectively, showing both normal and inverse Cl-KIEs depending on collision
energies. The observed Cl-KIEs generally declined with the increasing collision energies from
0-60 eV, but were inferred to be independent of MS signal intensities. The Cl-KIEs are dominated
by critical energies at low internal energies, while controlled by rotational barriers (or looseness/tightness
of transition states) at high internal energies. It is concluded that the Cl-KIEs may depend on critical
energies, bond strengths, available internal energies, and transition state looseness/tightness.
The findings of this study yield new insights into the fundamentals of Cl-KIEs of organochlorines
during CID, and may be conducive to elucidating the mechanisms of KIEs in collision-induced and
photo-induced reactions in the actual world.
