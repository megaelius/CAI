Fragments of deep-ocean tidal records up to 3 days long belong to the same functional sub-space,
regardless of the record's origin. The tidal sub-space basis can be derived via Empirical Orthogonal
Function (EOF) analysis of a tidal record of a single buoy. Decomposition of a tsunami buoy record
in a functional space of tidal EOFs presents an efficient tool for a short-term tidal forecast, as
well as for an accurate tidal removal (Tolkova, E. 2009. Principal Component Analysis of Tsunami
Buoy Record: Tide Prediction and Removal. Dyn. Atmos. Oceans, 46 (1-4): 62-82.) EOF analysis of
a time series, however, assumes that the time series represents a stationary (in the weak sense)
process. In the present work, a modification of one-dimensional EOF formalism not restricted to
stationary processes is introduced. With this modification, the EOF-based de-tiding/forecasting
technique can be interpreted in terms of a signal passage through a filter bank, which is unique for
the sub-space spanned by the EOFs. This interpretation helps to identify a harmonic content of a
continuous process whose fragments are decomposed by given EOFs. In particular, seven EOFs and
a constant function are proved to decompose 1-day-long tidal fragments at any location. Filtering
by projection into a reduced sub-space of the above EOFs is capable of separating a tsunami wave from
a tidal component within a few millimeter accuracy from the first minutes of the tsunami appearance
on a tsunami buoy record, and is reliable in the presence of data gaps. EOFs with ~3-day duration (a
reciprocal of either tidal band width) allow short-term (24.75 hour in advance) tidal predictions
using the inherent structure of a tidal signal. The predictions do not require any a priori knowledge
of tidal processes at a particular location, except for recent 49.5 hour long recordings at the location.
