An ab-initio analysis based on coupled mode theory (CMT) is applied to describe the interaction
dynamics of high dielectric resonators (DRs) with its containing aqueous solution. We prove that
the coupling mechanism is reciprocal. Such property is exploited to find closed form and accurate
expressions of the coupling coefficient, the main factor characterizing the system performance.
Based on such expressions, it is shown that, for wireless power transfer (WPT) applications, up
sizing the DRs relaxes the need of using ultra high dielectric constant materials. The nature of
interaction is captured by the coupling matrix, which shows that the behaviour of the system is identical
to the ones studied extensively in the literature when the contained aqueous solution is replaced
by an enclosing cavity. It follows, as in a typical three coupled resonators setting, that when two
DRs are inserted in the aqueous solution a non-bonding mode emerges; hence enabling efficient wireless
power transfer (WPT) via the opening of an electromagnetic induced transparency like window. Due
to the inevitable situations where the DRs are not symmetrically placed inside the solution, the
general eigenvalue problem, with asymmetrically placed DR inserts is solved and the eigenvectors
representing the coupled modes are depicted by vectors in a 3D mathematical space where the uncoupled
modes represent its basis. Moreover, the strong coupling between the DR inserts and the aqueous
medium allows the proposed WPT system to tolerate intrinsic aqueous solution losses and the presence
of extraneous objects. Additionally, the value of the load at maximum efficiency is independent
of the aqueous solution loss tangent, thus tolerating the variation of the medium salinity. The
Proposed EIT like scheme can find applications for mid/short range power transfer in/through swimming
pools, chemical reactors, fish tanks, etc.
