Electronic devices are progressively fabricated on flexible substrates allowing new fields of
applications. A maskless and very flexible structuring process is offered by ablation using ultra-short
pulse laser irradiation. Usually, certain areas of a functional thin film coating are locally removed
to yield the needed device structures. Micro laser patterning quality is not only influenced by
the beam properties (beam profile, fluence) but also by pulse overlap, scan repetitions and many
other factors such as substrate and coating material. This makes process parameter optimization
a challenging task. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to efficiently find suitable
parameters for laser-induced ablation of thin films on susceptible polymer substrates. As an example,
we use a sputtered NiCr coating with a thickness of 100 $nm$ on a polyimide film made by spin coating
of PI-2611 precursor (@ 2000 $rpm$ > ca. 8 ${\mu}m$, HD microsystems). Irradiation is conducted
using a fs-laser with infrared wavelength of 1030 $nm$ and a pulse length of 212 $fs$. The energy per
pulse is varied in the range of 0,29 ${\mu}J$ to 4,83 ${\mu}J$, yielding fluence values between 70
$mJ/cm^2$ and 1,11 $J/cm^2$. Ablation threshold fluence for a 100 $nm$ layer of NiCr was found to
be ${\phi}_{th}$ ($N_P$:1)=0,50 $J/cm^2$ and the incubation factor was evaluated to be ${\xi}$=0,53.
A clear distinction must be made between the material ablation at the surface of a bulk material and
the selective removal of a thin film. In the second case effects such as flaking occur in practice
and influence the ablation characteristic. We then investigate different varieties of thin film
removal including dot-, line- and areal-ablation. The methodology is presented using a practical
example, but can be applied to selective ablation of a wide range of thin film systems.
