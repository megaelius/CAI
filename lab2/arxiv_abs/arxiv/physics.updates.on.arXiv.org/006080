At near-grounded glacier termini, calving can lead to the capsize of kilometer-scale (i.e. gigatons)
unstable icebergs. The transient contact force applied by the capsizing iceberg on the glacier
front generates seismic waves that propagate over teleseismic distances. The inversion of this
seismic signal is of great interest to get insight into actual and past capsize dynamics. However,
the iceberg size, which is of interest for geophysical and climatic studies, cannot be recovered
from the seismic amplitude alone. This is because the capsize is a complex process involving interactions
between the iceberg, the glacier and the surrounding water. For this reason, we propose an approach
based on the computation of the source force with a mechanical model for various iceberg geometries
and the estimation of the iceberg size from a comparison of the computed and seismically inverted
time histories of the force. The capsize dynamics is captured by computational fluid dynamic (CFD)
simulations for a simple scenario of capsize in the open ocean without glacier front. This approach
allows assessing the complexity of the fluid motion around an iceberg. Expressing the results in
terms of appropriate dimensionless variables, we show that laboratory scale and field scale capsizes
can be directly compared. The capsize dynamics is found to be highly sensitive to the iceberg aspect
ratio and to the fluid and ice densities. We present a semi-analytical simplified fluid-structure
model (SAFIM) that can be implemented in solid mechanics models dealing with contact dynamics.
This model accounts for hydrodynamic forces through calibrated drag and added-mass effects. We
show that SAFIM significantly improves the accuracy of the modeled horizontal force and horizontal
iceberg velocity compared with existing simplified models. SAFIM has been calibrated against
the reference CFD simulations...
