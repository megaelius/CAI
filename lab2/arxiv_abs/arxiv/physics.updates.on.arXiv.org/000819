This thesis centres on the development of multidimensional fluorescence imaging tools, with a
particular emphasis on fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) microscopy for application to biological
research. The key aspects of this thesis are the development and application of tunable supercontinuum
excitation sources based on supercontinuum generation in microstructured optical fibres and
the development of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope capable of fluorescence lifetime
imaging beyond the diffraction limit. The utility of FLIM for biological research is illustrated
by examples of experimental studies of the molecular structure of sarcomeres in muscle fibres and
of signalling at the immune synapse. The application of microstructured optical fibre to provide
tunable supercontinuum excitation source for a range of FLIM microscopes is presented, including
wide-field, Nipkow disk confocal and hyper-spectral line scanning FLIM microscopes. The application
of supercontinuum generation to the first super-resolved FLIM microscope is then described. This
novel microscope exploited the concept of STED with a femtosecond mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser
providing a tunable excitation beam by pumping microstructured optical fibre for supercontinuum
generation and directly providing the (longer wavelength) STED beam. This STED microscope was
implemented in a commercial scanning confocal microscope to provide compatibility with standard
biological imaging, and exploited digital holography using a spatial light modulator (SLM) to
provide the appropriate phase manipulation for shaping the STED beam profile and to compensate
for aberrations. The STED microscope was shown to be capable of recording superresolution images
in both the lateral and axial planes, according to the settings of the SLM.
