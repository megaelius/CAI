Module Analysis for Multiple-Choice Responses (MAMCR) was applied to a large sample of Force Concept
Inventory (FCI) pretest and post-test responses ($N_{pre}=4509$ and $N_{post}=4716$) to replicate
the results of the original MAMCR study and to understand the origins of the gender differences reported
in a previous study of this data set. When the results of MAMCR could not be replicated, a modification
of the method was introduced, Modified Module Analysis (MMA). MMA was productive in understanding
the structure of the incorrect answers in the FCI, identifying 9 groups of incorrect answers on the
pretest and 11 groups on the post-test. These groups, in most cases, could be mapped on to common misconceptions
used by the authors of the FCI to create distactors for the instrument. Of these incorrect answer
groups, 6 of the pretest groups and 8 of the post-test groups were the same for men and women. Two of
the male-only pretest groups disappeared with instruction while the third male-only pretest group
was identified for both men and women post-instruction. Three of the groups identified for both
men and women on the post-test were not present for either on the pretest. The rest of the identified
incorrect answer groups did not represent misconceptions, but were rather related to the the blocked
structure of some FCI items where multiple items are related to a common stem. The groups identified
had little relation to the gender unfair items previously identified for this data set, and therefore,
differences in the structure of student misconceptions between men and women cannot explain the
gender differences reported for the FCI.
