A DEM of a dunefield in Southern Brazil was generated from 810 photos captured by an RPA in February
2019. Altimetric accuracy of the SfM-MVS DEM was validated by comparison with Terrestrial LiDAR
(TLS) data collected during the same fieldwork campaign of the RPA flights. The SfM-MVS DEM was then
compared to an Airborne LiDAR (ALS) DEM from October 2010. While the SfM-MVS and TLS DEMs are very
similar, the SfM-MVS DEM presents a small scale surface roughness not visible in the TLS DEM. The
Feature Preserving DEM Smoothing (FPD) algorithm was applied to the SfM-MVS DEM with good results
in terms of surface smoothing, but without any significant changes in descriptive statistics and
error metrics, with an RMSE of 0.08m and MAE of 0.06m for both the original and the FPD-filtered DEM.
Displacement of dune crest lines from the ALS and SfM-MVS DEMs resulted in a migration rate of ~5m/year
between 2010 and 2019, in good agreement with rates derived from satellite images and historical
aerial photographs of the same area. Sand volume change in the same period showed a decrease of only
0.2%, which can be related to the installation of sand fences to promote dune stabilization and sand
removal from the front of the dune field to keep a road open to vehicles. ALS can cover large areas in
little time but its high cost still remains a barrier to wider usage, especially by researchers in
developing countries. TLS has an intermediate cost but demands more fieldwork and more processing
time. In our case we needed three days for the TLS survey and around three weeks to produce a DEM of ~80400m2.
On the other hand, we were able to cover ~740900m2 with six flight missions in under three hours, with
~13 hours processing time in a medium-range workstation. This makes SfM-MVS a low-cost solution
with fast and reliable results for 3D modelling and continuous monitoring of coastal dunes.
