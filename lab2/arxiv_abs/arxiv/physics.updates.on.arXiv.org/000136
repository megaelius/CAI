A three-dimensional numerical experiment of the launching of a hot and fast coronal jet followed
by several violent eruptions is analyzed in detail. These events are initiated through the emergence
of a magnetic flux rope from the solar interior into a coronal hole. We explore the evolution of the
emerging magnetically-dominated plasma dome surmounted by a current sheet and the ensuing pattern
of reconnection. A hot and fast coronal jet with inverted-Y shape is produced that shows properties
comparable to those frequently observed with EUV and X-Ray detectors. We analyze its 3D shape, its
inhomogeneous internal structure, and its rise and decay phases, lasting for some 15-20 min each.
Particular attention is devoted to the field-line connectivities and the reconnection pattern.
We also study the cool and high-density volume that appears encircling the emerged dome. The decay
of the jet is followed by a violent phase with a total of five eruptions. The first of them seems to follow
the general pattern of tether-cutting reconnection in a sheared arcade, although modified by the
field topology created by the preceding reconnection evolution. The two following eruptions take
place near and above the strong field-concentrations at the surface. They show a twisted, \Omega-loop
like rope expanding in height, with twist being turned into writhe, thus hinting at a kink instability
(perhaps combined with a torus-instability) as the cause of the eruption. The succession of a main
jet ejection and a number of violent eruptions that resemble mini-CME's and their physical properties
suggest that this experiment may provide a model for the blowout jets recently proposed in the literature.
