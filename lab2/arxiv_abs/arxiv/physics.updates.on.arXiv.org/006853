The Transactional Interpretation of quantum mechanics exploits the intrinsic time-symmetry
of wave mechanics to interpret the $\psi$ and $\psi$* wave functions present in all wave mechanics
calculations as representing retarded and advanced waves moving in opposite time directions that
form a quantum "handshake" or transaction. This handshake is a 4D standing-wave that builds up across
space-time to transfer the conserved quantities of energy, momentum, and angular momentum in an
interaction. Here we derive a two-atom quantum formalism describing a transaction. We show that
the bi-directional electromagnetic coupling between atoms can be factored into a matched pair
of vector potential Green's functions: one retarded and one advanced, and that this combination
uniquely enforces the conservation of energy in a transaction. Thus factored, the single-electron
wave functions of electromagnetically-coupled atoms can be analyzed using Schr\"odinger's original
wave mechanics. The technique generalizes to any number of electromagnetically coupled single-electron
states---no higher-dimensional space is needed. Using this technique, we show a worked example
of the transfer of energy from a hydrogen atom in an excited state to a nearby hydrogen atom in its ground
state. It is seen that the initial exchange creates a dynamically unstable situation that avalanches
to the completed transaction, demonstrating that wave function collapse, considered mysterious
in the literature, can be implemented with solutions of Schr\"odinger's original wave mechanics,
coupled by this unique combination of retarded/advanced vector potentials, without the introduction
of any additional mechanism or formalism. We also analyse a simplified version of the photon-splitting
and Freedman-Clauser three-electron experiments and show that their results can be predicted
by this formalism.
