Consider the problem of modeling memory effects in discrete-state random walks using higher-order
Markov chains. This paper explores cross validation and information criteria as proxies for a model's
predictive accuracy. Our objective is to select, from data, the number of prior states of recent
history upon which a trajectory is statistically dependent. Through simulations, I evaluate these
criteria in the case where data are drawn from systems with fixed orders of history, noting trends
in the relative performance of the criteria. As a real-world illustrative example of these methods,
this manuscript evaluates the problem of detecting statistical dependencies in shot outcomes
in free throw shooting. Over three NBA seasons analyzed, several players exhibited statistical
dependencies in free throw hitting probability of various types - hot handedness, cold handedness,
and error correction. For the 2013-2014 through 2015-2016 NBA seasons, I detected statistical
dependencies in 23% of all player-seasons. Focusing on a single player, in two of these three seasons,
LeBron James shot a better percentage after an immediate miss than otherwise. In those seasons,
conditioning on the previous outcome makes for a more predictive model than treating free throw
makes as independent. When extended to data from the 2016-2017 NBA season specifically for LeBron
James, a model depending on the previous shot (single-step Markovian) does not clearly beat a model
with independent outcomes. An error-correcting variable length model of two parameters, where
James shoots a higher percentage after a missed free throw than otherwise, is more predictive than
either model.
