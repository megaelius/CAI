We examine the relation between the absolute equilibrium state of the spectrally truncated Euler
equations (TEE) predicted by Kraichnan (1973) to the forced and dissipated flows of the spectrally
truncated Navier-Stokes (TNS) equations. In both of these idealized systems a finite number of
Fourier modes is kept contained inside a sphere of radius $\kmax$. We show, using an asymptotic expansion
of the Fokker-Planck equation, that in the limit of small viscosity $\nu$ and fixed maximum wavenumber
$\kmax$ the flow approaches the absolute equilibrium solution of Kraichnan with such an effective
`{\it temperature}' that there is a balance between the energy injection and the energy dissipation
rate. We further investigate the TNS system using direct numerical simulations. The simulations
demonstrate that, at steady state with large-scale forcing and dissipation acting only at small-scales,
the TNS reproduce the Kolmogorov energy spectrum if the viscosity is large enough so that the Kolmogorov
dissipation wavenumber $k_\nu$ is smaller than $\kmax$. As viscosity becomes smaller then a bottleneck
effect appears taking the form of the equipartition spectrum $E(k) \propto k^2$ at small scales.
As $\nu$ is decreased even further the equipartition spectrum occupies all scales approaching
the asymptotic equilibrium solutions found before. If the forcing is applied at small scales and
the dissipation acts only at large scales then the equipartition spectrum appears at all scales
for all values of $\nu$. In both cases a finite forward or inverse flux is present independent of the
amplitude of the viscosity even for the cases where the flow is close to the equilibrium state solutions.
