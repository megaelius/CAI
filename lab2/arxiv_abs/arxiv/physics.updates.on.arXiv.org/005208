Magnetic reconnection, a fundamentally important process in many aspects of astrophysics, is
believed to be initiated by the tearing instability of an electric current sheet, a region where
magnetic field abruptly changes direction and electric currents build up. Recent studies have
suggested that the amount of magnetic shear in these structures is a critical parameter for the switch-on
nature of magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere, at fluid spatial scales much larger than
kinetic scales. We present results of simulations of reconnection in 3D current sheets with conditions
appropriate to the solar corona. Using high-fidelity simulations, we follow the evolution of the
linear and non-linear 3D tearing instability, leading to reconnection. We find that, depending
on the parameter space, magnetic shear can play a vital role in the onset of significant energy release
and heating via non-linear tearing. Two regimes in our study exist, dependent on whether the current
sheet is longer or shorter than the wavelength of the fastest growing parallel mode (in the corresponding
infinite system), thus determining whether sub-harmonics are present in the actual system. In
one regime, where the fastest growing parallel mode has sub-harmonics, the non-linear interaction
of these sub-harmonics and the coalescence of 3D plasmoids dominates the non-linear evolution,
with magnetic shear playing only a weak role in the amount of energy released. In the second regime,
where the fastest growing parallel mode has no-sub-harmonics, then only strongly sheared current
sheets, where oblique mode are strong enough to compete with the dominant parallel mode, show any
significant energy release. We expect both regimes to exist on the Sun, and so our results have important
consequences for the the question of reconnection onset in different solar physics applications.
