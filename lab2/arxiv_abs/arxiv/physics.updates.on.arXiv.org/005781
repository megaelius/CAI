We present STREAmS, an in-house high-fidelity solver for large-scale, massively parallel direct
numerical simulations (DNS) of compressible turbulent flows on graphical processing units (GPUs).
STREAmS is written in the Fortran 90 language and it is tailored to carry out DNS of canonical compressible
wall-bounded flows, namely turbulent plane channel, zero-pressure gradient turbulent boundary
layer and supersonic oblique shock-wave/boundary layer interactions. The solver incorporates
state-of-the-art numerical algorithms, specifically designed to cope with the challenging problems
associated with the solution of high-speed turbulent flows and can be used across a wide range of
Mach numbers, extending from the low subsonic up to the hypersonic regime. The use of cuf automatic
kernels allowed an easy and efficient porting on the GPU architecture minimizing the changes to
the original CPU code, which is also maintained. We discuss a memory allocation strategy based on
duplicated arrays for host and device which carefully minimizes the memory usage making the solver
suitable for large scale computations on the latest GPU cards. Comparison between different CPUs
and GPUs architectures strongly favor the latter, and executing the solver on a single NVIDIA Tesla
P100 corresponds to using approximately 330 Intel Knights Landing CPU cores. STREAmS shows very
good strong scalability and essentially ideal weak scalability up to 2048 GPUs, paving the way to
simulations in the genuine high-Reynolds number regime, possibly at friction Reynolds number
$Re_{\tau} > 10^4$. The solver is released open source under GPLv3 license and is available at https://github.com/matteobernardini/STREAmS.
