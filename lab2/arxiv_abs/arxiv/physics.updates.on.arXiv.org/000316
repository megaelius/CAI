Many of the heated arguments about the meaning of "Bell's theorem" arise because this phrase can
refer to two different theorems that John Bell proved, the first in 1964 and the second in 1976. His
1964 theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the dual assumptions of locality
and determinism. His 1976 theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the unitary
property of local causality. This is contrary to Bell's own later assertions, that his 1964 theorem
began with that single, and indivisible, assumption of local causality (even if not by that name).
While there are other forms of Bell's theorems --- which I present to explain the relation between
Jarrett-completeness, "weak locality", and EPR-completeness --- I maintain that Bell's two versions
are the essential ones. Although the two Bell's theorems are logically equivalent, their assumptions
are not, and the different versions of the theorem suggest quite different conclusions, which are
embraced by different communities. For realists, the notion of local causality, ruled out by Bell's
1976 theorem, is motivated implicitly by Reichenbach's Principle of common cause and explicitly
by Einstein's relativity Principle, and it is the latter which must be forgone. Operationalists
pay no heed to Reichenbach's Principle, but wish to keep Einstein's relativity Principle, which,
bolstered by an implicit "Principle of causal efficacy", implies their notion of locality. Thus
for operationalists, Bell's theorem is the 1964 one, and implies that it is determinism that must
be forgone. I discuss why the two `camps' are drawn to these different conclusions, and what can be
done to increase mutual understanding.
