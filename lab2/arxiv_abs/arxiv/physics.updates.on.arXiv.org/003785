Background: The use of whole slide imaging (WSI) for digital pathology has recently been cleared
for primary diagnosis in the US. A conventional WSI system scans the tissue slide to different positions
and acquires the digital images. In a typical implementation, a focus map is created prior to the
scanning process, leading to significant overhead time and a necessity for high positional accuracy
of the mechanical system. The resulting cost of WSI system is often prohibitive for frozen section
procedure during surgery. Methods: We report a novel WSI scheme based on a programmable LED array
for sample illumination. In between two regular brightfield image acquisitions, we acquire one
additional image by turning on a red and a green LED for color multiplexed illumination. We then identify
the translational shift of the red- and green-channel images by maximizing the image mutual information
or cross-correlation. The resulting translational shift is used for dynamic focus correction
in the scanning process. Since we track the differential focus during adjacent acquisitions, there
is no positional repeatability requirement in our scheme. Results: We demonstrate a prototype
WSI platform with a mean focusing error of ~0.3 microns. Different from previous implementations,
this prototype platform requires no focus map surveying, no secondary camera or additional optics,
and allows for continuous sample motion in the focus tracking process. Conclusions: A programmable
LED array can be used for color-multiplexed single-shot autofocusing in WSI. The reported scheme
may enable the development of cost-effective WSI platforms without positional repeatability
requirement. It may also provide a turnkey solution for other high-content microscopy applications.
