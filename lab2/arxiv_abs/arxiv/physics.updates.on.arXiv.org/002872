This work investigates the motion of neutrally-buoyant, slightly deformable straight and curved
prolate capsules in unbounded simple shear flow at zero Reynolds number using direct simulations.
The curved capsules serve as a model for the typical crescent-shaped sickle red blood cells in sickle
cell disease (SCD). The effects of deformability and curvature on the dynamics are revealed. We
show that with low deformability, straight prolate spheroidal capsules tumble in the shear plane
as their unique asymptotically stable orbit, which contrasts with that for rigid spheroids where
infinitely many neutrally stable Jeffery orbits exist. The dynamics of curved prolate capsules
are more complicated due to a combined effect of deformability and curvature. At short times, depending
on the initial orientation, slightly deformable curved prolate capsules exhibit either a Jeffery-like
motion such as tumbling or kayaking, or a non-Jeffery-like behavior in which the end-to-end vector
of the capsule crosses the shear-gradient plane back and forth. At long times, however, a Jeffery-like
quasi-periodic orbit is taken regardless of the initial orientation. We further show that the average
of the long-time trajectory can be well approximated using the analytical solution for Jeffery
orbits with an effective orbit constant $C_{\textnormal{eff}}$ and aspect ratio $\ell_{\textnormal{eff}}$.
As the capsule becomes more deformable or curved, $C_{\textnormal{eff}}$ decreases, indicating
a shift of the orbit towards log-rolling motion, while $\ell_{\textnormal{eff}}$ increases weakly
as the degree of curvature increases but shows negligible dependency on deformability. As cell
deformability, cell shape, and cell-cell interactions are all pathologically altered in blood
disorders such as SCD, these results will have clear implications on improving our understanding
of the pathophysiology of hematologic disease.
