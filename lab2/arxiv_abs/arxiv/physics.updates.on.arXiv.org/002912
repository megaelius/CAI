This tutorial describes challenges and possible avenues for the implementation of the components
of a solid-state system, which emulates a biological brain. The tutorial is devoted mostly to a charge-based
(i.e. electric controlled) implementation using transition metal oxides materials, which exhibit
unique properties that emulate key functionalities needed for this application. In the Introduction,
we compare the main differences between a conventional computational machine, based on the Turing-von
Neumann paradigm, to a Neuromorphic machine, which tries to emulate important functionalities
of a biological brain. We also describe the main electrical properties of biological systems, which
would be useful to implement in a charge-based system. In Chapter II, we describe the main components
of a possible solid-state implementation. In Chapter III, we describe a variety of Resistive Switching
phenomena, which may serve as the functional basis for the implementation of key devices for Neuromorphic
computing. In Chapter IV we describe why transition metal oxides, are promising materials for future
Neuromorphic machines. Theoretical models describing different resistive switching mechanisms
are discussed in Chapter V while existing implementations are described in Chapter VI. Chapter
VII presents applications to practical problems. We list in Chapter VIII important basic research
challenges and open issues. We discuss issues related to specific implementations, novel materials,
devices and phenomena. The development of reliable, fault tolerant, energy efficient devices,
their scaling and integration into a Neuromorphic computer may bring us closer to the development
of a machine that rivals the brain.
