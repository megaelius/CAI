Excited states exhibiting double excitation character are notoriously difficult to model using
conventional single-reference methods, such as adiabatic time-dependent density-functional
theory (TD-DFT) or equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC). In the present work, we provide
accurate reference excitation energies for transitions involving a substantial amount of double
excitation using a series of increasingly large diffuse-containing atomic basis sets. Our set
gathers 20 vertical transitions from 14 small- and medium-size molecule. Depending on the size
of the molecule, selected configuration interaction (sCI) and/or multiconfigurational calculations
are performed in order to obtain reliable estimates of the vertical transition energies. In addition,
coupled cluster approaches including at least contributions from iterative triples are assessed.
Our results clearly evidence that the error in CC methods is intimately related to the amount of double
excitation character of the transition. For "pure" double excitations (i.e. for transitions which
do not mix with single excitations), the error in CC3 can easily reach 1 eV, while it goes down to few
tenths of an eV for more common transitions (like in \emph{trans}-butadiene) involving a significant
amount of singles. As expected, CC approaches including quadruples yield highly accurate results
for any type of transitions. The quality of the excitation energies obtained with multiconfigurational
methods is harder to predict. We have found that the overall accuracy of these methods is highly dependent
of both the system and the selected active space. The inclusion of the $\sigma$ and $\sigma^*$ orbitals
in the active space, even for transitions involving mostly $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ orbitals, is mandatory
in order to reach high accuracy. A theoretical best estimate (TBE) is reported for each transition.
