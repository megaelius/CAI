Cavitating flow over a circular cylinder is investigated over a range of cavitation numbers for
both laminar and turbulent regimes. We observe non-cavitating, cyclic and transitional cavitation
regimes with reduction in freestream $\sigma$. The cavitation inside the Karman vortices in the
cyclic regime, is significantly altered by the onset of "condensation front" propagation in the
transitional regime. At the transition, an order of magnitude jump in shedding Strouhal number
is observed as the dominant frequency shifts from periodic vortex shedding in the cyclic regime,
to irregular-regular vortex shedding in the transitional regime. In addition, a peak in pressure
fluctuations, and a maximum in St versus $\sigma$ based on cavity length are observed at the transition.
Shedding characteristics in each regime are discussed using dynamic mode decomposition. It is
demonstrated that the condensation fronts observed in the transitional regime are supersonic
(referred as "condensation shocks"). In the presence of NCG, multiple condensation shocks in a
given cycle are required for complete cavity condensation and detachment, as compared to a single
condensation shock when only vapor is present. This is explained by the reduction in pressure ratio
across the shock in the presence of NCG effectively reducing its strength. In addition, at $\sigma=0.85$
(near transition from the cyclic to the transitional regime), presence of NCG suppresses the low
frequency irregular-regular vortex shedding. Vorticity transport at $Re=3900$, in the transitional
regime, indicates that the region of attached cavity is nearly two-dimensional with very low vorticity,
affecting Karman shedding in the near wake. In addition, the boundary-layer separation point is
found to be strongly dependent on the amounts of vapor and gas in the freestream for both laminar and
turbulent regimes.
