Reconstruction of seismic data with missing traces is a long-standing issue in seismic data processing.
In recent years, rank reduction operations are being commonly utilized to overcome this problem,
which require the rank of seismic data to be a prior. However, the rank of field data is unknown; usually
it requires much time to manually adjust the rank and just obtain an approximated rank. Methods based
on deep learning require very large datasets for training; however acquiring large datasets is
difficult owing to physical or financial constraints in practice. Therefore, in this work, we developed
a novel method based on unsupervised learning using the intrinsic properties of a convolutional
neural network known as U-net, without training datasets. Only one undersampled seismic data was
needed, and the deep seismic prior of input data could be exploited by the network itself, thus making
the reconstruction convenient. Furthermore, this method can handle both irregular and regular
seismic data. Synthetic and field data were tested to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm
(DSPRecon algorithm); the advantages of using our method were evaluated by comparing it with the
singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method for irregular data reconstruction and de-aliased Cadzow
method for regular data reconstruction. Experimental results showed that our method provided
better reconstruction performance than the SSA or Cadzow methods. The recovered signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) were 32.68 dB and 19.11 dB for the DSPRecon and SSA algorithms, respectively. Those
for the DSPRecon and Cadzow methods were 35.91 dB and 15.32 dB, respectively.
