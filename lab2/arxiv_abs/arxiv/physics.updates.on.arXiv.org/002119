In various biological processes, semi-flexible filaments like F-actin exploit chemical energy
associated to polymerization to perform mechanical work against a loaded external obstacle. The
dynamics of fingerlike filopodial structures, characterized by the relationship between the
obstacle velocity $V$ and the applied external load $F$, is generally interpreted by a brownian
ratchet mechanism appropriate to fully rigid filaments. Based on the properties of the Wormlike
Chain model, we propose an original and general multiscale approach to consider filament flexibility
in the modelling. By stochastic dynamic simulations, we studied the dynamical relaxation of a bundle
of $N_f$ supercritical semi-flexible filaments against an optical trap load ($F=-\kappa_TL$,
where $L$ is the distance between the grafting wall and the obstacle mobile wall, and $\kappa_T$
the trap strength). For realistic values of the model parameters, the systematic motion of the trap
is two/three orders of magnitude slower than the characteristic time between chemical events and
this separation of time scales lets consider the optical trap relaxation as a sequence of non-equilibrium
steady states for the bundle properties. The velocity-load relationship $V(F,\lambda)$ can then
be generalized by introducing the degree of flexibility $\lambda$, defined as the ratio of the filaments
contour length over the typical length beyond which flexibility effects are detectable. Our approach
lets us map out the entire range of flexibility from the rigid to the escaping filament regime, in
which the trap gets large enough for filaments to have a high probability to laterally escape, not
participating anymore to the bundle polymerization force. We show that flexibility considerably
enriches the theoretical scenario filling the gap between the multi-filaments brownian ratchet
model and the mean field Perfect Load Sharing result.
