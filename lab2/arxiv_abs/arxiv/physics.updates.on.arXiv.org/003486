A novel realization of Gas Modulation Refractometry (GAMOR) that outperforms the original realization
[Single Cavity Modulated GAMOR (SCM-GAMOR)], is presented. The reference measurements are carried
out by equalizing the pressures in the two cavities. By this, the time it takes to reach adequate conditions
for the reference measurements has been reduced. This implies that a larger fraction of the measurement
cycle can be devoted to data acquisition, which reduces white noise and improves on short-term characteristics.
The presented realization also encompasses a new cavity design with improved temperature stabilization
and assessment. This has contributed to an improved long-term characteristics. The system was
characterized with respect to a dead weight piston gauge. For short integration times (up to 10 min)
it can provide a response that exceeds that of the original SCM-GAMOR system by a factor of two. For
longer integration times, and up to 18 hours, the system shows, at 4303 Pa, an integration time independent
Allan deviation of 1 mPa (corresponding to a precision defined as twice the Allan deviation, of 0.5
ppm). This implies that the novel system shows a significant improvement with respect to the original
realization for all integration times (by a factor of 8 for an integration time of 18 hours). When
used for low pressures, it can provide a precision in the sub-mPa region; for the case with an evacuated
measurement cavity, the system provided, up to ca. 40 measurement cycles (ca. 1.5 hours), a white-noise
limited noise of 0.7 mPa sqrt(cycle), and minimum Allan deviation of 0.15 mPa. Furthermore, over
the pressure range investigated, i.e. in the 2.8 - 10.1 kPa range, it shows, with respect to a dead
weight piston gauge, a purely linear response. This implies that the system can be used for transfer
of calibration over large pressure ranges with exceptional low uncertainty.
