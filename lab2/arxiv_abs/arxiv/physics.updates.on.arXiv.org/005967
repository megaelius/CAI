Complexity metrics and machine learning (ML) models have been utilized to analyze the lengths of
segmental genomic entities like: exons, introns, intergenic and repeat/unique DNA sequences,
in each of the 22 human chromosomes. The purpose of the study was to assess information and order that
may be concealed within the size distribution of these sequences. For this purpose, we developed
an innovative integrated methodology. Our analysis is based upon the reconstructed phase space
theorem, the non-extensive statistical theory of Tsallis, ML techniques and a new technical index,
integrating the generated information, which we introduce and named it Complexity Factor (COFA).
The low-dimensional deterministic nonlinear chaotic and non-extensive statistical character
of the DNA sequences was verified with strong multifractal characteristics and long-range correlations
with significant variations per genomic entity and per chromosome. The results of the analysis
reveal changes in complexity behavior per genomic entity and chromosome regarding the size distribution
of individual genomic segment. The lengths of intron regions show greater complexity behavior
in all metrics than the exonic ones, with longer range correlations, and stronger memory effects,
for all chromosomes. We conclude from our analysis, that the size distribution of the genomic regions
within chromosomes, are not random, but follow a specific pattern with characteristic features,
that have been seen here through its complexity character, and it is part of the dynamics of the whole
genome according to complexity theory. This picture of dynamics of the redundancy of information
in DNA recognized from ML tools for clustering, classification and prediction.
