Partial differential equations with distributional sources---in particular, involving (derivatives
of) delta distributions---have become increasingly ubiquitous in numerous areas of physics and
applied mathematics. It is often of considerable interest to obtain numerical solutions for such
equations, but any singular ("particle"-like) source modeling invariably introduces nontrivial
computational obstacles. A common method to circumvent these is through some form of delta function
approximation procedure on the computational grid; however, this often carries significant limitations
on the efficiency of the numerical convergence rates, or sometimes even the resolvability of the
problem at all. In this paper, we present an alternative technique for tackling such equations which
avoids the singular behavior entirely: the "Particle-without-Particle" method. Previously
introduced in the context of the self-force problem in gravitational physics, the idea is to discretize
the computational domain into two (or more) disjoint pseudospectral (Chebyshev-Lobatto) grids
such that the "particle" is always at the interface between them; thus, one only needs to solve homogeneous
equations in each domain, with the source effectively replaced by jump (boundary) conditions thereon.
We prove here that this method yields solutions to any linear PDE the source of which is any linear
combination of delta distributions and derivatives thereof supported on a one-dimensional subspace
of the problem domain. We then implement it to numerically solve a variety of relevant PDEs: hyperbolic
(with applications to neuroscience and acoustics), parabolic (with applications to finance),
and elliptic. We generically obtain improved convergence rates relative to typical past implementations
relying on delta function approximations.
