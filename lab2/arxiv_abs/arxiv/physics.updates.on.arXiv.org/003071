Objective: To achieve an optimal sealing zone during EVAR, the intended positioning of the proximal
end of the endograft fabric should be as close as possible to the most caudal edge of the renal arteries.
Some endografts exhibit a small offset between the radiopaque markers and the proximal fabric edge.
Unintended partial renal artery coverage may thus occur. This study investigates the consequences
of partial coverage on renal flow patterns and wall shear stress. Methods: In-vitro models of an
abdominal aortic aneurysm were used to visualize pulsatile flow using 2D particle image velocimetry
under physiologic resting conditions. One model served as control and two models were stented with
an Endurant endograft, one without and one with partial renal artery coverage with 1.3 mm of stent
fabric extending beyond the marker (16\% area coverage). The magnitude and oscillation of wall
shear stress, relative residence time and backflow in the renal artery were analyzed. Results:
In both stented models, a region along the caudal renal artery wall presented with low and oscillating
wall shear stress, not present in the control model. A region with very low wall shear stress (<0.1
Pa) was present in the model with partial coverage over a length of 7 mm, compared to a length of 2 mm
in the model without renal coverage. Average renal backflow area percentage in the renal artery
incrementally increased from control (0.9%) to the stented model without (6.4%) and with renal
coverage (18.8%). Conclusion: In this flow model partial renal coverage after EVAR causes low and
marked oscillations in wall shear stress, potentially promoting atherosclerosis and subsequent
renal artery stenosis. Awareness of the device-dependent offset between the fabric edge and the
radiopaque markers is therefore important in endovascular practice.
