Understanding how a scientist develops new scientific collaborations or how their papers receive
new citations is a major challenge in scientometrics. The approach being proposed simultaneously
examines the growth processes of the co-authorship and citation networks by analyzing the evolutions
of the rich get richer and the fit get richer phenomena. In particular, the preferential attachment
function and author fitnesses, which govern the two phenomena, are estimated non-parametrically
in each network. The approach is applied to the co-authorship and citation networks of the flagship
journal of the strategic management scientific community, namely the Strategic Management Journal.
The results suggest that the abovementioned phenomena have been consistently governing both temporal
networks. The average of the attachment exponents in the co-authorship network is 0.30 while it
is 0.29 in the citation network. This suggests that the rich get richer phenomenon has been weak in
both networks. The right tails of the distributions of author fitness in both networks are heavy,
which imply that the intrinsic scientific quality of each author has been playing a crucial role
in getting new citations and new co-authorships. Since the total competitiveness in each temporal
network is founded to be rising with time, it is getting harder to receive a new citation or to develop
a new collaboration. Analyzing the average competency, it was found that on average, while the veterans
tend to be more competent at developing new collaborations, the newcomers are likely better at acquiring
new citations. Furthermore, the author fitness in both networks has been consistent with the history
of the strategic management scientific community. This suggests that coupling node fitnesses
throughout different networks might be a promising new direction in analyzing simultaneously
multiple networks.
