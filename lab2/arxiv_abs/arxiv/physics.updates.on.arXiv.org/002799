The large distances involved in interstellar travel require a high degree of spacecraft autonomy,
realized by artificial intelligence. The breadth of tasks artificial intelligence could perform
on such spacecraft involves maintenance, data collection, designing and constructing an infrastructure
using in-situ resources. Despite its importance, existing publications on artificial intelligence
and interstellar travel are limited to cursory descriptions where little detail is given about
the nature of the artificial intelligence. This article explores the role of artificial intelligence
for interstellar travel by compiling use cases, exploring capabilities, and proposing typologies,
system and mission architectures. Estimations for the required intelligence level for specific
types of interstellar probes are given, along with potential system and mission architectures,
covering those proposed in the literature but also presenting novel ones. Finally, a generic design
for an interstellar probes with an AI payload is proposed. Given current levels of increase in computational
power, a spacecraft with a similar computational power as the human brain would have a mass from dozens
to hundreds of tons in a 2050-2060 timeframe. Given that the advent of the first interstellar missions
and artificial general intelligence are estimated to be by mid-21st century, a more in-depth exploration
of the relationship between the two should be attempted, focusing on neglected areas such as protecting
the artificial intelligence payload from radiation in interstellar space and the role of artificial
intelligence in self-replication.
