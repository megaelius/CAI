An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion
rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this
epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where
the epidemic started on February 25. We calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to
date (May 5, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature.
The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction
ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown.
The predicted death toll is approximately 15600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals
at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is
4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on
the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and
2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially
exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three
times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints
and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe
that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine
times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality
rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic.
