The observed architecture of ecological and socio-economic networks differs significantly from
that of random networks. From a network science standpoint, non-random structural patterns observed
in real networks call for an explanation of their emergence and an understanding of their potential
systemic consequences. This article focuses on one of these patterns: nestedness. Given a network
of interacting nodes, nestedness can be described as the tendency for nodes to interact with subsets
of the interaction partners of better-connected nodes. Known since more than $80$ years in biogeography,
nestedness has been found in systems as diverse as ecological mutualistic organizations, world
trade, inter-organizational relations, among many others. This review article focuses on three
main pillars: the existing methodologies to observe nestedness in networks; the main theoretical
mechanisms conceived to explain the emergence of nestedness in ecological and socio-economic
networks; the implications of a nested topology of interactions for the stability and feasibility
of a given interacting system. We survey results from variegated disciplines, including statistical
physics, graph theory, ecology, and theoretical economics. Nestedness was found to emerge both
in bipartite networks and, more recently, in unipartite ones; this review is the first comprehensive
attempt to unify both streams of studies, usually disconnected from each other. We believe that
the truly interdisciplinary endeavour -- while rooted in a complex systems perspective -- may inspire
new models and algorithms whose realm of application will undoubtedly transcend disciplinary
boundaries.
