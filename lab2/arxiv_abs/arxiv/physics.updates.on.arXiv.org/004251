As a star spins-down during the main sequence, its wind properties are affected. In this work, we
investigate how the Earth's magnetosphere has responded to the change in the solar wind. Earth's
magnetosphere is simulated using 3D magnetohydrodynamic models that incorporate the evolving
local properties of the solar wind. The solar wind, on the other hand, is modelled in 1.5D for a range
of rotation rates Omega from 50 to 0.8 times the present-day solar rotation (Omega_sun). Our solar
wind model uses empirical values for magnetic field strengths, base temperature and density, which
are derived from observations of solar-like stars. We find that for rotation rates ~10 Omega_sun,
Earth's magnetosphere was substantially smaller than it is today, exhibiting a strong bow shock.
As the sun spins down, the magnetopause standoff distance varies with Omega^{-0.27} for higher
rotation rates (early ages, > 1.4 Omega_sun), and with Omega^{-2.04} for lower rotation rates (older
ages, < 1.4 Omega_sun). This break is a result of the empirical properties adopted for the solar wind
evolution. We also see a linear relationship between magnetopause distance and the thickness of
the shock on the subsolar line for the majority of the evolution (< 10 Omega_sun). It is possible that
a young fast rotating Sun would have had rotation rates as high as 30 to 50 Omega_sun. In these speculative
scenarios, at 30 Omega_sun, a weak shock would have been formed, but for 50 Omega_sun, we find that
no bow shock could be present around Earth's magnetosphere. This implies that with the Sun continuing
to spin down, a strong shock would have developed around our planet, and remained for most of the duration
of the solar main sequence.
