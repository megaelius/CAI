Density functional theory calculations can be used to identify dominant reaction mechanisms.
However, the dominant reaction mechanism is sensitive to choice of the exchange correlation functional.
Here, we demonstrate using the example case of chlorine evolution reaction on rutile oxides, which
can occur through at least three reaction mechanisms each mediated by different surface intermediates
and active sites. We utilize Bayesian error estimation capabilities within the BEEF-vdW exchange
correlation (XC) functional to quantify the uncertainty associated with predictions of the operative
reaction mechanism by systematically propagating the uncertainty originating from DFT-computed
adsorption free energies. We construct surface Pourbaix diagrams based on the calculated adsorption
free energies for rutile oxides of Ru, Ir, Ti, Pt, V, Sn and Rh. We utilize confidence-value (c-value)
to determine the degree of confidence in the predicted surface phase diagrams. Using the scaling
relations between the adsorption energies of intermediates we construct a generalized Pourbaix
diagram showing the stable surface composition as a function of potential and the oxygen binding
energy on the cus site. This is used to consistently determine activity volcano relationships.
We incorporate the uncertainty in linear scaling relations to quantify the confidence in generalized
Pourbaix diagram and the associated activity. This allows us to compute the expectation limiting
potential as a function of $\Delta E_{O^c}$, which provides a more appropriate activity measure
incorporating DFT uncertainty. We show that the confidence in the classification problem of identifying
the active reaction mechanism is much better than the prediction problem of determining catalytic
activity.
