Forming macroscopic solid bodies in circumstellar discs requires local dust concentration levels
significantly higher than the mean. Interactions of the dust particles with the gas must serve to
augment local particle densities, and facilitate growth past barriers in the metre size range.
Amongst a number of mechanisms that can amplify the local density of solids, aerodynamic streaming
instability (SI) is one of the most promising. This work tests the physical assumptions of models
that lead to SI in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). We conduct laboratory experiments in which we track
the three-dimensional motion of spherical solid particles fluidized in a low-pressure, laminar,
incompressible, gas stream. The particle sizes span the Stokes-Epstein drag regime transition
and the overall dust-to-gas mass density ratio is close to unity. Lambrechts et al. (2016) established
the similarity of the laboratory flow to a simplified PPD model flow. We obtain experimental results
suggesting an instability due to particle-gas interaction: i) there exist variations in particle
concentration in the direction of the mean drag forces; ii) the particles have a tendency to 'catch
up' to one another when they are in proximity; iii) particle clumping occurs on very small scales,
which implies local enhancements above the background dust-to-gas mass density ratio by factors
of several tens; v) the presence of these density enhancements occurs for a mean dust-to-gas mass
density ratio approaching or greater than 1; v) we find evidence for collective particle drag reduction
when the local particle number density becomes high and when the background gas pressure is high
so that the drag is in the continuum regime. The experiments presented here are precedent-setting
for observing SI under controlled conditions and may lead to a deeper understanding of how it operates
in nature.
