We found evidence of dynamic scaling in the spreading of MDCK monolayer, which can be characterized
by the Hurst exponent ${\alpha} = 0.86$ and the growth exponent ${\beta} = 0.73$, and theoretically
and experimentally clarified the mechanism that governs the contour shape dynamics. During the
spreading of the monolayer, it is known that so-called "leader cells" generate the driving force
and lead the other cells. Our time-lapse observations of cell behavior showed that these leader
cells appeared at the early stage of the spreading, and formed the monolayer protrusion. Informed
by these observations, we developed a simple mathematical model that included differences in cell
motility, cell-cell adhesion, and random cell movement. The model reproduced the quantitative
characteristics obtained from the experiment, such as the spreading speed, the distribution of
the increment, and the dynamic scaling law. Analysis of the model equation revealed that the model
could reproduce the different scaling law from ${\alpha} = 0.5, {\beta} = 0.25$ to ${\alpha} = 0.9,
{\beta} = 0.75$, and the exponents ${\alpha}, {\beta}$ were determined by the two indices: $\rho
t$ and $c$. Based on the analytical result, parameter estimation from the experimental results
was achieved. The monolayer on the collagen-coated dishes showed a different scaling law ${\alpha}
= 0.74, {\beta} = 0.68$, suggesting that cell motility increased by 9 folds. This result was consistent
with the assay of the single-cell motility. Our study demonstrated that the dynamics of the contour
of the monolayer were explained by the simple model, and proposed a new mechanism that exhibits the
dynamic scaling property.
