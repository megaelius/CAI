The semiconducting oxide $\beta$-Gallium Oxide ($\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$) possesses a monoclinic
unit cell whose low symmetry generally leads to anisotropic physical properties. For example,
its electrical conductivity is generally described by a polar symmetrical tensor of second rank
consisting of four independent components. Using van der Pauw measurements in a well-defined square
geometry on differently-oriented high-quality bulk samples and the comparison to finite element
simulations we precisely determine the ratio of all elements of the $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ 3-dimensional
electrical conductivity tensor. Despite the structural anisotropy a nearly isotropic conductivity
at and above room temperature was found with the principal conductivities deviating from each other
by less than 6% and the off-diagonal element being $\approx3$% of the diagonal ones. Analysis of
the temperature dependence of the anisotropy and mobility of differently doped samples allows
us to compare the anisotropy for dominant phonon-scattering to that for dominant ionized-impurity
scattering. For both scattering mechanisms, the conductivites along the $a$ and $b$-direction
agree within 2%. In contrast, the conductivity along $c$-direction amounts to $0.96\times$ and
up to $1.12\times$ that along the $b$-direction for phonon and ionized impurity scattering, respectively.
The determined transport anisotropies are larger than the theoretically predicted effective
mass anisotropy, suggesting slightly anisotropic scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that
significantly higher anisotropies can be caused by oriented extended structural defects in the
form of low-angle grain boundaries for which we determined energy barriers of multiple 10 meV.
