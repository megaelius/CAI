Machine learning models are capable of capturing the structure-property relationship from a dataset
of computationally demanding ab initio calculations. In fact, machine learning models have reached
chemical accuracy on small organic molecules contained in the popular QM9 dataset. At the same time,
the domain of large crystal structures remains rather unexplored. Over the past two years, the Organic
Materials Database (OMDB) has hosted a growing number of electronic properties of previously synthesized
organic crystal structures. The complexity of the organic crystals contained within the OMDB,
which have on average 85 atoms per unit cell, makes this database a challenging platform for machine
learning applications. In this paper, we focus on predicting the band gap which represents one of
the basic properties of a crystalline material. With this aim, we release a consistent dataset of
12500 crystal structures and their corresponding DFT band gap freely available for download at
https://omdb.diracmaterials.org/dataset. We run two recent machine learning models, kernel
ridge regression with the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) kernel and the deep learning
model SchNet, on this new dataset and find that an ensemble of these two models reaches mean absolute
error (MAE) of 0.361 eV, which corresponds to a percentage error of 12% on the average band gap of 3.03
eV. The models also provide chemical insights into the data. For example, by visualizing the SOAP
kernel similarity between the crystals, different clusters of materials can be identified, such
as organic metals or semiconductors. Finally, the trained models are employed to predict the band
gap for 260092 materials contained within the Crystallography Open Database (COD) and made available
online so the predictions can be obtained for any arbitrary crystal structure uploaded by a user.
