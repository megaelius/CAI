Supercontinuum generation in optical fibers is one of the most dramatic nonlinear effects discovered,
allowing short pulses to be converted into multi-octave spanning coherent spectra. However, generating
supercontinua that are both coherent and broadband requires pulses that are simultaneously ultrashort
with high peak power. This results in a reducing efficiency with increasing pulse repetition rate,
that has hindered supercontinua at microwave line spacing, i.e. 10s of GHz. Soliton microcombs
by contrast, can generate octave-spanning spectra, but with good conversion efficiency only at
vastly higher repetition rates in the 100s of GHz. Here, we bridge this efficiency gap with resonant
supercontinuum, allowing supercontinuum generation using input pulses with an ultra-low 6 picojoule
energy, and duration of 1 picosecond, 10-fold longer than what is typical. By applying synchronous
pulse-driving to a dispersion-engineered, low-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic chip microresonator,
we generate dissipative Kerr solitons with a strong dispersive wave, both bound to the input pulse.
This creates a smooth, flattened 2,200 line frequency comb, with an electronically detectable
repetition rate of 28 GHz, constituting the largest bandwidth-line-count product for any microcomb
generated to date. Strikingly, we observe that solitons exist in a weakly bound state with the input
pulse, stabilizing their repetition rate, but simultaneously allowing noise transfer from one
to the other to be suppressed even for offset frequencies 100 times lower than the linear cavity decay
rate. We demonstrate that this nonlinear filtering can be enhanced by pulse-driving asynchronously,
in order to preserve the coherence of the comb. Taken together, our work establishes resonant supercontinuum
as a promising route to broadband and coherent spectra.
