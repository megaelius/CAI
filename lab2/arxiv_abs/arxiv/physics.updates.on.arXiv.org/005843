The Wide-field Imager for Parker Solar Probe (WISPR) captures unprecedented white-light images
of the solar corona and inner heliosphere. Thanks to the uniqueness of Parker Solar Probe's (PSP)
orbit, WISPR is able to image ``locally'' coronal structures at high spatial and time resolutions.
The observed plane of sky, however, rapidly changes because of the PSP's high orbital speed. Therefore,
the interpretation of the dynamics of the coronal structures recorded by WISPR is not straightforward.
A first study, undertaken by \citet{Liewer2019}, shows how different coronal features (e.g.,
streamers, flux ropes) appear in the field of view of WISPR by means of raytracing simulations. In
particular, they analyze the effects of the spatial resolution changes on both the images and the
associated height-time maps, and introduce the fundamentals for geometric triangulation. In
this follow-up paper, we focus on the study of the total brightness of a simple, spherical, plasma
density structure, to understand how the analysis of Thomson-scattered emission by the electrons
in a coronal feature can shed light into the determination of its kinematic properties. We investigate
two cases: {\it (a)} a density sphere at a constant distance from the Sun for different heliographic
longitudes; {\it (b)} a density sphere moving outwardly with constant speed. The study allows us
to characterize the effects of the varying heliocentric distance of the observer and scattering
angle on the total brightness observed, which we exploit to contribute to a better determination
of the position and speed of the coronal features observed by WISPR.
