Quantum bits, or qubits, are an example of coherent circuits envisioned for next-generation computers
and detectors. A robust superconducting qubit with a coherent lifetime of $O$(100 us) is the transmon:
a Josephson junction functioning as a non-linear inductor shunted with a capacitor to form an anharmonic
oscillator. In a complex device with many such transmons, precise control over each qubit frequency
is often required, and thus variations of the junction area and tunnel barrier thickness must be
sufficiently minimized to achieve optimal performance while avoiding spectral overlap between
neighboring circuits. Simply transplanting our recipe optimized for single, stand-alone devices
to wafer-scale (producing 64, 1x1 cm dies from a 150 mm wafer) initially resulted in global drifts
in room-temperature tunneling resistance of $\pm$ 30%. Inferring a critical current $I_{\rm c}$
variation from this resistance distribution, we present an optimized process developed from a
systematic 38 wafer study that results in $<$ 3.5% relative standard deviation (RSD) in critical
current ($\equiv \sigma_{I_{\rm c}}/\left\langle I_{\rm c} \right\rangle$) for 3000 Josephson
junctions (both fixed frequency and asymmetric SQUIDs) across an area of 49 cm$^{2}$. Looking within
a 1x1 cm moving window across the substrate gives an estimate of the variation characteristic of
a given qubit chip. Our best process, utilizing ultrasonically assisted development, uniform
ashing, and dynamic oxidation has shown $\sigma_{I_{\rm c}}/\left\langle I_{\rm c} \right\rangle$
= 1.8% within 1x1 cm, on average, with a few 1x1 cm areas having $\sigma_{I_{\rm c}}/\left\langle
I_{\rm c} \right\rangle$ $<$ 1.0% (equivalent to $\sigma_{f}/\left\langle f \right\rangle$
$<$ 0.5%). Such stability would drastically improve the yield of multi-qubit chips with strict
frequency requirements.
