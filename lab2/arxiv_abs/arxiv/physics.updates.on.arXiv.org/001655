Plasma turbulence at scales of the order of the ion inertial length is mediated by several mechanisms,
including linear wave damping, magnetic reconnection, formation and dissipation of thin current
sheets, stochastic heating. It is now understood that the presence of localized coherent structures
enhances the dissipation channels and the kinetic features of the plasma. However, no formal way
of quantifying the relationship between scale-to-scale energy transfer and the presence of spatial
structures has so far been presented. In this letter we quantify such relationship analyzing the
results of a two-dimensional high-resolution Hall-MHD simulation. In particular, we employ the
technique of space-filtering to derive a spectral energy flux term which defines, in any point of
the computational domain, the signed flux of spectral energy across a given wavenumber. The characterization
of coherent structures is performed by means of a traditional two-dimensional wavelet transformation.
By studying the correlation between the spectral energy flux and the wavelet amplitude, we demonstrate
the strong relationship between scale-to-scale transfer and coherent structures. Furthermore,
by conditioning one quantity with respect to the other, we are able for the first time to quantify
the inhomogeneity of the turbulence cascade induced by topological structures in the magnetic
field. Taking into account the low filling-factor of coherent structures (i.e. they cover a small
portion of space), it emerges that 80% of the spectral energy transfer (both in the direct and inverse
cascade directions) is localized in about 50% of space, and 50% of the energy transfer is localized
in only 25% of space.
