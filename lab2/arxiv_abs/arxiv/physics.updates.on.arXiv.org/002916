The ANAIS (Annual modulation with NaI(Tl) Scintillators) experiment aims at the confirmation
or refutation of the DAMA/LIBRA positive annual modulation signal in the low energy detection rate,
using the same target and technique, at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) in Spain. ANAIS-112,
consisting of nine 12.5 kg NaI(Tl) modules produced by Alpha Spectra Inc. in a 3x3 matrix configuration,
is taking data smoothly in dark matter search mode since August, 2017, after a commissioning phase
and operation of the first detectors during the last years in various set-ups. A large effort has
been carried out within ANAIS to characterize the background of sodium iodide detectors, before
unblinding the data and performing the first annual modulation analysis. Here, the background
models developed for all the nine ANAIS-112 detectors are presented. Measured spectra from threshold
to high energy in different conditions are well described by the models based on quantified activities
independently estimated following several approaches. In the region from 1 to 6 keVee the measured,
efficiency corrected background level is 3.58+-0.02 keV-1 kg-1 d-1; NaI crystal bulk contamination
is the dominant background source being 210Pb, 40K, 22Na and 3H contributions the most relevant
ones. This background level, added to the achieved 1 keVee analysis threshold (thanks to the outstanding
light collection and robust filtering procedures developed), allow ANAIS-112 to be sensitive
to the modulation amplitude measured by DAMA/LIBRA, and able to explore at three sigma level in five
years the DAMA/LIBRA single-out WIMP parameter region.
