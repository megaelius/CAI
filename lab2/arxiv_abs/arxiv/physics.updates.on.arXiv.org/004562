We present a quantum embedding method that allows for the calculation of local excited states embedded
in a Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) environment. Projection-based quantum embedding
methodologies provide a rigorous framework for performing DFT-in-DFT and wave function in DFT
(WF-in-DFT) calculations. The use of absolute localization, where the density of each subsystem
is expanded in only the basis functions associated with the atoms of that subsystem, provide improved
computationally efficiency for WF-in-DFT calculations by reducing the number of orbitals in the
WF calculation. In this work, we extend absolutely localized projection-based quantum embedding
to study localized excited states using EOM-CCSD-in-DFT and TDDFT-in-DFT. The embedding results
are highly accurate compared to the corresponding canonical EOM-CCSD and TDDFT results on the full
system, with TDDFT-in-DFT frequently more accurate than canonical TDDFT. The absolute localization
method is shown to eliminate the spurious low-lying excitation energies for charge transfer states
and prevent over delocalization of excited states. Additionally, we attempt to recover the environment
response caused by the electronic excitations in the high-level subsystem using different schemes
and compare their accuracy. Finally, we apply this method to the calculation of the excited state
energy of green fluorescent protein and show that we systematically converge to the full system
results. Here we demonstrate how this method can be useful in understanding excited states, specifically
which chemical moieties polarize to the excitation. This work shows absolutely localized projection-based
quantum embedding can treat local electronic excitations accurately, and make computationally
expensive WF methods applicable to systems beyond current computational limits.
