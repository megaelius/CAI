The task of dynamic flow estimation is to construct an approximation of an evolving flow---and particularly,
its response to disturbances---using measurements from available sensors. Building from previous
work by Darakananda et al.~(Phys Rev Fluids 2018), we further develop an ensemble Kalman filter
(EnKF) framework for aerodynamic flows based on an ensemble of randomly-perturbed inviscid vortex
models of flow about an infinitely-thin plate. In the forecast step, vortex elements in each ensemble
member are advected by the flow and new elements are released from each edge of the plate; the elements
are aggregated to maintain an efficient representation. The vortex elements and leading edge constraint
are corrected in the analysis step by assimilating the surface pressure differences across the
plate measured from the truth system. We show that the overall framework can be physically interpreted
as a series of adjustments to the position and shape of an elliptical region of uncertainty associated
with each vortex element. In this work, we compare the previously-used stochastic EnKF with the
ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF), which uses a deterministic analysis step. We examine
the response of the flat plate at $20^\circ$ in two perturbed flows, with truth data obtained from
high-fidelity simulation at Reynolds number 500. In the first case, we apply a sequence of large-amplitude
pulses near the leading edge of the plate to mimic flow actuation. In the second, we place the plate
in a vortex street wake behind a cylinder. In both cases, we show that the vortex-based framework
accurately estimates the pressure distribution and normal force, with no {\em a priori} knowledge
of the perturbations. We show that the ETKF is consistently more robust than the stochastic EnKF.
Finally, we examine the mapping from measurements to state update in the analysis step through SVD
of the Kalman gain.
