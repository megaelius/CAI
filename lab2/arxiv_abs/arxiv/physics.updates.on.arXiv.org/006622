Transition metal nitrides have recently gained attention in the fields of plasmonics, plasmon-enhanced
photocatalysis, photothermal applications, and nonlinear optics because of their suitable optical
properties, refractory nature, and large laser damage thresholds. This work reports comparative
studies of the transient response of films of titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, and Au under
femtosecond excitation. Broadband transient optical characterization helps to adjudicate earlier,
somewhat inconsistent reports regarding hot electron lifetimes based upon single wavelength
measurements. These pump-probe experiments show sub-picosecond transient dynamics only within
the epsilon-near-zero window of the refractory metals. The dynamics are dominated by photoinduced
interband transitions resulting from ultrafast electron energy redistribution. The enhanced
reflection modulation in the epsilon-near-zero window makes it possible to observe the ultrafast
optical response of these films at low pump fluences. These results indicate that electron-phonon
coupling in TiN and ZrN is 25-100 times greater than in Au. Strong electron-phonon coupling drives
the sub-picosecond optical response and facilitates greater lattice heating compared to Au, making
TiN and ZrN promising for photothermal applications. The spectral response and dynamics of TiN
and ZrN are only weakly sensitive to pump fluence and pump excitation energy. However, the magnitude
of the response is much greater at higher pump photon energies and higher fluences, reaching peak
observed values of 15 % in TiN and 50 % in ZrN in the epsilon-near-zero window.
