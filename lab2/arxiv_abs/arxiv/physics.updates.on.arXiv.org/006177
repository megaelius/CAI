Nowadays, the coronavirus pandemic has and is still causing large numbers of deaths and infected
people. Although governments all over the world have taken severe measurements to slow down the
virus spreading (e.g., travel restrictions, suspending all sportive, social, and economic activities,
quarantines, social distancing, etc.), a lot of persons have died and a lot more are still in danger.
Indeed, a recently conducted study~\cite{ref2} has reported that 79\% of the confirmed infections
in China were caused by undocumented patients who had no symptoms. In the same context, in numerous
other countries, since coronavirus takes several days before the emergence of symptoms, it has
also been reported that the known number of infections is not representative of the real number of
infected people (the actual number is expected to be much higher). That is to say, asymptomatic patients
are the main factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major reason
that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To contribute to remedying
this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT (Internet of Things) investigation system
that was specifically designed to spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal
is to help the authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if they
have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all persons who had close
contact with infected or suspected patients. Consequently, rapid isolation of suspicious cases
and more efficient control over any pandemic propagation can be achieved.
