The ALICE experiment at CERN is preparing for a major upgrade for the third phase of data taking run
(Run 3), when the high luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) starts. The increase in
the beam luminosity will result in high interaction rate causing the data acquisition rate to exceed
3 TB/sec. In order to acquire data for all the events and to handle the increased data rate, a transition
in the readout electronics architecture from the triggered to the trigger-less acquisition mode
is required. In this new architecture, a dedicated electronics block called the Common Readout
Unit (CRU) is defined to act as a nodal communication point for detector data aggregation and as a
distribution point for timing, trigger and control (TTC) information. TTC information in the upgraded
triggerless readout architecture uses two asynchronous high-speed serial links connections:
the TTC-PON and the GBT. We have carried out a study to evaluate the quality of the embedded timing
signals forwarded by the CRU to the connected electronics using the TTC-PON and GBT bridge connection.
We have used four performance metrics to characterize the communication bridge: (a)the latency
added by the firmware logic, (b)the jitter cleaning effect of the PLL on the timing signal, (c)BER
analysis for quantitative measurement of signal quality, and (d)the effect of optical transceivers
parameter settings on the signal strength. Reliability study of the bridge connection in maintaining
the phase consistency of timing signals is conducted by performing multiple iterations of power
on/off cycle, firmware upgrade and reset assertion/de-assertion cycle (PFR cycle). The test results
are presented and discussed concerning the performance of the TTC-PON and GBT bridge communication
chain using the CRU prototype and its compliance with the ALICE timing requirements.
