The analysis of the results of a depletion code is often considered a tedious and delicate task for
it requires both the processing of large volume of information (the time dependent composition
of up to thousands isomeric states) and an extensive experience of nuclear reactions and associated
nuclear data. From these observations, dedicated developments have been integrated to the upcoming
version of the Monte Carlo depletion code VESTA 2.2, in order to implement an innovative representation
of depletion problems. The aim is to provide user with an adapted and efficient framework to ease
the analysis of the results of the code and facilitate their interpretation. This effort ultimately
culminated in the development of the representation of the isotope evolution of a given system as
a directed graph. In this paper, it is shown that the Bateman equation encoded in the VESTA code indeed
possesses a natural interpretation in terms of directed cyclic graph and it is proposed to explore
some of the insight one can gain from the graph representation of a depletion problem. Starting from
the new capabilities of the code, it is shown how one can build on the wealth of existing methods of
graph theory in order to gain useful information about the nuclear reactions taking place in a material
under irradiation. The graph representation of a depletion problem being especially simple in
activation problems, for then only a limited number of nuclides and reactions are involved, the
graph representation and its associated tools will be used to study the evolution of the structure
materials of a simplifed model of the ITER fusion reactor.
