The dominant viewpoint on Jovian decametric S-burst emission neglects the time delay of the radiation,
although its base theory of electron cyclotron maser instability allows a significant decreasing
of X-mode group velocity near the cutoff frequency at the bottom of source region. We searched for
effects of the frequency-related delay of radiation in broadband Jovian radio storms consisting
of periodic S-bursts (S-burst trains) at 16 to 30 MHz. It was found that up to 1% of bursts in a train
are of distorted meandering shape in dynamic spectrum, where the emission from one radio source
was observed at several frequencies simultaneously. It is difficult to explain such spectra in
terms of radio waves beaming or causality without significant frequency-related delay of radio
emission. We found experimentally that the frequency drift rate of middle lines of such events coincides
with the drift rate of disturbances in common S-bursts. This indicates a general distortion of the
dynamic spectrum of S-bursts. As a result, the correlation method for the measurement of the spectral
distortion is proposed. Using this method, we found the approximation coefficients for the distortion
in 32 spectra of 8 Io-B storms. The corrected spectra formally show that S-burst trains do not move
mainly outward from Jupiter, as it is usually assumed, but fly in the opposite direction. Our simulation
confirms that the dispersion is capable in principle to reproduce the found spectral distortion.
Hence, the dispersion-like phenomena in Jovian S-bursts deserve discussion because they have
no satisfactory explanations in terms of traditional approach.
