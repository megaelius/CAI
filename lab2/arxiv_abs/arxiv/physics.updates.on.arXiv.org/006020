Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) allows non-invasive investigation of
whole-brain connectivity, which can potentially help to reveal the brain's global network architecture
and abnormalities involved in neurological and mental disorders. However, the reliability of
connection inferences from dMRI-based fiber tracking is still debated, due to low sensitivity,
dominance of false positives, and inaccurate and incomplete reconstruction of long-range connections.
Furthermore, parameters of tracking algorithms are typically tuned in a heuristic way, which leaves
room for manipulation of an intended result. Here we propose a data-driven framework to optimize
and validate parameters of dMRI-based fiber-tracking algorithms using neural tracer data as a
reference. Japan's Brain/MINDS Project provides invaluable datasets containing both dMRI and
neural tracer data from the same primates. We considered four criteria for goodness of fiber tracking:
distance-weighted coverage, true/false positive ratio, projection coincidence, and commissural
passage, applied using a multi-objective optimization algorithm. We implemented a variant of
non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to optimize five major parameters of a global
fiber-tracking algorithm over multiple brain samples in parallel. Using optimized parameters
compared to the default parameters, dMRI-based fiber tracking performance was significantly
improved, while minimizing false positives and impossible cross-hemisphere connections. Parameters
optimized for 10 tracer injection sites showed good generalization capability for other brain
samples. These results demonstrate the importance of data-driven adjustment of fiber-tracking
algorithms and support the validity of dMRI-based tractography, if appropriate adjustments are
employed.
