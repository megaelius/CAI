Magnetic reconnection is a leading mechanism for magnetic energy conversion and high-energy non-thermal
particle production in a variety of high-energy astrophysical objects, including ones with relativistic
ion-electron plasmas (e.g., microquasars or AGNs) - a regime where first principle studies are
scarce. We present 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of low $\beta$ ion-electron plasmas
under relativistic conditions, i.e., with inflow magnetic energy exceeding the plasma rest-mass
energy. We identify outstanding properties: (i) For relativistic inflow magnetizations (here
$10 < \sigma_e < 360$), the reconnection outflows are dominated by thermal agitation instead
of bulk kinetic energy. (ii) At large inflow electron magnetization ($\sigma_e > 80$), the reconnection
electric field is sustained more by bulk inertia than by thermal inertia. It challenges the thermal-inertia-paradigm
and its implications. (iii) The inflows feature sharp transitions at the entrance of the diffusion
zones. These are not shocks but results from particle ballistic motions, all bouncing at the same
location, provided that the thermal velocity in the inflow is far smaller than the inflow E cross
B bulk velocity. (iv) Island centers are magnetically isolated from the rest of the flow, and can
present a density depletion at their center. (v) The reconnection rates are slightly larger than
in non-relativistic studies. They are best normalized by the inflow relativistic Alfv\'en speed
projected in the outflow direction, which then leads to rates in a close range (0.14-0.25) thus allowing
for an easy estimation of the reconnection electric field.
