The MEG experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) represents the state of the art in the search
for the charged Lepton Flavour Violating (cLFV) $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \gamma$ decay. With the
phase 1, MEG set the new world best upper limit on the $\mbox{BR}(\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \gamma) <
4.2 \times 10^{-13}$ (90% C.L.). With the phase 2, MEG II, the experiment aims at reaching a sensitivity
enhancement of about one order of magnitude compared to the previous MEG result. The new Cylindrical
Drift CHamber (CDCH) is a key detector for MEG II. CDCH is a low-mass single volume detector with high
granularity: 9 layers of 192 drift cells, few mm wide, defined by $\sim 12000$ wires in a stereo configuration
for longitudinal hit localization. The filling gas mixture is Helium:Isobutane (90:10). The total
radiation length is $1.5 \times 10^{-3}$ $\mbox{X}_0$, thus minimizing the Multiple Coulomb Scattering
(MCS) contribution and allowing for a single-hit resolution $< 120$ $\mu$m and an angular and momentum
resolutions of 6 mrad and 90 keV/c respectively. This article presents the CDCH commissioning activities
at PSI after the wiring phase at INFN Lecce and the assembly phase at INFN Pisa. The endcaps preparation,
HV tests and conditioning of the chamber are described, aiming at reaching the final stable working
point. The integration into the MEG II experimental apparatus is described, in view of the first
data taking with cosmic rays and $\mu^+$ beam during the 2018 and 2019 engineering runs. The first
gas gain results are also shown. A full engineering run with all the upgraded detectors and the complete
DAQ electronics is expected to start in 2020, followed by three years of physics data taking.
