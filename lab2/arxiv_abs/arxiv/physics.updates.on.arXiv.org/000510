The Heavy Photon Search (HPS), an experiment to search for a hidden sector photon in fixed target
electroproduction, is preparing for installation at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility (JLab) in the Fall of 2014. As the first stage of this project, the HPS Test Run apparatus
was constructed and operated in 2012 to demonstrate the experiment's technical feasibility and
to confirm that the trigger rates and occupancies are as expected. This paper describes the HPS Test
Run apparatus and readout electronics and its performance. In this setting, a heavy photon can be
identified as a narrow peak in the e$^+$e$^-$ invariant mass spectrum, above the trident background
or as a narrow invariant mass peak with a decay vertex displaced from the production target, so charged
particle tracking and vertexing are needed for its detection. In the HPS Test Run, charged particles
are measured with a compact forward silicon microstrip tracker inside a dipole magnet. Electromagnetic
showers are detected in a PbW0$_{4}$ crystal calorimeter situated behind the magnet, and are used
to trigger the experiment and identify electrons and positrons. Both detectors are placed close
to the beam line and split top-bottom. This arrangement provides sensitivity to low-mass heavy
photons, allows clear passage of the unscattered beam, and avoids the spray of degraded electrons
coming from the target. The discrimination between prompt and displaced e$^+$e$^-$ pairs requires
the first layer of silicon sensors be placed only 10~cm downstream of the target. The expected signal
is small, and the trident background huge, so the experiment requires very large statistics. Accordingly,
the HPS Test Run utilizes high-rate readout and data acquisition electronics and a fast trigger
to exploit the essentially 100% duty cycle of the CEBAF accelerator at JLab.
