A simple analytical model based on the transmission-matrix approach is proposed for equivalent
wire-medium (WM) interfaces. The obtained ABCD matrices for equivalent interfaces capture the
non-local effects due to the evanescent transverse magnetic (TM) WM mode and in part due to the propagating
transverse electromagnetic (TEM) WM mode. This enables one to characterize the overall response
of bounded WM structures by cascading the ABCD matrices of equivalent WM interfaces and WM slabs
as transmission lines supporting only the propagating TEM WM mode, resulting in a simple circuit-model
formalism for bounded WM structures with arbitrary terminations, including the open-end, patch/slot
arrays, and thin metal/2D material, among others. The individual ABCD matrices for equivalent
WM interfaces apparently violate the conservation of energy and reciprocity, and therefore, the
equivalent interfaces apparently behave as non-reciprocal lossy or active systems. However,
the overall response of a bounded WM structure is consistent with the lossless property maintaining
the conservation of energy and reciprocity. These unusual features are explained by the fact that
in the non-local WM the Poynting vector has an additional correction term which takes into account
a "hidden power" due to non-local effects. Results are obtained for various numerical examples
demonstrating a rapid and efficient solution for bounded WM structures, including the case of geometrically
complex multilayer configurations with arbitrary terminations, subject to the condition that
WM interfaces are decoupled by the evanescent TM WM mode below the plasma frequency.
