A high resolution (0.05 m) water isotopic record ($\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$) is available from
the NorthGRIP ice core. In this study we look into the water isotope diffusion history as estimated
by the spectral characteristics of the $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ time series covering the last
16,000 years. The diffusion of water vapor in the porous medium of the firn pack attenuates the initial
isotopic signal, predominantly having an impact on the high frequency components of the power spectrum.
Higher temperatures induce higher rates of smoothing and thus the signal can be used as a firn paleothermometer.
We use a water isotope diffusion model coupled to a steady-state densification model in order to
infer the temperature signal from the site, assuming the accumulation and strain rate history as
estimated using the GICC05 layer counted chronology and a Dansgaard--Johnsen ice flow model. The
temperature reconstruction accurately captures the timing and magnitude of the B\o lling--Aller\o
d and Younger Dryas transitions. A Holocene climatic optimum is seen between 7 and 9 ky b2k with an
apparent cooling trend thereafter. Our temperature estimate for the Holocene climatic optimum,
points to a necessary adjustment of the ice thinning function indicating that the ice flow model
overestimates past accumulation rates by about 10\% at 8 ky b2k. Finally, the record presents a climatic
variability over the Holocene spanning millennial and centennial scales with a profound cooling
occurring at approximately 4000 years b2k. The new reconstruction technique is able to provide
past temperature estimates by overcoming the issues apparent in the use of the classical $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$
slope method. It can in the same time resolve temperature signals at low and high frequencies.
