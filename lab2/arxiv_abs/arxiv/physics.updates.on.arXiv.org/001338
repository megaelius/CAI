We propose fabrication of the fiber-shaped lithium ion batteries assembled by twisting a cathode
filament together with an anode filament. The cathode filament is fabricated by depositing a LiFePO4
(LFP)-composite layer onto a steel-filled polyester conductive thread (SPCT). As anode filaments,
we propose several scenarios including a Li4Ti5O12 (LTO)-composite coated SPCT (dip-and-dry
deposition), a tin-coated SPCT (PVD deposition) as well as a bare tin wire. An electrolyte composite
layer consisting of LiPF6 and polyethylene oxide (PEO) is then deposited onto both the anode and
cathode filament before the battery assembly. By twisting the cathode filament and anode filament
together using a customized jig, the batteries are then assembled. The open-circuit voltage is
found to be ~ 2.3 V for the battery using the LTO@SPCT anode, and ~3.3 V for the battery using the tin@SPCT
anode and the tin wire anode. Charge-discharge tests are carried out at different C rates for each
battery sample. Experimental results suggest that the LIBs using the LTO@SPCT anode, the tin@SPCT
anode and the bare tin wire anode could achieve a specific capacity of ~64, ~67, and ~96 mAh/g, respectively,
when charge-discharged at 0.5-C rate. The battery could retain well its capacity after 80 charge-discharge
cycles. During operation of all the batteries reported in this paper, their coulombic efficiency
remained above 80%. Among the advantages of the proposed LIB are light weight, ease of fabrication,
high specific capacitance, high energy density, and good durability. Finally, employing cheap
and commercially-available steel-filled polyester threads as a base material in our batteries,
makes them potentially suitable for integration into wearables using various standard textile
manufacturing techniques.
