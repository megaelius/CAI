Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one of the most preferred candidate for Dark Matter.
WIMPs should interact with the nuclei of detectors. If a robust signal is eventually observed in
direct detection experiments, the best signature to confirm its Galactic origin would be the nuclear
recoil track direction. The MIMAC collaboration has developed a low pressure gas detector providing
both the kinetic energy and three-dimensional track reconstruction of nuclear recoils. In this
paper we report the first ever observations of $^{19}$F nuclei tracks in a $5$ cm drift prototype
MIMAC detector, in the low kinetic energy range ($6$-$26$ keV), using specially developed ion beam
facilities. We have measured the recoil track lengths and found significant differences between
our measurements and standard simulations. In order to understand these differences, we have performed
a series of complementary experiments and simulations to study the impact of the diffusion and eventual
systematics. We show an unexpected dependence of the number of read-out corresponding to the track
on the electric field applied to the $512\ \mathrm{\mu m}$ gap of the Micromegas detector. We have
introduced, based on the flash-ADC observable, corrections in order to reconstruct the physical
3D track length of the primary electron clouds proposing the physics behind these corrections.
We show that diffusion and space charge effects need to be taken into account to explain the differences
between measurements and standard simulations. These measurements and simulations may shed a
new light on the high-gain TPC ionization signals in general and particularly at low energy.
