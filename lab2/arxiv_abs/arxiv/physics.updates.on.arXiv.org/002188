We investigate deposit patterns and associated morphology formed after the evaporation of an aqueous
droplet containing mono- and bi-dispersed colloidal particles. In particular, the combined effect
of substrate heating and particle diameter is investigated. We employ high-speed visualization,
optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to characterize the evaporating droplets,
particle motion, and deposit morphology, respectively. In the context of mono-dispersed colloidal
particles, an inner deposit and a typical ring form for smaller and larger particles, respectively,
on a nonheated surface. At larger substrate temperature, a thin ring with inner deposit forms, explained
by the self-pinning of the contact line and advection of the particles from the contact line to the
center of the droplet due to Marangoni flow. In the context of bi-dispersed colloidal particles,
self-sorting of the colloidal particles within the ring occurs at larger substrate temperature.
The smaller particles deposit at the outermost edge as compared to the larger diameter particles
and this preferential deposition in a stagnation region near the contact line is due to the spatially-varying
height of the liquid-gas interface above the substrate. The sorting occurs at a smaller ratio of
the diameter of the smaller and larger particle. At the larger substrate temperature and a larger
ratio, the particles do not get sorted and mix into each other. Our measurements show that there exists
a critical substrate temperature as well as a diameter ratio in order to achieve the sorting. We propose
regime maps on substrate temperature-particle diameter and substrate temperature-diameter
ratio plane for mono- and bi-dispersed solutions, respectively.
