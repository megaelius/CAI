Vortex, the winding of a vector field in two dimensions, has its core the field singularity and its
topological charge defined by the quantized winding angle of the vector field. Vortices are one
of the most fundamental topological excitations in nature, widely known in hair whorls as the winding
of hair strings, in fluid dynamics as the winding of velocities, in angular-momentum beams as the
winding of phase angle and in superconductors and superfluids as the winding of order parameters.
Nevertheless, vortices have hardly been observed other than those in the real space. Although band
degeneracies, such as Dirac cones, can be viewed as momentum-space vortices in their mathematical
structures, there lacks a well-defined physical observable whose winding number is an arbitrary
signed integer. Here, we experimentally observed momentum-space vortices as the winding of far-field
polarization vectors in the Brillouin zone (BZ) of periodic plasmonic structures. Using a home-made
polarization-resolved momentum-space imaging spectroscopy, we completely map out the dispersion,
lifetime and polarization of all radiative states at the visible wavelengths. The momentum space
vortices were experimentally identified by their winding patterns in the polarization-resolved
iso-frequency contours and their diverging radiative quality factors. Such polarization vortices
can exist robustly on any periodic systems of vectorial fields, while they are not captured by the
existing topological band theory developed for scaler fields. This work opens up a promising avenue
for exploring topological photonics in the momentum space, studying bound states in continuum
(BICs), as well as for rendering and steering vector beams and designing high-Q plasmonic resonances.
