In this paper, we introduce a new framework for parametrization schemes (PS) in GFD. Using the theory
of controlled rough paths, we derive a class of rough geophysical fluid dynamics (RGFD) models as
critical points of rough action functionals. These RGFD models characterize Lagrangian trajectories
in fluid dynamics as geometric rough paths (GRP) on the manifold of diffeomorphic maps. Three constrained
variational approaches are formulated for the derivation of these models. The first is the Clebsch
formulation, in which the constraints are imposed as rough advection laws. The second is the Hamilton-Pontryagin
formulation, in which the constraints are imposed as right-invariant rough vector fields. The
third is the Euler--Poincar\'e formulation in which the variations are constrained. These variational
principles lead directly to the Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian formulation of fluid dynamics on geometric
rough paths. The GRP framework preserves the geometric structure of fluid dynamics obtained by
using Lie group reduction to pass from Lagrangian to Eulerian variational principles, thereby
yielding a rough formulation of the Kelvin circulation theorem. The rough-path variational approach
includes non-Markovian perturbations of the Lagrangian fluid trajectories. In particular, memory
effects can be introduced through this formulation through a judicious choice of the rough path
(e.g. a realization of a fractional Brownian motion). In the special case when the rough path is a
realization of a semimartingale, we recover the SGFD models in Holm (2015). However, by eliminating
the need for stochastic variational tools, we retain a pathwise interpretation of the Lagrangian
trajectories. In contrast, the Lagrangian trajectories in the stochastic framework are described
by stochastic integrals which do not have a pathwise interpretation. Thus, the rough path formulation
restores this property.
