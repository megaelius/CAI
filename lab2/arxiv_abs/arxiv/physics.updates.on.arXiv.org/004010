All-dielectric nanophotonics becomes a versatile tool for various optical applications, including
nanothermometry and optical heating. Its general concept includes excitation of Mie resonances
in nonplasmonic nanoparticles. However, the potential of resonant dielectric nanoparticles
in drug delivery applications still have not been fully realized. Here, optically resonant dielectric
iron oxide nanoparticles ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ NPs) are employed for remote rupture of microcontainers
used as drug delivery platform. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated, that $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$
NPs has several advantages in light-to-heat energy conversion comparing to previously used materials,
such as noble metals and silicon, due to the broader spectral range of efficient optical heating,
and in enhancement of thermally sensitive Raman signal. The $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ NPs embedded
into the wall of universal drug carriers, polymer capsules, are used to experimentally determine
the local temperature of the capsule rupture upon laser irradiation (170$^o$C). As a proof of principle,
we successfully show the delivery and remote release of anticancer drug vincristine upon lowered
laser irradiation (4.0$\times$10$^4$~W/cm$^2$) using polymer capsules modified with the $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$
NPs. The biological tests were performed on two primary cell types: (i) carcinoma cells, as an example
of malignant tumor, and (ii) human stem cells, as a model of healthy cells. The developed delivery
system consisting of polymer capsules modified with the dielectric nanoparticles provides multifunctional
platform for remote drug release and temperature detection.
