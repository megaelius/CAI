Many rare weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, and floods, dramatically impact human
life. To accurately forecast these events and characterize their climatology requires specialized
mathematical techniques to fully leverage the limited data that are available. Here we describe
\emph{transition path theory} (TPT), a framework originally developed for molecular simulation,
and argue that it is a useful paradigm for developing mechanistic understanding of rare climate
events. TPT provides a method to calculate statistical properties of the paths into the event. As
an initial demonstration of the utility of TPT, we analyze a low-order model of sudden stratospheric
warming (SSW), a dramatic disturbance to the polar vortex which can induce extreme cold spells at
the surface in the midlatitudes. SSW events pose a major challenge for seasonal weather prediction
because of their rapid, complex onset and development. Climate models struggle to capture the long-term
statistics of SSW, owing to their diversity and intermittent nature. We use a stochastically forced
Holton-Mass-type model with two stable states, corresponding to radiative equilibrium and a vacillating
SSW-like regime. In this stochastic bistable setting, from certain probabilistic forecasts TPT
facilitates estimation of dominant transition pathways and return times of transitions. These
"dynamical statistics" are obtained by solving partial differential equations in the model's
phase space. With future application to more complex models, TPT and its constituent quantities
promise to improve the predictability of extreme weather events, through both generation and principled
evaluation of forecasts.
