For modelling geophysical systems, large-scale processes are described through a set of coarse-grained
dynamical equations while small-scale processes are represented via parameterizations. This
work proposes a method for identifying the best possible stochastic parameterization from noisy
data. State-the-art sequential estimation methods such as Kalman and particle filters do not achieve
this goal succesfully because both suffer from the collapse of the parameter posterior distribution.
To overcome this intrinsic limitation, we propose two statistical learning methods. They are based
on the combination of two methodologies: the maximization of the likelihood via Expectation-Maximization
(EM) and Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithms which are mainly applied in the statistic and machine learning
communities, and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The methods are derived using a Bayesian approach
for a hidden Markov model. They are applied to infer deterministic and stochastic physical parameters
from noisy observations in coarse-grained dynamical models. Numerical experiments are conducted
using the Lorenz-96 dynamical system with one and two scales as a proof-of-concept. The imperfect
coarse-grained model is modelled through a one-scale Lorenz-96 system in which a stochastic parameterization
is incorpored to represent the small-scale dynamics. The algorithms are able to identify an optimal
stochastic parameterization with a good accuracy under moderate observational noise. The proposed
EnKF-EM and EnKF-NR are promising statistical learning methods for developing stochastic parameterizations
in high-dimensional geophysical models.
