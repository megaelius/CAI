The fabrication method of diamond nanostructures can be divided into two categories: top-down
etching and bottom-growth. The early work on 3D micro-structured diamond dates back to mid-1990s,
using chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) techniques. In this technology, carbon or carbide fibers
were typically used as the growth template. Almost in parallel, reactive ion etching (RIE) was applied
to achieve diamond surface nanostructuring. After that the diamond surface nanostructures, typically
vertically aligned diamond nanowires (or nanorods) has been mainly fabricated using top-down
plasma etching techniques. In recent year, the templated diamond growth has gained increasing
attention due to the wide choice of template, mask-free production, and unlimited surface enlargement.
In this chapter, the development and main techniques used in these two approaches will be elaborated.
Nevertheless, other less common methods, such as catalytic etching by metal particles, steam activation
and selective materials removal will also be discussed. As indicated by the title, this chapter
will mainly deal with the application of micro- and nanostructured diamond in electrochemistry.
In these applications, the advantage of nanostructured diamond can be divided into three aspects:
1) providing enlarged surface area for charge storage and catalyst deposition; 2) tip-enhanced
electrochemical reactions used in sensing applications; 3) diamond membranes with micro- or nanopores
can be applied in the electrochemistry separation and purification applications. Examples and
explanations on these applications will be given in this chapter.
