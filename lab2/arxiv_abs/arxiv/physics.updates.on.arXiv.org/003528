Mapping tissue microstructure accurately and noninvasively is one of the frontiers of biomedical
imaging. Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is at the forefront of such efforts, as it is
capable of reporting on microscopic structures orders of magnitude smaller than the voxel size
by probing restricted diffusion. Double Diffusion Encoding (DDE) and Double Oscillating Diffusion
Encoding (DODE) in particular, are highly promising for their ability to report on microscopic
fractional anisotropy ({\mu}FA), a measure of the pore anisotropy in its own eigenframe, irrespective
of orientation distribution. However, the underlying correlates of {\mu}FA have insofar not been
studied. Here, we extract {\mu}FA from DDE and DODE measurements at ultrahigh magnetic field of
16.4T in the aim to probe fixed rat spinal cord microstructure. We further endeavor to correlate
{\mu}FA with Myelin Water Fraction (MWF) derived from multiexponential T2 relaxometry, as well
as with literature-based spatially varying axonal diameters. In addition, a simple new method
is presented for extracting unbiased {\mu}FA from three measurements at different b-values. Our
findings reveal strong anticorrelations between {\mu}FA (derived from DODE) and axon diameter
in the distinct spinal cord tracts; a moderate correlation was also observed between {\mu}FA derived
from DODE and MWF. These findings suggest that axonal membranes strongly modulate {\mu}FA, which
- owing to its robustness towards orientation dispersion effects - reflects axon diameter much
better than its typical FA counterpart. The {\mu}FA exhibited modulations when measured via oscillating
or blocked gradients, suggesting selective probing of different parallel path lengths and providing
insight into how those modulate {\mu}FA metrics. Our findings thus shed light into the underlying
microstructural correlates of {\mu}FA and are (...)
