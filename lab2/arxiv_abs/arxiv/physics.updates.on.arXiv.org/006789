Bosonic atoms confined in optical lattices are described by the Bose-Hubbard model and can exist
in two different phases, Mott insulator or superfluid, depending on the strength of the system parameters.
In the vicinity of the phase boundary, there are degeneracies that occur between every two adjacent
Mott lobes. Because of this, nondegenerate perturbation theory fails to give meaningful results
for the condensate density: it predicts a phase transition in a point of the phase diagram where no
transition occurs. Motivated by this, we develop two different degenerate perturbative methods
to solve the degeneracy-related problems. Moreover, we study the one-dimensional repulsively
interacting Bose gas under harmonic confinement, with special attention to the asymptotic behavior
of the momentum distribution, which is a universal $k^{-4}$ decay characterized by the Tan's contact.
The latter constitutes a direct signature of the short-range correlations in such an interacting
system and provides valuable insights about the role of the interparticle interactions. We investigate
the system constituted of $N$ interacting particles in the strongly interacting limit. In such
a regime, the strong interparticle interaction makes the bosons behave similarly to the ideal Fermi
gas. Because of the difficulty in analytically solving the system for $N$ particles at finite interaction,
the Tonks-Girardeau regime provides a favorable scenario to probe the contact. Therefore, we are
able to provide an analytical formula for the Tan's contact. Furthermore, we analyze the scaling
properties of the Tan's contact in terms of $N$ in the high-temperature regime as well as in the strongly
interacting regime. Finally, we compare our analytical calculations of the Tan's contact to quantum
Monte Carlo simulations and discuss some fundamental differences between the canonical and the
grand-canonical ensembles.
