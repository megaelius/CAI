This work describes and validates an approach for autonomously bifurcating turbulent combustion
manifolds to divide regression tasks amongst specialized artificial neural networks (ANNs).
This approach relies on the mixture of experts (MoE) framework, where each neural network is trained
to be specialized in a given portion of the input space. The assignment of different input regions
to the experts is determined by a gating network, which is a neural network classifier. In some previous
studies, it has been demonstrated that bifurcation of a complex combustion manifold and fitting
different ANNs for each part leads to better fits or faster inference speeds. However, the manner
of bifurcation in these studies was based on heuristic approaches or clustering techniques. In
contrast, the proposed technique enables automatic bifurcation using non-linear planes in high-dimensional
turbulent combustion manifolds that are often associated with complex behavior due to different
dominating physics in various zones. The proposed concept is validated using 4-dimensional (4D)
and 5D flamelet tables, showing that the errors obtained with a given network size, or conversely
the network size required to achieve a given accuracy, is considerably reduced. The effect of the
number of experts on inference speed is also investigated, showing that by increasing the number
of experts from 1 to 8, the inference time can be approximately reduced by a factor of two. Moreover,
it is shown that the MoE approach divides the input manifold in a physically intuitive manner, suggesting
that the MoE framework can elucidate high-dimensional datasets in a physically meaningful way.
