With the recent introduction of CT scanners with large cone angles, wide coverage detectors now
provide a desirable scanning platform for cardiac CT that allows whole heart imaging in a single
rotation. On these scanners, while half-scan data is strictly sufficient to produce images with
the best temporal resolution, acquiring a full 360 degree rotation worth of data is beneficial for
wide-cone image reconstruction at negligible additional radiation dose. Applying Model-Based
Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm to the heart has shown to yield significant enhancement
in image quality for cardiac CT. But imaging the heart in large cone angle geometry leads to apparently
conflicting data usage considerations. On the one hand, in addition to using the fastest available
scanner rotation speed, a minimal complete data set of 180 degrees plus the fan angle is typically
used to minimize both cardiac and respiratory motion. On the other hand, a full 360 degree acquisition
helps better handle the challenges of missing frequencies and incomplete projections associated
with wide-cone half-scan data acquisition. In this paper, we develop a Spatially Adaptive sinogram
Weights MBIR algorithm (SAW-MBIR) that is designed to achieve the benefits of both half and full-scan
reconstructions in order to maximize temporal resolution over the heart region while providing
stable results over the whole volume covered with the wide-area detector. Spatially-adaptive
sinogram weights applied to each projection measurement in SAW-MBIR are designed to selectively
perform backprojection from the full and half-scan portion of the sinogram based on both projection
angle and reconstructed voxel location. We demonstrate with experimental results of SAW-MBIR
applied to whole-heart cardiac CT clinical data that overall temporal resolution matches half-scan
while full volume image quality is on par with full-scan MBIR.
