We report on observation of the unusual kind of solar microflares, presumably associated with the
so-called "topological trigger" of magnetic reconnection, which was theoretically suggested
long time ago by Gorbachev et al. (Sov. Ast. 1988, v.32, p.308) but has not been clearly identified
so far by observations. As can be seen in pictures by Hinode SOT in CaII line, there may be a bright loop
connecting two sunspots, which looks at the first sight just as a magnetic field line connecting
the opposite poles. However, a closer inspection of SDO HMI magnetograms shows that the respective
arc is anchored in the regions of the same polarity near the sunspot boundaries. Yet another peculiar
feature is that the arc flashes almost instantly as a thin strip and then begins to expand and decay,
while the typical chromospheric flares in CaII line are much wider and propagate progressively
in space. A qualitative explanation of the unusual flare can be given by the above-mentioned model
of topological trigger. Namely, there are such configurations of the magnetic sources on the surface
of photosphere that their tiny displacements result in the formation and fast motion of a 3D null
point along the arc located well above the plane of the sources. So, such a null point can quickly ignite
a magnetic reconnection along the entire its trajectory. Pictorially, this can be presented as
flipping the so-called two-dome magnetic-field structure (which is just the reason why such mechanism
was called topological). The most important prerequisite for the development of topological instability
in the two-dome structure is a cruciform arrangement of the magnetic sources in its base, and this
condition is really satisfied in the case under consideration.
