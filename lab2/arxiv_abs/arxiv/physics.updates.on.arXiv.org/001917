A detailed theoretical study of temperature-gradient induced electric field and electrokinetic
flow of aqueous electrolytes in a capillary is presented. A semi-analytical model for this fluid
flow field and induced electric field is derived by using the energy, Poisson-Nernst-Planck and
Navier-Stokes equations with lubrication approximation. Results reveal that the induced field
due to the difference in the Soret coefficients of the ions prevails for lower $\zeta$ potentials
or wider capillaries, while the induced field due to the selective migration of the ions arising
from the temperature-dependent ion electromobilities dominates for higher $\zeta$ potentials
and very narrow capillaries. It follows that different electrolytes affect the induced field by
altering four variables, i.e. Soret coefficient difference $ \Delta S_T $, normalized difference
in diffusivities of the ions $ \chi $, intrinsic Peclet number $ \Lambda $ and average Soret coefficient
$ S_T $. The induced fields due to these two origins can cooperate with or cancel each other depending
on the sign of $ \zeta\Delta S_T $. Also, non-zero $ \chi $ can enhance or reduce the induced field depending
on the sign of $ \chi\zeta $. Our model indicates that the higher the average temperature the weaker
the induced field. Besides, the overall flow can be decomposed as the superimposition of a thermoosmotic
flow and an electroosmotic flow (EOF) caused by the induced field. These two forms of flows may cooperate
with or cancel each other depending on $ \zeta $ and $ \kappa_0 a $, where $ \kappa_0a $ is the ratio of
capillary radius to Debye length. It suggests that in contrast to the conventional EOF, the thermoosmotic
velocity $ u_{\mathrm{TOF}}\propto\zeta^2 $, whereas the thermal induced EOF velocity $ u_{\mathrm{EOF}}\propto\zeta^{\nu}$,
where $ \nu $ depends on $ \zeta $ and $ \kappa_0a $.
