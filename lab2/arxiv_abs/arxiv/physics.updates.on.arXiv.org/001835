Many real-world systems are profitably described as complex networks that grow over time. Preferential
attachment and node fitness are two simple growth mechanisms that not only explain certain structural
properties commonly observed in real-world systems, but are also tied to a number of applications
in modeling and inference. While there are statistical packages for estimating various parametric
forms of the preferential attachment function, there is no existing package for a non-parametric
estimation, which would allow finer inspections on the famous `rich-get-richer' phenomenon as
well as provide clues to explain non-standard structural properties observed in real-world networks.
This paper introduces the R package PAFit, which implements statistical methods for estimating
the preferential attachment function and node fitness non-parametrically, as well as a number
of functions for generating complex networks from these two mechanisms. The main computational
part of the package is implemented in C++ with OpenMP to ensure scalability to large-scale networks.
In this paper, we first introduce the main functionalities of PAFit through simulated examples,
and then use the package to analyze a collaboration network between scientists in the field of complex
networks. The results indicate the joint existence of `rich-get-richer' and `fit-get-richer'
phenomena in the collaboration network. The estimated attachment function is almost linear, which
means that the probability an author develops a new collaboration is proportional to their current
number of collaborators. Furthermore, the estimated fitnesses reveal many familiar names of the
complex network field as top fittest scientists.
