Pseudospectral time domain (PSTD) methods are widely used in many branches of acoustics for the
numerical solution of the wave equation, including biomedical ultrasound and seismology. The
use of the Fourier collocation spectral method in particular has many computational advantages,
including a reduced number of grid points required for accurate simulations. However, the use of
a discrete Fourier basis is also inherently restricted to solving problems with periodic boundary
conditions. Here, a family of spectral collocation methods based on the use of a sine or cosine basis
is described. These retain the computational advantages of the Fourier collocation method but
instead allow homogeneous Dirichlet (sound-soft) and Neumann (sound-hard) boundary conditions
to be imposed. The basis function weights are computed numerically using the discrete sine and cosine
transforms, which can be implemented using $O(N\log N)$ operations analogous to the fast Fourier
transform. The different combinations of discrete symmetry give rise to sixteen possible discrete
trigonometric transforms. The properties of these transforms are described, and practical details
of how to implement spectral methods using discrete sine and cosine transforms are provided. The
technique is then illustrated through the solution of the wave equation in a rectangular domain
subject to different combinations of boundary conditions. The extension to boundaries with arbitrary
real reflection coefficients or boundaries that are non-reflecting is also demonstrated using
the weighted summation of the solutions with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
