The speed of sound in two-phase pipe flow systems is often several orders of magnitude greater than
the travelling speed of hydraulic information (volume fractions.) Dynamically simulating such
flows requires resolution of acoustic and hydraulic waves existing at vastly different spatial
and temporal scales. If simulated on the same numerical grid, the need for accuracy in hydraulic
waves will necessitate an exaggerated resolution of acoustic waves. Likewise, time steps restricted
by the speed of sound are small compared to the time scales active in hydraulic waves. This constitutes
a waste of computational potential. The method proposed herein decouples the hydraulic and acoustic
scales, greatly improving computational efficiency. The proposed dual grid method solves a four-equation
compressible two-fluid model on a principal grid which robustly accounts for the pressure evolution
and conserves mass and momentum. An incompressible two-equation model is at the same time solved
on a finer grid, resolving the details of the hydraulic evolution. Information from both model formulations
is coupled through the terms of the governing transport equations, providing consistency between
the grids. Accurate and finely resolved schemes can then be employed for the incompressible two-fluid
model without suffering from the time and stability restrictions otherwise enforced by acoustic
waves. At the same time, the Hybrid Central-Upwind flux splitting scheme of Evje and Fl{\aa}tten
(2005a) allows for an explicit and numerically robust treatment of the acoustic waves without losing
hydraulic accuracy. The dual grid method is tested against four dissimilar problems. In all problems,
the proposed scheme provided significant increases in computational efficiency and accuracy
as compared with a single grid arrangement.
