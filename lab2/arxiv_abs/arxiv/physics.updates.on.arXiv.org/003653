Disentangling the mechanistic details of a chemical reaction pathway is a hard problem that often
requires a considerable amount of chemical intuition and a component of luck. Experiments struggle
in observing short-life metastable intermediates, while computer simulations often rely upon
a good initial guess. In this work, we propose a method that, from the simulations of a reactant and
a product state, searches for a path between the two by performing metadynamics, a well known enhanced
molecular dynamics method. The key quantity underlying this search is based on the use of an approach
called Harmonic Linear Discriminant Analysis which allows a systematic construction of collective
variables. Given the reactant and product states, we choose a set of descriptors capable of discriminating
between the two states. In order not to prejudge the results, generic descriptors are introduced.
The fluctuations of the descriptors in the two states are used to construct collective variables.
We use metadynamics in an exploratory mode to discover the intermediates and the transition states
that lead from reactant to product. The search is at first conducted at a low theory level. The calculation
is then refined and the energy of the intermediates and transition states discovered during metadynamics
is computed again using a higher level of theory. The method's aim is to offer a simple reaction pathway
search procedure that helps in saving time and is able to find unexpected mechanisms that defy well
established chemical paradigms. We apply it to two reactions, showing that a high level of complexity
can be hidden even in seemingly trivial and small systems. The method can be applied to larger systems,
such as reactions in solution or catalysis.
