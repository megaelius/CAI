Network science is a rapidly expanding field, with a large and growing body of work on network-based
dynamical processes. Most theoretical results in this area rely on the so-called \emph{locally
tree-like approximation}. This is, however, usually an `uncontrolled' approximation, in the
sense that the magnitudes of the error are typically unknown, although numerical results show that
this error is often surprisingly small. In this paper we place this approximation on more rigorous
footing by calculating the magnitude of deviations away from tree-based theories in the context
of discrete-time critical network cascades with re-excitable nodes. We discuss the conditions
under which tree-like approximations give good results for calculating network criticality,
and also explain the reasons for deviation from this approximation, in terms of the density of certain
kinds of network motifs. Using this understanding, we derive results for network criticality that
apply to general networks that explicitly do not satisfy the locally tree-like approximation.
In particular, we focus on the bi-parallel motif, the smallest motif relevant to the failure of a
tree-based theory in this context, and we derive the corrections due to such motifs on the conditions
for criticality. We verify our claims on computer-generated networks, and we confirm that our theory
accurately predicts the observed deviations from criticality. Using our theory, we explain why
numerical simulations often show that deviations from a tree-based theory are surprisingly small.
More specifically, we show that these deviations are negligible for networks with large average
degrees, justifying why tree-based theories appear to work well for most real-world networks.
