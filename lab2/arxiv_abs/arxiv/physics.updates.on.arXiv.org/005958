We present a systematic approach to effectively evaluate potential risk cost caused by exposure
to solar proton events (SPEs) from solar flares for the airline industry. We also evaluate associated
health risks from radiation, to provide relevant alternative ways to minimize economic loss and
opportunity. The estimated radiation dose induced by each SPE for the passengers of each flight
is calculated using ExoKyoto and PHITS. We determine a few scenarios for the estimated dose limit
at 1 and 20mSv, corresponding to the effective dose limit for the general public and occupational
exposure, respectively, as well as a higher dose induced an extreme superflare. We set a hypothetical
airline shutdown scenario at 1mSv for a single flight per passenger, due to legal restrictions under
the potential radiation dose. In such a scenario, we calculate the potential loss in direct and opportunity
cost under the cancelation of the flight. At the same time, we considered that, even under such a scenario,
if the airplane flies at a slightly lower altitude (from 12 to 9.5km: atmospheric depth from 234 to
365g/cm$^{2}$), the total loss becomes much smaller than flight cancelation, and the estimated
total dose goes down from 1.2 to 0.45mSv, which is below the effective dose limit for the general public.
In case of flying at an even lower altitude (7km: atmospheric depth 484g/cm$^{2}$), the estimated
total dose becomes much smaller, 0.12 mSv. If we assume the increase of fuel cost is proportional
to the increase in atmospheric depth, the increase in cost becomes 1.56 and 2.07 for the case of flying
at 9.5 km and at 7 km, respectively. Lower altitude flights provide more safety for the potential
risk of radiation doses induced by severe SPEs. At the same time, since there is total loss caused
by flight cancelation, we propose that considering lower flight altitude is the best protection
against solar flares.
