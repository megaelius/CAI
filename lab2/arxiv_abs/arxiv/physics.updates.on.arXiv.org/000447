We construct different equivalent non-equilibrium statistical ensembles in a simple yet instructive
$N$-degrees of freedom model of atmospheric turbulence, introduced by Lorenz in 1996. The vector
field can be decomposed into an energy-conserving, time-reversible part, plus a non-time reversible
part, including forcing and dissipation. We construct a modified version of the model where viscosity
varies with time, in such a way that energy is conserved, and the resulting dynamics is fully time-reversible.
For each value of the forcing, the statistical properties of the irreversible and reversible model
are in excellent agreement, if in the latter the energy is kept constant at a value equal to the time-average
realized with the irreversible model. In particular, the average contraction rate of the phase
space of the time-reversible model agrees with that of the irreversible model, where instead it
is constant by construction. We also show that the phase space contraction rate obeys the fluctuation
relation, and we relate its finite time corrections to the characteristic time scales of the system.
A local version of the fluctuation relation is explored and successfully checked. The equivalence
between the two non-equilibrium ensembles extends to dynamical properties such as the Lyapunov
exponents, which are shown to obey to a good degree of approximation a pairing rule. These results
have relevance in motivating the importance of the chaotic hypothesis. in explaining that we have
the freedom to model non-equilibrium systems using different but equivalent approaches, and,
in particular, that using a model of a fluid where viscosity is kept constant is just one option, and
not necessarily the only option, for describing accurately its statistical and dynamical properties.
