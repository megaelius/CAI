In this paper, Ten discoveries are reported. 1. New GLHUA outer annular layer electromagnetic (EM)
invisible cloak with relative parameter not less than 1. 2. Analytical EM wave solution of EM full
wave equation with the GLHUA cloak materials is found, In annular layer cloak, $R_1 \le r \le R_2 $,
$R_1>0$,$R_2>R_1$, $\varepsilon_r = \mu_r = \frac{{R_2 ^2 }}{{r^2 }}$, $\varepsilon_\theta
= \varepsilon_\phi = \mu_\theta = \mu_\phi = \frac{{R_2 - R_1 }}{{r - R_1 }}$. 3. A GLHUA expansion
method to find an exact analytical EM wave propagation in the GLHUA double cloak is propsed. 4.Novel
negative space is proposed.5. GLHUANPII transformation is proposed, which maps negative infinity,$
- \infty $ to $R_1$ and $R_2$ is invariant. 6. three invisible cloaks are created by GLHUANPII transformation.
7. GLHUAF transformation is proposed and 8.GLHUAF invisible cloak with double negative materials
is created.9. We discover a novel GLHUA wave attached in the inner sphere surface $r = R_1$ , which
is bridge to make EM wave propagation through the GLHUA invisible cloak without exceeding light
speed difficulties. 10. The wave front and ray tracing in GLHUA cloak are discontinuous, the ray
redirection method can not be used to prove invisible cloak and can not be used to study GLHUA invisible
cloak.The new contents of this paper, GLHUANPII transformation and GLHUANP-I, GLHUANP-II, GLHUANP-III,
and GLHUAF, four invisible cloaks are different from my papers arXiv:1701.02583 and arXiv:1701.00534
and arXiv:1612.02857. Negative space is also presented in arXiv:1612.02857, but in that paper,
we proposed GLHUANP-I transformation.The arXiv admin note is made by its software. The patent and
