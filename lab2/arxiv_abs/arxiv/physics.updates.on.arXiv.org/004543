Many medical and biological protocols for analyzing individual biological cells involve morphological
evaluation based on cell staining, designed to enhance imaging contrast and enable clinicians
and biologists to differentiate between various cell organelles. However, cell staining is not
always allowed in certain medical procedures. In other cases, staining may be time consuming or
expensive to implement. Here, we present a new deep-learning approach, called HoloStain, which
converts images of isolated biological cells acquired without staining by holographic microscopy
to their virtually stained images. We demonstrate this approach for human sperm cells, as there
is a well-established protocol and global standardization for characterizing the morphology
of stained human sperm cells for fertility evaluation, but, on the other hand, staining might be
cytotoxic and thus is not allowed during human in vitro fertilization (IVF). We use deep convolutional
Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) with training that is based on both the quantitative
phase images and two gradient phase images, all extracted from the digital holograms of the stain-free
cells, with the ground truth of bright-field images of the same cells that subsequently underwent
chemical staining. To validate the quality of our virtual staining approach, an experienced embryologist
analyzed the unstained cells, the virtually stained cells, and the chemically stained sperm cells
several times in a blinded and randomized manner. We obtained a 5-fold recall (sensitivity) improvement
in the analysis results. With the introduction of simple holographic imaging methods in clinical
settings, the proposed method has a great potential to become a common practice in human IVF procedures,
as well as to significantly simplify and facilitate other cell analyses and techniques such as imaging
flow cytometry.
