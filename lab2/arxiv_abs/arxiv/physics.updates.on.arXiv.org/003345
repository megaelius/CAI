We comparatively studied the long-term variation (1992-2017) in polar brightening observed with
the Nobeyama Radioheliograph, the polar solar wind velocity with interplanetary scintillation
observations at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, and the coronal hole distribution
computed by potential field calculations of the solar corona using synoptic magnetogram data obtained
at Kitt Peak National Solar Observatory. First, by comparing the solar wind velocity (V) and the
brightness temperature (T_b) in the polar region, we found good correlation coefficients (CCs)
between V and T_b in the polar regions, CC = 0.91 (0.83) for the northern (southern) polar region,
and we obtained the V-T_b relationship as V =12.6 (T_b-10,667)^{1/2}+432. We also confirmed that
the CC of V-T_b is higher than those of V-B and V-B/f, where B and f are the polar magnetic field strength
and magnetic flux expansion rate, respectively. These results indicate that T_b is a more direct
parameter than B or B/f for expressing solar wind velocity. Next, we analyzed the long-term variation
of the polar brightening and its relation to the area of the polar coronal hole (A). As a result, we
found that the polar brightening matches the probability distribution of the predicted coronal
hole and that the CC between T_b and A is remarkably high, CC = 0.97. This result indicates that the
polar brightening is strongly coupled to the size of the polar coronal hole. Therefore, the reasonable
correlation of V-T_b is explained by V-A. In addition, by considering the anti-correlation between
A and f found in a previous study, we suggest that the V-T_b relationship is another expression of
the Wang-Sheeley relationship (V-1/f) in the polar regions.
