We report the spectral features of a phase-shifted parity and time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetric
fiber Bragg grating (PPTFBG) and demonstrate its functionality as a demultiplexer in the unbroken
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime. The length of the proposed system is of the order of millimeters
and the lasing spectra in the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime can be easily tuned in terms
of intensity, bandwidth and wavelength by varying the magnitude of the phase shift in the middle
of the structure. Surprisingly, the multi-modal lasing spectra are suppressed by virtue of judiciously
selected phase and the gain-loss value. Also, it is possible to obtain sidelobe-less spectra in
the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime, without a need for an apodization profile, which
is a traditional way to tame the unwanted sidelobes. The system is found to show narrow band single-mode
lasing behavior for a wide range of phase shift values for given values of gain and loss. Moreover,
we report the intensity tunable reflection and transmission characteristics in the unbroken regime
via variation in gain and loss. At the exceptional point, the system shows unidirectional wave transport
phenomenon independent of the presence of phase shift in the middle of the grating. For the right
light incidence direction, the system exhibits zero reflection wavelengths within the stopband
at the exceptional point. We also investigate the role of multiple phase shifts placed at fixed locations
along the length of the FBG and the variations in the spectra when the phase shift and gain-loss values
are tuned. In the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime, the presence of multiple phase shifts
aids in controlling the number of reflectivity peaks besides controlling their magnitude.
