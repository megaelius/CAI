A two-dimensional model was developed to simulate the optoelectronic characteristics of indium-gallium-nitride
(InGaN), thin-film, Schottky-barrier solar cells. The solar cells comprise a window, designed
to reduce the reflection of incident light, Schottky-barrier and ohmic front electrodes, an n-doped
InGaN wafer, and a metallic periodically corrugated back-reflector (PCBR). The ratio of indium
to gallium in the wafer varies periodically throughout the thickness of the absorbing layer of the
solar cell. Thus, the resulting InGaN wafer's optical and electrical properties are made to vary
periodically. This material nonhomogeneity could be physically achieved by varying the fractional
composition of indium and gallium during deposition. Empirical models for indium nitride and gallium
nitride were combined using Vegard's law to determine the optical and electrical constitutive
properties of the alloy. The nonhomogeneity of the electrical properties of the InGaN aids in the
separation of the excited electron-hole pairs, while the periodicities of optical properties
and the back-reflector enable the incident light to couple to multiple guided wave modes. The profile
of the resulting charge-carrier-generation rate when the solar cell is illuminated by the AM1.5G
spectrum was calculated using the rigorous coupled-wave approach. The steady-state drift-diffusion
equations were solved using COMSOL, which employs finite-volume methods, to calculate the current
density as a function of the voltage. Mid-band Shockley-Read-Hall, Auger, and radiative recombination
rates were taken to be the dominant methods of recombination. The model was used to study the effects
of the solar-cell geometry and the shape of the periodic material nonhomogeneity on efficiency.
The solar-cell efficiency was optimized using the differential evolution algorithm.
