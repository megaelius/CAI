The time periodic circuit theory is exploited to introduce an appropriate translation operator
that is invariant under the change of the spatial unit cell. Useful properties of the operator are
derived. By casting the problem in an eigenvalue problem form, the equivalency between solutions
at different positions along the structure is demonstrated. It is shown that the underlying mathematical
machinery is identical to the one used in the analysis of linear time invariant periodic structures,
where a two step eigen-decompositions is performed. The first decomposition is in the temporal
eigenfunctions basis, which is followed by the decomposition of the translation operator in the
spatial domain. The two step process results in the well-known dispersion relation. We also prove
that all points in the ($\beta$,$\omega$) plane parallel to the modulation velocity are equivalent
in the sense that the eigenvectors are related by a shift operator. Additionally, the wave propagation
inside the space time periodic circuit and the terminal characteristics are rigorously determined
via the expansion of the total solution in terms of the eigenmodes. To validate the developed framework,
two examples are provided. In the first, a space time modulated composite right left handed transmission
line is studied and results are compared with time domain simulation. The second example is concerned
with the characterization of the non-reciprocal behaviour observed on a nonlinear transmission
line that was manufactured in our lab. Using the developed machinery it is shown that the passive
interaction between different harmonics results in an observed giant non-reciprocity, where
the difference between the forward and backward transmission coefficients can be greater than
30 dB. The frequencies at which non-reciprocity occurs and its strength agree with time domain simulation
and measurements.
