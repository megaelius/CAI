Spectra of methyl cyanide were recorded to analyze interactions in low-lying vibrational states
and to construct line lists for radio astronomical observations as well as for infrared spectroscopic
investigations of planetary atmospheres. The rotational spectra cover large portions of the 36$-$1627
GHz region. In the infrared (IR), a spectrum was recorded for this study in the region of 2$\nu _8$
around 717 cm$^{-1}$ with assignments covering 684$-$765 cm$^{-1}$. Additional spectra in the
$\nu _8$ region were used to validate the analysis. The large amount and the high accuracy of the rotational
data extend to much higher $J$ and $K$ quantum numbers and allowed us to investigate for the first
time in depth local interactions between these states which occur at high $K$ values. In particular,
we have detected several interactions between $v_8 = 1$ and 2. Notably, there is a strong $\Delta
v_8 = \pm1$, $\Delta K = 0$, $\Delta l = \pm3$ Fermi resonance between $v_8 = 1^{-1}$ and $v_8 = 2^{+2}$
at $K$ = 14. Pronounced effects in the spectrum are also caused by resonant $\Delta v_8 = \pm1$, $\Delta
K = \mp2$, $\Delta l = \pm1$ interactions between $v_8 = 1$ and 2. An equivalent resonant interaction
occurs between $K$ = 14 of the ground vibrational state and $K$ = 12, $l = +1$ of $v_8 = 1$ for which we
present the first detailed account. A preliminary account was given in an earlier study on the ground
vibrational state. From data pertaining to $v_8 = 2$, we also investigated rotational interactions
with $v_4 = 1$ as well as $\Delta v_8 = \pm1$, $\Delta K = 0$, $\Delta l = \pm3$ Fermi interactions between
$v_8 = 2$ and 3. We have derived N$_2$- and self-broadening coefficients for the $\nu _8$, 2$\nu _8
- \nu _8$, and 2$\nu _8$ bands from previously determined nu4 values. Subsequently, we determined
transition moments and intensities for the three IR bands.
