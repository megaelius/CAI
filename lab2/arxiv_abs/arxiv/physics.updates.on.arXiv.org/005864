We study the joint effect of the non-linearity of interactions and noise on coevolutionary dynamics.
We choose the coevolving voter model as a prototype framework for this problem. By numerical simulations
and analytical approximations we find three main phases that differ in the absolute magnetization
and the size of the largest component: a consensus phase, a coexistence phase, and a dynamical fragmentation
phase. More detailed analysis reveals inner differences in these phases, allowing us to divide
two of them further. In the consensus phase we can distinguish between a weak or alternating consensus
(switching between two opposite consensus states), and a strong consensus, in which the system
remains in the same state for the whole realization of the stochastic dynamics. Additionally, weak
and strong consensus phases scale differently with the system size. The strong consensus phase
exists for superlinear interactions and it is the only consensus phase that survives in the thermodynamic
limit. In the coexistence phase we distinguish a fully-mixing phase (both states well mixed in the
network) and a structured coexistence phase, where the number of links connecting nodes in different
states (active links) drops significantly due to the formation of two homogeneous communities
of opposite states connected by a few links. The structured coexistence phase is an example of emergence
of community structure from not exclusively topological dynamics, but coevolution. Our numerical
observations are supported by an analytical description using a pair approximation approach and
an ad-hoc calculation for the transition between the coexistence and dynamical fragmentation
phases. Our work shows how simple interaction rules including the joint effect of non-linearity,
noise, and coevolution lead to complex structures relevant in the description of social systems.
