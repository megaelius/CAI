A theoretical framework is established to model the evaporation from continuously fed droplets,
promising tools in the thermal management of high heat flux electronics. Using the framework, a
comprehensive model is developed for a hemispherical water droplet resting on a heated flat substrate
incorporating all of the relevant transport mechanisms: buoyant and thermocapillary convection
inside the droplet and diffusive and convective transport of vapor in the gas domain. At the interface,
mass, momentum, and thermal coupling of the phases are also made accounting for all pertinent physical
aspects including several rarely considered interfacial phenomena such as Stefan flow of gas and
the radiative heat transfer from interface to the surroundings. The model developed utilizes temperature
dependent properties in both phases including the density and accounts for all relevant physics
including Marangoni flow, which makes the model unprecedented. Moreover, utilizing this comprehensive
model, a nonmonotonic interfacial temperature distribution with double temperature dips is discovered
for a hemispherical droplet having internal convection due to buoyancy in the case of high substrate
temperature. Proposed framework is also employed to construct several simplified models adopting
common assumptions of droplet evaporation and the computational performance of these models,
thereby the validity of commonly applied simplifying assumptions, are assessed. Benchmark simulations
reveal that omission of gas flow, i.e. neglecting convective transport in gas phase, results in
the underestimation of evaporation rates by 23-54%. When gas flow is considered but the effect of
buoyancy is modeled using Boussinesq approximation instead of assigning temperature dependent
density throughout the gas domain, evaporation rate can be underestimated by up to 16%.
