Two-dimensional (2D) flows are efficiently controlled with spanwise waviness, i.e. spanwise-periodic
(SP) wall blowing/suction/deformation. We tackle the global linear stability of 2D flows subject
to small-amplitude 3D SP control. Building on previous work for parallel flows (Boujo et al. 2015),
an adjoint method is proposed for computing the 2nd-order eigenvalue sensitivity. Such control
has a zero 1st-order linear effect, so the 2nd-order quadratic effect prevails. The sensitivity
operator allows one (i) to predict the effect of any control without computing the controlled flow,
(ii) to compute the optimal control for growth rate/frequency modification. The method takes advantage
of spanwise periodicity to reduce computational complexity (from a 3D problem to a 2D one). The approach
is applied to the leading eigenvalue of the laminar flow around a circular cylinder. Two SP controls
are explored: wall actuation (blowing/suction) and wall deformation. Decomposing the eigenvalue
variation, we find that the 3D contribution (from the SP 1st-order flow modification) is generally
larger than the 2D one from the mean flow correction (spanwise-invariant 2nd-order flow modification).
The optimal control for stabilization is top-down symmetric, leading to varicose streaks in the
wake. Analyzing the competition between amplification and stabilization shows that optimal varicose
streaks are not significantly more amplified than sinuous ones but have a stronger stabilizing
effect. The optimal wall deformation induces a flow modification similar to that of the optimal
wall actuation. In general, spanwise and tangential actuation have a small contribution to the
optimal control, so normal-only actuation is a good trade-off between simplicity and effectiveness.
Our method opens the way to the systematic design of optimal SP control for a variety of control objectives
other than linear stability.
