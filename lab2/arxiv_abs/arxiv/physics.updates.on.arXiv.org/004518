The dielectric microsphere can be directly embedded into the traditional microscope, which can
significantly improve the resolution of the microscope and provide a simple and feasible way to
break through the diffraction limit of optical imaging system. However, due to the lack of effective
theory and formula system, the resolution limit, magnification and optimal imaging position of
the microsphere microsystem cannot be determined, which hinders its application. In this paper,
the microscopic theory of dielectric microspheres is studied systematically, and the ray optics
is extended to the imaging of dielectric microspheres, so as to establish a formula system containing
important optical parameters such as resolution, magnification and imaging position, which provides
a solid theoretical basis for further optimization of the nano-microscopic properties of dielectric
microspheres. Compared with simulation and experiment, the correctness of the formula system
is ensured. The formula shows that the mismatch between refractive index and ambient refractive
index limits the resolution of microspheres, and it is an effective method to further improve the
resolution to find the optimal refractive index ratio. In addition, the larger refractive index
of the medium microsphere and the refractive index of the environment are conducive to the enhancement
of the imaging magnification, but the working distance of the microscope objective must be taken
into account in the experiment to obtain the ideal imaging position. The theoretical system proposed
in this paper effectively explains the optical principle of dielectric microsphere imaging, gives
optimized optical parameters, and has been applied in experiments, which is of great value for the
practical application of dielectric microsphere nanometer microscopy.
