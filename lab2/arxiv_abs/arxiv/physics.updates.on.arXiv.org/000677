The scaling of plasmoid instability maximum linear growth rate with respect to Lundquist number
$S$ in a Sweet-Parker current sheet, $\gamma_{max}\sim S^{1/4}$, indicates that at high $S$, the
current sheet will break apart before it approaches the Sweet-Parker width. Therefore, a proper
description for the onset of the plasmoid instability must incorporate the evolving process of
the current sheet. We carry out a series of two-dimensional simulations and develop diagnostics
to separate fluctuations from an evolving background. It is found that the fluctuation amplitude
starts to grow only when the linear growth rate is sufficiently large ($\gamma_{max}\tau_{A}>O(1)$)
to overcome convective losses. The linear growth rate continues to rise until the sizes of plasmoids
become comparable to the inner layer width of the tearing mode. At this point the current sheet is
disrupted and the instability enters the early nonlinear regime. The growth rate suddenly decreases,
but the fluctuation amplitude continues to grow until it reaches nonlinear saturation. We identify
important time scales of the instability development, as well as scalings for the linear growth
rate, current sheet width, and dominant wavenumber at current sheet disruption. These scalings
depend on not only the Lundquist number, but also the initial noise amplitude. A phenomenological
model that reproduces scalings from simulation results is proposed. The model incorporates the
effect of reconnection outflow, which is crucial for yielding a critical Lundquist number $S_{c}$
below which disruption does not occur. The critical Lundquist number $S_{c}$ is not a constant value
but has a weak dependence on the noise amplitude.
