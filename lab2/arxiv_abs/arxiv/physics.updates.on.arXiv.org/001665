The CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET), launched for installation on the International
Space Station (ISS) in August, 2015, has been accumulating scientific data since October, 2015.
CALET is intended to perform long-duration observations of high-energy cosmic rays onboard the
ISS. CALET directly measures the cosmic-ray electron spectrum in the energy range of 1 GeV to 20 TeV
with a 2% energy resolution above 30 GeV. In addition, the instrument can measure the spectrum of
gamma rays well into the TeV range, and the spectra of protons and nuclei up to a PeV. In order to operate
the CALET onboard ISS, JAXA Ground Support Equipment (JAXA-GSE) and the Waseda CALET Operations
Center (WCOC) have been established. Scientific operations using CALET are planned at WCOC, taking
into account orbital variations of geomagnetic rigidity cutoff. Scheduled command sequences
are used to control the CALET observation modes on orbit. Calibration data acquisition by, for example,
recording pedestal and penetrating particle events, a low-energy electron trigger mode operating
at high geomagnetic latitude, a low-energy gamma-ray trigger mode operating at low geomagnetic
latitude, and an ultra heavy trigger mode, are scheduled around the ISS orbit while maintaining
maximum exposure to high-energy electrons and other high-energy shower events by always having
the high-energy trigger mode active. The WCOC also prepares and distributes CALET flight data to
collaborators in Italy and the United States. As of August 31, 2017, the total observation time is
689 days with a live time fraction of the total time of approximately 84%. Nearly 450 million events
are collected with a high-energy (E>10 GeV) trigger. By combining all operation modes with the excellent-quality
on-orbit data collected thus far, it is expected that a five-year observation period will provide
a wealth of new and interesting results.
