The expansion in multipoles of the gravitational potential of a rotating body affects the orbital
motion of a test particle orbiting it with long-term perturbations both at a classical and at a relativistic
level. In this preliminary sensitivity analysis, we show that, for the first time, the J2 c^-2 effects
could be measured by the ongoing Juno mission in the gravitational field of Jupiter during its yearlong
science phase (10 November 2016-5 October 2017) thanks to its high eccentricity (e=0.947) and to
the huge oblateness of Jupiter (J2=1.47 10^-2). The semi-major axis a and the perijove \omega\ of
Juno are expected to be shifted by \Delta a =700-900 m and \Delta\omega = 50-60 milliarcseconds,
respectively, over 1-2 yr. A numerical analysis shows also that the expected J2c^-2 range-rate
signal for Juno should be as large as 280 microns per second during a typical 6 h pass at its closest
approach. Independent analyses previously performed by other researchers about the measurability
of the Lense-Thirring effect showed that the radio science apparatus of Juno should reach an accuracy
in Doppler range-rate measurements of 1-5 microns per second over such passes. The range-rate signature
of the classical even zonal perturbations is different from the 1PN one. Thus, further investigations,
based on covariance analyses of simulated Doppler data and dedicated parameters estimation, are
worth of further consideration. It turns out that the J2 c^-2 effects cannot be responsible of the
flyby anomaly in the gravitational field of the Earth. A dedicated spacecraft in a 6678 km X 57103
km polar orbit would experience a geocentric J2 c^-2 range-rate shift of 0.4 mm s^-1.
