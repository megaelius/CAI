We present a wave-equation inversion method that inverts skeletonized data for the subsurface
velocity model. The skeletonized representation of the seismic traces consists of the low-rank
latent-space variables predicted by a well-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the
autoencoder is the recorded common shot gathers, and the implicit function theorem is used to determine
the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the velocity perturbation. The final
velocity model is the one that best predicts the observed latent-space parameters. Empirical results
suggest that the cycle-skipping problem is largely mitigated compared to the conventional full
waveform inversion (FWI) method by replacing the waveform differences by those of the latent-space
parameters. The advantage of this method over other skeletonized data methods is that no manual
picking of important features is required because the skeletal data are automatically selected
by the autoencoder. The most significant contribution of this paper is that it provides a general
framework for using solutions to the governing PDE to invert skeletal data generated by any type
of a neural network. The governing equation can be that for gravity, seismic waves, electromagnetic
fields, and magnetic fields. The input data can be the records from different types of data and their
skeletal features, as long as the model parameters are sensitive to their perturbations. The skeletal
data can be the latent space variables of an autoencoder, a variational autoencoder, or a feature
map from a convolutional neural network (CNN), or principal component analysis (PCA) features.
In other words, we have combined the best features of Newtonian physics and the pattern matching
capabilities of machine learning to invert seismic data by Newtonian machine learning.
