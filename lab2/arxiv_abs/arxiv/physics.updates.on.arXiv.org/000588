Recent progress in active-edge technology of silicon sensors enables the development of large-area
tiled silicon pixel detectors with small dead space between modules by utilizing edgeless sensors.
Such technology has been proven in successful productions of ATLAS and Medipix-based silicon pixel
sensors by a few foundries. However, the drawbacks of edgeless sensors are poor radiation hardness
for ionizing radiation and non-uniform charge collection by edge pixels. In this work, the radiation
hardness of edgeless sensors with different polarities has been investigated using Synopsys TCAD
with X-ray radiation-damage parameters implemented. Results show that if no conventional guard
ring is present, none of the current designs are able to achieve a high breakdown voltage (typically
< 30 V) after irradiation to a dose of ~10 MGy. In addition, a charge-collection model has been
developed and was used to calculate the charges collected by the edge pixels of edgeless sensors
when illuminated with X-rays. The model takes into account the electric field distribution inside
the pixel sensor, the absorption of X-rays, drift and diffusion of electrons and holes, charge sharing
effect, and threshold settings in ASICs. It is found that the non-uniform charge collection of edge
pixels is caused by the strong bending of electric field and the non-uniformity depends on bias voltage,
sensor thickness and distance from active edge to the last pixel ("edge space"). In particular,
the last few pixels close to the active edge of the sensor are not sensitive to low-energy X-rays (<
10 keV) especially for sensors with thicker Si and smaller edge space. The results from the model
calculation have been compared to measurements and good agreement was obtained. The model has been
used to optimize the edge design.
