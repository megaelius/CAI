Thin film processing by means of sputter deposition inherently depends on the interaction of energetic
particles with a target surface and the subsequent particle transport. The length and time scales
of the underlying physical phenomena span orders of magnitudes. A theoretical description which
bridges all time and length scales is not practically possible. Advantage can be taken particularly
from the well-separated time scales of the fundamental surface and plasma processes. Initially,
surface properties may be calculated from a surface model and stored for a number of representative
cases. Subsequently, the surface data may be provided to gas-phase transport simulations via appropriate
model interfaces (e.g., analytic expressions or look-up tables) and utilized to define insertion
boundary conditions. During run-time evaluation, however, the maintained surface data may prove
to be not sufficient. In this case, missing data may be obtained by interpolation (common), extrapolation
(inaccurate), or be supplied on-demand by the surface model (computationally inefficient). In
this work, a potential alternative is established based on machine learning techniques using artificial
neural networks. As a proof of concept, a multilayer perceptron network is trained and verified
with sputtered particle distributions obtained from transport of ions in matter based simulations
for Ar projectiles bombarding a Ti-Al composite. It is demonstrated that the trained network is
able to predict the sputtered particle distributions for unknown, arbitrarily shaped incident
ion energy distributions. It is consequently argued that the trained network may be readily used
as a machine learning based model interface (e.g., by quasi-continuously sampling the desired
sputtered particle distributions from the network), which is sufficiently accurate also in scenarios
which have not been previously trained.
