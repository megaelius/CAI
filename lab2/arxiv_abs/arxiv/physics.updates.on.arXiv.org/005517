Context. The spatial power spectrum of supergranulation does not fully characterize the underlying
physics of turbulent convection. For example, it does not describe the non-Gaussianity in the horizontal
flow divergence. Aims. Our aim is to statistically characterize the spatial pattern of solar supergranulation
beyond the power spectrum. The next-order statistic is the bispectrum. It measures correlations
of three Fourier components and is related to the nonlinearities in the underlying physics. Methods.
We estimated the bispectrum of supergranular horizontal surface divergence maps that were obtained
using local correlation tracking (LCT) and time-distance helioseismology (TD) from one year of
data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory starting
in May 2010. Results. We find significantly nonzero and consistent estimates for the bispectrum.
The strongest nonlinearity is present when the three coupling wave vectors are at the supergranular
scale. These are the same wave vectors that are present in regular hexagons, which were used in analytical
studies of solar convection. At these Fourier components, the bispectrum is positive, consistent
with the positive skewness in the data and with supergranules preferentially consisting of outflows
surrounded by a network of inflows. We use the bispectrum to generate synthetic divergence maps
that are very similar to the data by a model that consists of a Gaussian term and a weaker quadratic
nonlinear component. Thereby, we estimate the fraction of the variance in the divergence maps from
the nonlinear component to be of the order of 4-6%. Conclusions. We propose that bispectral analysis
is useful for understanding solar turbulent convection, for example for comparing observations
and numerical models of supergranular flows. This analysis may also be useful to generate synthetic
flow fields.
