Quantum Monte Carlo belongs to the most accurate simulation techniques for quantum many-particle
systems. However, for fermions, these simulations are hampered by the sign problem that prohibits
simulations in the regime of strong degeneracy. The situation changed with the development of configuration
path integral Monte Carlo (CPIMC) by Schoof \textit{et al.} [T. Schoof \textit{et al.}, Contrib.
Plasma Phys. \textbf{51}, 687 (2011)] that allowed for the first \textit{ab initio} simulations
for dense quantum plasmas. CPIMC also has a sign problem that occurs when the density is lowered,
i.e. in a parameter range that is complementary to traditional QMC formulated in coordinate space.
Thus, CPIMC simulations for the warm dense electron gas are limited to small values of the Brueckner
parameter -- the ratio of the interparticle distance to the Bohr radius -- $r_s=\bar{r}/a_B \lesssim
1$. In order to reach the regime of stronger coupling (lower density) with CPIMC, here we investigate
additional restrictions on the Monte Carlo procedure. In particular, we introduce two different
versions of "restricted CPIMC" where certain sign changing Monte Carlo updates are being omitted.
Interestingly, one of the methods (RCPIMC) has no sign problem at all, but it is less accurate than
RCPIMC+ which neglects only a smaller class of the Monte Carlo steps. Here we report extensive simulations
for the ferromagnetic uniform electron gas with which we investigate the properties and accuracy
of RCPIMC and RCPIMC+. Further, we establish the parameter range in the density-temperature plane
where these simulations are both feasible and accurate. The conclusion is that RCPIMC and RCPIMC+
work best at temperatures in the range of $\Theta \sim 0.1\dots 0.5$ allowing to reach density parameters
up to $r_s \sim 3\dots 5$, thereby partially filling a gap left open by existing \textit{ab initio}
QMC methods.
