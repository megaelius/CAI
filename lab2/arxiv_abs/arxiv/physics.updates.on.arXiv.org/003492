The auditory pathway is widely distributed throughout the brain, and is perhaps one of the most interesting
networks in the context of neuroplasticity. Accurate mapping of neural activity in the entire pathway,
preferably noninvasively, and with high resolution, could be instrumental for understanding
such longitudinal processes. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has clear advantages
for such characterizations, as it is noninvasive, provides relatively high spatial resolution
and lends itself for repetitive studies, albeit relying on an indirect neurovascular coupling
to deliver its information. Indeed, fMRI has been previously used to characterize the auditory
pathway in humans and in rats. In the mouse, however, the auditory pathway has insofar only been mapped
using manganese-enhanced MRI. Here, we describe a novel setup specifically designed for high-resolution
mapping of the mouse auditory pathway using high-field fMRI. Robust and consistent Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent
(BOLD) responses were documented along nearly the entire auditory pathway, from the cochlear nucleus
(CN), through the superior olivary complex (SOC), nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (LL), inferior
colliculus (IC) and the medial geniculate body (MGB). By contrast, clear BOLD responses were not
observed in auditory cortex (AC) in this study. Diverse BOLD latencies were mapped ROI- and pixel-wise
using coherence analysis, evidencing different averaged BOLD time courses in different auditory
centers. Some degree of tonotopy was identified in the IC, SOC, and MGB in the pooled dataset though
it could not be assessed per subject due to a lack of statistical power. Given the importance of the
mouse model in plasticity studies, animal models, and optogenetics, and fMRI's potential to map
dynamic responses to specific cues, this first fMRI study of the mouse auditory pathway paves the
way for future (...)
