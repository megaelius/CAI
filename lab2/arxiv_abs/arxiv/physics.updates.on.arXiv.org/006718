Patagonian fjords' area is one of the largest estuarine regions in the world. Every one of its water
bodies displays a unique hydrodynamic behavior with enormous effects on the biogeochemical characteristics
of the ecosystems. In this context, algal blooms are ecological phenomena of major relevance. Numerical
simulation has proved to be a promising tool to understand their impacts. It has not been used for
studying algal blooms in this zone. This article focuses on proposing a novel numerical model for
simulating brief algal blooms occurring in water bodies of western Patagonia. The proposed model
presents a trade-off between complexity and applicability since field-data sparsity in the zone
discourages using more sophisticated approaches. The model is based on a two-layer description
of the water column. The first layer represents the euphotic zone where an embedded biogeochemical
model of NPZD-type is used to model a mass-conserving trophic web. High intensity wind drives the
water column mixing, introducing an upward flux of nutrients that boosts high rates of primary production.
A time-dependent Gaussian pulse is used to describe this process. Mass losses due to detritus sinking
are also included. Then, the ecosystem's dynamics is represented by means of an externally forced,
non-autonomous system of ordinary differential equations which is characterized by strictly
positive trajectories but that it is not longer mass-conserving. A structure-preserving time
integrator based on a splitting-composition technique is designed for solving the system's equations.
It is cast as a three-steps algorithm and provides an exact estimations of biomass fluxes. Additionally,
a genetic algorithm-based tool is used to calibrate the model's parameters in realistic scenarios.
The proposed model is applied im a detailed study of a winter bloom in an austral fjord.
