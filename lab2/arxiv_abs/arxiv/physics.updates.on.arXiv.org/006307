Multifractal analysis (MFA) is a useful tool to systematically describe the spatial heterogeneity
of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns. One of the widely used methods for fractal
analysis is box-covering. It is known to be NP-hard. More severely, in comparison with fractal analysis
algorithms, MFA algorithms have much higher computational complexity. Among various MFA algorithms
for complex networks, the sandbox MFA algorithm behaves with the best computational efficiency.
However, the existing sandbox algorithm is still computationally expensive. It becomes challenging
to implement the MFA for large-scale networks with tens of millions of nodes. It is also not clear
whether or not MFA results can be improved by a largely increased size of a theoretical network. To
tackle these challenges, a computationally-efficient sandbox algorithm (CESA) is presented
in this paper for MFA of large-scale networks. Our CESA employs the breadth-first search (BFS) technique
to directly search the neighbor nodes of each layer of center nodes, and then to retrieve the required
information. Our CESA's input is a sparse data structure derived from the compressed sparse row
(CSR) format designed for compressed storage of the adjacency matrix of large-scale network. A
theoretical analysis reveals that the CESA reduces the time complexity of the existing sandbox
algorithm from cubic to quadratic, and also improves the space complexity from quadratic to linear.
MFA experiments are performed for typical complex networks to verify our CESA. Finally, our CESA
is applied to a few typical real-world networks of large scale.
