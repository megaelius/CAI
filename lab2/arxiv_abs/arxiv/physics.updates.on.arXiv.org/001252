As the increasing complexity of large-scale research requires the combined efforts of scientists
with expertise in different fields, the advantages and costs of interdisciplinary scholarship
have taken center stage in current debates on scientific production. Here we conduct a comparative
assessment of the scientific success of specialized and interdisciplinary researchers in modern
science. Drawing on comprehensive data sets on scientific production, we propose a two-pronged
approach to interdisciplinarity. For each scientist, we distinguish between background interdisciplinarity,
rooted in knowledge accumulated over time, and social interdisciplinarity, stemming from exposure
to collaborators' knowledge. We find that, while abandoning specialization in favor of moderate
degrees of background interdisciplinarity deteriorates performance, very interdisciplinary
scientists outperform specialized ones, at all career stages. Moreover, successful scientists
tend to intensify the heterogeneity of collaborators and to match the diversity of their network
with the diversity of their background. Collaboration sustains performance by facilitating knowledge
diffusion, acquisition and creation. Successful scientists tend to absorb a larger fraction of
their collaborators' knowledge, and at a faster pace, than less successful ones. Collaboration
also provides successful scientists with opportunities for the cross-fertilization of ideas
and the synergistic creation of new knowledge. These results can inspire scientists to shape successful
careers, research institutions to develop effective recruitment policies, and funding agencies
to award grants of enhanced impact.
