Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) simulations with turbulence closure models continue
to play important roles in industrial flow simulations. However, the commonly used linear eddy
viscosity models are intrinsically unable to handle flows with non-equilibrium turbulence. Reynolds
stress models, on the other hand, are plagued by their lack of robustness. Recent studies in plane
channel flows found that even substituting Reynolds stresses with errors below 0.5% from direct
numerical simulation (DNS) databases into RANS equations leads to velocities with large errors
(up to 35%). While such an observation may have only marginal relevance to traditional Reynolds
stress models, it is disturbing for the recently emerging data-driven models that treat the Reynolds
stress as an explicit source term in the RANS equations, as it suggests that the RANS equations with
such models can be ill-conditioned. So far, a rigorous analysis of the condition of such models is
still lacking. As such, in this work we propose a metric based on local condition number function
for a priori evaluation of the conditioning of the RANS equations. We further show that the ill-conditioning
cannot be explained by the global matrix condition number of the discretized RANS equations. Comprehensive
numerical tests are performed on turbulent channel flows at various Reynolds numbers and additionally
on two complex flows, i.e., flow over periodic hills and flow in a square duct. Results suggest that
the proposed metric can adequately explain observations in previous studies, i.e., deteriorated
model conditioning with increasing Reynolds number and better conditioning of the implicit treatment
of Reynolds stress compared to the explicit treatment. This metric can play critical roles in the
future development of data-driven turbulence models by enforcing the conditioning as a requirement
on these models.
