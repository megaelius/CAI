This work focuses on the dissolution of a train of unconfined bubbles in cylindrical microchannels.
We investigate how the mass transfer is affected by the channel and bubble sizes, distance between
bubbles, diffusivity, superficial velocity, deformation of the bubble, the presence of surfactants
in the limit of rigid interface and off-centred positions of the bubbles. We analyse the influence
of the dimensionless numbers and especially the distance between bubbles and the P\'eclet number,
Pe, which we vary among eight decades and identify five different dissolution regimes. We show different
concentration patterns and the dependence of the Sherwood numbers, Sh. These regimes can be classified
by either the importance of the streamline diffusion or by the interaction between bubbles. For
small Pe the streamline diffusion is not negligible as compared to convection whereas for large
Pe, convection dominates in the streamline direction and, thus, crosswind diffusion becomes crucial
in governing the dissolution through boundary layers or of the remaining wake behind the bubbles.
Bubbles interaction takes place for very small Pe for which the dissolution is purely diffusive
or for very large Pe numbers in which case long wakes eventually reach the following bubble. We also
observe that the bubble deformability mainly affects the Sh in the regime for very large Pe in which
bubbles interaction matters, and also that the rigid interface effect affects the boundary layer
and the remaining wake. The effect of off-centred position of the bubble, determined by the transverse
force balance, is also limited to large Pe. The boundary layers in rigid bubble surfaces are thicker
as compared to those on stress-free bubble surface and, thus, the dissolution is smaller. For centred
bubbles, the influence of inertia on the dissolution is negligible. Finally, we discuss underlying
hypothesis of the model.
