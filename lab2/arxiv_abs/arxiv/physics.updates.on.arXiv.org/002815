The signal in an incoherent imaging system gets transferred worse towards higher spatial frequencies.
Since the photon noise is distributed equally in Fourier space, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
decreases, and therefore represents a fundamental limit in the field of imaging. Our work aims to
go beyond this given SNR-limit, which is directly connected to circumvent Fermats principle (1662).
The proposed technique only makes use of a single acquisition process. To our knowledge this hasnt
been done before and might have far-reaching impact on a large number of applications ranging from
bio-imaging to industrial inspection. Especially in the case of limited photon numbers, e.g. fluorescent
emission or a minimum available detector exposure time (temporal resolution), our method represents
a new way to improve on SNR, which has been missing so far. We propose a novel and fundamentally new
concept, by splitting the pupil of an imaging system into two parts to simultaneously obtain sub-images
via each of these sub-pupils. Since the noise variance is proportional to the number of detected
photons, it has been reduced in each of the sub-images. Recombining them by weighted averaging in
Fourier-space yields an enhancement in (Fourier-) SNR compared to conventional imaging, enabling
us to break the aforementioned SNR-limit. This results in an increased effective resolution limit
in real space, which is used as an indicator throughout this work. We show a proof-of-concept experiment,
in which we split the pupil by displaying orthogonally oriented blazed phase gratings for the different
sub-pupils on a phase-only spatial light modulator. Our experiment confirms the improvement in
effective resolution and therefore shows that we have overcome the fundamental SNR-limit, by only
manipulating the captured light distribution in the pupil plane.
