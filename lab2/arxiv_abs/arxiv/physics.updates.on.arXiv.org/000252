In this paper, a novel approach for resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski debate is proposed, in which
the principle of relativity is used to uniquely determine the light momentum formulation for a plane
wave in a moving non-dispersive lossless isotropic uniform medium. It is shown by analysis of the
plane-wave solution that, (1) there may be a pseudo-power flow when a medium moves, and the Poynting
vector does not necessarily denote the direction of real power flowing, (2) Minkowski's light momentum
and energy constitute a Lorentz four-vector in a form of single photon or single EM-field cell, and
Planck constant is a Lorentz invariant, (3) there is no momentum transfer taking place between the
plane wave and the uniform medium, and the EM momentum conservation equation cannot be uniquely
determined without resort to the principle of relativity, and (4) the moving medium behaves as a
so-called "negative index medium" when it moves opposite to the wave vector at a faster-than-dielectric
light speed. It is also shown by analysis of EM-field Lorentz transformations that, when a static
electric (magnetic) field moves in free space, neither Abraham's nor Minkowski's formulation
can correctly describe a real electromagnetic momentum; as an application of this principle, the
classical electron mass-energy paradox is analyzed and resolved. Finally, a general EM momentum
definition is proposed, and according to this new definition, the traditional "Abraham-type"
and "Minkowski-type" momentums in the dispersion wave-guiding systems, such as regular dielectric-filled
metallic waveguides, are found to be included in the same momentum formulation, but they appear
at different frequencies.
