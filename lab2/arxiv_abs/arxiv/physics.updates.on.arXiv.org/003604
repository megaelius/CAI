Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have been applied very successfully to ground state properties
but still remain generally less effective than other non-stochastic methods for electronically
excited states. Nonetheless, we have recently reported accurate excitation energies for small
organic molecules at the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) within a Jastrow-free QMC protocol
relying on a deterministic and systematic construction of nodal surfaces using the selected configuration
interaction (sCI) algorithm known as CIPSI (Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection
made Iteratively). Albeit highly accurate, these all-electron calculations are computationally
expensive due to the presence of core electrons. One very popular approach to remove these chemically-inert
electrons from the QMC simulation is to introduce pseudopotentials (also known as effective core
potentials). However, such an approach inevitably introduces a bias due to the approximate nature
of these pseudopotentials. Furthermore, an additional bias may be introduced in DMC due to the localization
of nonlocal pseudopotentials. Taking the water molecule as an example, we investigate the influence
of Burkatzki-Filippi-Dolg (BFD) pseudopotentials on vertical excitation energies obtained
with sCI and FN-DMC methods. Although these pseudopotentials are known to be relatively safe for
ground state properties, we evidence that special care is required if one strives for highly accurate
vertical transition energies. Indeed, comparing all-electron and valence-only calculations,
we show that the approximate nature of the pseudopotentials can induce errors as large as 0.1 eV on
the excitation energies. While acceptable for most chemical applications, it might become unacceptable
for benchmark studies.
