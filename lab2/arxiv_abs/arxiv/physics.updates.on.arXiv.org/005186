We first present the salient features of the gravitational time dilation and redshift effects in
two ways; by considering the oscillation frequencies/rates of clocks at different heights/potentials
and by considering the photons emitted by these clocks such as atoms/nuclei. We then point out to
the extension of these gravitational effects to static electricity along with two experiments
performed in the '30s with null results of the electrostatic redshift. We show that the absence of
this redshift is a consequence of the conservation of electric charge. We discuss the electrical
time dilation and redshift effects in detail and argue that the electrostatic time dilation in an
electric field must be a fact of Nature. We then present a general relativistic scheme that explains
this effect. We also introduce an electrical equivalence principle analogous to the gravitational
one and demonstrate how to obtain the electrostatic time dilation by this principle. We emphasize
the importance of ionic atomic clocks to measure this effect whose confirmation would support the
general relativistic scheme presented. We finally go over an attempt in the literature to explain
the impossibility of the experimental observation of the electrostatic redshift due to its smallness
by employing the Reissner - Nordstr\"om metric in general relativity. We argue that the $Q^{\,2}$
- term in this metric is due to the minuscule contribution of the energy of the electric field of the
central body to its gravitational field. Thus being gravitational, this metric cannot be used to
calculate the amount of the alleged electrostatic redshift.
