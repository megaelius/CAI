The use of Large Eddy Simulations in compressible, turbulent MHD is often limited to the implementation
of purely dissipative sub-grid scale models. While such models work well in the hydrodynamic case
due to the universality of the spectrum, they do not fully describe the complex dynamics of MHD, where
the transfer of energy between internal, kinetic and magnetic energies at small scales are less
trivial. For this reason, a sub-grid scale model based on the gradients of the fields entering in
each non-linear term of the equations has already been proposed and studied in the literature, for
the momentum and induction equations. Here, we consider the full set of compressible, ideal MHD
equations, with an ideal gas equation of state, and we proposed a generalization of the gradient
model, including the energy equation. We focus on the residuals coming from the whole set of equations,
by filtering accurate high-resolution simulations of the turbulent Newtonian Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability in a periodic box. We employ the same high-resolution shock capturing methods typically
used in relativistic MHD, applicable in particular to neutron star mergers. The a-priori test,
i.e. the fit between the sub-filter residuals and the model, allows us to confirm that the gradient
model outperforms any other, in terms of accuracy of the fit and small deviations of the best-fit
pre-coefficient from the expected value. Such results are validated for 2D and 3D, for a range of
different problems, and are shown, for the first time, to hold also for the energy evolution equation.
This paper is the first step, based on a solid theoretical and numerical basis, towards the near-future
extension of the sub-grid scale gradient model to the relativistic MHD, and a future implementation
in a full General Relativity LES.
