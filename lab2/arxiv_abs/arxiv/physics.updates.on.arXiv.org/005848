This report summarizes the major progresses to develop the dynamic core for next-generation atmospherical
model for both numerical weather prediction and climate simulation. The numerical framework is
based on a general formulation, so-called multi-moment constrained finite volume (MCV) method,
which is well-balanced among solution quality (accuracy and robustness), algorithmic simplicity,
computational efficiency and flexibility for model configuration. A local high-order limiting
projection is also devised to remove spurious oscillations and noises in numerical solutions,
which allows the numerical model working well alone without artificial diffusion or filter. The
resulted numerical schemes are very simple, efficient and easy to implement for both structured
and unstructured grids, which provide a promising plateform of great practical significance.
We have implemented the MCV method to shallow water equations on various spherical grids, including
Yin-Yang overset grid, cubed sphere grid and geodesic icosahedral grid, non-hydrostatic compressible
atmosherical model under complex topographic boundary conditions. In addition, the moist dynamics
simulation like moist thermal bubble has been validated by using direct microphysical feedback.
We have also constructed a prototype of 3D global non-hydrostatic compressible atmosherical model
on cubed sphere grid with an explicit/implicit-hybrid time integration scheme, which can be used
as the base to develop global atmospheric GCM. All the MCV models have been verified with widely used
benchmark tests. The numerical results show that the present MCV models have solution quality competitive
to other exiting high order models. Parallelization of the MCV shallow water model on cubed sphere
grid reveals its suitability for large scale parallel processing with desirable scalability.
