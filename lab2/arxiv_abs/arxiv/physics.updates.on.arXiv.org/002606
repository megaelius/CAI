We here calculate the series expansion of the T-matrix for a spheroidal particle in the small-size/long-wavelength
limit, up to third lowest order with respect to the size parameter, X, which we will define rigorously
for a non-spherical particle. T is calculated from the standard extended boundary condition method
with a linear system involving two infinite matrices P and Q, whose matrix elements are integrals
on the particle surface. We show that the limiting form of the P- and Q-matrices, which is different
in the special case of spheroid, ensures that this Taylor expansion can be obtained by considering
only multipoles of order 3 or less (i.e. dipoles, quadrupoles, and octupoles). This allows us to
obtain self-contained expressions for the Taylor expansion of T(X). The lowest order is O(X^3)
and equivalent to the quasi-static limit or Rayleigh approximation. Expressions to order O(X^5)
are obtained by Taylor expansion of the integrals in P and Q followed by matrix inversion. We then
apply a radiative correction scheme, which makes the resulting expressions valid up to order O(X^6).
Orientation-averaged extinction, scattering, and absorption cross-sections are then derived.
All results are compared to the exact T-matrix predictions to confirm the validity of our expressions
and assess their range of applicability. For a wavelength of 400nm, the new approximation remains
valid (within 1% error) up to particle dimensions of the order of 100-200nm depending on the exact
parameters (aspect ratio and material). These results provide a relatively simple and computationally-friendly
alternative to the standard T-matrix method for spheroidal particles smaller than the wavelength,
in a size range much larger than for the commonly-used Rayleigh approximation.
