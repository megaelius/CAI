This paper analyses in detail the dynamics in a neighbourhood of a G\'enot-Brogliato point, colloquially
termed the G-spot, which physically represents so-called dynamic jam in rigid body mechanics with
unilateral contact and Coulomb friction. Such singular points arise in planar rigid body problems
with slipping point contacts at the intersection between the conditions for onset of lift-off and
for the Painlev\'e paradox. The G-spot can be approached in finite time by an open set of initial conditions
in a general class of problems. The key question addressed is what happens next. In principle trajectories
could, at least instantaneously, lift off, continue in slip, or undergo a so-called impact without
collision. Such impacts are non-local in momentum space and depend on properties evaluated away
from the G-spot. The results are illustrated on a particular physical example, namely the a frictional
impact oscillator first studied by Leine et al. The answer is obtained via an analysis that involves
a consistent contact regularisation with a stiffness proportional to $1/\varepsilon^2$. Taking
a singular limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$, one finds an inner and an outer asymptotic zone in the neighbourhood
of the G-spot. Two distinct cases are found according to whether the contact force becomes infinite
or remains finite as the G-spot is approached. In the former case it is argued that there can be no such
canards and so an impact without collision must occur. In the latter case, the canard trajectory
acts as a dividing surface between trajectories that momentarily lift off and those that do not before
taking the impact. The orientation of the initial condition set leading to each eventuality is shown
to change each time a certain positive parameter $\beta$ passes through an integer.
