The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urgently
calls for the design of drugs directed against this new virus. Given its essential role in proteolytic
processing, the main protease Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against
SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies have identified
a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one),
a glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly attractive. Recent
experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than that of other molecules that also act
at the enzyme catalytic site. By relying on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this
study we examine at a molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity.
Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the catalytic site cavity of
Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen
in the dimerization region localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed analysis
of the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this second binding site is
in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic site. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen
bound between the II-III domains exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic
site access through surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and reconfiguration
of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could interfere with normal enzymatic
function. Taken together, these findings provide a framework for the future design of more potent
and specific Mpro inhibitors, based on the Ebselen scaffold, that could lead to new therapeutic
strategies for COVID-19.
