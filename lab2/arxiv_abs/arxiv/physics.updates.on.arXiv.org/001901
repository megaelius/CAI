We study the relationship between the El Ni\~no--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian summer
monsoon in ensemble simulations from state-of-the-art climate models, the Max Planck Institute
Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) and the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We consider two simple
variables: the Tahiti--Darwin sea-level pressure difference and the Northern Indian precipitation.
We utilize ensembles converged to the snapshot attractor of the system for analyzing possible changes
(i) in the teleconnection between the fluctuations of the two variables, and (ii) in their climatic
means. (i) With very high confidence, we detect an increase in the strength of the teleconnection
in the MPI-ESM under historical forcing between 1890 and 2005, which is in contrast with scientific
consensus. In the MPI-ESM no similar increase is present between 2006 and 2099 under the Representative
Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5), and in a 110-year-long 1-percent pure CO2 scenario; neither
is in the CESM between 1960 and 2100 with historical forcing and RCP8.5. The static susceptibility
of the strength of the teleconnection with respect to radiative forcing (assuming an instantaneous
and linear response) is at least three times larger in the historical MPI-ESM ensemble than in the
others. (ii) In the other ensembles, the climatic mean is strongly displaced in the phase space projection
spanned by the two variables. This displacement is nevertheless linear. However, the slope exhibits
a strong seasonality, falsifying a hypothesis of a universal relation, an emergent constraint,
that would be valid at all time scales between these two climatic means.
