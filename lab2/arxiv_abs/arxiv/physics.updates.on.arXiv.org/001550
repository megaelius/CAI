Interplate megathrust earthquakes have inflicted catastrophic damage on human society. An extremely
hazardous megathrust earthquake is predicted to occur along the Nankai Trough off southwestern
Japan, an economically active and densely populated area with historical records of megathrust
earthquakes. Megathrust earthquakes are the result of a plate subduction mechanism and occur at
interplate slip-deficit (or coupling) regions. Many past studies have attempted to capture slip-deficit
rate (SDR) distributions for assessing future earthquake disasters. However, they could not capture
a total view of the megathrust earthquake source region because they had no seafloor geodetic data.
The Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of the Japan Coast Guard (JHOD) has been developing
a highly precise and sustainable seafloor geodetic observation network deployed in this subduction
zone to broadly obtain direct information related to offshore SDR. Here, we present seafloor geodetic
observation data and an offshore interplate SDR distribution model. Our data suggests that most
offshore regions in this subduction zone have positive SDRs. Specifically, our observations indicate
previously unknown high-SDR regions that are important for tsunami disaster mitigation and low-SDR
regions that are consistent with distributions of shallow slow earthquakes and subducting seamounts.
This is the first direct evidence suggesting that coupling conditions are related to these seismological
and geological phenomena. These observations provide new fundamental information for inferring
megathrust earthquake scenarios and interpreting research on the Nankai Trough subduction zone.
