The Maxey-Riley equation has been extensively used by the fluid dynamics community to study the
dynamics of small inertial particles in fluid flow. However, most often, the Basset history force
in this equation is neglected. Including the Basset force in numerical solutions of particulate
flows involves storage requirements which rapidly increase in time. Thus the significance of the
Basset history force in the dynamics has not been understood. In this paper, we show that the Maxey-Riley
equation in its entirety can be exactly mapped as a forced, time-dependent Robin boundary condition
of the one-dimensional heat equation, and solved using the Unified Transform Method. We obtain
the exact solution for a general homogeneous time-dependent flow field, and apply it to a range of
physically relevant situations. In a particle coming to a halt in a quiescent environment, the Basset
history force speeds up the decay as stretched-exponential at short time while slowing it down to
a power-law relaxation, $\sim t^{-3/2}$, at long time. A particle settling under gravity is shown
to relax even more slowly to its terminal velocity ($\sim t^{-1/2}$), whereas this relaxation would
be expected to take place exponentially fast if the history term were to be neglected. For a general
flow, our approach makes possible a numerical scheme for arbitrary but smooth flows without increasing
memory demands and with spectral accuracy. We use our numerical scheme to solve an example spatially
varying flow of inertial particles in the vicinity of a point vortex. We show that the critical radius
for caustics formation shrinks slightly due to history effects. Our scheme opens up a method for
future studies to include the Basset history term in their calculations to spectral accuracy, without
astronomical storage costs. Moreover our results indicate that the Basset history can affect dynamics
significantly.
