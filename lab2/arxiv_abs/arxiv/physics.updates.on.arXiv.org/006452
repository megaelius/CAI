While vehicular sensor networks (VSNs) have earned the stature of a mobile sensing paradigm utilizing
sensors built into cars, they have limited sensing scopes since car drivers only opportunistically
discover new events. Conversely, social sensing is emerging as a new sensing paradigm where measurements
about the physical world are collected from humans. In contrast to VSNs, social sensing is more pervasive,
but one of its key limitations lies in its inconsistent reliability stemming from the data contributed
by unreliable human sensors. In this paper, we present DASC, a road Damage-Aware Social-media-driven
Car sensing framework that exploits the collective power of social sensing and VSNs for reliable
disaster response applications. However, integrating VSNs with social sensing introduces a new
set of challenges: i) How to leverage noisy and unreliable social signals to route the vehicles to
accurate regions of interest? ii) How to tackle the inconsistent availability (e.g., churns) caused
by car drivers being rational actors? iii) How to efficiently guide the cars to the event locations
with little prior knowledge of the road damage caused by the disaster, while also handling the dynamics
of the physical world and social media? The DASC framework addresses the above challenges by establishing
a novel hybrid social-car sensing system that employs techniques from game theory, feedback control,
and Markov Decision Process (MDP). In particular, DASC distills signals emitted from social media
and discovers the road damages to effectively drive cars to target areas for verifying emergency
events. We implement and evaluate DASC in a reputed vehicle simulator that can emulate real-world
disaster response scenarios. The results of a real-world application demonstrate the superiority
of DASC over current VSNs-based solutions in detection accuracy and efficiency.
