Dynamic wind loads acting on structures by definition are statistically correlated both in space
and time. However, conventional approaches for the analysis of distributed aerodynamic loads,
such as the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), can only present relevant spatial pattern that
is encapsulated in a set of coherent structures. In this regard, this paper provides an operator-theoretic
approach that describes a nonlinear/chaotic dynamical system in a functional space rather than
the conventional phase space via the introduction of the Koopman operator. Subsequently, spectral
analysis of the Koopman operator provides a spatial-temporal characterization of the time-dependent
wind loads. We proposed an augmented dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method to obtain the spectral
decomposition results. Specifically, the proposed DMD algorithm is augmented by means of the delay
coordinate embedding, and the identified eigen-tuples (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and time
evolution) can not only capture dominant spatial structures but also isolate each structure with
a specific frequency and a corresponding growth/decay rate. To demonstrate the unique feature
of this approach, we consider learning the evolution dynamics of the random wind pressure field
over a scaled model of a finite height prism representing a tall building using limited wind tunnel
data. POD analysis of the experimental data is also carried out. We systematically examine the DMD/POD
learning results from aspects of algorithm convergence, data sufficiency, and modal analysis,
highlighting their specialties and physical interpretations. The ensuing results from the learning
process indicate that the proposed method can accurately identify a wide range of dynamical mechanisms,
which are closely associated with physical phenomena.
