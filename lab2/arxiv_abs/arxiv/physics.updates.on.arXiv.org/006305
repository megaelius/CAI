The effective performance of arterial corridors is essential to community safety and vitality.
Managing this performance, considering the dynamic nature of demand requires updating traffic
signal timings through various strategies. Agency resources for these activities are commonly
scarce and are primarily by public complaints. This paper provides a data-driven prioritization
approach for traffic signal re-timing on a corridor. In order to remove any dependence on available
detection, probe-based data are used for assessing the performance measures. Probe-based data
are derived from in-vehicle global positioning system observations, eliminating the need for
installing on-field traffic infrastructure. The paper provides a workflow to measure and compare
different segments on arterial corridors in terms of probe-based signal performance measures
that capture different aspects of signal operations. The proposed method can serve as a tool to guide
agencies looking to alter their signal control. The methodology identifies a group of dynamic days
followed by evaluation of travel rate based upon non-dynamic days. Dynamic days represent the variability
of traffic on a segment. Performance measures on non-dynamic days include Median Travel Rate, Within-Day
Variability of travel rate, between-days variability of travel rate Minimum Travel Rate Dispersion,
and two variables which include Overall Travel Rate Variabilities. Consequently, a corridor having
high number of dynamic segments along with poor performance during normal days would be a candidate
for adaptive control. A case study was conducted on 11 corridors within Des Moines, Iowa where Merle
Hay Road and University Avenue were identified suitable for adaptive control.
