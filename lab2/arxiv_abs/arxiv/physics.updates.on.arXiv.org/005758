For long it has been known that specific patterns of folding are necessary for an optimally functioning
brain. For instance, lissencephaly and polymicrogyria can lead to severe mental retardation,
short life expectancy, epileptic seizures, and tetraplegia. The construction of a quantitative
model on how and why these folds appear is the first step in understanding the cause of these conditions.
In recent years, there have been various attempts to understand and model the mechanisms of brain
folding. Previous works have shown that mechanical instabilities play a crucial role in the formation
of brain folds, and that the geometry of the fetal brain is one of the main factors in dictating the
folding characteristics. However, modeling higher-order folding, one of the main characteristics
of the human brain, has not been fully tackled. The effects of thickness inhomogeneity in the gyrogenesis
of the mammalian brain are studied through finite-element simulations of rectangular slabs. The
slabs are divided into two distinct regions, where the outer layer mimics the gray matter, and the
inner layer the underlying white matter. Differential growth is introduced by only growing the
top layer. The brain tissue is modeled as a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material. Simulations are
performed with both, homogeneous and inhomogeneous cortical thickness. The homogeneous cortex
is shown to fold into a single wavelength, as common for bilayered materials, while the inhomogeneous
cortex folds into more complex conformations: In their early stages of development, structures
reminiscent of the deep sulci in the brain are obtained. As the cortex continues to develop, secondary
undulations, which are shallower and more variable than the structures obtained in earlier gyrification
stage emerge, reproducing well-known characteristics of higher-order folding in the mammalian,
and particularly the human, brain.
