In D(L)akota star knowledge, the Sun is known as Wi and the Moon is Han-Wi. They have an important relationship,
husband and wife. The pattern of their ever-changing relationship is mirrored in the motions of
Sun and Moon as seen from our backyards, also called the lunar phases. The framework of the cultural
teaching is storytelling and relationships. Cultural perspectives in astronomy such as this remind
us of how indigenous ways of knowing are rooted in inclusion, engagement, and relevancy. Designed
by A. Lee in 2007, the Native Skywatchers initiative seeks to remember and revitalize indigenous
star and earth knowledge, promoting the native voice as the lead voice. The overarching goal of Native
Skywatchers is to communicate the knowledge that indigenous people traditionally practiced a
sustainable way of living and sustainable engineering through a living and participatory relationship
with the above and below, sky and earth. In 2012 two indigenous star maps were created: the Ojibwe
Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan-Ojibwe Sky Star Map (A. Lee, W. Wilson, C. Gawboy), and the D(L)akota
star map, Makoce Wicanhpi Wowapi (A. Lee, J. Rock). In 2016, a collaboration with W. Buck of the Manitoba
First Nations Resource Centre (MFNRC), produced a third star map: Ininew Achakos Masinikan-Cree
Star Map Book. We aim to improve current inequities in education for native young people especially
through STEM engagement, to inspire increased cultural pride, and promote community wellness.
Presented here will be recently created resources such as: astronomical calendar-paintings and
short videos that exist at the intersection of art-science-culture. As we look for sustainable
ways to widen participation in STEM, particularly in astronomy education, part of the conversation
needs to consider the place for art and culture in STEM.
