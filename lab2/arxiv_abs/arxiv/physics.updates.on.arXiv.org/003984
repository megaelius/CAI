Conservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature. It has broad application in many
fields including physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering. Solving the differential
equations associated with conservation laws is a major branch in computational mathematics. Recent
success of machine learning, especially deep learning, in areas such as computer vision and natural
language processing, has attracted a lot of attention from the community of computational mathematics
and inspired many intriguing works in combining machine learning with traditional methods. In
this paper, we are the first to explore the possibility and benefit of solving nonlinear conservation
laws using deep reinforcement learning. As a proof of concept, we focus on 1-dimensional scalar
conservation laws. We deploy the machinery of deep reinforcement learning to train a policy network
that can decide on how the numerical solutions should be approximated in a sequential and spatial-temporal
adaptive manner. We will show that the problem of solving conservation laws can be naturally viewed
as a sequential decision making process and the numerical schemes learned in such a way can easily
enforce long-term accuracy. Furthermore, the learned policy network can determine a good local
discrete approximation based on the current state of the solution, which essentially makes the
proposed method a meta-learning approach. In other words, the proposed method is capable of learning
how to discretize for a given situation mimicking human experts. Finally, we will provide details
on how the policy network is trained, how well it performs compared with some state-of-the-art numerical
solvers such as WENO schemes, and how well it generalizes.
