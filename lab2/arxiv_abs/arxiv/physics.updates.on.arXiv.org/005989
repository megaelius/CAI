We report on the experimental study made on a successive prototype of High-Voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS)
ATLASPix2 sensor for the tracking detector application, developed with 180 nm feature size. These
sensors are to qualify mainly the peripheral data processing blocks (e.g. Command Decoder, Trigger
Buffer, etc.). It is a smaller version of 24 X 36 pixelated sensor in comparison to the earlier generation
of ATLASPix1 fabricated in both ams AG, Austria, and TSI Semiconductors, USA. While ams produced
ATLASPix2 showed breakdown voltage 50 V in nonirradiated condition as it was seen on its predecessors
ATLASpix1, TSI produced prototypes reported breakdown voltage greater than 100 V. The chosen wafer
of MCz 20 Ohm.cm P-type substrate resistivity can deplete a few tenths of um, where the process-driven
surface damage can have a greater impact on device operating conditions before and after irradiation.
In an aim to understand device intrinsic performance at the irradiated case, a dedicated neutron
irradiation campaign has been made at JSI for different fluences. Characterizations have been
performed at different temperatures after irradiation to analyze the leakage current and breakdown
voltage before and after irradiation. TSI prototypes showed a breakdown voltage decrease 90 V due
to impact ionization and enhanced effective doping concentration. Results demonstrated for the
neutron-irradiated devices up to the fluence of 2 X 10^15 neq/cm2 can still safely be operated at
a voltage high enough to allow for high efficiency. Accelerated Annealing steps also made on selective
irradiated ATLASPix2 samples, equivalent to more than two years of room-temperature annealing
(at 20 degC), and they showed the reassuring expected breakdown voltage increase and damage constant
rate alpha^* (geometry dependent) decrease, driven by the beneficial annealing.
