In this paper we investigate, using theory and Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), the Forward
In Time (FIT) and Backward In Time (BIT) Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of the separation
of inertial particle-pairs in isotropic turbulence. In agreement with our earlier study (Bragg
et al., Phys. Fluids 28, 013305 (2016)), where we compared the FIT and BIT mean-square separations,
we find that inertial particles separate much faster BIT than FIT, with the strength of the irreversibility
depending upon the final/initial separation of the particle-pair and their Stokes number $St$.
However, we also find that the irreversibility shows up in subtle ways in the behavior of the full
PDF that it does not in the mean-square separation. In the theory, we derive new predictions, including
a prediction for the BIT/FIT PDF for ${St\geq O(1)}$, and for final/initial separations in the dissipation
regime. The prediction shows how caustics in the particle relative velocities in the dissipation
range affect the scaling of the pair-separation PDF, leading to a PDF with an algebraically decaying
tail. The predicted functional behavior of the PDFs is universal, in that it does not depend upon
the level of intermittency in the underlying turbulence. We also analyze the pair-separation PDFs
for fluid particles at short-times, and construct theoretical predictions using the multifractal
formalism to describe the fluid relative velocity distributions. The theoretical and numerical
results both suggest that the extreme events in the inertial particle-pair dispersion at the small-scales
are dominated by their non-local interaction with the turbulent velocity field, rather than due
to the strong dissipation range intermittency of the turbulence itself...
