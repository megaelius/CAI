The shadow is a separated feature in the satellite images specially high resolution images. It may
be looked as a problem when it causes a loss in the ground ray response to the shaded area, and may be,
from other view, considered as an indication to the height of the bodies or buildings, when it hidden
due to top view of the satellite image usually. The location of the object on the earth affects its
shadow length, direction and darkness. The ostensible sun path in the sky also affects the shadow
length and direction, it is depending on the change of the rotation axis of planet about its center
during the year. And it is clear that the shadow is changing with the sun transmission in the day times.
The sun location needs complex equations, because there are several angles describing its location
with taking into consideration the location of the shaded body on the earth spatially the latitude,
and the shadow direction and length depend on the sun location so it need more equations. Some engineering
purposes, and some engineers and designer can not process these complex astronomy equations every
time they need to calculate the shadow effect on the urban region or garden for examples, or other
architectural purposes, it is unpractical process to estimate the shadow direction and length
for civil from these equation. So, we derived in this study a high accurate empirical Gaussian equation
to find shadow length percent in the limits of the study area depends on single parameter which is
the number of day during the year, and calculating the percent of shadow, so we can calculate the shadow
length percent accurately in any day number by the suggested equation after knowing the real building
height.
