In a social network the individuals or nodes connect to other nodes by choosing one of the channels
of communication at a time to re-establish the existing social links. Since information for research
is usually restricted to a limited number of channels or layers, these autonomous decision making
processes by the nodes constitute the sampling of a multiplex network leading to just one (though
very important) example of sampling bias caused by the behavior of the nodes. We develop a general
setting to get insight and understand the class of network sampling models, where the probability
of sampling a link in the original network depends on the attributes $h$ of its adjacent nodes. Assuming
that the nodal attributes are independently drawn from an arbitrary distribution $\rho(h)$ and
that the sampling probability $r(h_i , h_j)$ for a link $ij$ of nodal attributes $h_i$ and $h_j$ is
also arbitrary, we are able to derive exact analytic expressions of the sampled network for such
network characteristics as the degree distribution, degree correlation, and clustering spectrum.
The properties of the sampled network turn out to be sums of quantities for the original network topology
weighted by the factors stemming from the sampling. Based on our analysis, we find that the sampled
network may have sampling-induced network properties that are absent in the original network,
which implies the potential risk of a naive generalization of the results of the sample to the entire
original network. We also consider the case, when neighboring nodes have correlated attributes
to show how to generalize our formalism for such sampling bias and we get good agreement between the
analytic results and the numerical simulations.
