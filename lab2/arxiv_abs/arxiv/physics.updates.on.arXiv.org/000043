We apply adjoint-based sensitivity analysis to a time-delayed thermo-acoustic system: a Rijke
tube containing a hot wire. We calculate how the growth rate and frequency of small oscillations
about a base state are affected either by a generic passive control element in the system (the structural
sensitivity analysis) or by a generic change to its base state (the base-state sensitivity analysis).
We illustrate the structural sensitivity by calculating the effect of a second hot wire with a small
heat release parameter. In a single calculation, this shows how the second hot wire changes the growth
rate and frequency of the small oscillations, as a function of its position in the tube. We then examine
the components of the structural sensitivity in order to determine the passive control mechanism
that has the strongest influence on the growth rate. We find that a force applied to the acoustic momentum
equation in the opposite direction to the instantaneous velocity is the most stabilizing feedback
mechanism. We also find that its effect is maximized when it is placed at the downstream end of the
tube. This feedback mechanism could be supplied, for example, by an adiabatic mesh. We illustrate
the base-state sensitivity by calculating the effects of small variations in the damping factor,
the heat-release time-delay coefficient, the heat-release parameter, and the hot wire location.
The successful application of sensitivity analysis to thermo-acoustics opens up new possibilities
for the passive control of thermo-acoustic oscillations by providing gradient information that
can be combined with constrained optimization algorithms in order to reduce linear growth rates.
