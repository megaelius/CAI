In this work a weak-turbulence closure is used for the first time to determine the structure of the
two-time power spectrum of weak magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence from the nonlinear equations
describing the dynamics. The two-time energy spectrum is a fundamental quantity in turbulence
theory from which most statistical properties of a homogeneous turbulent system can be derived.
A closely related quantity, obtained via a spatial Fourier transform, is the two-point, two-time
correlation function describing the space-time correlations arising from the underlying dynamics
of the turbulent fluctuations. Both quantities are central in fundamental turbulence theories
as well as in the analysis of turbulence experiments and simulations. However, a first-principle
derivation of these quantities has remained elusive due to the statistical closure problem, in
which dynamical equations for correlations at order $n$ depend on correlations of order $n+1$.
The recent launch of the \emph{Parker Solar Probe} (PSP), which will explore the near-Sun region
where the solar wind is born, has renewed the interest in the scientific community to understand
the structure, and possible universal properties of space-time correlations. The weak MHD turbulence
regime that we consider in this work allows for a natural asymptotic closure of the two-time spectrum,
which may be applicable to other weak turbulence regimes found in fluids and plasmas. An integro-differential
equation for the scale-dependent temporal correlation function is derived for incompressible
Alfv\'enic fluctuations whose nonlinear dynamics is described by the Reduced MHD equations.
