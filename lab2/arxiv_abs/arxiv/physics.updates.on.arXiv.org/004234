In many laboratories, conventional bright-field transmission microscopes are available to study
the structure and organization principles of fibrous tissue samples, but they usually provide
only 2D information. To access the third (out-of-plane) dimension, more advanced techniques are
employed. An example is 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI), which measures the birefringence
of histological brain sections to derive the spatial nerve fiber orientations. Here, we show how
light scattering in transmission microscopy measurements can be leveraged to gain 3D structural
information about fibrous tissue samples like brain tissue. For this purpose, we developed a simulation
framework using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and high performance computing,
which can easily be adapted to other microscopy techniques and tissue types with comparable fibrous
structures (e.g., muscle fibers, collagen, or artificial fibers). As conventional bright-field
transmission microscopy provides usually only 2D information about tissue structures, a three-dimensional
reconstruction of fibers across several sections is difficult. By combining our simulations with
experimental studies, we show that the polarization-independent transmitted light intensity
(transmittance) contains 3D information: We demonstrate in several experimental studies on brain
sections from different species (rodent, monkey, human) that the transmittance decreases significantly
(by more than 50%) with the increasing out-of-plane angle of the nerve fibers. Our FDTD simulations
show that this decrease is mainly caused by polarization-independent light scattering in combination
with the finite numerical aperture of the imaging system. This allows to use standard transmission
microscopy techniques to obtain 3D information about the fiber inclination and to detect steep
fibers, without need for additional measurements.
