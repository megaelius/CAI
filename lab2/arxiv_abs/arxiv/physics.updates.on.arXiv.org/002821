Nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD) is a promising material for a variety of
neural interfacing applications, due to its unique combination of high conductivity, bioinertness,
and durability. One emerging application for N-UNCD is as a photoelectrode material for high-precision
optical neural stimulation. This may be used for the treatment of neurological disorders and for
implantable bionic devices such as cochlear ear implants and retinal prostheses. N-UNCD is a well-suited
material for stimulation photoelectrodes, exhibiting a photocurrent response to light at visible
wavelengths with a high charge injection density [A. Ahnood, A. N. Simonov, J. S. Laird, M. I. Maturana,
K. Ganesan, A. Stacey, M. R. Ibbotson, L. Spiccia, and S. Prawer, Appl. Phys. Lett. 108, 104103 (2016)].
In this study, the photoresponse of N-UNCD to near-infrared (NIR) irradiation is measured. NIR
light has greater optical penetration through tissue than visible wavelengths, opening the possibility
to stimulate previously inaccessible target cells. It is found that N-UNCD exhibits a photoresponsivity
which diminishes rapidly with increasing wavelength and is attributed to transitions between
mid-gap states and the conduction band tail associated with the graphitic phase present at the grain
boundaries. Oxygen surface termination on the diamond films provides further enhancement of the
injected charge per photon, compared to as-grown or hydrogen terminated surfaces. Based on the
measured injected charge density, we estimate that the generated photocurrent of oxygen terminated
N-UNCD is sufficient to achieve extracellular stimulation of brain tissue within the safe optical
exposure limit.
