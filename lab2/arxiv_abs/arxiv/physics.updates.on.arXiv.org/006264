This study investigates, by means of numerical simulations, extreme mechanical force exerted
by a turbulent flow impinging on a bluff body, and examines the relevance of two distinct rare-event
algorithms to efficiently sample these events. The drag experienced by a square obstacle placed
in a turbulent channel flow (in two dimensions) is taken as a representative case study. Direct sampling
shows that extreme fluctuations are closely related to the presence of a strong vortex blocked in
the near wake of the obstacle. This vortex is responsible for a significant pressure drop between
the forebody and the base of the obstacle, thus yielding a very high value of the drag. Two algorithms
are then considered to speed up the sampling of such flow scenarii, namely the AMS and the GKTL algorithms.
The general idea behind these algorithms is to replace a long simulation by a set of much shorter ones,
running in parallel, with dynamics that are replicated or pruned, according to some specific rules
designed to sample large-amplitude events more frequently. These algorithms have been shown to
be relevant for a wide range of problems in statistical physics, computer science, biochemistry.
The present study is the first application to a fluid-structure interaction problem. Practical
evidence is given that the fast sweeping time of turbulent fluid structures past the obstacle has
a strong influence on the efficiency of the rare-event algorithm. While the AMS algorithm does not
yield significant run-time savings as compared to direct sampling, the GKTL algorithm appears
to be effective to sample very efficiently extreme fluctuations of the time-averaged drag and estimate
related statistics such as return times.
