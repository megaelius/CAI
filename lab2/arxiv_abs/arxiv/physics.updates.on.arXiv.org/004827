In recent years, several optimal dynamos have been discovered. They minimize the magnetic energy
dissipation and the critical magnetic Reynolds number or maximize the growth rate at a fixed magnetic
Reynolds number. In the optimal dynamo of Willis (2012, PRL 109, 251101), we find mean-field dynamo
action for planar averages. One component of the magnetic field grows exponentially while the other
decays in an oscillatory fashion near onset. This behavior is different from that of an alpha^2 dynamo,
where the two non-vanishing components of the planar averages are coupled and have the same growth
rate. For the Willis dynamo, we find that the mean field is excited by a negative turbulent magnetic
diffusivity, which has a non-uniform spatial profile near onset. The temporal oscillations in
the decaying component are caused by the corresponding component of the diffusivity tensor being
complex when the mean field is decaying and, in this way, time-dependent. The growing mean field
can be modeled by a negative magnetic diffusivity combined with a positive magnetic hyperdiffusivity.
In two other classes of optimal dynamos of Chen et al. (2015, JFM 783, 23), we find, to some extent,
similar mean-field dynamo actions. When the magnetic boundary conditions are mixed, the two components
of the planar averaged field grow at different rates when the dynamo is 15% supercritical. When the
mean magnetic field satisfies homogeneous boundary conditions, mean-field dynamo action is only
found for one-dimensional averages, but not for planar averages. Despite having different spatial
profiles, both dynamos show negative turbulent magnetic diffusivities. Our finding suggests
negative turbulent magnetic diffusivities may support a broader class of dynamos than previously
thought, including these three optimal dynamos.
