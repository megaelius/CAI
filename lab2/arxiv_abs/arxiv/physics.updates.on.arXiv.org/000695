Cauchy in 1822 presented the idea of traction vector that contains both the normal and tangential
components of the internal surface forces per unit area and gave the tetrahedron argument to prove
the existence of stress tensor. These great achievements form the main part of the foundation of
continuum mechanics. During nearly two centuries, some versions of tetrahedron argument and a
few other proofs for the existence of stress tensor are presented in every text in continuum mechanics,
fluid mechanics, and the related subjects. In this article, we show the birth, importance, and location
of these Cauchy's achievements, then by presenting the formal tetrahedron argument in detail,
for the first time we extract some fundamental challenges. These conceptual challenges are related
to the result of applying the conservation of linear momentum to any mass element and the order of
its surface and volume terms, the definition of traction vectors on the surfaces that pass through
the same point, the limiting and approximating processes in the derivation of stress tensor, and
some others. In a comprehensive review, we present the different tetrahedron arguments and the
proofs for the existence of stress tensor, consider the challenges in each one, and classify them
in two general approaches. In the first approach that is followed in most texts, the traction vectors
do not define exactly on the surfaces that pass through the same point so, most of the challenges hold.
But in the second approach, the traction vectors are defined on the surfaces that pass exactly through
the same point, so some of the related challenges are removed. We also represent the improved works
of Hamel and Backus, and show that the original work of Backus removes most of the challenges. This
article shows that the foundation of continuum mechanics is not a finished subject and there are
still some fundamental challenges.
