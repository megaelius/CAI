Cardiovascular simulations are increasingly used for non-invasive diagnosis of cardiovascular
disease, to guide treatment decisions, and in the design of medical devices. Quantitative assessment
of the variability of simulation outputs due to input uncertainty is a key step toward further integration
of cardiovascular simulations in the clinical workflow. In this study, we present uncertainty
quantification in computational models of the coronary circulation to investigate the effect
of uncertain parameters, including coronary pressure waveform, intramyocardial pressure, morphometry
exponent, and the vascular wall Young's modulus. We employ a left coronary artery model with deformable
vessel walls, simulated via an ALE framework for FSI, with a prescribed inlet pressure and open-loop
lumped parameter network outlet boundary conditions. Stochastic modeling of the uncertain inputs
is determined from intra-coronary catheterization data or gathered from the literature. Uncertainty
propagation is performed using several approaches including Monte Carlo, Quasi MC, stochastic
collocation, and multiwavelet stochastic expansion. Variabilities in QoI, including branch
pressure, flow, wall shear stress, and wall deformation are assessed. We find that uncertainty
in inlet pressures and intramyocardial pressures significantly affect all resulting QoIs, while
uncertainty in elastic modulus only affects the mechanical response of the vascular wall. Variability
in the morphometry exponent has little effect on coronary hemodynamics or wall mechanics. Finally,
we compare convergence behaviors of statistics of QoIs using several uncertainty propagation
methods. From the simulation results, we conclude that the multi-wavelet stochastic expansion
shows superior accuracy and performance against Quasi Monte Carlo and stochastic collocation
methods.
