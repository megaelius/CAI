We study structural properties of street networks from 97 of the most populous cities worldwide
at scales significantly larger than previous studies. We find that the distribution of betweenness
centrality (BC), a global structural metric based on network flow, is invariant in all studied street
networks, despite the obvious structural differences between them. We also find that the BC distribution
is robust to major alterations in the network, including significant changes to its topology and
edge weight structure, indicating that the only relevant factors shaping the distribution are
the number of nodes in a network, the number of edges, and the constraint of planarity. Through a combination
of simulations of random planar graph models and analytical calculations on Cayley trees, this
remarkable invariance is demonstrated to be a consequence of a bimodal regime consisting of an underlying
tree structure for high betweenness nodes, and a low betweenness regime arising from the presence
of loops providing local path alternatives. Furthermore, the high betweenness nodes display a
non-trivial spatial dependence, with increasing spatial correlation as a function of the number
of roads, leading them to cluster around the barycenter for cities with high density of streets.
As the BC is a static predictor of traffic flow, this invariance has important implications for urban
planning; indeed, as long as planarity is conserved, bottlenecks will persist and the effect of
planned interventions to alleviate congestion will be limited primarily to load redistribution,
a feature confirmed by analyzing 200 years of data for central Paris.
