Individual performance metrics are commonly used to compare players from different eras. However,
such cross-era comparison is often biased due to significant changes in success factors underlying
player achievement rates (e.g. performance enhancing drugs and modern training regimens). Such
historical comparison is more than fodder for casual discussion among sports fans, as it is also
an issue of critical importance to the multi-billion dollar professional sport industry and the
institutions (e.g. Hall of Fame) charged with preserving sports history and the legacy of outstanding
players and achievements. To address this cultural heritage management issue, we report an objective
statistical method for renormalizing career achievement metrics, one that is particularly tailored
for common seasonal performance metrics, which are often aggregated into summary career metrics
-- despite the fact that many player careers span different eras. Remarkably, we find that the method
applied to comprehensive Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association player data
preserves the overall functional form of the distribution of career achievement, both at the season
and career level. As such, subsequent re-ranking of the top-50 all-time records in MLB and the NBA
using renormalized metrics indicates reordering at the local rank level, as opposed to bulk reordering
by era. This local order refinement signals time-independent mechanisms underlying annual and
career achievement in professional sports, meaning that appropriately renormalized achievement
metrics can be used to compare players from eras with different season lengths, team strategies,
rules -- and possibly even different sports.
