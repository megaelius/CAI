The presented investigation is motivated by the need to uncover connections between underlying
rotor fluid-structure interactions and vortex dynamics to fatigue performance and characterization
of flexible rotor blades, their hub, and their supporting superstructure. Towards this effort,
temporal stability characteristics of tip vortices shed from flexible rotor blades are investigated
numerically. An aeroelastic free-vortex wake method is employed to simulate the helical tip vortices
and the associated velocity field. A linear eigenvalue stability analysis is employed to quantify
stability trends (growth-rate v. perturbation wavenumber) and growth-rate temporal evolution
of tip vortices. Simulations of a canonical rotor with rigid blades and its generation of tip vortices
are first conducted to validate the stability analysis employed herein. Next, a stationary wind
turbine is emulated using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5MW reference wind turbine
base design to investigate the impact rotor aeroelasticity has on tip vortex stability evolution
in time. Blade flexibility is shown to reduce the sensitivity of tip vortex destabilization to low
wavenumber perturbations, also blade-pitch reduces growth-rate magnitude and alters the growth-rate
peak dependence on perturbation wavenumber, all of which have in the past not been reported in the
rotorcraft literature. The current investigation aims to develop insight into rotorcraft tip
vortex kinematics and stability to work towards quantifying fatigue loading and its effects, minimizing
adverse blade-vortex interaction effects, such as excessive noise emission and large blade vibrations
also affecting fatigue performance.
