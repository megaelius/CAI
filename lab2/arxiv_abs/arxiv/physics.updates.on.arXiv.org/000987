A network-based approach is presented to investigate the cerebrovascular flow patterns during
atrial fibrillation (AF) with respect to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). AF, the most common cardiac
arrhythmia with faster and irregular beating, has been recently and independently associated
with the increased risk of dementia. However, the underlying hemodynamic mechanisms relating
the two pathologies remain mainly undetermined so far; thus the contribution of modeling and refined
statistical tools is valuable. Pressure and flow rate temporal series in NSR and AF are here evaluated
along representative cerebral sites (from carotid arteries to capillary brain circulation),
exploiting reliable artificially built signals recently obtained from an in silico approach.
The complex network analysis evidences, in a synthetic and original way, a dramatic signal variation
towards the distal/capillary cerebral regions during AF, which has no counterpart in NSR conditions.
At the large artery level, networks obtained from both AF and NSR hemodynamic signals exhibit elongated
and chained features, which are typical of pseudo-periodic series. These aspects are almost completely
lost towards the microcirculation during AF, where the networks are topologically more circular
and present random-like characteristics. As a consequence, all the physiological phenomena at
microcerebral level ruled by periodicity - such as regular perfusion, mean pressure per beat, and
average nutrient supply at cellular level - can be strongly compromised, since the AF hemodynamic
signals assume irregular behaviour and random-like features. Through a powerful approach which
is complementary to the classical statistical tools, the present findings further strengthen
the potential link between AF hemodynamic and cognitive decline.
