The tunneling contribution of evanescent waves carrying high density of state of photons can substantially
strengthen the near-field Planckian thermal radiation with efficiency far beyond the classic
blackbody limit. In this aspect, the monolayer graphene (Gr) has the special potential due to its
strong surface plasmonic response in the thermal infrared window. In this work, we manage to characterize
the near-field heat transfer between two macroscopic Gr-sheets seated on different silicon substrates
at nanoscale gaps and unambiguously verify the role of Gr-plasmons in enhancing the thermal radiation.
This effect is firstly demonstrated using an intrinsic silicon (i-Si) substrate without doping
so that the plasmonic contribution of graphene is solely inspected. A large super-Planckian heat
transfer efficiency 8 times larger than the blackbody limit is obtained at a gap size of 435 nm at a
temperature difference of 35 K. Highly doped silicon (d-Si) substrate with plasmonic response
in the long wavelength range is then used, which alone can give rise to a large near-field heat flux.
When covered with a Gr-sheet, the electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the two alien plasmonic
materials can further enhance the Gr-Si radiation efficiency with an increment about 11%. The underlying
charging doping arising from the Gr-Si heterojunction and their electromagnetic influence are
investigated. The experimental results are in good agreement with the analytical calculations
incorporating the measurement uncertainties, which in turn validates the classic fluctuating
electrodynamics theory used in describing the graphene-involved near-field heat transfer system.
