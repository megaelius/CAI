Wave dispersion in a pulsar plasma (a 1D, strongly magnetized, pair plasma streaming highly relativistically
with a large spread in Lorentz factors in its rest frame) is discussed, motivated by interest in beam-driven
wave turbulence and the pulsar radio emission mechanism. In the rest frame of the pulsar plasma there
are three wave modes in the low-frequency, non-gyrotropic approximation. For parallel propagation
these are referred to as the X, A and L modes, with the X and A modes having dispersion relation $z=z_A\approx1-1/2\beta_A^2$,
where $z=\omega/k_\parallel c$ is the phase speed and $\beta_Ac$ is the Alfven speed. The L mode
dispersion relation is determined by a relativistic plasma dispersion function, $z^2W(z)$, which
is negative for $ z < z_0 $ and has a sharp maximum at $z=z_m$, with $1-z_m<1-z_0\ll1$. We give numerical
estimates for the maximum of $z^2W(z)$ and for $z_m$ and $z_0$ for a 1D Juttner distribution. The
L and A modes reconnect, for $z_A>z_0$, to form the O and Alfven modes for oblique propagation ($\theta\neq0$).
For $z_A<z_0$ the Alfven and O~mode curves reconnect forming a new mode that exists only for $\tan^2\theta>z_0^2-z_A^2$.
The L mode is the nearest counterpart to Langmuir waves in a nonrelativistic plasma, but we argue
that there are no `Langmuir-like' waves in pulsar plasma, identifying three features of the L~mode
(dispersion relation, ratio of electric to total energy and group speed) that are not Langmuir-like.
A beam-driven instability requires a beam speed equal to the phase speed of the wave. This resonance
condition can be satisfied for the O mode, but only for an implausibly energetic beam and only for
a tiny range of angles for the O~mode around $\theta\approx0$. The resonance is also possible for
the Alfven mode but only near a turnover frequency that has no counterpart for Alfven waves in a nonrelativistic
plasma.
