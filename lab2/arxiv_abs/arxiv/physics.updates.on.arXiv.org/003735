Solution-processed, lead halide-based perovskite solar cells have overcome important challenges
over the recent years, offering low-cost and high solar power conversion efficiencies. However,
they still undergo unoptimized light collection due mainly to the thin (~350 nm) polycrystalline
absorber layers. Moreover, their high toxicity (due to the presence of lead in the perovskite crystalline
structure) makes it necessary that the thickness of the absorber layers to be further reduced, for
their future commercialization, without reducing the device performance. Here we aim to address
these issues via embedding spherical plasmonic nanoparticles of various sizes, composition,
concentrations, and vertical positions, for the first time in realistic halide-based perovskite
solar cells architecture, and to clarify their effect on the absorption properties and enhancement.
We theoretically show that plasmon-enhanced near-field effects and scattering leads to a device
photocurrent enhancement of up to ~7.3% when silver spheres are embedded inside the perovskite
layer. Interestingly, the combination of silver spheres in perovskite and aluminum spheres inside
the hole transporting layer (PEDOT:PSS) of the solar cell leads to an even further enhancement,
of up to ~12%. This approach allows the employment of much thinner perovskite layers in PSCs (up to
150 nm) to reach the same photocurrent as the nanoparticles-free device and reducing thus significantly
the toxicity of the device. Providing the requirements related to the size, shape, position, composition,
and concentration of nanoparticles for the PSCs photocurrent enhancement, our study establishes
guidelines for a future development of highly-efficient, environmentally friendly and low-cost
plasmonic perovskite solar cells.
