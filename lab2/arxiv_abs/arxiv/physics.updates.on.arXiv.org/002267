Experience shows that celestial bodies have a nearly round shape only from a certain size. At IAU
resolution B5, item b, that shape serves as an indicator for a distinct mechanism of its forming,
caused by a minimum of mass. Rigid body forces should have been overcome by self gravity and a hydrostatic
equilibrium shape should have been achieved. A new approach to correlate the size and shape of a solid
in hydrostatic equilibrium by balancing self gravity and rigid body forces leads to a real, not to
an arbitrary lower limit of size. No arbitrary criterion is required as it is often the case. Above
this limit the shape of a solid body is restricted by a maximum of its surface area, and this maximum
vanishes only at infinite size. Therefore the shape like that of a related fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium
can only be reached in the solid state, if its surface area is larger than this maximum. This applies
only to the four giant planets and Haumea. All the known nearly round celestial bodies in the solar
System cant have achieved their present shape while being solids. The dwarf Haumea is a questionable
exception. The present shapes have been formed before solidification and are frozen. The gas giants
are not solids at all and the terrestrial planets have at least partially melted in their thermal
history for millions of years. The smaller nearly round objects such as asteroids and satellites
were at least partially melted combined with internal differentiation and resurfacing of a mechanically
unstable crust in their very early thermal history. No rigid body forces had to be overcome. Item
b of the current planet definition is somewhat undetermined. All planets and dwarfs in the solar
system match this requirement only at very generous interpretation. It should be completely deleted.
The number of dwarfs could be restricted by an arbitrary minimum of mass.
