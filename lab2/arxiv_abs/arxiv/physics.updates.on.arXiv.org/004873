Passive detection of special nuclear material (SNM) is challenging due to its inherently low rate
of spontaneous emission of penetrating radiation, the relative ease of shielding, and the fluctuating
and frequently overwhelming background. Active interrogation (AI), the use of external radiation
to increase the emission rate of characteristic radiation from SNM, has long been considered to
be a promising method to overcome those challenges. Current AI systems that incorporate radiography
tend to use bremsstrahlung beams, which can deliver high radiation doses. Low-energy ion-driven
nuclear reactions that produce multiple monoenergetic photons may be used as an alternative. The
$^{12}$C(p,p')$^{12}$C is one such reaction that could produce large gamma-ray yields of highly
penetrating 4.4- and 15.1-MeV gamma rays. This reaction does not directly produce neutrons below
the $\sim$19.7-MeV threshold, and the 15.1-MeV gamma-ray line is well matched to the photofission
cross-section of $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U. We report the measurements of thick-target gamma-ray
yields at 4.4 and 15.1 MeV from the $^{12}$C(p,p')$^{12}$C at proton energies of 19.5, 25, and 30
MeV. Measurements were made with two 3'' EJ309 cylindrical liquid scintillation detectors and
thermoluminescent dosimeters placed at 0 and 90 degrees. We estimate the highest yields of the 4.4-
and 15.1-MeV gamma rays of 1.65$\times10^{10}$ sr$^{-1}\mu$ C$^{-1}$ and 4.47$\times10^8$ sr$^{-1}\mu$
C$^{-1}$ at a proton energy of 30 MeV, respectively. The yield of 4.4 and 15.1 MeV gamma rays in all
experimental configurations is greater than a comparable deuteron-driven reaction that produces
the same gamma-ray energies- $^{11}$B(d,n$\gamma$)$^{12}$C. However, a two orders of magnitude
increase of the neutron radiation dose is observed when the proton energy increases from 19.5 to
30 MeV.
