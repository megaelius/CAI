A weak turbulence theory is derived for magnetohydrodynamics under rapid rotation and in the presence
of a large-scale magnetic field. The angular velocity $\Omega_0$ is assumed to be uniform and parallel
to the constant Alfv\'en speed ${\bf b_0}$. Such a system exhibits left and right circularly polarized
waves which can be obtained by introducing the magneto-inertial length $d \equiv b_0/\Omega_0$.
In the large-scale limit ($kd \to 0$; $k$ being the wave number), the left- and right-handed waves
tend respectively to the inertial and magnetostrophic waves whereas in the small-scale limit ($kd
\to + \infty$) pure Alfv\'en waves are recovered. By using a complex helicity decomposition, the
asymptotic weak turbulence equations are derived which describe the long-time behavior of weakly
dispersive interacting waves {\it via} three-wave interaction processes. It is shown that the
nonlinear dynamics is mainly anisotropic with a stronger transfer perpendicular ($\perp$) than
parallel ($\parallel$) to the rotating axis. The general theory may converge to pure weak inertial/magnetostrophic
or Alfv\'en wave turbulence when the large or small-scales limits are taken respectively. Inertial
wave turbulence is asymptotically dominated by the kinetic energy/helicity whereas the magnetostrophic
wave turbulence is dominated by the magnetic energy/helicity. For both regimes a family of exact
solutions are found for the spectra which do not correspond necessarily to a maximal helicity state.
It is shown that the hybrid helicity exhibits a cascade whose direction may vary according to the
scale $k_f$ at which the helicity flux is injected with an inverse cascade if $k_fd < 1$ and a direct
cascade otherwise. The theory is relevant for the magnetostrophic dynamo whose main applications
are the Earth and giant planets for which a small ($\sim 10^{-6}$) Rossby number is expected.
