In spherical tokamaks, the electron plasma frequency is greater than the electron cyclotron frequency.
Electromagnetic waves in the electron cyclotron range of frequencies are unsuitable for directly
heating such plasmas due to their reduced accessibility. However, mode-conversion of the extraordinary
wave to the electron Bernstein wave (X-B mode-conversion) at the upper hybrid resonance makes it
possible to efficiently couple externally-launched electromagnetic wave energy into an overdense
plasma core. Traditional mode-conversion models describe an X-mode wave propagating in a potential
containing two cutoffs that bracket a single wave resonance. Often, however, the mode-conversion
region is in the edge, where turbulent fluctuations and blobs can generate abrupt cutoffs and scattering
of the incident X-mode wave. We present a new framework for studying the X-B mode-conversion which
makes the inclusion of these fluctuations analytically tractable. In the new approach, the high-field
cutoff is modelled as an infinite barrier, which manifests as a boundary condition applied to a wave
equation involving only one cutoff adjacent to the resonance on the low-field side. The new model
reproduces the main features of the previous approach, yet is more suitable for analyzing experimental
observations and extrapolating to higher dimensions. We then develop an analytical estimate for
the effect of small-amplitude, quasi-monochromatic density fluctuations on the X-B mode-conversion
efficiency using perturbation theory. We find that Bragg backscattering of the launched X-mode
wave reduces the mode-conversion efficiency significantly when the fluctuation wavenumber is
resonant with the wavenumber of the incident X-mode wave. These analytical results are corroborated
by numerically integrating the mode-conversion equations.
