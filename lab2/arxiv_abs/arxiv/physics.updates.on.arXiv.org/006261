Planar metamaterials with tailorable electromagnetic properties in the terahertz domain offer
customized optics solutions that are needed for the development of imaging and spectroscopy systems.
In particular, metamaterials carry the potential to substitute conventional bulky optics or can
be basic building blocks for completely novel devices. In this respect it is advantageous that metamaterials
can be devised to be impedance-matched to another material regarding their electromagnetic properties.
Here, we design, fabricate and investigate a metamaterial with tailorable refractive index and
impedance-matching to free space. The unit cell is comprised of two different pairs of cut-wires
that provide almost independent control over the electric and magnetic response to an electromagnetic
wave. For the example of a metamaterial with a uniform effective refractive index of 1.18, we experimentally
demonstrate an amplitude transmission of more than 90% and a reflectivity of about 5% at a working
frequency of 0.444THz. As a more functional device, we fabricate a terahertz gradient index beam
steerer with a linear refractive index gradient from 1.14 to 2.66. We numerically simulate the electromagnetic
wave propagation through the beam steerer and compare the electric field amplitude of the deflected
wave with the terahertz field distribution that is measured behind the beam steerer in an imaging
terahertz time-domain spectroscope. The numerically simulated deflection angle of 6.1{\deg}
agrees well with the measured deflection angle of 5.95{\deg}. The measured peak amplitude transmission
of the beam steerer amounts to almost 90%, which also agrees well with a simulated value of approximately
88%.
