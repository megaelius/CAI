Simulator imperfection, often known as model error, is ubiquitous in practical data assimilation
problems. Despite the enormous efforts dedicated to addressing this problem, properly handling
simulator imperfection in data assimilation remains to be a challenging task. In this work, we propose
an approach to dealing with simulator imperfection from a point of view of functional approximation
that can be implemented through a certain machine learning method, such as kernel-based learning
adopted in the current work. To this end, we start from considering a class of supervised learning
problems, and then identify similarities between supervised learning and variational data assimilation.
These similarities found the basis for us to develop an ensemble-based learning framework to tackle
supervised learning problems, while achieving various advantages of ensemble-based methods
over the variational ones. After establishing the ensemble-based learning framework, we proceed
to investigate the integration of ensemble-based learning into an ensemble-based data assimilation
framework to handle simulator imperfection. In the course of our investigations, we also develop
a strategy to tackle the issue of multi-modality in supervised-learning problems, and transfer
this strategy to data assimilation problems to help improve assimilation performance. For demonstration,
we apply the ensemble-based learning framework and the integrated, ensemble-based data assimilation
framework to a supervised learning problem and a data assimilation problem with an imperfect forward
simulator, respectively. The experiment results indicate that both frameworks achieve good performance
in relevant case studies, and that functional approximation through machine learning may serve
as a viable way to account for simulator imperfection in data assimilation problems.
