Flagella and cilia are cellular appendages that inherit essential functions of microbial life
including sensing and navigating the environment. In order to propel a swimming microorganism
they displace the surrounding fluid by means of periodic motions, while precisely-timed modulations
of their beating patterns enable the cell to steer towards or away from specific locations. Characterizing
the dynamic forces, however, is challenging and typically relies on indirect experimental approaches.
Here, we present direct in vivo measurements of the dynamic forces of motile Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
cells in controlled environments. The experiments are based on partially aspirating a living microorganism
at the tip of a micropipette force sensor and optically recording the micropipette's position fluctuations
with high temporal and sub-pixel spatial resolution. We provide an analytic elasto-hydrodynamic
model for the micropipette force sensor and describe how to obtain the micropipette's full frequency
response function from a dynamic force calibration. Using this approach, we find dynamic forces
during the free swimming activity of individual Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells of 23$\pm$5 pN
resulting from the coordinated flagellar beating with a frequency of 51$\pm$6 Hz. In addition to
measurements in bulk liquid environment, we study the dynamic forces of the biflagellated microswimmer
in the vicinity of a solid/liquid interface. As we gradually decrease the distance of the swimming
microbe to the interface, we measure a significantly enhanced force transduction at distances
larger than the maximum extend of the beating flagella, highlighting the importance of hydrodynamic
interactions for scenarios in which flagellated microorganisms encounter surfaces.
