We investigate the transition to a Landau-Levich-Derjaguin film in forced dewetting using a quadtree
adaptive solution to the Navier-Stokes equations with surface tension. We use a discretization
of the capillary forces near the receding contact line that yields an equilibrium for a specified
contact angle $\theta_\Delta$ called the numerical contact angle. Despite the well-known contact
line singularity, dynamic simulations can proceed without any explicit additional numerical
procedure. We investigate angles from $15^\circ$ to $110^\circ$ and capillary numbers from $0.00085$
to $0.2$ where the mesh size $\Delta$ is varied in the range of $0.0035$ to $0.06$ of the capillary
length $l_c$. To interpret the results, we use Cox's theory which involves a microscopic distance
$r_m$ and a microscopic angle $\theta_e$. In the numerical case, the equivalent of $\theta_e$ is
the angle $\theta_\Delta$ and we find that Cox's theory also applies. We introduce the scaling factor
or gauge function $\phi$ so that $r_m = \Delta/\phi$ and estimate this gauge function by comparing
our numerics to Cox's theory. The comparison provides a direct assessment of the agreement of the
numerics with Cox's theory and reveals a critical feature of the numerical treatment of contact
line dynamics: agreement is poor at small angles while it is better at large angles. This scaling
factor is shown to depend only on $\theta_\Delta$ and the viscosity ratio $q$. In the case of small
$\theta_e$, we use the prediction by Eggers [Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 93, pp 094502, 2004] of the critical
capillary number for the Landau-Levich-Derjaguin forced dewetting transition. We generalize
this prediction to large $\theta_e$ and arbitrary $q$ and express the critical capillary number
as a function of $\theta_e$ and $r_m$. An analogy can be drawn between $r_m$ and the numerical slip
length.
