The timeline of the Earth's history reveals quasi-periodicity of the geological record over the
last 542 Myr, on timescales close, in the order of magnitude, to 1 Myr. What is the origin of this quasi-periodicity?
What is the nature of the global events that define the boundaries of the geological time scale? I
propose that a single mechanism is responsible for all three types of such events: mass extinctions,
geomagnetic polarity reversals, and sea-level fluctuations. The mechanism is fast, and involves
a significant energy release. The mechanism is unlikely to have astronomical causes, both because
of the energies involved, and because it acts quasi-periodically. It must then be sought within
the Earth itself. And it must be capable of reversing the Earth's magnetic field. The last requirement
makes it incompatible with the consensus model of the origin of the geomagnetic field - the hydromagnetic
dynamo operating in the Earth's fluid core. In the second part of the paper, I show that a vast amount
of seemingly unconnected geophysical and geological data can be understood in a unified way if the
source of the Earth's main magnetic field is a ~200-km-thick lithosphere, repeatedly magnetized
as a result of methane-driven oceanic eruptions, which produce ocean flow capable of dynamo action.
The eruptions are driven by the interplay of buoyancy forces and exsolution of dissolved gas, which
accumulates in the oceanic water masses prone to stagnation and anoxia. Polarity reversals, mass
extinctions, and sequence boundaries are consequences of these eruptions. Unlike the consensus
model of geomagnetism, this scenario is consistent with the paleomagnetic data showing that "directional
changes during a [geomagnetic polarity] reversal can be astonishingly fast, possibly occurring
as a nearly instantaneous jump from one inclined dipolar state to another in the opposite hemisphere".
