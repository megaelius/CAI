Topological phonon polaritons (TPhPs) are highly protected and localized edge modes that are capable
to achieve a strong confinement of electromagnetic waves and immune to impurities and disorder.
Here we realize TPhPs by constructing one-dimensional dimerized silicon carbide nanoparticle
chains, which mimic the topological property of the well-known Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model.
We analytically calculate the complex band structure of such chains by taking all near-field and
far-field dipole-dipole interactions into account. For longitudinal modes, we demonstrate that,
despite the non-Hermiticity and breaking of the chiral symmetry, the band topology can be still
characterized by the complex Zak phase, which is quantized and indicates a topological phase transition
when the dimerization parameter $\beta$ changes from less than 0.5 to larger than 0.5, like the conventional
Hermitian SSH model. By calculating the eigenmodes of a finite chain, we find such a dimerized chain
with $\beta>0.5$ supports nontrivial topological eigenmodes localized over both of its edges,
indicating the validity of the bulk-boundary correspondence. On the other hand, for transverse
modes, we discover a topological phase transition by increasing the lattice constant, which is
due to the presence of strong long-range far-field transverse dipole-dipole interactions decaying
with the distance $r$ as $1/r$ for an infinitely long chain. However, we surprisingly find the emergence
of non-Hermitian skin effect in a finite chain, which leads to the breakdown of the bulk-boundary
correspondence. Furthermore, by incorporating the effect of localized bulk eigenmodes and proposing
a modified complex Zak phase for a finite lattice, we still recover the topological behavior of the
conventional SSH model. We also demonstrate the excitation of the topological phonon polaritons
and show their enhancement to the photonic LDOS.
