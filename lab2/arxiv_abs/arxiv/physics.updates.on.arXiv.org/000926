This study uses two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy in conjunction with isotope labeling
and spectral modeling from molecular dynamics simulations to identify the dominant turn conformations
that exist in equilibrium ensembles of the (VPGVG)n family of intrinsically disordered elastin-like
peptides. Numerous models have been proposed to explain the origins of elastin's elasticity and
its counterintuitive ability to become structured upon heating. However, the structure of elastin
remains unassigned because none of the techniques currently used to study highly disordered amino
acid sequences have a time resolution that is faster than the lifetime of a transient conformation
in a disordered sequence. Because these conformations exchange on time scales longer than the 5-6
ps required for 2D IR measurements, isotope-edited 2D IR spectroscopy was chosen to study this family
of peptides. This study first examined the small GVGVPGVG peptide at a series of temperatures and
salt concentrations to assign its dominant turn conformations and to determine what variables
alter the populations of these conformations. These data were then used to identify the dominant
turn conformations that exist in larger elastin-like peptides including (GVGVP)251. The results
indicate that the (VPGVG)n family of elastin-like peptides contain a high population of both an
irregular turn structure with 2 peptide-peptide hydrogen bonds to the proline amide C=O group and
a conventional turn structure with 1 peptide-peptide hydrogen bond to the proline amide C=O group.
These turn structures are durable, showing a significant population of closed turns at all temperatures
and salt concentrations studied.
