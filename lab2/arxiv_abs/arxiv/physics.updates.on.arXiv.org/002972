Objective: Evaluate a method for the estimation of the nocturnal systolic blood pressure (SBP)
dip from 24-hour blood pressure trends using a wrist-worn photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and
a deep neural network in free-living individuals, comparing the deep neural network to traditional
machine learning and non-machine learning baselines. Approach: A wrist-worn PPG sensor was worn
by 106 healthy individuals for 226 days during which 5111 reference values for blood pressure (BP)
were obtained with a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitor and matched with the PPG sensor data. Features
based on heart rate variability and pulse morphology were extracted from the PPG waveforms. Long-
and short term memory (LSTM) networks, dense networks, random forests and linear regression models
were trained and evaluated in their capability of tracking trends in BP, as well as the estimation
of the SBP dip. Main results: Best performance for estimating the SBP dip were obtained with a deep
LSTM neural network with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.12$\pm$2.20 $\Delta$mmHg and a correlation
of 0.69 $(p=3*10^{-5})$. This dip was derived from trend estimates of BP which had an RMSE of 8.22$\pm$1.49
mmHg for systolic and 6.55$\pm$1.39 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). While other models had similar
performance for the tracking of relative BP, they did not perform as well as the LSTM for the SBP dip.
Significance: The work provides first evidence for the unobtrusive estimation of the nocturnal
SBP dip, a highly prognostic clinical parameter. It is also the first to evaluate unobtrusive BP
measurement in a large data set of unconstrained 24-hour measurements in free-living individuals
and provides evidence for the utility of LSTM models in this domain.
