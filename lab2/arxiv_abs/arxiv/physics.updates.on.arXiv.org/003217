If international agreements regarding the need to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions
are to be met then there is a high probability that the shipping industry will have to dramatically
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. For emission reductions from ships greater than around 40\%
then alternatives to fossil fuels - such as nuclear energy - will very likely be required. A Small
Modular Pressurised Water Reactor design has been developed specifically to meet the requirements
of a large container ship with a power requirement of 110~MWe. Container ships have a number of requirements
- including a small crew size and reduced outages associated with refuelling - that result in a greater
focus on design simplifications, including the elimination of the chemical reactivity control
system during power operation and a long core life. We have developed a novel, soluble-boron free,
low power density core that does not require refuelling for 15 years. The neutronic and fuel performance
behaviour of this system has been studied with conventional UO2 fuel. The size of the pressure vessel
has been limited to 3.5 metres in diameter. Furthermore, to ensure the survivability of the cladding
material, the coolant outlet temperature has been reduced to 285degC from 320degC as in conventional
GWe-class PWRs, with a resulting reduction in thermal efficiency to 25%. The UO2 core design was
able to satisfactorily meet the majority of requirements placed upon the system assuming that fuel
rod burnups can be limited to 100 GWd/tHM. The core developed here represents the first workable
design of a commercial marine reactor using conventional fuel, which makes realistic the idea of
using nuclear reactors for shipping.
