The double plasma resonance (DPR) instability plays a basic role in the generation of solar radio
zebras. In the plasma, consisting of the loss-cone type distribution of hot electrons and much denser
and colder background plasma, this instability generates the upper-hybrid waves, which are then
transformed into the electromagnetic waves and observed as radio zebras. In the present paper we
numerically study the double plasma resonance instability from the point of view of the zebra interpretation.
We use a 3-dimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell (3-D PIC) relativistic model. First
using the multi-mode model, we study details of the double plasma resonance instability. We show
how the distribution function of hot electrons changes during this instability. Then we show that
there is a very good agreement between results obtained by the multi-mode and specific-mode models,
which is caused by a dominance of the wave with the maximal growth rate. Therefore, for computations
in a broad range of model parameters, we use the specific-mode model. We compute the maximal growth
rates of the double plasma resonance instability. The results are compared with the analytical
ones. We find a very good agreement between numerical and analytical growth rates. We also compute
saturation energies of the upper-hybrid waves in a very broad range of parameters. We find that the
saturation energies of the upper-hybrid waves show maxima and minima at almost the same values of
$\omega_\mathrm{UH}/\omega_\mathrm{ce}$ as the growth rates. Furthermore, we find that the
saturation energy of the upper-hybrid waves is proportional to the density of hot electrons. The
maximum saturated energy can be up to one percent of the kinetic energy of hot electrons. All these
findings can be used in the interpretation of solar radio zebras.
