Strong-field photoelectron holography denotes the interference of various electron paths in
laser-induced ionization of atoms, leading to interference patterns in the final momentum distribution.
For a quantitative description of holography beyond the electric dipole approximation and in the
presence of the Coulomb potential, we develop a semiclassical model in which the initial conditions
of outgoing electrons are set according to the beyond-dipole strong-field approximation for the
ionization step. The phases associated with trajectories are evaluated following the prescription
for semiclassical propagators. The validity of the method is confirmed by comparison to the numerical
solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in two spatial dimensions. The semiclassical
model reproduces correctly the backward and forward shifts of the photoelectron momenta along
the laser propagation axis that arise from beyond-dipole dynamics. The position of the central
holographic interference fringe can be estimated already from a simplified Coulomb-free interference
model that provides closed-form expressions for the beyond-dipole shifts. In three dimensions,
Coulomb focusing causes a breakdown of the semiclassical model for final momenta with directions
close to the polarization axis. We implement a beyond-dipole regularization procedure based on
the concept of glory scattering, which was recently used to describe Coulomb focusing in the dipole
approximation. While the position of the central maximum and higher-order fringes can already
be obtained approximately by simpler semiclassical modeling, this glory model is able to predict
the shape of the distribution in the close vicinity of the central maximum. The violation of the dipole
approximation in holography should be observable with mid-infrared fields, for which the forward/backward
shifts can be comparable with the fringe spacing.
