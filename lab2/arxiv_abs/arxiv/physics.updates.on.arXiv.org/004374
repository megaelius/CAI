We consider the gravity-driven flow of a perfect dielectric, viscous, thin liquid film, wetting
a flat substrate inclined at a non-zero angle to the horizontal. The dynamics of the thin film is influenced
by an electric field which is set up parallel to the substrate surface - this nonlocal physical mechanism
has a linearly stabilizing effect on the interfacial dynamics. Our particular interest is in fluid
films that are hanging from the underside of the substrate; these films may drip depending on physical
parameters, and we investigate whether a sufficiently strong electric field can suppress such
nonlinear phenomena. For a non-electrified flow, it was observed by Brun et al. (Phys. Fluids 27,
084107, 2015) that the thresholds of linear absolute instability and dripping are reasonably close.
In the present study, we incorporate an electric field and analyse the absolute/convective instabilities
of a hierarchy of reduced-order models to predict the dripping limit in parameter space. The spatial
stability results for the reduced-order models are verified by performing an impulse-response
analysis with direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled to the
appropriate electrical equations. Guided by the results of the linear theory, we perform DNS on
extended domains with inflow/outflow conditions (mimicking an experimental set-up) to investigate
the dripping limit for both non-electrified and electrified liquid films. For the latter, we find
that the absolute instability threshold provides an order-of-magnitude estimate for the electric
field strength required to suppress dripping; the linear theory may thus be used to determine the
feasibility of dripping suppression given a set of geometrical, fluid and electrical parameters.
