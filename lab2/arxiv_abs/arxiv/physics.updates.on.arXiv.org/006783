Two-dimensional laminar flow of a viscous fluid induced by peristalsis due to a moving wall wave
has been studied previously for a rectangular channel, a circular tube, and a concentric circular
annulus. Here we study peristaltic flow in a non-axisymmetric annular tube, where the flow is three
dimensional, with azimuthal motions. This geometry is motivated by experimental observations
of cerebrospinal fluid flow along perivascular spaces (PVSs) surrounding arteries in the brain,
which is at least partially driven by peristaltic pumping. These PVSs are well matched, in cross-section,
by an adjustable model consisting of an inner circle (arterial wall) and an outer ellipse (outer
edge of the PVS), not necessarily concentric. We use this model, which may have other applications,
as a basis for numerical simulations of peristaltic flow. We use a finite-element scheme to compute
the flow driven by a propagating sinusoidal radial displacement of the inner wall. Unlike peristaltic
flow in a concentric circular annulus, the flow is fully three-dimensional, with streamlines wiggling
in both the radial and axial directions. We examine the dependence of the flow on the elongation of
the outer elliptical wall and on the eccentricity of the configuration. We find that time-averaged
volumetric flow decreases with increasing ellipticity or eccentricity. Azimuthal pressure variations,
caused by the wall wave, drive an oscillatory azimuthal flow in and out of the narrower gaps. The additional
shearing motion in the azimuthal direction will enhance Taylor dispersion in these flows, an effect
that might have practical applications.
