The fields are discussed, the internal degrees of freedom of which are expressed by either the Grassmann
or the Clifford "coordinates". Since both "coordinates" fulfill anticommutation relations,
both fields can be second quantized so that their creation and annihilation operators fulfill the
requirements of the commutation relations for fermion fields. However, while the internal spin,
determined by the generators of the Lorentz group of the Clifford objects $S^{ab}$ and $\tilde{S}^{ab}$
(in the spin-charge-family theory $S^{ab}$ determine the spin degrees of freedom and $\tilde{S}^{ab}$
the family degrees of freedom) have half integer spin, ${\cal {\bf S}}^{ab}$ (expressible with
$S^{ab} + \tilde{S}^{ab}$) have integer spin. Nature "made" obviously a choice of the Clifford
algebra, at least in the so far observed part of our universe. We discuss the quantization - first
and second - of the fields, the internal degrees of freedom of which are functions of the Grassmann
coordinates $\theta$ and their conjugate momentum and the fields, the internal degrees of freedom
of which are functions of the Clifford $\gamma^{a}$. Inspiration comes from the spin-charge-family
theory with the action for fermions in $d$-dimensional space is $ \int \; d^dx \; E\;\frac{1}{2}\,
(\bar{\psi} \, \gamma^a p_{0a} \psi) + h.c.$, $p_{0a} = f^{\alpha}{}_a p_{0\alpha} +\frac{1}{2E}\,
\{ p_{\alpha}, E f^{\alpha}{}_a\}_- $, $ p_{0\alpha}=$ $ p_{\alpha} - \frac{1}{2} S^{ab} \omega_{ab
\alpha} - \frac{1}{2} \tilde{S}^{ab} \tilde{\omega}_{ab \alpha}$. We write the basic states
of the Grassmann fields and the Clifford fields as a function of products of either Grassmann or Clifford
objects, trying to understand "the choice of nature". We look for the action for free fields in Grassmann
and Clifford space to understand why Clifford algebra "wins" in the competition for the physical
degrees of freedom.
