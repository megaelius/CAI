The $1/Z$-expansion for the Coulomb system of infinitely massive center of charge Z and two electrons
(two electron ion) is discussed. Critical analysis of Baker et al, {\em Phys. Rev. \bf A41}, 1247
(1990) is performed and its numerical deficiency, in particular, leading in the first 50 coefficients
of $1/Z$-expansion to systematically incorrect decimal digits beyond 11-12th is indicated. Correct
calculations of some coefficients due to C. Schwartz (2013) are presented. Checking consistency
it is shown that weighted sums of $1/Z$-expansion with the Schwartz coefficients complemented
by ones due to Baker et al. but cut beyond 12th decimal digits reproduce the ground state energies
of two-electron ions with $Z \geq 2$ with 15 decimal digits. Ground state energies of two-electron
ions $Z=11\ (Na^{9+})$ and $Z=12\ (Mg^{10+})$ are found with 15 decimal digits. It is demonstrated
that the ground state energy behavior {\it vs.} $Z$ in vicinity of the critical charge $[Z_{cr} \,\div
\, 1.25]$ is described accurately by a terminated Puiseux expansion with integer and half-integer
degrees being consistent with the critical charge and the linear slope found in Estienne et al. (2014).
It suggests the existence of the square-root branch point at $Z_{cr}$ with exponent 3/2. Close consistency
of the Puiseux expansion with the results of calculations of the higher order coefficients $e_{100,200}$
in $1/Z$-expansion, carried out by Baker et al. and checked by Schwartz, is indicated. It favors
the Reinhardt conjecture about a connection between the radius of convergency $\lambda_{\star}$
of $1/Z$-expansion and the critical charge, $\lambda_{\star}=\frac{1}{Z_{cr}}$.
