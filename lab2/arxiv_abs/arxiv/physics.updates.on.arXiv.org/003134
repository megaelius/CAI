Extreme confinement of electromagnetic energy by phonon polaritons holds the promise of strong
and new forms of control over the dynamics of matter. To bring such control to the atomic-scale limit,
it is important to consider phonon polaritons in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Recent studies
have pointed out that in 2D, splitting between longitudinal and transverse optical (LO and TO) phonons
is absent at the $\Gamma$ point, even for polar materials. Does this lack of LO--TO splitting imply
the absence of a phonon polariton in polar monolayers? Here, we derive a first-principles expression
for the conductivity of a polar monolayer specified by the wavevector-dependent LO and TO phonon
dispersions. In the long-wavelength (local) limit, we find a universal form for the conductivity
in terms of the LO phonon frequency at the $\Gamma$ point, its lifetime, and the group velocity of
the LO phonon. Our analysis reveals that the phonon polariton of 2D is simply the LO phonon of the 2D
system. For the specific example of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we estimate the confinement
and propagation losses of the LO phonons, finding that high confinement and reasonable propagation
quality factors coincide in regions which may be difficult to detect with current near-field optical
microscopy techniques. Finally, we study the interaction of external emitters with two-dimensional
hBN nanostructures, finding extreme enhancement of spontaneous emission due to coupling with
localized 2D phonon polaritons, and the possibility of multi-mode strong and ultra-strong coupling
between an external emitter and hBN phonons. This may lead to the design of new hybrid states of electrons
and phonons based on strong coupling.
