In real applications, drops always impact on solid walls with various inclinations. For the oblique
impact of a Leidenfrost drop, which has a vapor layer under its bottom surface to prevent its direct
contact with the superheated substrate, the drop can nearly frictionlessly slide along the substrate
accompanied by the spreading and the retracting. To individually study these processes, we experimentally
observe ethanol drops impact on superheated inclined substrates using high-speed imaging from
two different views synchronously. We first study the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature, which
mainly depends on the normal Weber number ${We}_\perp $. Then the substrate temperature is set to
be high enough to study the Leidenfrost drop behaviors. During the spreading process, drops always
keep uniform. And the maximum spreading factor $D_m/D_0$ follows a power-law dependence on the
large normal Weber number ${We}_\perp $ as $D_m/D_0 = \sqrt{We_\perp /12+2}$ for $We_\perp \geq
30$. During the retracting process, drops with low impact velocities become non-uniform due to
the gravity effect. For the sliding process, the residence time of all studied drops is nearly a constant,
which is not affected by the inclination and $We$ number. The frictionless vapor layer results in
the dimensionless sliding distance $L/D_0$ follows a power-law dependence on the parallel Weber
number $We_\parallel$ as $L/D_0 \propto We_\parallel^{1/2}$. Without direct contact with the
substrate, the behaviors of drops can be separately determined by ${We}_\perp $ and $We_\parallel$.
When the impact velocity is too high, the drop fragments into many tiny droplets, which is called
the splashing phenomenon. The critical splashing criterion is found to be $We_\perp ^*\simeq$
120 or $K_\perp = We_\perp Re_\perp^{1/2} \simeq$ 5300 in the current parameter regime.
