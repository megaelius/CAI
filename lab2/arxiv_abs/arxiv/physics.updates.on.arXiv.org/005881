We present a sequential data assimilation algorithm based on the ensemble Kalman inversion to estimate
the near-surface shear wave velocity profile and damping when heterogeneous data and a priori information
that can be represented in forms of (physical) equality and inequality constraints in the inverse
problem are available. Although non-invasive methods, such as surface wave testing, are efficient
and cost effective methods for inferring Vs profile, one should acknowledge that site characterization
using inverse analyses can yield erroneous results associated with the inverse problem non-uniqueness.
One viable solution to alleviate the inverse problem ill-posedness is to enrich the prior knowledge
and/or the data space with complementary observations. In the case of non-invasive methods, the
pertinent data are the dispersion curve of surface waves, typically resolved by means of active
source methods at high frequencies and passive methods at low frequencies. To improve the inverse
problem well-posedness, horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) data are commonly used jointly
with the dispersion data in the inversion. In this paper, we show that the joint inversion of dispersion
and strong motion downhole array data can also reduce the margins of uncertainty in the Vs profile
estimation. This is because acceleration time-series recorded at downhole arrays include both
body and surface waves and therefore can enrich the observational data space in the inverse problem
setting. We also show how the proposed algorithm can be modified to systematically incorporate
physical constraints that further enhance its well-posedness. We use both synthetic and real data
to examine the performance of the proposed framework in estimation of Vs profile and damping at the
Garner Valley downhole array, and compare them against the Vs estimations in previous studies.
