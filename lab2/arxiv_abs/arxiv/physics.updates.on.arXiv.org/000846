We propose a novel class of low-threshold single-frequency lasers based on a fourth order eigenwave
degeneracy in a pair of coupled periodic waveguides. The proposed lasing action is based on unconventional
Fabry-Perot cavity (FPC) resonances occurring near the degenerate band edge (DBE) in the dispersion
relation of the coupled periodic waveguides. The resulting "DBE laser" features a synchronous
operation of four degenerate Floquet-Bloch eigenwaves of the relevant periodic structure with
an optically-pumped active medium. We advance here a theory that describes degenerate waves in
coupled waveguides with non-linear gain, and analyze the lasing action in such FPC with DBE. The
principle feature of the DBE regime is that the FPC resonance frequency closest to the DBE frequency
becomes dominant enforcing mode selectivity. We demonstrate that the DBE laser has the lowest lasing
threshold in comparison to a regular band edge laser and a conventional laser in cavities with the
same loaded quality (Q) factor and length. In particular, the DBE laser, without mirror reflectors,
exhibits a lasing threshold which is an order of magnitude lower than that of a uniform FPC laser of
the same length and with very high mirror reflectivity. In addition, we show that the mode selection
scheme associated with the DBE ensures coherent single-frequency operation of the DBE laser in
contrast to the multifrequency nature of conventional uniform FPC lasers. Our proposed principle
of operation for laser is valuable for further developing active devices based on DBE properties,
and other applications including extremely sensitive sensors, four-wave mixing, saturable absorbers,
and filters.
