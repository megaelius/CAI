This paper studies the mechanisms of dispersion in the laminar flow through the pore space of a $3$-dimensional
porous medium. We focus on pre-asymptotic transport prior to the asymptotic hydrodynamic dispersion
regime, in which solute motion may be described by the average flow velocity and a hydrodynamic dispersion
coefficient. High performance numerical flow and transport simulations of solute breakthrough
at the outlet of a sand-like porous medium evidence marked deviations from the hydrodynamic dispersion
paradigm and identifies two distinct regimes. The first regime is characterized by a broad distribution
of advective residence times in single pores. The second regime is characterized by diffusive mass
transfer into low-velocity region in the wake of solute grains. These mechanisms are quantified
systematically in the framework of a time-domain random walk for the motion of marked elements (particles)
of the transported material quantity. The model is parameterized with the characteristics of the
porous medium under consideration and captures both pre-asymptotic regimes. Macroscale transport
is described by an integro-differential equation for solute concentration, whose memory kernels
are given in terms of the distribution of mean pore velocities and trapping times. This approach
quantifies the physical non-equilibrium caused by a broad distribution of mass transfer time scales,
both advective and diffusive, on the representative elementary volume (REV). Thus, while the REV
indicates the scale at which medium properties like porosity can be uniquely defined, this does
not imply that transport can be characterized by hydrodynamic dispersion.
