We survey temperature patterns and heat transport in convective boundary layers (CBLs) from the
perspective that these are emergent properties of far-from-equilibrium, complex dynamical systems.
We introduce a two-temperature (2T) toy model to define the cross-sectional areas of plumes, and
connect the scaling properties of temperature gradients, temperature variance and heat transport
to this area. We examine temperature ($T$) probability density functions and $w$-$T$ joint probability
density functions, $T$ spectra and $wT$ cospectra observed both within and above the surface friction
layer. Here $w$ is vertical velocity. In our discussion of $T$ spectra and $wT$ cospectra we focus
on the self-similarity property of the plumes and flux events above the SFL. We interpret the $z^{1/2}$
dependence of the mixed length scale for wavenumbers in the $T$ spectra as reflecting the cross-sectional
areas of the plumes, and so with the $z^{-1/2}$ form of the temperature profile, where $z$ is observation
height. We introduce new scaling results for $T$ spectra and $wT$ cospectra from within the surface
friction layer (SFL), based on a data from the SLTEST experiment. We confirm earlier results showing
that the scaling behaviours of $T$ spectra and $wT$ cospectra change for heights below $z/z_s<0.1$,
where $z_s$ the height of the SFL, and come to display properties associated with random diffusion.
We conclude by contrasting our interpretation of the role of buoyancy as a system-wide action in
CBL flows with that of Richardson, whose ideas inform the current interpretation of the statistical
fluid mechanics model of boundary-layer flows.
