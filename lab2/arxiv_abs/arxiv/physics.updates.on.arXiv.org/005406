We investigate the influence of parametric excitation on MEMS vibration energy harvesters for
energy autonomous sensor systems. In Industry 4.0 (or Industrial IoT) applications, interconnected
sensors provide a means of data acquisition for automated control of the manufacturing process.
Ensuring a continuous energy supply to the sensors is essential for their reliable operation. Manufacturing
machines usually display a wide spectrum of vibration frequencies which needs to be covered by an
array of harvester substructures in order to maintain the desired output level. We show that mechanical
structures designed to implement a Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator have an increased bandwidth
by exploiting several orders of parametric resonances. In contrast to concepts implementing parametric
amplification in a multi-mode scenario, our concept is based on a single mechanical mode. Therefore,
it is more robust against fabrication tolerances as the relevant multi-mode resonance conditions
do not need to be matched on the level of single chips. Using exact transient simulations and semi-analytic
models to showcase the relation of the Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator to the damped and driven Mathieu
equation, we show that parametric resonances highly increase the bandwidth of the output power
whenever high Helmholtz nonlinearities are present. To achieve the required nonlinearities,
we suggest nonlinear stress-strain curves and we propose to achieve such nonlinearities through
field-induced striction by magneto- or electrostriction. Thus, we are able to propose a novel energy
harvester concept incorporating strictive materials that exploits the effects of parametric
excitation to achieve broadband vibrational energy harvesting.
