Network science provides effective tools to model and analyze complex systems. However, the increasing
size of real-world networks becomes a major hurdle in order to understand their structure and topological
features. Therefore, mapping the original network into a smaller one while preserving its information
is an important issue. Extracting the so-called backbone of a network is a very challenging problem
that is generally handled either by coarse-graining or filter-based methods. Coarse-graining
methods reduce the network size by grouping similar nodes, while filter-based methods prune the
network by discarding nodes or edges based on a statistical property. In this paper, we propose and
investigate two filter-based methods exploiting the overlapping community structure in order
to extract the backbone in weighted networks. Indeed, highly connected nodes (hubs) and overlapping
nodes are at the heart of the network. In the first method, called "overlapping nodes ego backbone",
the backbone is formed simply from the set of overlapping nodes and their neighbors. In the second
method, called "overlapping nodes and hubs backbone", the backbone is formed from the set of overlapping
nodes and the hubs. For both methods, the links with the lowest weights are removed from the network
as long as a backbone with a single connected component is preserved. Experiments have been performed
on real-world weighted networks originating from various domains (social, co-appearance, collaboration,
biological, and technological) and different sizes. Results show that both backbone extraction
methods are quite similar. Furthermore, comparison with the most influential alternative filtering
method demonstrates the greater ability of the proposed backbones extraction methods to uncover
the most relevant parts of the network.
