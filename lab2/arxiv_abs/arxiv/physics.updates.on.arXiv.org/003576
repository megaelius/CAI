Here we derive a simplified mathematical model for calculating the energy exchange in resonant
and near-resonant triads consisting of weakly nonlinear internal gravity wave packets in weakly
non-uniform density stratifications. Such triad interactions are one of the mechanisms by which
high wavenumber internal waves lead to ocean turbulence and mixing via PSI. We assume each internal
wave to have a slowly varying amplitude and a rapidly varying phase (both in space and time), and derive
the amplitude evolution equations using the method of multiple scales. We show that although the
pump-wave approximation of PSI using the normal mode forms for a near-resonant triad predicts the
initial growth rates accurately, it fails to provide the complete picture of energy transfer. Each
near-resonant wave packet in a triad has to be of a larger size in comparison to a resonant wave packet
to exchange the same percentage of energy. Energy transfer in non-uniform stratification introduces
wave detuning, which may strongly affect the energy transfer process. When wave packet triads move
to a higher (lower) stratification from the base stratification where the triad conditions are
perfectly met, the group speed of the packets decrease (increase) and the non-linear coupling coefficients
increase (decrease). For waves packets with frequencies $\omega \approx N$, where $N$ is the buoyancy
frequency, even a small change in $N$ can cause a significant mismatch in the vertical wavenumbers.
This results in a sharp reduction in growth rates. Wave packet triads satisfying $\omega \ll N$ and
moving to a higher stratification causes increased growth rates. The energy transfer process between
resonant wave packet triads in a uniform stratification can be significantly different from the
case of a weakly varying stratification, provided all wave packets have nearly the same order of
magnitude of energy.
