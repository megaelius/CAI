Meaningful laws of nature must be independent of the units employed to measure the variables. The
principle of similitude (Rayleigh 1915) or dimensional homogeneity, states that only commensurable
quantities (ones having the same dimension) may be compared, therefore, meaningful laws of nature
must be homogeneous equations in their various units of measurement, a result which was formalized
in the $\rm \Pi$ theorem (Vaschy 1892; Buckingham 1914). However, most relations in allometry do
not satisfy this basic requirement, including the `3/4 Law' (Kleiber 1932) that relates the basal
metabolic rate and body mass, which it is sometimes claimed to be the most fundamental biological
rate (Brown et al. 2004) and the closest to a law in life sciences (West \& Brown 2004). Using the $\rm
\Pi$ theorem, here we show that it is possible to construct a unique homogeneous equation for the
metabolic rates, in agreement with data in the literature. We find that the variations in the dependence
of the metabolic rates on body mass are secondary, coming from variations in the allometric dependence
of the heart frequencies. This includes not only different classes of animals (mammals, birds,
invertebrates) but also different exercise conditions (basal and maximal). Our results demonstrate
that most of the differences found in the allometric exponents (White et al. 2007) are due to compare
incommensurable quantities and that our dimensionally homogenous formula, unify these differences
into a single formulation. We discuss the ecological implications of this new formulation in the
context of the Malthusian's, Fenchel's and Calder's relations.
