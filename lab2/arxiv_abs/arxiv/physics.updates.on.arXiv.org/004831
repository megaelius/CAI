A special surface discharge is proposed based on the multi-anode electrode geometry. Instead of
the traditional surface flashover of creepage on the insulator surface between the electrodes,
a surface discharge with one of the electrodes being placed far away from the insulator is achieved
in this paper. The unique electric field distribution due to the multi-anode electrode geometry
has a significant influence on the discharge process of the surface discharge. It changes the generation
and propagation process of the plasma, forming a plasma plume contributes to the propulsion performance
of the thruster. Through theoretical analysis of the obtained plume data, it is indicated that the
ablative pulsed plasma thruster based on multi-anode electrode geometry (short for multi-anode
APPT) promotes the internal pressure of the plasma jet during its propagation and significantly
increases the density and energy of charged particles. The discharge phenomena manifest that the
multi-anode APPT and the helix-coil multi-anode APPT effectively increase the intensity of the
plasma plume. Through electron density spatial distribution measurement, it has been found that
the helix-coil multi-anode APPT increases the density of plasma in the axial direction to more than
4 times of the conventional coaxial APPT and reduces the electron density in other directions. In
the propulsion test, it has been demonstrated that the multi-anode APPT and the helix-coil multi-anode
APPT have better performance in terms of the impulse bit and the thrust-to-power ratio. In addition,
it is also identified that the pinch effect will be enhanced with the increase of discharge power
and the propulsion performance is promoted more distinctly. The multi-anode APPT and the helixcoil
multi-anode APPT have been proved to have potential application advantage in the field of micro-satellite
propulsion.
