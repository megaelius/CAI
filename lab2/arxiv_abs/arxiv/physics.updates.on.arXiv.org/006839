Identifying the relative importance of the different transmission routes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
is an urgent research priority. To that end, the different transmission routes, and their role in
determining the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic are analyzed in this work. Probability of infection
caused by inhaling virus-laden droplets (initial, ejection diameters between $0.5-750\mu m$)
and the corresponding desiccated nuclei that mostly encapsulate the virions post droplet evaporation,
are individually calculated. At typical, air-conditioned yet quiescent indoor space, for average
viral loading, cough droplets of initial diameter between $10-50 \mu m$ have the highest infection
probability. However, by the time they are inhaled, the diameters reduce to about $1/6^{th}$ of
their initial diameters. While the initially near unity infection probability due to droplets
rapidly decays within the first $25s$, the small yet persistent infection probability of desiccated
nuclei decays appreciably only by $\mathcal{O} (1000s)$, assuming the virus sustains equally
well within the dried droplet nuclei as in the droplets. Combined with molecular collision theory
adapted to calculate frequency of contact between the susceptible population and the droplet/nuclei
cloud, infection rate constants are derived ab-initio, leading to a SEIR model applicable for any
respiratory event - vector combination. Viral load, minimum infectious dose, sensitivity of the
virus half-life to the phase of its vector and dilution of the respiratory jet/puff by the entraining
air are shown to mechanistically determine specific physical modes of transmission and variation
in the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$, from first principle calculations.
