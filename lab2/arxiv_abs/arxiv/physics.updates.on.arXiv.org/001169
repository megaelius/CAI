The $L$-$R$ symmetric composite model for quarks and leptons where constituent preons are bound
by the $SO(n)_{L}\times SO(n)_{R}$ gauge forces is reconsidered. We find that just the eight left-handed
and right-handed preons, their local metaflavor symmetry $SU(8)_{MF}$ and accompanying global
chiral symmetry $SU(8)_{L}\times SU(8)_{R}$ may determine physical world at small distances.
This result for an admissible number of preons filling the fundamental multiplet of some $SU(N)_{MF}$
symmetry group appears as a solution to the 't Hooft's anomaly matching condition precisely for
$N=8$, provided that this condition is satisfied separately for the $L$-preon and $R $-preon composites
which form individually a single multiplet of the $SU(N)$ rather than a set of its multiplets. We
next show that an appropriate $L$-$R$ symmetry violation reduces the vectorlike $SU(8)$ theory
initially emerged for the identical $L$-preon and $R$-preon composites down to the conventional
$SU(5)$ GUT with an extra local family symmetry $SU(3)_{F}$ and three standard generations of quarks
and leptons. Though the tiny radius of compositeness for universal preons composing both quarks
and leptons makes it impossible to immediately confirm their composite nature, a few special $%
SU(5)\times SU(3)_{F}$ multiplets of extra composite fermions located at the scales from $O(1)$
$TeV$ up to the Planck mass scale predicted by the theory may appear of actual experimental interest.
Some of them can be directly observed, the others populate the $SU(5)$ GUT desert. Due to their mixing
with ordinary quark-lepton families there may arise a marked violation of unitarity in the mass
matrices for leptons and down quarks depending on the interplay between the compositeness scale
and scale of the family symmetry $% SU(3)_{F}$.
