Evaporation kinetics of pendant droplets is an area of immense importance in several applications
in addition to possessing rich fluid and thermal transport physics. The present article experimentally
and analytically sheds insight into the augmented evaporation dynamics of paramagnetic pendent
droplets in the presence of a magnetic field stimulus. Literature provides information that solutal
advection and solutal Marangoni effect lead to enhancement of evaporation in droplets with ionic
inclusions. The major crux of the present article remains to modulate the thermosolutal advection
with the aid of magnetic field and comprehend the dynamics of the evaporation process under such
complex multiphysics interactions. Experimental observations reveal that the evaporation rate
enhances as a direct function of the magnetic moment of the solvated magnetic element ions, thereby
pinpointing at the magnetophoretic and magneto-solutal advection. Additionally, flow visualization
by PIV illustrates that the internal advection currents within the droplet are strengthened in
magnitude as well as distorted in orientation by the magnetic field. A mathematical formalism based
on magnetothermal and magnetosolutal advection effects has been proposed via scaling analysis
of the species and energy conservation equations. The formalism takes into account all major governing
factors such as the magnetothermal and magnetosolutal Marangoni numbers, magneto Prandtl and
magneto Schmidt numbers and the Hartmann number. The modeling establishes the magnetosolutal
advection component to be the domineering factor in augmented evaporation dynamics. Accurate
validation of the experimental internal circulation velocity is obtained from the proposed model.
The present study reveals rich insight on the magneto thermosolutal hydrodynamics aspects in paramagnetic
droplets.
