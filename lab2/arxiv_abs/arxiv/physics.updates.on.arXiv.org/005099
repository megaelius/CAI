We present vec2pix, a deep neural network designed to predict categorical or continuous 2D subsurface
property fields from one-dimensional measurement data (e.g., time series), thereby, offering
a new way to solve inverse problems. The method's capabilities are investigated through two types
of synthetic inverse problems: (a) a crosshole ground penetrating radar (GPR) tomography experiment
where GPR travel times are used to infer a 2D velocity field, and (2) a multi-well pumping experiment
within an unconfined aquifer for which time series of transient hydraulic heads serve to retrieve
a 2D hydraulic conductivity field. For each problem type, both a multi-Gaussian and a binary channelized
subsurface domain with long-range connectivity are considered. Using a training set of 20,000
examples, the method is found to always recover a 2D model that is in much closer agreement with the
true model than the closest training model in the forward-simulated data space. Even if the recovered
models by vec2pix are visually close to the true ones, the data misfits associated with their forward
responses are generally larger than the noise level that was used to contaminate the true data. If
fitting to the data noise level is required, then vec2pix-based inversion models can be used as initial
inputs for more traditional multiple-point statistics inversion. Apart from further improving
model reconstruction accuracy, more work is needed to provide an uncertainty assessment of the
inferred models. Despite these current limitations, this study opens up a promising research avenue
on how to use deep learning to infer subsurface models from indirect measurement data.
