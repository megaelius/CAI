We present a three-dimensional (3D) common-refinement method for non-matching meshes between
discrete non-overlapping subdomains of incompressible fluid and nonlinear hyperelastic structure.
To begin, we first investigate the accuracy of common-refinement method (CRM) to satisfy traction
equilibrium condition along the fluid-elastic interface with non-matching meshes. We systematically
assess the accuracy of CRM against the matching grid solution by varying grid mismatch between the
fluid and solid meshes over a cylindrical tubular elastic body. We demonstrate second-order accuracy
of CRM through uniform refinements of fluid and solid meshes along the interface. We then extend
the error analysis to transient data transfer across non-matching meshes between fluid and solid
solvers. We show that the common-refinement discretization across non-matching fluid-structure
grids yields accurate transfer of the physical quantities across the fluid-solid interface. We
next solve a 3D benchmark problem of a cantilevered hyperelastic plate behind a circular bluff body
and verify the accuracy of coupled solutions with respect to the available solution in the literature.
By varying the solid interface resolution, we generate various non-matching grid ratios and quantify
the accuracy of CRM for the nonlinear structure interacting with a laminar flow. We illustrate that
the CRM with the partitioned NIFC treatment is stable for low solid-to-fluid density ratio and non-matching
meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the 3D parallel implementation of common-refinement with NIFC
scheme for a realistic engineering problem of drilling riser undergoing complex vortex-induced
vibration with strong added mass effects.
