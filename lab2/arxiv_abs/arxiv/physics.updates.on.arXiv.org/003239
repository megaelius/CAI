This paper demonstrates the significant benefits of exploiting highly aligned porosity in piezoelectric
and pyroelectric materials for improved energy harvesting performance. Porous lead zirconate
(PZT) ceramics with aligned pore channels and varying fractions of porosity were manufactured
in a water-based suspension using freeze casting. The aligned porous PZT ceramics were characterized
in detail for both piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties and their energy harvesting performance
figures of merit were assessed parallel and perpendicular to the freezing direction. As a result
of the introduction of porosity into the ceramic microstrucutre, high piezoelectric and pyroelectric
harvesting figures of merits were achieved for porous freeze-cast PZT compared to dense PZT due
to the reduced permittivity and volume specific heat capacity. Experimental results were compared
to parallel and series analytical models with good agreement and the PZT with porosity aligned parallel
to the freezing direction exhibited the highest piezoelectric and pyroelectric harvesting response;
this was a result of the enhanced interconnectivity of the ferroelectric material along the poling
direction and reduced fraction of unpoled material that leads to a higher polarization. A complete
thermal energy harvesting system, composed of an parallel-aligned PZT harvester element and an
AC/DC converter successfully demonstrated by charging a storage capacitor. The maximum energy
density generated by the 60 vol.% porous parallel-connected PZT when subjected to thermal oscillations
was 1653 {\mu}J/cm3 respectively, which was 374% higher than that of the dense PZT with an energy
density of 446 {\mu}J/cm3. The results are of benefit for the design and manufacture of high performance
porous pyroelectric and piezoelectric materials in devices for energy harvesting and sensor applications.
