Cardiac growth and remodeling (G&R) refers to structural changes in myocardial tissue in response
to chronic alterations in loading conditions. One such condition is pressure overload where elevated
wall stresses stimulate the growth in cardiomyocyte thickness, associated with a phenotype of
concentric hypertrophy at the organ scale, and promote fibrosis. The initial hypertrophic response
can be considered adaptive and beneficial by favoring myocyte survival, but over time if pressure
overload conditions persist, maladaptive mechanisms favoring cell death and fibrosis start to
dominate, ultimately mediating the transition towards an overt heart failure phenotype. The underlying
mechanisms linking biological factors at the myocyte level to biomechanical factors at the systemic
and organ level remain poorly understood. Computational models of G&R show high promise as a unique
framework for providing a quantitative link between myocardial stresses and strains at the organ
scale to biological regulatory processes at the cellular level which govern the hypertrophic response.
However, microstructurally motivated, rigorously validated computational models of G&R are
still in their infancy. This article provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art of computational
models to study cardiac G&R. The microstructure and mechanosensing/mechanotransduction within
cells of the myocardium is discussed and quantitative data from previous experimental and clinical
studies is summarized. We conclude with a discussion of major challenges and possible directions
of future research that can advance the current state of cardiac G&R computational modeling.
