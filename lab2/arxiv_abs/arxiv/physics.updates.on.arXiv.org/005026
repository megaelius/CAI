Integration of heterogeneous sensors is a challenging problem across a range of applications.
Prominent among these are multi-target tracking, where one must combine observations from different
sensor types in a meaningful way to track multiple targets. Because sensors have differing error
models, we seek a theoretically-justified quantification of the agreement among ensembles of
sensors, both overall for a sensor collection, and also at a fine-grained level specifying pairwise
and multi-way interactions among sensors. We demonstrate that the theory of mathematical sheaves
provides a unified answer to this need, supporting both quantitative and qualitative data. The
theory provides algorithms to globalize data across the network of deployed sensors, and to diagnose
issues when the data do not globalize cleanly. We demonstrate the utility of sheaf-based tracking
models based on experimental data of a wild population of black bears in Asheville, North Carolina.
A measurement model involving four sensors deployed among the bears and the team of scientists charged
with tracking their location is deployed. This provides a sheaf-based integration model which
is small enough to fully interpret, but of sufficient complexity to demonstrate the sheaf's ability
to recover a holistic picture of the locations and behaviors of both individual bears and the bear-human
tracking system. A statistical approach was developed for comparison, a dynamic linear model which
was estimated using a Kalman filter. This approach also recovered bear and human locations and sensor
accuracies. When the observations are normalized into a common coordinate system, the structure
of the dynamic linear observation model recapitulates the structure of the sheaf model, demonstrating
the canonicity of the sheaf-based approach. But when the observations are not so normalized, the
sheaf model still remains valid.
