A theoretical framework and computer code are developed for accurate calculations of coupled rotational-vibrational
states in triatomic molecules using hyper-spherical coordinates and taking into account the Coriolis
coupling effect. Concise final formulae are derived for construction of the Hamiltonian matrix
using an efficient combination of the FBR and DVR methods with locally optimized basis sets and grids.
First, the new code is tested by comparing its results with those of the APH3D program of Kendrick.
Then, accurate calculations of the ro-vibrational spectra are carried out for doubly substituted
symmetric (18O16O18O) and asymmetric (18O18O16O) ozone isotopomers for total angular momentum
up to J=5. Together with similar data recently reported for the singly substituted symmetric (16O18O16O)
and asymmetric (16O16O18O) ozone isotopomers, these calculations quantify the role of the Coriolis
coupling effect in the large mass-independent isotopic enrichment of ozone, observed in both laboratory
experiments and the atmosphere of Earth. It is found that the Coriolis effect in ozone is relatively
small, as evidenced by deviations of its rotational constants from the symmetric-top-rotor behavior,
by the magnitudes of parity splittings ({\Lambda}-doubling), and by the ratios of ro-vibrational
partition functions for asymmetric vs. symmetric ozone molecules. It is concluded that all of these
characteristics are influenced by the isotopic masses as much as they are influenced by the overall
symmetry of the molecule. It is therefore unlikely that the Coriolis coupling effect could be responsible
for symmetry-driven mass-independent fractionation of oxygen isotopes in ozone.
