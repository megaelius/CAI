Morphogenesis in whole-body regeneration requires the dynamic interplay of three types of processes:
biochemical, mechanical and electrical, which span all scales from the molecular to the entire
organism. Despite significant progress in elucidating the role of these processes in morphogenesis,
understanding their integration into a robust body-plan remains elusive. Here we employ external
electric fields and study their effect on morphogenesis during Hydra regeneration. We show the
existence of a critical electric field at which the process of morphogenesis halts. Remarkably,
above this critical field morphogenesis exhibits reversal dynamics; a fully developed animal
flows back into its incipient spheroid morphology, which nevertheless can regenerate again when
the amplitude of the external electric field is reduced below criticality. This controlled backward-forward
cycle of morphogenesis can be repeated several times. The folding back of morphology is accompanied
by the gradual decay of the Wnt3 activity, a central component of the head organizer in Hydra, which
re-emerges upon renewed regeneration. We further show that electric-induced reversal of morphogenesis
is triggered by enhanced electrical activity of the Hydra tissue. The external field stimulates
an increase in the epithelium spike-like calcium activity, which in turn is demonstrated to follow
electrical spike bursts. The existence of a ~1 kHz upper frequency cutoff of the external AC field
and the emergence of similar behavior at an elevated external potassium (K+) concentration, strengthen
the conclusion that enhanced electrical excitability is the underlying mechanism of morphogenesis
reversal. Controlled reversal trajectories open a new vista on morphogenesis and suggest a novel
approach to study regeneration as well as potential applications in regenerative medicine.
