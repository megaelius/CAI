We consider the frequency domain form of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) called spectral
proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). SPOD is derived from a space-time POD problem for stationary
flows and leads to modes that each oscillate at a single frequency. This form of POD goes back to the
original work of Lumley (Stochastic tools in turbulence, Academic Press, 1970), but has been overshadowed
by a space-only form of POD since the 1990s. We clarify the relationship between these two forms of
POD and show that SPOD modes represent structures that evolve coherently in space and time while
space-only POD modes do not. We also establish a relationship between SPOD and dynamic mode decomposition
(DMD); we show that SPOD modes are in fact optimally averaged DMD modes obtained from an ensemble
DMD problem for stationary flows. Accordingly, SPOD modes represent structures that are dynamic
in the same sense as DMD modes but also optimally account for the statistical variability of turbulent
flows. Finally, we establish a connection between SPOD and resolvent analysis. The key observation
is that the resolvent-mode expansion coefficients, which are usually treated as deterministic
quantities described by an amplitude and phase, should be regarded as statistical quantities,
described by their cross-spectral density, in order for the resolvent-mode expansion to properly
capture the flow statistics. When the expansion coefficients are uncorrelated, we show that SPOD
and resolvent modes are identical. Our theoretical results and the overall utility of SPOD are demonstrated
using two example problems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a turbulent jet.
