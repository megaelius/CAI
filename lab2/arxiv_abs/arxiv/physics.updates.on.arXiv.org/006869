Next-generation high-power lasers that can be focused to intensities exceeding 10^23 W/cm^2 are
enabling new physics and applications. The physics of how these lasers interact with matter is highly
nonlinear, relativistic, and can involve lowest-order quantum effects. The current tool of choice
for modeling these interactions is the particle-in-cell (PIC) method. In strong fields, the motion
of charged particles and their spin is affected by radiation reaction. Standard PIC codes usually
use Boris or its variants to advance the particles, which requires very small time steps in the strong-field
regime to obtain accurate results. In addition, some problems require tracking the spin of particles,
which creates a 9D particle phase space (x, u, s). Therefore, numerical algorithms that enable high-fidelity
modeling of the 9D phase space in the strong-field regime are desired. We present a new 9D phase space
particle pusher based on analytical solutions to the position, momentum and spin advance from the
Lorentz force, together with the semi-classical form of RR in the Landau-Lifshitz equation and
spin evolution given by the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation. These analytical solutions are
obtained by assuming a locally uniform and constant electromagnetic field during a time step. The
solutions provide the 9D phase space advance in terms of a particle's proper time, and a mapping is
used to determine the proper time step for each particle from the simulation time step. Due to the
analytical integration, the constraint on the time step needed to resolve trajectories in ultra-high
fields can be greatly reduced. We present single-particle simulations and full PIC simulations
to show that the proposed particle pusher can greatly improve the accuracy of particle trajectories
in 9D phase space for given laser fields. A discussion on the numerical efficiency of the proposed
pusher is also provided.
