Synergy, emerges from synchronized reciprocal positive feedback loops between a network of diverse
actors. For this process to proceed, compatible information from different sources synchronically
coordinates the actions of the actors resulting in a nonlinear increase in the useful work or potential
energy the system can manage. In contrast noise is produced when incompatible information is mixed.
This synergy produced from the coordination of different agents achieves non-linear gains in energy
and/or information that are greater than the sum of the parts. The final product of new synergies
is an increase in the autonomy of an organism or increased emancipation from the environment with
increases in productivity, efficiency, capacity for flexibility, self-regulation and self-control
of behavior through a synchronized division of ever more specialized labor. Synergistic is the
interdisciplinary science studying the formation and self-organization of patterns and structures
in partially open systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Understanding the mechanisms that
produce synergy helps to increase success rates in everyday life, in business, in science, in economics
and in increasing, yet to be named areas. Biological evolution achieves synergy by exploiting division
of labor, serendipity and assortation (like with like: the combination of similar or compatible
agents or information), to reduce the chances of noisy mismatches. Empirical evidence in many domains
show that assortative information matching increases the probability of achieving synergy. The
roots of synergy are the evolutionary forces (variation, reproduction and selection) that promote
information (or negentropy) to increase at the same time as free energy or the power to produce useful
work.
