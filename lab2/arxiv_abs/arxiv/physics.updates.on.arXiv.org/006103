Amorphous materials exhibit complex material proprteties with strongly nonlinear behaviors.
Below a yield stress they behave as plastic solids, while they start to yield above a critical stress
$\Sigma_c$. A key quantity controlling plasticity which is, however, hard to measure is the density
$P(x)$ of weak spots, where $x$ is the additional stress required for local plastic failure. In the
thermodynamic limit $P(x)\sim x^\theta$ is singular at $x= 0$ in the solid phase below the yield
stress $\Sigma_c$. This singularity is related to the presence of system spannig avalanches of
plastic events. Here we address the question if the density of weak spots and the flow properties
of a material can be determined from the geometry of an amporphous structure alone. We show that a
vertex model for cell packings in tissues exhibits the phenomenology of plastic amorphous systems.
As the yield stress is approached from above, the strain rate vanishes and the avalanches size $S$
and their duration $\tau$ diverge. We then show that in general, in materials where the energy functional
depend on topology, the value $x$ is proportional to the length $L$ of a bond that vanishes in a plastic
event. For this class of models $P(x)$ is therefore readily measurable from geometry alone. Applying
this approach to a quantification of the cell packing geometry in the developing wing epithelium
of the fruit fly, we find that in this tissue $P(L)$ exhibits a power law with exponents similar to
those found numerically for a vertex model in its solid phase. This suggests that this tissue exhibits
plasticity and non-linear material properties that emerge from collective cell behaviors and
that these material properties govern developmental processes. Our approach based on the relation
between topology and energetics suggests a new route to outstanding questions associated with
the yielding transition.
