We develop a simple 3-dimensional iterative map model to forecast the global spread of the coronavirus
disease. Our model contains at most two fitting parameters, which we determine from the data supplied
by the world health organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that
our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data, which exhibits a cross-over
from exponential to power-law growth, as lock-down measures begin to take effect. Before these
measures, our model predicts exponential growth from day 30 to 69, starting from the date on which
the world health organisation provided the first `Situation report' (21 January 2020 $-$ day 1).
Based on this initial data the disease may be expected to infect approximately 23% of the global population,
i.e. about 1.76 billion people, taking approximately 83 million lives. Under this scenario, the
global number of new cases is predicted to peak on day 133 (about the middle of May 2020), with an estimated
60 million new cases per day. If current lock-down measures can be maintained, our model predicts
power law growth from day 69 onward. Such growth is comparatively slow and would have to continue
for several decades before a sufficient number of people (at least 23% of the global population)
have developed immunity to the disease through being infected. Lock-down measures appear to be
very effective in postponing the unimaginably large peak in the daily number of new cases that would
occur in the absence of any interventions. However, should these measure be relaxed, the spread
of the disease will most likely revert back to its original exponential growth pattern. As such,
the duration and severity of the lock-down measures should be carefully timed against their potentially
devastating impact on the world economy.
