Recent experiments have demonstrated that small-scale rotary devices installed in a microfluidic
channel can be driven passively by the underlying flow alone without resorting to conventionally
applied magnetic or electric fields. In this work, we conduct a theoretical and numerical study
on such a flow-driven "watermill" at low Reynolds number, focusing on its hydrodynamic features.
We model the watermill by a collection of equally-spaced rigid rods. Based on the classical resistive
force (RF) theory and direct numerical simulations, we compute the watermill's instantaneous
rotational velocity as a function of its rod number $N$, position and orientation. When $N \geq 4$,
the RF theory predicts that the watermill's rotational velocity is independent of $N$ and its orientation,
implying the full rotational symmetry (of infinity order), even though the geometrical configuration
exhibits a lower-fold rotational symmetry; the numerical solutions including hydrodynamic interactions
show a weak dependence on $N$ and the orientation. In addition, we adopt a dynamical system approach
to identify the equilibrium positions of the watermill and analyse their stability. We further
compare the theoretically and numerically derived rotational velocities, which agree with each
other in general, while considerable discrepancy arises in certain configurations owing to the
hydrodynamic interactions neglected by the RF theory. We confirm this conclusion by employing
the RF-based asymptotic framework incorporating hydrodynamic interactions for a simpler watermill
consisting of two or three rods and we show that accounting for hydrodynamic interactions can significantly
enhance the accuracy of the theoretical predictions.
