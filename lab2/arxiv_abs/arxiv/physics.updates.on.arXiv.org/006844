The Bell inequality is thought to be a common constraint shared by all models of local hidden variables
that aim to describe the entangled states of two qubits. Since the inequality is violated by the quantum
mechanical description of these states, it purportedly allows distinguishing in an experimentally
testable way the predictions of quantum mechanics from those of models of local hidden variables
and, ultimately, ruling the latter out. In this paper, we show, however, that the models of local
hidden variables constrained by the Bell inequality all share a subtle, though crucial, feature
that is not required by fundamental physical principles and, hence, it might not be fulfilled in
the actual experimental setup that tests the inequality. Indeed, the disputed feature neither
can be properly implemented within the standard framework of quantum mechanics and it is even at
odds with the fundamental principle of relativity. Namely, the proof of the inequality requires
the existence of a preferred absolute frame of reference (supposedly provided by the lab) with respect
to which the hidden properties of the entangled particles and the orientations of each one of the
measurement devices that test them can be independently defined through a long sequence of realizations
of the experiment. We notice, however, that while the relative orientation between the two measurement
devices is a properly defined physical magnitude in every single realization of the experiment,
their global rigid orientation with respect to a lab frame is a spurious gauge degree of freedom.
Following this observation, we were able to explicitly build a model of local hidden variables that
does not share the disputed feature and, hence, it is able to reproduce the predictions of quantum
mechanics for the entangled states of two qubits.
