It has been recently shown that the energy-containing motions in turbulent channel flow exist in
the form of Townsend's attached eddies by a numerical experiment which simulates the energy-containing
motions only at a prescribed spanwise length scale using their self-sustaining nature (Hwang,
2015, J. Fluid Mech., 767, p254). In the present study, a detailed investigation of the self-sustaining
process of the energy-containing motions at each spanwise length scale (i.e. the attached eddies)
in the logarithmic and outer regions is carried out with an emphasis on its relevance to 'bursting',
which refers to an energetic temporal oscillation of the motions (Flores & Jim\'enez, 2010, Phys.
Fluids, 22, 071704). It is shown that the attached eddies in the logarithmic and outer regions, composed
of streaks and quasi-streamwise vortical structures, bear the self-sustaining process remarkably
similar to that in the near-wall region: i.e. the streaks are significantly amplified by the quasi-streamwise
vortices via the lift-up effect; the amplified streaks subsequently undergo a 'rapid streamwise
meandering motion', reminiscent of streak instability or transient growth, which eventually
results in breakdown of the streaks and regeneration of new quasi-streamwise vortices. Two numerical
experiments, designed to artificially suppress the lift-up effect and the streak meandering motions,
respectively, reveal that these processes are essential ingredients of the self-sustaining process
of the attached eddies in the logarithmic and outer regions, consistent with several previous theoretical
studies. It is also shown that the artificial suppression of the lift-up effect of the attached eddies
in the logarithmic and outer regions leads to substantial amounts of turbulent skin-friction reduction.
