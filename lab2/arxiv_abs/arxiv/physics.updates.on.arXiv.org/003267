We model the settlement of the galaxy by space-faring civilizations in order to address issues related
to the Fermi Paradox. We explore the problem in a way that avoids assumptions about the intent and
motivation of any exo-civilization seeking to settle other planetary systems. We first consider
the speed of an advancing settlement via probes of finite velocity and range to determine if the galaxy
can become inhabited with space-faring civilizations on timescales shorter than its age. We also
include the effect of stellar motions on the long term behavior of the settlement front which adds
a diffusive component to its advance. The results of these models demonstrate that the Milky Way
can be readily 'filled-in' with settled stellar systems under conservative assumptions about
interstellar spacecraft velocities and launch rates. We then consider the question of the galactic
steady-state achieved in terms of the fraction of settled planets. We do this by considering the
effect of finite settlement civilization lifetimes on the steady states. We find a range of parameters
for which the galaxy supports a population of interstellar space-faring civilizations even though
some settleable systems are uninhabited. Both results point to ways in which Earth might remain
unvisited in the midst of an inhabited galaxy. Finally we consider how our results can be combined
with the finite horizon for evidence of previous settlements in Earth's geologic record. Our steady-state
model can constrain the probabilities for an Earth visit by a settling civilization before a given
time horizon. These results break the link between Hart's famous "Fact A" (no interstellar visitors
on Earth now) and the conclusion that humans must, therefore, be the only technological civilization
in the galaxy.
