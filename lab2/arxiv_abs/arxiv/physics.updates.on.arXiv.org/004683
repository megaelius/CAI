The magnetic presheath is a boundary layer occurring when magnetized plasma is in contact with a
wall and the angle $\alpha$ between the wall and the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is oblique. Here, we
consider the fusion-relevant case of a shallow-angle, $\alpha \ll 1$, electron-repelling sheath,
with the electron density given by a Boltzmann distribution, valid for $\alpha / \sqrt{\tau+1}
\gg \sqrt{m_{\text{e}}/m_{\text{i}}}$, where $m_{\text{e}}$ is the electron mass, $m_{\text{i}}$
is the ion mass, $\tau = T_{\text{i}}/ZT_{\text{e}}$, $T_{\text{e}}$ is the electron temperature,
$T_{\text{i}}$ is the ion temperature, and $Z$ is the ionic charge state. The thickness of the magnetic
presheath is of the order of a few ion sound Larmor radii $\rho_{\text{s}} = \sqrt{m_{\text{i}}
\left(ZT_{\text{e}} + T_{\text{i}} \right) } / ZeB$, where $e$ is the proton charge and $B = |\vec{B}|$
is the magnitude of the magnetic field. We study the dependence on $\tau $ of the electrostatic potential
and ion distribution function in the magnetic presheath by using a set of prescribed ion distribution
functions at the magnetic presheath entrance, parameterized by $\tau$. The kinetic model is shown
to be asymptotically equivalent to Chodura's fluid model at small ion temperature, $\tau \ll 1$,
for $|\ln \alpha| > 3|\ln \tau | \gg 1$. In this limit, despite the fact that fluid equations give a
reasonable approximation to the potential, ion gyro-orbits acquire a spatial extent that occupies
a large portion of the magnetic presheath. At large ion temperature, $\tau \gg 1$, relevant because
$T_{\text{i}}$ is measured to be a few times larger than $T_{\text{e}}$ near divertor targets of
fusion devices, ions reach the Debye sheath entrance (and subsequently the wall) at a shallow angle
whose size is given by $\sqrt{\alpha}$ or $1/\sqrt{\tau}$, depending on which is largest.
