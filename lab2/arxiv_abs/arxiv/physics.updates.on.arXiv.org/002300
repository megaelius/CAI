Here we first revisit the celebrated Boussinesq approximation in stratified flows. Using scaling
arguments we show that when the background shear is weak, Boussinesq approximation yields (i) either
the Atwood number, $A_t\ll \mathcal{O}(1)$ or (ii) $Fr_c^2 \ll \mathcal{O}(1)$, where $Fr_c$
is the ratio of the phase speed to the long wave speed. The second clause implies, contrary to the commonly
accepted notion, that a flow with large density variations can also be Boussinesq. Indeed, we show
that deep water surface gravity waves are Boussinesq while shallow water waves are not. However,
in the presence of moderate or strong shear, Boussinesq approximation implies the conventionally
accepted condition: $A_t\ll \mathcal{O}(1)$. To understand the inertial effects of density variation,
we explore various non-Boussinesq shear flows and study different kinds of neutral waves that can
be present at an interface between two fluids of different background densities and vorticities.
Three kinds of density interfaces -- neutral, stable and unstable -- embedded in a background shear
layer, are investigated. Instabilities ensuing from these configurations, which includes Kelvin-Helmholtz,
Holmboe, Rayleigh-Taylor and triangular-jet, are studied in terms of resonant wave interactions.
The effects of $A_t$ and the shear Froude number, $Fr$ on the stability of each of these flow configurations
are explored. Some of the results, e.g. the destabilizing role of density stratification, stabilizing
role of shear, etc. are apparently counter-intuitive, but physical explanations are possible
if the instabilities are interpreted from wave interactions perspective. A new vorticity-like
quantity called momentor, defined as the curl of momentum, is proposed, which incorporates the
effect of density stratification in describing solid-body like rotation in density stratified
flows.
