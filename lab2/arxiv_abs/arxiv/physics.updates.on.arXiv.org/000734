We study the causes of anomalous dispersion in Darcy-scale porous media characterized by spatially
heterogeneous hydraulic properties. Spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity leads to
spatial variability in the flow properties through Darcy's law and thus impacts on solute and particle
transport. We consider purely advective transport in heterogeneity scenarios characterized
by broad distributions of heterogeneity length scales and point values. Particle transport is
characterized in terms of the stochastic properties of equidistantly sampled Lagrangian velocities,
which are determined by the flow and conductivity statistics. The persistence length scales of
flow and transport velocities are imprinted in the spatial disorder and reflect the distribution
of heterogeneity length scales. Particle transitions over the velocity length scales are kinematically
coupled with the transition time through velocity. We show that the average particle motion follows
a coupled continuous time random walk (CTRW), which is fully parameterized by the distribution
of flow velocities and the medium geometry in terms of the heterogeneity length scales. The coupled
CTRW provides a systematic framework for the investigation of the origins of anomalous dispersion
in terms of heterogeneity correlation and the distribution of heterogeneity point values. Broad
distributions of heterogeneity point values and lengths scales may lead to very similar dispersion
behaviors in terms of the spatial variance. Their mechanisms, however are very different, which
manifests in the distributions of particle positions and arrival times, which plays a central role
for the prediction of the fate of dissolved substances in heterogeneous natural and engineered
porous materials.
