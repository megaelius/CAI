The surface detector (SD) array of the Pierre Auger Observatory containing at present 1680 water
Cherenkov detectors spread over an area of 3000 km^2 started to operate since 2004. The currently
used Front-End Boards are equipped with no-more produced ACEX and obsolete Cyclone FPGA (40 MSps/15-bit
of dynamic range). Huge progress in electronics and new challenges from physics impose a significant
upgrade of the SD electronics either to improve a quality of measurements (much higher sampling
and much wider dynamic range) or pick-up from a background extremely rare events (new FPGA algorithms
based on sophisticated approaches like e.g. spectral triggers or neural networks). Much higher
SD sensitivity is necessary to confirm or reject hypotheses critical for a modern astrophysics.
The paper presents the Front-End Board (FEB) with the biggest Cyclone V E FPGA 5CEFA9F31I7N, supporting
8 channels sampled with max. 250 MSps @ 14-bit resolution. Considered sampling for the SD is 120 MSps,
however, the FEB has been developed with external anti-aliasing filters to keep a maximal flexibility.
Six channels are targeted to the SD, two the rest for other experiments like: Auger Engineering Radio
Array and additional muon counters. The FEB is an intermediate design pluged-in the actually used
Unified Board communicating with micro-controller at 40 MHz, however providing even 250 MSPs sampling
with 20-bit dynamic range, equipped in a virtual NIOS processor and supporting 256 MB of SDRAM as
well as with an implemented spectral trigger based on the Discrete Cosine Transform for a detection
of very inclined "old" showers. The FEB can also support a neural network developing for a detection
of "young" showers, potentially generated by neutrinos.
