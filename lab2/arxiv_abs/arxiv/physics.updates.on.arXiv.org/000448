We investigated the spectral and compositional properties of Chelyabinsk meteorite to identify
its possible parent body in the main asteroid belt. Our analysis shows that the meteorite contains
two spectrally distinct but compositionally indistinguishable components of LL5 chondrite and
shock blackened/impact melt material. Our X-ray diffraction analysis confirms that the two lithologies
of the Chelyabinsk meteorite are extremely similar in modal mineralogy. The meteorite is compositionally
similar to LL chondrite and its most probable parent asteroid in the main belt is a member of the Flora
family. Intimate mixture of LL5 chondrite and shock blackened/impact melt material from Chelyabinsk
provides a spectral match with (8) Flora, the largest asteroid in the Flora family. The Baptistina
family and Flora family overlap each other in dynamical space. Mineralogical analysis of (298)
Baptistina and 9 small family members shows that their surface compositions are similar to LL chondrites,
although their absorption bands are subdued and albedos lower when compared to typical S-type asteroids.
A range of intimate mixtures of LL5 chondrite and shock blackened/impact melt material from Chelyabinsk
provides spectral matches for all these BAF members. We suggest that the presence of a significant
shock/impact melt component in the surface regolith of BAF members could be the cause of lower albedo
and subdued absorption bands. The parent asteroid of BAF was either a member of the Flora family or
had the same basic composition as the Floras (LL Chondrite). The shock pressures produced during
the impact event generated enough impact melt or shock blackening to alter the spectral properties
of BAF, but keep the BAF composition largely unchanged.
