Targeted immunization or attacks of large-scale networks has attracted significant attention
by the scientific community. However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of
the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize
(or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here,
we study a novel immunization strategy where only $n$ nodes are observed at a time and the most central
between these $n$ nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until
$1-p$ fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this
approach and determine the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ and the size of the giant component
$P_{\infty}$ for networks with arbitrary degree distributions $P(k)$. In the limit of $n\to\infty$
we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for $n=1$ we recover the known case of random failure.
Between these two extremes, we observe that as $n$ increases, $p_c$ increases quickly towards its
optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular,
we find a new scaling relationship between $|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|$ and $n$ as $|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|\sim
n^{-1}\exp(-\alpha n)$. For Scale-free (SF) networks, where $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}, 2<\gamma<3$,
we find that $p_c$ has a transition from zero to non-zero when $n$ increases from $n=1$ to order of
$\log N$ ($N$ is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, knowledge of order of $\log N$ nodes and
immunizing them can reduce dramatically an epidemics.
