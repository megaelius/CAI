Methods for reducing and directly controlling the speed of DNA through a nanopore are needed to enhance
sensing performance for direct strand sequencing and detection/mapping of sequence-specific
features. We have created a method for reducing and controlling the speed of DNA that uses two independently
controllable nanopores operated with an active control logic. The pores are positioned sufficiently
close to permit co-capture of a single DNA by both pores. Once co-capture occurs, control logic turns
on constant competing voltages at the pores leading to a `tug-of-war' whereby the molecule is pulled
from both ends by opposing forces. These forces exert both conformational and speed control over
the co-captured molecule, removing folds and reducing the translocation rate. When the voltages
are tuned so that the electrophoretic force applied to both ends of the molecule comes into balance,
the life-time of the tug-of-war state is limited purely by diffusive sliding of the DNA between the
pores. We are able to produce a tug-of-war state on 76.8% of molecules that are captured with a maximum
two-order of magnitude increase in average pore translocation time relative to the average time
for single-pore translocation. Moreover, we quantify the translocation slow-down as a function
of voltage tuning and show that the slow-down is well described by a first passage analysis for a one-dimensional
sub-diffusive process. The ionic current of each nanopore provides an independent sensor that
synchronously measures a different region of the same molecule, enabling sequential detection
of physical labels, such as mono-streptavidin tags. With advances in devices and control logic,
future dual-pore applications include genome mapping and enzyme-free sequencing.
