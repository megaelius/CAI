Using super-heterodyne Doppler velocimetry with multiple scattering correction, we extend the
opti-cally accessible range of concentrations in experiments on colloidal electro-kinetics.
We here meas-ured the electro-phoretic mobility and the DC conductivity of aqueous charged sphere
suspensions covering about three orders of magnitude in particle concentrations and transmissions
as low as 40%. The extended concentration range for the first time allows the demonstration of a non-monotonic
con-centration dependence of the mobility for a single particle species. Our observations reconcile
previ-ous experimental observations made on other species over restricted concentration ranges.
We com-pare our results to state of the art theoretical calculations using a constant particle charge
and the carefully determined experimental boundary conditions as input. In particular, we consider
so-called realistic salt free conditions, i.e. we respect the release of counter-ions by the particles,
the solvent hydrolysis and the formation of carbonic acid from dissolved neutral CO2. We also compare
to previ-ous results obtained under similarly well-defined conditions. This allows identification
of three dis-tinct regions of differing density dependence. An ascent during the built up of double
layer overlap which is not expected by theory, an extended plateau region in quantitative agreement
with theoretical expectation based on a constant effective charge and a sudden decrease which occurs
way before the expected gradual decrease. Our observations suggest a relation of the non-monotonic
behavior to a decrease of particle charge, and we tentatively discuss possibly underlying mechanisms.
