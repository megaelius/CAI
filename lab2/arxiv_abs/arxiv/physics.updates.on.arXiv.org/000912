The proposed underground Iron CALorimeter (ICAL) detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory(INO)
can be used to study highly energetic atmospheric muons. ICAL being a magnetized detector is capable
of identifying the charge of the particles, hence we can identify $\mu^{+}$ and $\mu^{-}$. A GEANT4
based code has been developed by the INO collaboration to simulate the ICAL geometry. In this work
we have added the real topography of the hill to the detector (INO-ICAL) code and estimated the amount
of energy that the muon will lose, while passing through the rock shield to reach the detector. The
threshold energy of the muon for reaching the detector and momentum reconstruction from the INO
peak is around 1600 GeV. A cosmic muon flux is generated at the top of the hill using CORSIKA(Cosmic
ray generator) and then this flux is passed through the rock overburden to the detector. A detailed
study of the muon charge ratio using CORSIKA and "pika" model is performed for INO. Highly energetic
muons will enter the detector and give tracks in the detector, these tracks are reconstructed using
Kalman Filter technique. Finally we have measured the energy and the number of $\mu^{+}$ and $\mu^{-}$
particles at the detector and compared our muon charge ratio results with the existing experimental
data in the corresponding energy range. The estimated average muon charge ratio at ICAL detector
is 1.3472$\pm $0.0194 and at the top of the hill it is 1.3575 for surface muons in the energy range 1.60-2.00TeV
using CORSIKA. The same analysis is performed using "pika" model and the estimated average muon
charge ratio using this model is found to be 1.4367$\pm$0.055, which is slightly higher than the
muon charge ratio results estimated by available experimental data, whereas our CORSIKA results
are in agreement with the experimental observations.
