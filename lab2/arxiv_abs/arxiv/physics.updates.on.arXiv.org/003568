Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of standard systems of interacting particles ("atoms") give
excellent agreement with the equipartition theorem for the average energy, but we find that these
simulations exhibit finite-size effects in the dynamics that cause local fluctuations in energy
to deviate significantly from the analogous energy fluctuation relation (EFR). The main conclusion
of our study is that systems separated into nanometer-sized "blocks" inside much larger simulations
exhibit excess fluctuations in potential energy (pe) that diverge inversely proportional to T
in a manner that is strongly dependent on the range of interaction. Specifically, at low T with long-range
interactions pe fluctuations exceed the EFR by at least an order of magnitude, dropping abruptly
to below the EFR when interactions include only 1st-neighbor atoms. A simplistic model that includes
2nd-neighbor interactions matches the behavior of the excess pe fluctuations, but only if the 2nd-neighbor
terms are not included in Boltzmann's factor, attributable to energy localization due to anharmonic
effects. Characterizing energy correlations as a function of time and distance reveals that excess
pe fluctuations in a block coincide with negative pe correlations between neighboring blocks,
whereas reduced pe fluctuations coincide with positive pe correlations. Indeed, anomalous pe
fluctuations in small systems at low T can be quantified by using the net energy in Boltzmann's factor
that includes the pe from a surrounding shell of similarly small systems, or equivalently an effective
local temperature. Our analysis elucidates the source of non-Boltzmann fluctuations, and the
need to include mesoscopic thermal effects from the local environment for a consistent theoretical
description of the equilibrium fluctuations in MD simulations of standard models with long-range
interactions.
