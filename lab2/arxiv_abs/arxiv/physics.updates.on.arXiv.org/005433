Inactivation of microorganisms on sensitive surfaces by cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is one major
application in the field of plasma medicine because it provides a simple and effective way to sterilize
heat-sensitive materials. Therefore, one has to know whether plasma treatment affects the treated
surfaces, and thus causes long-term surface modifications. In this contribution, the effect of
cold atmospheric Surface Micro-Discharge (SMD) plasma on different materials and its sporicidal
behavior was investigated. Hence, different material samples (stainless steel, different polymers
and glass) were plasma-treated for 16 hours, simulating multiple plasma treatments using an SMD
plasma device. Afterwards, the material samples were analyzed using surface analysis methods
such as laser microscopy, contact angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
Furthermore, the device was used to investigate the behavior of Bacillus atrophaeus endospores
inoculated on material samples at different treatment times. The interaction results for plasma-treated
endospores show, that a log reduction of the spore count between 4.3 and 6.2 can be achieved within
15 min of plasma treatment. Besides, the surface analysis revealed, that there were three different
types of reactions the probed materials showed to plasma treatment, ranging from no changes to shifts
of the materials' free surface energies and oxidation. As a consequence, it should be taken into
account that even though cold atmospheric plasma treatment is a non-thermal method to inactivate
microorganisms on heatsensitive materials, it still affects surface properties of the treated
materials. Therefore, the focus of future work must be a further classification of plasma-caused
material modifications.
