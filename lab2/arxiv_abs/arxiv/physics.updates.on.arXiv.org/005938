When effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available, non-pharmaceutical interventions
such as social distancing, home quarantine and far-reaching shutdown of public life are the only
available strategies to prevent the spreading of epidemics. Based on an extended SEIR model and
continuous-time optimal control theory, in this paper the optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention
strategy is presented for the case that a vaccine is never found. In this case, the optimal control
must meet two competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related deaths, and,
second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of herd immunity at the end of the measures, in order
to exclude a second wave. The presented control strategy is a single-intervention scenario that
goes beyond heuristically motivated interventions and simple "flattening of the curve". The characteristic
time course of the computed optimal control is the following: After an intense but short initial
lockdown, a dynamical equilibrium is enforced during which the number of actively infected is held
on a constant level for a longer period of time. At the same time, the measures can be gradually relaxed
with an ever increasing speed. Two simple rules for the optimal control of the effective reproduction
number are presented, see Eqs. (13)-(14), which ensure a stable route out of the initial lockdown.
The rules are directly applicable in practice, as they only depend on a precise knowledge of the cumulative
number of cases and a reliable estimate of the effective reproduction number. The obtained results
could serve as a guideline for the implementation and gradual relaxation of non-pharmaceutical
intervention measures also in other scenarios, e.g., when the development of a vaccine is expected
soon. The model system is calibrated to reproduce the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19
epidemic in Germany.
