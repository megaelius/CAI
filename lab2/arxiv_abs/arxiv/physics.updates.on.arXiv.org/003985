Radiotherapy treatment planning currently requires many trail-and-error iterations between
the planner and treatment planning system, as well as be-tween the planner and physician for discussion/consultation.
The physician's preferences for a particular patient cannot be easily quantified and precisely
conveyed to the planner. In this study we present a real-time volumetric Pareto surface dose generation
deep learning neural network that can be used after segmentation by the physician, adding a tangible
and quantifiable end-point to portray to the planner. From 70 prostate patients, we first generated
84,000 intensity modulated radiation therapy plans (1,200 plans per patient) sampling the Pareto
surface, representing various tradeoffs between the planning target volume (PTV) and the organs-at-risk
(OAR), including bladder, rectum, left femur, right femur, and body. We divided the data to 10 test
patients and 60 training/validation patients. We then trained a hierarchically densely connected
convolutional U-net (HD U-net), to take the PTV and avoidance map representing OARs masks and weights,
and predict the optimized plan. The HD U-net is capable of accurately predicting the 3D Pareto optimal
dose distributions, with average [mean, max] dose errors of [3.4%, 7.7%](PTV), [1.6%, 5.6%](bladder),
[3.7%, 4.2%](rectum), [3.2%, 8.0%](left femur), [2.9%, 7.7%](right femur), and [0.04%, 5.4%](body)
of the prescription dose. The PTV dose coverage prediction was also very similar, with errors of
1.3% (D98) and 2.0% (D99). Homogeneity was also similar, differing by 0.06 on average. The neural
network can predict the dose within 1.7 seconds. Clinically, the optimization and dose calculation
is much slower, taking 5-10 minutes.
