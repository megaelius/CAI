When pollen grains become exposed to the environment, they rapidly desiccate. To protect themselves
until rehydration, the grains undergo characteristic infolding with the help of special structures
in the grain wall---apertures---where the otherwise thick exine shell is absent or reduced in thickness.
Recent theoretical studies have highlighted the importance of apertures for the elastic response
and the folding of the grain. Experimental observations show that different pollen grains sharing
the same number and type of apertures can nonetheless fold in quite diverse fashion. Using thin-shell
theory of elasticity, we show how both the absolute elastic properties of the pollen wall as well
as the relative elastic differences between the exine wall and the apertures play an important role
in determining pollen folding upon desiccation. Focusing primarily on colpate pollen, we delineate
the regions of pollen elastic parameters where desiccation leads to a regular, complete closing
of all apertures and thus to an infolding which protects the grain against water loss. Phase diagrams
of pollen folding pathways indicate that an increase in the number of apertures leads to a reduction
of the region of elastic parameters where the apertures close in a regular fashion. The infolding
also depends on the details of the aperture shape and size, and our study explains how the features
of the mechanical design of apertures influence the pollen folding patterns. Understanding the
mechanical principles behind pollen folding pathways should also prove useful for the design of
the elastic response of artificial inhomogeneous shells.
