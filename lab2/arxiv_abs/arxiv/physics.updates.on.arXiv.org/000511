Background: How can mathematics help us to understand the mechanism of the cardiac motion? The best
known approach is to take a mathematical model of the fibered structure, insert it into a more-or-less
complex model of cardiac architecture, and then study the resulting fibers of activation that propagate
through the myocardium. In our paper, we have attempted to create a novel software capable of demonstrate
left ventricular (LV) model in normal hearts. Method: Echocardiography was performed on 70 healthy
volunteers. Data evaluated included: velocity (radial, longitudinal, rotational and vector
point), displacement (longitudinal and rotational), strain rate (longitudinal and circumferential)
and strain (radial, longitudinal and circumferential) of all 16 LV myocardial segments. Using
these data, force vectors of myocardial samples were estimated by MATLAB software, interfaced
in the echocardiograph system. Dynamic orientation contraction (through the cardiac cycle) of
every individual myocardial fiber could be created by adding together the sequential steps of the
multiple fragmented sectors of that fiber. This way we attempted to mechanically illustrate the
global LV model. Result: Our study shows that in normal cases myocardial fibers initiate from the
posterior basal region of the heart, continues through the LV free wall, reaches the septum, loops
around the apex, ascends, and ends at the superior-anterior edge of LV. Conclusion: We were able
to define the whole LV myocardial model mathematically, by MATLAB software in normal subjects.
This will enable physicians to diagnose and follow up many cardiac diseases when this software is
interfaced within echocardiographic machines.
