We present a computational live bacteria detection system that periodically captures coherent
microscopy images of bacterial growth inside a 60 mm diameter agar-plate and analyzes these time-lapsed
holograms using deep neural networks for rapid detection of bacterial growth and classification
of the corresponding species. The performance of our system was demonstrated by rapid detection
of Escherichia coli and total coliform bacteria (i.e., Klebsiella aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae
subsp. pneumoniae) in water samples. These results were confirmed against gold-standard culture-based
results, shortening the detection time of bacterial growth by >12 h as compared to the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)-approved analytical methods. Our experiments further confirmed that
this method successfully detects 90% of bacterial colonies within 7-10 h (and >95% within 12 h) with
a precision of 99.2-100%, and correctly identifies their species in 7.6-12 h with 80% accuracy.
Using pre-incubation of samples in growth media, our system achieved a limit of detection (LOD)
of ~1 colony forming unit (CFU)/L within 9 h of total test time. This computational bacteria detection
and classification platform is highly cost-effective (~$0.6 per test) and high-throughput with
a scanning speed of 24 cm2/min over the entire plate surface, making it highly suitable for integration
with the existing analytical methods currently used for bacteria detection on agar plates. Powered
by deep learning, this automated and cost-effective live bacteria detection platform can be transformative
for a wide range of applications in microbiology by significantly reducing the detection time,
also automating the identification of colonies, without labeling or the need for an expert.
