We study a regularisation of Coulomb's friction law on the propagation of local slip at an interface
between a deformable and a rigid solid. This regularisation, which was proposed based on experimental
observations, smooths the effect of a sudden jump in the contact pressure over a characteristic
length scale. We apply it in numerical simulations in order to analyse its influence on the behaviour
of local slip. We first show that mesh convergence in dynamic simulations is achieved without any
numerical damping in the bulk and draw a convergence map with respect to the characteristic length
of the friction regularisation. By varying this length scale on the example of a given slip event,
we observe that there is a critical length below which the friction regularisation does not affect
anymore the propagation of the interface rupture. A spectral analysis of the regularisation on
a periodic variation of Coulomb's friction is conducted to confirm the existence of this critical
length. The results indicate that if the characteristic length of the friction regularisation
is smaller than the critical length, a slip event behaves as if it was governed by Coulomb's law. We
therefore propose that there is a domain of influence of the friction regularisation depending
on its characteristic length and on the frequency content of the local slip event. A byproduct of
the analysis is related to the existence of a physical length scale characterising a given frictional
interface. We establish that the experimental determination of this interface property may be
achieved by experimentally monitoring slip pulses whose frequency content is rich enough.
