In March of this year, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and it continues to threaten public health.
This global health crisis imposes limitations on daily movements, which have deteriorated every
sector in our society. Understanding public reactions to the virus and the non-pharmaceutical
interventions should be of great help to fight COVID-19 in a strategic way. We aim to provide tangible
evidence of the human mobility trends by comparing the day-by-day variations across the U.S. Large-scale
public mobility at an aggregated level is observed by leveraging mobile device location data and
the measures related to social distancing. Our study captures spatial and temporal heterogeneity
as well as the sociodemographic variations regarding the pandemic propagation and the non-pharmaceutical
interventions. All mobility metrics adapted capture decreased public movements after the national
emergency declaration. The population staying home has increased in all states and becomes more
stable after the stay-at-home order with a smaller range of fluctuation. There exists overall mobility
heterogeneity between the income or population density groups. The public had been taking active
responses, voluntarily staying home more, to the in-state confirmed cases while the stay-at-home
orders stabilize the variations. The study suggests that the public mobility trends conform with
the government message urging to stay home. We anticipate our data-driven analysis offers integrated
perspectives and serves as evidence to raise public awareness and, consequently, reinforce the
importance of social distancing while assisting policymakers.
