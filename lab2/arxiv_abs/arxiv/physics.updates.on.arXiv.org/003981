A Monte Carlo method for evaluating multi-center two-electron-repulsion integrals over any type
of orbitals (Slater, Sturmian, finite-range, numerical, etc.) is presented. The approach is based
on a simple and universal (orbital-independent) gaussian sampling of the two-electron configuration
space and on the use of efficient zero-variance Monte Carlo estimators. Quite remarkably, it is
shown that the high level of accuracy required on two-electron integrals to make Hartree-Fock (HF)
and configuration interaction (CI) calculations feasible can be achieved. A first zero-variance
estimator is built by introducing a gaussian approximation of the orbitals and by evaluating the
two-electron integrals using a correlated sampling scheme for the difference between exact and
approximate orbitals. A second one is based on the introduction of a general coordinate transformation.
The price to pay for this simple and general Monte Carlo scheme is the high computational cost required.
However, we argue that the great simplicity of the algorithm, its embarrassingly parallel nature,
its ideal adaptation to modern computational platforms and, most importantly, the possibility
of using more compact and physically meaningful basis sets make nevertheless the method attractive.
HF and near full CI (FCI) calculations using Slater-type orbitals (STO) are reported for Be, CH4
and [H2N(CH)NH2]^+ (a simple model of cyanine). To the best of our knowledge, our largest FCI calculation
involving 18 active electrons distributed among 90 orbitals for the cyanine molecule, is the most
extensive molecular calculation performed so far using pure STO orbitals (no gaussian approximation,
even for the challenging four-center two-electron integrals).
