Experiments have shown that micron-sized distributed surface roughness can significantly promote
transition in a three-dimensional boundary layer dominated by crossflow insta- bility. This sensitive
effect has not yet been fully explained physically and mathematically. Unlike past researches
focusing on the receptivity of the boundary layer to surface roughness, or on the local stability
of the modified mean flow, this paper seeks possible inherent mechanisms by investigating the effects
of distributed surface roughness on crossflow instability through resonant interactions with
eigenmodes. A key observation is that the perturbation induced by roughness with specific wavenumbers
can interact with two eigenmodes (travelling and stationary vortices) through triadic resonance,
or interact with one eigenmode (stationary vortices) through Bragg scattering. Unlike the usual
triadic resonance of neutral, or nearly neutral, eigenmodes, the present triadic resonance can
take place among modes with O(1) growth rates, provided that these are equal; unlike the usual Bragg
scattering involving neutral waves, crossflow stationary vortices can also be unstable. For these
amplifying waves, the generalized triadic resonance and Bragg scattering are put forward, and
the resulting corrections to the growth rates are derived by a multiple-scale method. The analysis
is extended to the case where up to four crossflow vortices interact with each other in the presence
of suitable roughness components. The numerical results for Falkner-Skan-Cooke boundary layers
show that roughness with a small height (a few percent of the local boundary-layer thickness) can
change growth rates substantially (by a more-or-less O(1) amount)....
