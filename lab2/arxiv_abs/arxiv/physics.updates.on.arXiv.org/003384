We perform a detailed theoretical study of the edge fracture instability, which commonly destabilises
the fluid-air interface during strong shear flows of entangled polymeric fluids, leading to unreliable
rheological measurements. By means of direct nonlinear simulations, we map out phase diagrams
showing the degree of edge fracture in the plane of the surface tension of the fluid-air interface
and the imposed shear rate, within the Giesekus and Johnson-Segalman models, for different values
of the nonlinear constitutive parameters that determine the dependencies on shear rate of the shear
and normal stresses. The threshold for the onset of edge fracture is shown to be relatively robust
against variations in the wetting angle where the fluid-air interface meets the hard walls of the
flow cell, whereas the nonlinear dynamics depend strongly on wetting angle. We perform a linear
stability calculation to derive an exact analytical expression for the onset of edge fracture,
expressed in terms of the shear-rate derivative of the second normal stress difference, the shear-rate
derivative of the shear stress (sometimes called the tangent viscosity), the jump in shear stress
across the interface between the fluid and the outside air, the surface tension of that interface,
and the rheometer gap size. Full agreement between our analytical calculation and nonlinear simulations
is demonstrated. We also elucidate in detail the mechanism of edge fracture, and finally suggest
a new way in which it might be mitigated in experimental practice. Some of the results in this paper
were first announced in an earlier letter. The present manuscript provides additional simulation
results, calculational details of the linear stability analysis, and more detailed discussion
of the significance and limitations of our findings.
