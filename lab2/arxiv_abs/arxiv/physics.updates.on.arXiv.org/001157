Nanoscale membrane assemblies of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and certain proteins, also known
as lipid rafts, play a crucial role in facilitating a broad range of important cell functions. Whereas
on living cell membranes lipid rafts have been postulated to have nanoscopic dimensions and to be
highly transient, the existence of a similar type of dynamic nanodomains in multicomponent lipid
bilayers has been questioned. Here, we perform fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on planar
plasmonic antenna arrays with different nanogap sizes to assess the dynamic nanoscale organization
of mimetic biological membranes. Our approach takes advantage of the highly enhanced and confined
excitation light provided by the nanoantennas together with their outstanding planarity to investigate
membrane regions as small as 10 nm in size with microsecond time resolution. Our diffusion data are
consistent with the coexistence of transient nanoscopic domains in both the liquid-ordered and
the liquid-disordered microscopic phases of multicomponent lipid bilayers. These nanodomains
have characteristic residence times between 30 and 150 {\mu}s and sizes around 10 nm, as inferred
from the diffusion data. Thus, although microscale phase separation occurs on mimetic membranes,
nanoscopic domains also coexist, suggesting that these transient assemblies might be similar
to those occurring in living cells, which in the absence of raft-stabilizing proteins are poised
to be short-lived. Importantly, our work underscores the high potential of photonic nanoantennas
to interrogate the nanoscale heterogeneity of native biological membranes with ultrahigh spatiotemporal
resolution.
