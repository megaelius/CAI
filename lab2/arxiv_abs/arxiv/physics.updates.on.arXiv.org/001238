We seek to quantify non-normality of the most amplified resolvent modes and predict their features
based on the characteristics of the base or mean velocity profile. A 2-by-2 model linear Navier-Stokes
(LNS) operator illustrates how non-normality from mean shear distributes perturbation energy
in different velocity components of the forcing and response modes. The inverse of their inner product,
which is unity for a purely normal mechanism, is proposed as a measure to quantify non-normality.
In flows where there is downstream spatial dependence of the base/mean, mean flow advection separates
the spatial support of forcing and response modes which impacts the inner product. Success of mean
stability analysis depends on the normality of amplification. If the amplification is normal,
the resolvent operator written in its dyadic representation reveals that the adjoint and forward
stability modes are proportional to the forcing and response resolvent modes. If the amplification
is non-normal, then resolvent analysis is required to understand the origin of observed flow structures.
Eigenspectra and pseudospectra are used to characterize these phenomena. Two test cases are studied:
low Reynolds number cylinder flow and turbulent channel flow. The first deals mainly with normal
mechanisms and quantification of non-normality using the inverse inner product of the leading
forcing and response modes agrees well with the product of the resolvent norm and distance between
the imaginary axis and least stable eigenvalue. In turbulent channel flow, structures result from
both normal and non-normal mechanisms. Mean shear is exploited most efficiently by stationary
disturbances while bounds on the pseudospectra illustrate how non-normality is responsible for
the most amplified disturbances at spatial wavenumbers and temporal frequencies corresponding
to well-known turbulent structures.
