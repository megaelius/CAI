The changes of a turbulent channel flow subjected to oscillations of wall flush-mounted rigid discs
are studied by means of direct numerical simulations. The Reynolds number is $R_\tau$=$180$, based
on the friction velocity of the stationary-wall case and the half channel height. The primary effect
of the wall forcing is the sustained reduction of wall-shear stress, which reaches a maximum of 20%.
A parametric study on the disc diameter, maximum tip velocity, and oscillation period is presented,
with the aim to identify the optimal parameters which guarantee maximum drag reduction and maximum
net energy saving, computed by taking into account the power spent to actuate the discs. This may
be positive and reaches 6%. The Rosenblat viscous pump flow is used to predict the power spent for
disc motion in the turbulent channel flow and to estimate localized and transient regions over the
disc surface subjected to the turbulent regenerative braking effect, for which the wall turbulence
exerts work on the discs. The FIK identity is employed to show that the wall-friction reduction is
due to two distinguished effects. One effect is linked to the direct shearing action of the near-wall
oscillating disc boundary layer on the wall turbulence, which causes the attenuation of the turbulent
Reynolds stresses. The other effect is due the additional disc-flow Reynolds stresses produced
by the inter-disc structures. The contribution to drag reduction due to turbulent Reynolds stress
attenuation depends on the penetration thickness of the disc-flow boundary layer, while the contribution
due to the elongated structures scales linearly with a simple function of the maximum tip velocity
and oscillation period for the largest disc diameter tested, a result suggested by the Rosenblat
flow solution. A brief discussion on the future applicability of the oscillating-disc technique
is also presented.
