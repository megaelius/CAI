The central theme of this work is that a \emph{stable} levitation of a denser \emph{non-magnetizable}
liquid droplet, against gravity, inside a relatively lighter ferrofluid -- a system barely considered
in ferrohydrodynamics -- is possible, and exhibits unique interfacial features; the stability
of the levitation trajectory, however, is subject to an appropriate magnetic field modulation.
We explore the shapes and the temporal dynamics of a plane {non-magnetizable} droplet levitating
inside ferrofluid against gravity due to a spatially complex, but systematically generated, magnetic
field in two dimensions. The effect of the viscosity ratio, the stability of the levitation path
and the possibility of existence of multiple-stable equilibrium states is investigated. We find,
for certain conditions on the viscosity ratio, that there can be developments of \emph{cusps} and
\emph{singularities} at the droplet surface; this phenomenon we also observe experimentally
and compared with the simulations. Our simulations closely replicate the singular projection
on the surface of the levitating droplet. Finally, we present an dynamical model for the vertical
trajectory of the droplet. This model reveals a condition for the onset of levitation and the relation
for the equilibrium levitation height. The linearization of the model around the steady state captures
that the nature of the equilibrium point goes under a transition from being a \emph{spiral} to a \emph{node}
depending upon the control parameters, which essentially means that the temporal route to the equilibrium
can be either monotonic or undulating. The analytical model for the droplet trajectory is in close
agreement with the detailed simulations. (See draft for full abstract)
