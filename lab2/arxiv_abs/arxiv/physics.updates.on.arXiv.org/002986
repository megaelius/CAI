In this paper we present a simple mathematical theory of carving turns in alpine skiing and snowboarding.
The theory captures the basic dynamics of carving runs and thus provides a useful tool for assessing
the potential and limitations of the carving technique. We also apply the model to simulate runs
on slopes of constant gradient and describe the results. We find that pure carving is possible only
on relatively flat slopes, with the critical slope angle in the range of 8-20 degrees. The exact value
depends mostly on the coefficient of snow friction and to a lesser degree on the sidecut radius of
the skis. In wiggly carving runs on slopes of subcritical gradient, the aerodynamic drag force remains
relatively unimportant and the speed stops growing well below the one achieved in fall-line gliding.
This is because the increased g-force of carving turns leads to enhanced snow friction which can
significantly exceed the one found in the gliding. At the critical gradient, the g-force of carving
turns becomes excessive. For such and even steeper slopes only hybrid turns, where at least some
part of the turn is skidded, are possible. The carving turns of all alpine racing disciplines are
approximately similar. This is because in the dimensionless equations of the model the sidecut
radius of skis enters only via the coefficient of the aerodynamic drag term, which always remains
relatively small. Simple modifications to the model are made to probe the roles of skier angulation
and skidding at the transition phase of hybrid turns. As expected the angulation gives certain control
over the turn trajectory, but does not remove the slope limitations.
