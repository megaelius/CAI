Managing the quality of water for present and future generations of coastal regions should be a central
concern of both citizens and public officials. Remote sensing can contribute to the management
and monitoring of coastal water and pollutants. Algal blooms are a coastal pollutant that is a cause
of concern. Many satellite data, such as MODIS, have been used to generate water-quality products
to detect the blooms such as chlorophyll a (Chl-a), a photosynthesis index called fluorescence
line height (FLH), and sea surface temperature (SST). It is important to characterize the spatial
and temporal variations of these water quality products by using the mathematical models of these
products. However, for monitoring, pollution control boards will need nowcasts and forecasts
of any pollution. Therefore, we aim to predict the future values of the MODIS Chl-a, FLH, and SST of
the water. This will not be limited to one type of water but, rather, will cover different types of
water varying in depth and turbidity. This is very significant because the temporal trend of Chl-a,
FLH, and SST is dependent on the geospatial and water properties. For this purpose, we will decompose
the time series of each pixel into several components: trend, intra-annual variations, seasonal
cycle, and stochastic stationary. We explore three such time series machine learning models that
can characterize the non-stationary time series data and predict future values, including the
Seasonal ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) (SARIMA), regression, and neural
network. The results indicate that all these methods are effective at modelling Chl-a, FLH, and
SST time series and predicting the values reasonably well. However, regression and neural network
are found to be the best at predicting Chl-a in all types of water (turbid and shallow). Meanwhile,
the SARIMA model provides the best prediction of FLH and SST.
