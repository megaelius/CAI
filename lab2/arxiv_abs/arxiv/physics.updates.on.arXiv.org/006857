This paper addresses three-dimensional signal distortion and image reconstruction issues in
x-ray Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) in the event of a non-orthogonal orientation of
the area detector with respect to the diffracted beam. Growing interest in novel BCDI adaptations
at future fourth-generation synchrotron light sources (for example, at beam energies >= 50 keV)
has necessitated improvisations in the experimental configuration and the subsequent data analysis.
One such possibly unavoidable improvisation that is envisioned in this paper and related to diffractometer
stability is a photon counting area detector whose face is tilted away from the perpendicular to
the Bragg-diffracted beam during acquisition of the coherent diffraction signal. Working within
the context of high-energy BCDI we describe a likely circumstance in which one would require such
a detector configuration. Using physically accurate diffraction simulations from synthetic
scatterers in the presence of such tilted detectors, we analyze the general nature of the observed
signal distortion qualitatively and quantitatively, and provide a prescription to correct for
it during image reconstruction. Our simulations and reconstructions are based on an adaptation
of the known theory of BCDI sampling geometry as well as recently developed geometry-aware projection-based
methods of wavefield propagation. We demonstrate that such configurational modifications and
their numerical remedies are crucial to realizing high-energy BCDI at synchrotron facilities
and eventually paving the way for novel materials characterization experiments in the future.
