This work uses high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization techniques as a generic, parameter-free,
and reliable tool to accurately predict transitional and turbulent flows through medical devices.
Flows through medical devices are characterized by moderate Reynolds numbers and typically involve
different flow regimes such as laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows. Previous studies for
the FDA benchmark nozzle model revealed limitations of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence
models when applied to more complex flow scenarios. Recent works based on large-eddy simulation
approaches indicate that these limitations can be overcome but also highlight potential limitations
due to a high sensitivity with respect to numerical parameters. The novel methodology presented
in this work is based on two key ingredients. Firstly, we use high-order discontinuous Galerkin
methods for discretization in space yielding a discretization approach that is robust, accurate,
and generic. The inherent dissipation properties of high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations
render this approach well-suited for transitional and turbulent flow simulations. Secondly,
a precursor simulation approach is applied in order to correctly predict the inflow boundary condition
for the whole range of laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. This approach eliminates
the need to fit parameters of the numerical solution approach. We investigate the whole range of
Reynolds numbers as suggested by the FDA benchmark nozzle problem in order to critically assess
the predictive capabilities of the solver. The results presented in this study are compared to experimental
data obtained by particle image velocimetry demonstrating that the approach is capable of correctly
predicting the flow for different flow regimes.
