In this paper, a phase-field based model under the framework of discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme
(DUGKS) for incompressible multiphase fluid flows is proposed. Two kinetic models are constructed
to solve the conservative Allen-Cahn (A-C) equation that accounts for the interface behavior and
the incompressible hydrodynamic equations that govern the flow field, respectively. With a truncated
equilibrium distribution function as well as a temporal derivative added to the source term, the
macroscopic governing equations can be exactly recovered from the kinetic models through the Chapmann-Enskog
analysis. Calculation of source terms involving high-order derivatives existed in the quasi-incompressible
model is simplified. A series of benchmark cases including four interface-capturing tests and
four binary flow tests are carried out. Results compared to that of lattice Boltzmann method (LBM)
have been obtained. A convergence rate of second-order can be guaranteed in the test of interface
diagonal translation. The capability of present method in interface tracking that undergoes a
severe deformation has been verified. Stationary bubble and spinodal decomposition problems,
both with a density ratio as high as 1000, are conducted and reliable solutions have been provided.
The layered Poiseuille flow with a large viscosity ratio is simulated and numerical results agree
well with the analytical solutions. Variation of positions of the bubble front and spike tip during
the evolution of Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) has been predicted precisely. However, the
detailed depiction of complicated interface patterns appeared in the evolution process is failed,
which is mainly caused by the relatively large numerical dissipation of DUGKS compared to that of
LBM. A high-order DUGKS is needed to overcome this problem.
