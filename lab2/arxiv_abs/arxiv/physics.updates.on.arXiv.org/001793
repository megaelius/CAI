The advantages introduced by carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites has made them an
appropriate choice in many applications and an ideal replacement for conventional materials.
The benefits using CFRP composites are due to their lightweight, high stiffness, as well as corrosion
resistance. For this reason, there is a fast growing trend in using CFRP composites for aircraft
and wind turbine structural applications. The replacement of the conventional aerospace-grade
metal alloys (aluminum, titanium, magnesium, etc.) with CFRP composites results in new challenges.
For example, an aircraft during flight is prone to be struck by lightning. To withstand the injection
of such massive amount of energy, adequate electrical properties, mainly electrical conductivity,
is required. In fact, electrical conductance (or its reciprocal, resistance) is a critical parameter
representing any material change and it can be considered an index for health monitoring. In this
paper, AS4/8552 carbon/epoxy laminated composites were injected with two types of electrical
currents, impulse current and direct current. The change in measured electrical resistance was
recorded. A significant resistance drop occurred after electrical current injections. Furthermore,
four-point flexural tests were performed on these composites to correlate an electrical resistance
change with a potential flexural property change. There was no clear trend between a resistance
change and flexural strength/modulus change of the test coupons, regardless of current injection.
However, it was observed that the injection of the current affects the contact resistance such that
its resistance decreases.
