The first activities of the Canfranc Underground Laboratory ("Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc",
LSC) started in the mid-eighties in a railway tunnel located under the Spanish Pyrenees; since then,
it has become an international multidisciplinary facility equipped with different services for
underground science. The research activity at LSC is about Astroparticle Physics, dark matter
searches and neutrino Physics; but also activities in Nuclear Astrophysics, Geophysics, and Biology
are carried out. The investigation of the neutrinoless double beta decay has been one of the main
research lines of LSC since the beginning. Many unknowns remain in the characterization of the basic
neutrino properties and the study of this rare decay process requiring Physics beyond the Standard
Model of Particle Physics can shed light on the lepton number conservation, the nature of the neutrinos
as Dirac or Majorana particles and the absolute scale and ordering of the masses of the three generations.
Here, the double beta decay searches performed at LSC for different emitters and following very
different experimental approaches will be reviewed: from the very first experiments in the laboratory
including the successful IGEX for $^{76}$Ge, which released very stringent limits to the effective
neutrino mass at the time, to the present NEXT experiment for $^{136}$Xe and future project CROSS
("Cryogenic Rare-event Observatory with Surface Sensitivity") for $^{130}$Te and $^{100}$Mo,
both implementing innovative detector technologies to discriminate backgrounds. For the neutrinoless
double beta decay channel and at 90% C.L., IGEX derived a limit to the half-life of $^{76}$Ge of $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}
> 1.57 \times 10^{25}$ y while the corresponding expected limits are $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 1.0\times
10^{26}$ y for $^{136}$Xe from NEXT-100 (for an exposure of 500 kg.y) and $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 2.8 \times
10^{25}$ y for $^{100}$Mo from CROSS (for 5 y and 4.7 kg of isotope). Activities related to double
beta decays searches carried out in other underground laboratories have also been developed at
LSC and will be presented too, like the operation of the BiPo-3 detector for radiopurity measurements
of thin sheets with very high sensitivity. For each one of these experiments, the concept, the experimental
set-ups and relevant results will be discussed.
