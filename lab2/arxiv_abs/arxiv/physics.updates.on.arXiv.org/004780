High harmonic generation (HHG) is an extremely nonlinear effect, where a medium is driven by a strong
laser field, generating coherent broadband radiation with photon energies ranging up to the X-ray
and pulse durations reaching attosecond timescales. Conventional models of HHG treat the medium
quantum mechanically, while the driving and emitted fields are treated classically. Such models
are usually very successful, but inherently cannot capture the quantum-optical nature of the process.
Despite prior works considering quantum HHG, it is still not known in what circumstances the spectral
and statistical properties of the radiation considerably depart from the known phenomenology
of HHG. Finding such regimes in HHG could lead to novel sources of attosecond light with intrinsically
quantum statistics such as squeezing and entanglement. In this work, we present a fully quantum
electrodynamical theory of extreme nonlinear optics with which we predict new quantum effects
that alter both spectral and statistical properties of HHG. We predict the emission of shifted frequency
combs resulting from transitions between perturbed states of the driven atom, and identify new
spectral features that arise from the breakdown of the dipole approximation for the emission. Moreover,
we find that each HHG emitted photon is a superposition of all frequencies in the spectrum - e.g.,
HHG creates single photon combs. We also describe how the HHG process changes in the single atom regime,
and discuss how our various predictions can be tested experimentally. Our approach is also applicable
to a wide range of nonlinear optical processes, paving the way toward novel quantum information
techniques in the EUV and X-ray, and in ultrafast quantum optics.
