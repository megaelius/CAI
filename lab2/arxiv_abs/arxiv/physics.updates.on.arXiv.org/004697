The CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is a high resolution crystal calorimeter operating
at the CERN LHC. It is responsible for the identification and precise reconstruction of electrons
and photons in CMS, which were crucial in the discovery and subsequent characterization of the Higgs
boson. It also contributes to the reconstruction of tau leptons, jets, and calorimeter energy sums,
which are vital components of many CMS physics analyses. The ECAL trigger system employs fast digital
signal processing algorithms to precisely measure the energy and timing information of ECAL energy
deposits recorded during LHC collisions. These trigger primitives are transmitted to the Level-1
trigger system at the LHC collisions rate of 40 MHz. These energy deposits are then combined with
information from other CMS sub-detectors to determine whether the event should trigger the readout
of the data from CMS to permanent storage. This presentation will summarize the ECAL trigger performance
achieved during LHC Run 2 (2015-2018). It will describe the methods that are used to provide frequent
calibrations of the ECAL trigger primitives during LHC operation. These are needed to account for
radiation-induced changes in crystal and photodetector response, and to minimize the spurious
triggering on direct signals in the photodetectors used in the barrel region ($\eta<$1.48). Both
of these effects are increased relative to LHC Run 1 (2009-2012), due to the higher luminosities
experienced in Run 2. Further improvements in the energy and time reconstruction of the CMS ECAL
trigger primitives are being explored for LHC Run 3 (2021-23). The main features of these improved
algorithms will be described and preliminary estimates of the potential performance gains will
be given.
