We present a moving-trap Zeeman decelerator (MTZD) for use in molecular beam manipulation and magnetic-trapping
experiments of paramagnetic atoms and molecules. The 0.49 m MTZD consists of a combination of a 2D
magnetic quadrupole guide and deceleration coils, which together produce an array of 3D magnetic
traps. The design is based on that of Trimeche et al. with significant modifications. The 2D quadrupole
is driven by fast rising and falling square pulses of current (up to 700 A) of arbitrary lengths of
time. The traps can be made to move at velocities from ca. 370 m/s down to zero, which is done by driving
through the deceleration coils a sinusoidal current with frequencies ranging from zero to ca. 9
kHz and peak currents up to 1000 A. The trap velocity is proportional to the current frequency. The
MTZD manipulates the velocities of molecular beams by traveling initially at the same velocity
as the beam. 3D guiding is achieved with a constant current frequency and deceleration is achieved
with a downward chirp of the current frequency at a rate corresponding to the desired deceleration.
We explain the technical design and operation principles of the MTZD and we detail the custom power
electronics that drive the 2D quadrupole guide and the decelerator coils. We present extensive
Monte-Carlo trajectory simulations to demonstrate the properties of the MTZD and we conclude that
decelerations should be kept below 30000 m/s/s to maintain a good 6D phase-space acceptance. In
proof-of-principle experiments, with the deceleration coils operating with a reduced current
in the range 100-200 A, we demonstrate the 3D guiding of a beam of metastable argon atoms at 373 m/s
and deceleration at 25000 m/s/s from 342 m/s to 304 m/s. The deceleration corresponds to the removal
of 21% of the kinetic energy of the beam.
