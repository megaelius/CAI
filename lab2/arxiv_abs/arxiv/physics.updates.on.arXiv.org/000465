In this study, we describe how WRF-Sfire is coupled with WRF-Chem to construct WRFSC, an integrated
forecast system for wildfire and smoke prediction. The integrated forecast system has the advantage
of not requiring a simple plume-rise model and assumptions about the size and heat release from the
fire in order to determine fire emissions into the atmosphere. With WRF-Sfire, wildfire spread,
plume and plume-top heights are predicted directly, at every WRF timestep, providing comprehensive
meteorology and fire emissions to the chemical transport model WRF-Chem. Evaluation of WRFSC was
based on comparisons between available observations to the results of two WRFSC simulations. The
study found overall good agreement between forecasted and observed fire spread and smoke transport
for the Witch-Guejito fire. Also the simulated PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) peak concentrations
matched the observations. However, the NO and ozone levels were underestimated in the simulations
and the peak concentrations were mistimed. Determining the terminal or plume-top height is one
of the most important aspects of simulating wildfire plume transport, and the study found overall
good agreement between simulated and observed plume-top heights, with some (10% or less) underestimation
by the simulations. One of the most promising results of the study was the agreement between passive-tracer
modeled plume-top heights for the Barker Canyon fire simulation and observations. This simulation
took only 13h, with the first 24h forecast ready in almost 3h, making it a possible operational tool
for providing emission profiles for external chemical transport models.
