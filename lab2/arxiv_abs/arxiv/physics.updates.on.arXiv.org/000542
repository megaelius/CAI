School environments are thought to play an important role in the community spread of airborne infections
(e.g., influenza) because of the high mixing rates of school children. The closure of schools has
therefore been proposed as efficient mitigation strategy, with however high social and economic
costs: alternative, less disruptive interventions are highly desirable. The recent availability
of high-resolution contact networks in school environments provides an opportunity to design
micro-interventions and compare the outcomes of alternative mitigation measures. We consider
mitigation measures that involve the targeted closure of school classes or grades based on readily
available information such as the number of symptomatic infectious children in a class. We focus
on the case of a primary school for which we have high-resolution data on the close-range interactions
of children and teachers. We simulate the spread of an influenza-like illness in this population
by using an SEIR model with asymptomatics and compare the outcomes of different mitigation strategies.
We find that targeted class closure affords strong mitigation effects: closing a class for a fixed
period of time -equal to the sum of the average infectious and latent durations- whenever two infectious
individuals are detected in that class decreases the attack rate by almost 70% and strongly decreases
the probability of a severe outbreak. The closure of all classes of the same grade mitigates the spread
almost as much as closing the whole school. Targeted class closure strategies based on readily available
information on symptomatic subjects and on limited information on mixing patterns, such as the
grade structure of the school, can be almost as effective as whole-school closure, at a much lower
cost. This may inform public health policies for the management and mitigation of influenza-like
outbreaks in the community.
