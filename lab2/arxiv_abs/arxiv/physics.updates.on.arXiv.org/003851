The present experimental study addresses the flow of a Yield Stress Fluid with some elasticity (Carbopol
gel) in a square duct. The behaviour of two fluids with lower and higher yield stress is investigated
at multiple Reynolds numbers $Re^* \in$ (1, 200) and Bingham numbers $Bi \in$ (0.01, 0.35). A secondary
flow consisting of eight vortices is observed to recirculate the fluid from the corners to the core.
Their extent and intensity grows with increasing $Re^*$. The second objective of this study is to
explore the change in flow in the presence of particles. Almost neutrally-buoyant finite-size
spherical particles with duct height, $2H$, to particle diameter, $d_p$, ratio of 12 are used at
two volume fractions $\phi$ = 5 and 10\%. Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) is used to measure
the velocity of these refractive-index-matched spheres, and PIV to extract the fluid velocity.
Simple shadowgraphy is also used for qualitatively visualising the development of the particle
distribution along the streamwise direction. The particle distribution pattern changes from
being concentrated at the four corners, at low flow rates, to being focussed along a diffused ring
between the center and the corners, at high flow rates. The presence of particles induces streamwise
and wall-normal velocity fluctuations in the fluid phase; however, the primary Reynolds shear
stress is still very small compared to turbulent flows. The size of the plug in the particle-laden
cases appears to be smaller than the corresponding single phase cases. Similar to Newtonian fluids,
the friction factor increases due to the presence of particles, almost independently of the suspending
fluid matrix. Interestingly, predictions based on an increased effective suspension viscosity
agrees quite well with the experimental friction factor for the concentrations used in this study.
