The basal sliding of glaciers and ice sheets can constitute a large part of the total observed ice
velocity, in particular in dynamically active areas. It is therefore important to accurately represent
this process in numerical models. The condition that the sliding velocity should be tangential
to the bed is realized by imposing an impenetrability condition at the base. We study the, in glaciological
literature used, numerical implementations of the impenetrability condition for non-linear
Stokes flow with Navier's slip on the boundary. Using the finite element method, we enforce impenetrability
by: a local rotation of the coordinate system (strong method), a Lagrange multiplier method enforcing
zero average flow across each facet (weak method) and an approximative method that uses the pressure
variable as a Lagrange multiplier for both incompressibility and impenetrability. An analysis
of the latter shows that it relaxes the incompressibility constraint, but enforces impenetrability
approximately if the pressure is close to the normal component of the stress at the bed. Comparing
the methods numerically using a method of manufactured solutions unexpectedly leads to similar
convergence results. However, we find that, for more realistic cases, in areas of high sliding or
varying topography the velocity field simulated by the approximative method differs from that
of the other methods by $\sim 1\%$ (two-dimensional flow) and $> 5\%$ when compared to the strong
method (three-dimensional flow). In this study the strong method, which is the most commonly used
in numerical ice sheet models, emerges as the preferred method due to its stable properties (compared
to the weak method in three dimensions) and ability to well enforce the impenetrability condition.
