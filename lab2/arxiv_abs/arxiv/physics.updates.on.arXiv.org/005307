Noncollinear wave-mixing spectroscopies with attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses provide
unprecedented insight into electronic dynamics. In infrared and visible regimes, heterodyne
detection techniques utilize a reference field to amplify wave-mixing signals while simultaneously
allowing for phase-sensitive measurements. Here, we implement a self-heterodyned detection
scheme in noncollinear wave-mixing measurements with a short attosecond XUV pulse train and two
few-cycle near infrared (NIR) pulses. The initial spatiotemporally overlapped XUV and NIR pulses
generate a coherence of both odd (1snp) and even (1sns and 1snd) parity states within gaseous helium.
A variably delayed noncollinear NIR pulse generates angularly-dependent four-wave mixing signals
that report on the evolution of this coherence. The diffuse angular structure of the XUV harmonics
underlying these emission signals is used as a reference field for heterodyne detection, leading
to cycle oscillations in the transient wave-mixing spectra. With this detection scheme, wave-mixing
signals emitting from at least eight distinct light-induced, or dressed, states can be observed,
in contrast to only one light induced state identified in a similar homodyne wave-mixing measurement.
In conjunction with the self-heterodyned detection scheme, the noncollinear geometry permits
the conclusive identification and angular separation of distinct wave-mixing pathways, reducing
the complexity of transient spectra. These results demonstrate that the application of heterodyne
detection schemes can provide signal amplification and phase-sensitivity, while maintaining
the versatility and selectivity of noncollinear attosecond XUV wave-mixing spectroscopies.
These techniques will be important tools in the study of ultrafast dynamics within complex chemical
systems in the XUV regime.
