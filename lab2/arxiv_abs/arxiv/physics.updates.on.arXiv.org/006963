Formation of consensus, in binary yes/no type of voting, is a well defined process. However, even
in presence of clear incentives, the dynamics involved can be incredibly complex. Specifically,
formations of large groups of similarly opinionated individuals could create a condition of `support-bubbles'
or spontaneous polarization that renders consensus virtually unattainable (e.g., the question
of the UK exiting the EU). There have been earlier attempts in capturing the dynamics of consensus
formation in societies through simple $Z_2$-symmetric models hoping to capture the essential
dynamics of average behaviorof a large number of individuals in a statistical sense. However, in
absence of external noise, they tend to reach a frozen state with fragmented and polarized states
i.e., two or more groups of similarly opinionated groups with frozen dynamics. Here we show in a kinetic
exchange opinion model (KEM) considered on $L \times L$ square lattices, that while such frozen
states could be avoided, an exponentially slow approach to consensus is manifested. Specifically,
the system could either reach consensus in a time that scales as $L^2$ or a long lived metastable state
(termed a domain-wall state) for which formation of consensus takes a time scaling as $L^{3.6}$.
The latter behavior is comparable to some voter-like models with intermediate states studied previously.
The late-time anomaly in the time scale is reflected in the persistence probability of the model.
Finally, the interval of zero-crossing of the average opinion i.e., the time interval over which
the average opinion does not change sign is shown to follow a scale free distribution, which is compared
with that seen in the opinion surveys regarding Brexit and associated issues in the last 40 years.
The issue of minority spreading is also addressed by calculating the exit probability.
