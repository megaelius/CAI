This paper addresses the fundamental science question: "How does solar wind energy flow through
the Earth's magnetosphere, how is it converted and distributed?". We need to understand how the
Sun creates the heliosphere, and how the planets interact with the solar wind and its magnetic field,
not just as a matter of scientific curiosity, but to address a clear and pressing practical problem:
space weather, which can influence the performance and reliability of our technological systems,
in space and on the ground, and can endanger human life and health. Much knowledge has already been
acquired over the past decades, but the infant stage of space weather forecasting demonstrates
that we still have a vast amount of learning to do. We can tackle this issue in two ways: 1) By using multiple
spacecraft measuring conditions in situ in the magnetosphere in order to make sense of the fundamental
small scale processes that enable transport and coupling, or 2) By taking a global approach to observations
of the conditions that prevail throughout geospace in order to quantify the global effects of external
drivers. A global approach is now being taken by a number of space missions under development and
the first tantalising results of their exploration will be available in the next decade. Here we
propose the next step-up in the quest for a complete understanding of how the Sun gives rise to and
controls the Earth's plasma environment: a tomographic imaging approach comprising two spacecraft
which enable global imaging of magnetopause and cusps, auroral regions, plasmasphere and ring
current, alongside in situ measurements. Such a mission is going to be crucial on the way to achieve
scientific closure on the question of solar-terrestrial interactions.
