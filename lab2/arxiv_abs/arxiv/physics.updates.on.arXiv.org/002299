First-principles based lattice models allow the modeling of ab initio thermodynamics of crystalline
mixtures for applications such as the construction of phase diagrams and the identification of
ground state atomic orderings. The recent development of compressive sensing approaches for the
construction of lattice models has further enabled the systematic construction of sparse physical
models without the need for human intuition other than requiring the compactness of effective cluster
interactions. However, conventional compressive sensing based on L1-norm regularization is
strictly only applicable to certain classes of optimization problems and is otherwise not guaranteed
to generate optimally sparse and transferable results, so that the method can only be applied to
some materials science applications. In this paper, we illustrate a more robust L0L1-norm compressive-sensing
method that removes the limitations of conventional compressive sensing and generally results
in sparser lattice models that are at least as predictive as those obtained from L1-norm compressive
sensing. Apart from the theory, a practical implementation based on state-of-the-art mixed-integer
quadratic programming (MIQP) is proposed. The robustness of our methodology is illustrated for
four different transition-metal oxides with relevance as battery cathode materials: Li2xTi2(1-x)O2,
Li2xNi2yO2, MgxCr2O4, and NaxCrO2. This method provides a practical and robust approach for the
construction of sparser and more predictive lattice models, improving on the compressive sensing
paradigm and making it applicable to a much broader range of applications.
