Traditionally, interaction systems have been described as networks, where links encode information
on the pairwise influences among the nodes. Yet, in many systems, interactions take place in larger
groups. Recent work has shown that higher-order interactions between oscillators can significantly
affect synchronization. However, these early studies have mostly considered interactions up
to 4 oscillators at time, and analytical treatments are limited to the all-to-all setting. Here,
we propose a general framework that allows us to effectively study populations of oscillators where
higher-order interactions of all possible orders are considered, for any complex topology described
by arbitrary hypergraphs, and for general coupling functions. To this scope, we introduce a multi-order
Laplacian whose spectrum determines the stability of the synchronized solution. Our framework
is validated on three structures of interactions of increasing complexity. First, we study a population
with all-to-all interactions at all orders, for which we can derive in a full analytical manner the
Lyapunov exponents of the system, and for which we investigate the effect of including attractive
and repulsive interactions. Second, we apply the multi-order Laplacian framework to synchronization
on a synthetic model with heterogeneous higher-order interactions. Finally, we compare the dynamics
of coupled oscillators with higher-order and pairwise couplings only, for a real dataset describing
the macaque brain connectome, highlighting the importance of faithfully representing the complexity
of interactions in real-world systems. Taken together, our multi-order Laplacian allows us to
obtain a complete analytical characterization of the stability of synchrony in arbitrary higher-order
networks, paving the way towards a general treatment of dynamical processes beyond pairwise interactions.
