Spectroscopic mapping by scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy
loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) is a powerful technique for determining the structure and chemistry
of a wide range of materials and interfaces. The extension of this technique to cryogenic temperatures
opens the door to new experiments across many fields including materials physics, energy storage
and conversion, and biology. Such experiments, however, often face signal limitations due to sample
sensitivity or the need for rapid data acquisition under less stable cryogenic conditions. Compared
to traditional indirect detection systems such as charge coupled devices (CCDs), direct electron
detectors (DEDs) offer improved detective quantum efficiencies, narrower point spread functions,
and superior signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we compare the performance of a Gatan K2 Summit DED to
an UltraScan 1000 CCD for use in signal-limited atomic-resolution STEM-EELS experiments. Due
to its improved point spread function, the DED's energy resolution remains comparable to that of
the CCD at a 5 times lower dispersion, providing simultaneous access to a much broader total energy
range without sacrificing spectral resolution. More importantly, the benefits of direct detection
enable a variety of low-signal experiments, including atomic-resolution mapping of minor and
high energy edges such as the La-M$_{2,3}$ edge at 1123 eV and the Bi-M$_{4,5}$ edge at 2580 eV. For
rapid acquisitions at 400 spectra per second, elemental maps recorded with the DED show an up to 40
percent increase in atomic lattice fringe contrast compared to those acquired with the CCD. Taking
advantage of these performance improvements and the fast readout of the K2 DED, we use direct detection
STEM-EELS to demonstrate atomic-resolution elemental mapping at cryogenic temperatures.
