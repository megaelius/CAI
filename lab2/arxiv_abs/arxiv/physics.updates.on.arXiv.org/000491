In this paper, we study the effects of the acceleration gravity on the sedimentation deposition
probability, as well as the aerosol deposition rate on the surface of the Earth and Mars, but also
aboard a spacecraft in orbit around Earth and Mars as well for particles with density rho_p = 1300
kg/m^3, diameters d_p = 1, 3, 5 micrometers and residence times t = 0.0272, 0.2 s respectively. For
particles of diameter 1 micrometer we find that, on the surface of Earth and Mars the deposition probabilities
are higher at the poles when compared to the ones at the equator. Similarly, on the surface of the Earth
we find that the deposition probabilities exhibit 0.5% and 0.4% higher percentage difference at
the poles when compared to that of the equator, for the corresponding residence times. Moreover
in orbit equatorial orbits result to higher deposition probabilities when compared to polar ones.
For both residence times particles with the diameters considered above in circular and elliptical
orbits around Mars, the deposition probabilities appear to be the same for all orbital inclinations.
Sedimentation probability increases drastically with particle diameter and orbital eccentricity
of the orbiting spacecraft. Finally, as an alternative framework for the study of interaction and
the effect of gravity in biology, and in particular gravity and the respiratory system we introduce
is the term information in a way Shannon has introduced it, considering the sedimentation probability
as a random variable. This can be thought as a way in which gravity enters the cognitive processes
of the system (processing of information) in the cybernetic sense.
