In the seventies, scientists observed discrepancies of the bending of light around the Sun based
on Einstein's prediction of the curvature of star light due to the mass of the Sun. Discussions have
become silent, because no rigorous theoretical model was proposed. We claim that the interior electromagnetic
properties of the Sun influence the curvature of the light path outside the Sun as well. In this paper,
we investigate the additional deflection of light in the vacuum region surrounding the Sun by its
electromagnetic parameters. Starting with Maxwell's equations, we show how the deflection of
light passing the Sun depends on the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability of the
interior of the Sun. The electromagnetic field equations in Cartesian coordinates are transformed
to the ones in an appropriately chosen Riemannian space. This coordinate transform is dictated
by the introduction of a refractional potential. The geodetic lines with the shortest propagation
time are constructed from this potential. As far as the deflection of light propagating along these
geodetic lines is concerned, we show that the existence of a refractional potential influences
the light path outside any object with a typical refractive index. Our results add new aspects to
the bending of star light explained by general relativity. Some astrophysical observations, which
cannot be explained by gravity in a satisfactory manner, are justified by the electromagnetic model.
In particular, the frequency dependency of the light deflection is discussed. Our results show
that the additional bending due to the refractive index is proportional to the third power of the
inverse distance, while general relativity predicts that the bending due to the mass is proportional
to the inverse distance.
