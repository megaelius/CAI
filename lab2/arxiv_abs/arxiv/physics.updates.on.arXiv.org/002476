The two-fluid model based Multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (MCFD) has been considered
as one of the most promising tools to investigate two-phase flow and boiling system for engineering
purposes. The MCFD solver requires closure relations to make the conservation equations solvable.
The wall boiling closure relations, for example, provide predictions on wall superheat and heat
partitioning. The accuracy of these closure relations significantly influences the predictive
capability of the solver. In this paper, a study of validation and uncertainty quantification (VUQ)
for the wall boiling closure relations in MCFD solver is performed. The work has three purposes:
i). identify influential parameters to the quantities of interest of the boiling system through
sensitivity analysis; ii). evaluate the parameter uncertainty through Bayesian inference with
the support of multiple datasets; iii). quantitatively measure the agreement between solver predictions
and datasets. The widely used Kurul-Podowski wall boiling closure relation is studied in this paper.
Several statistical methods are used, including Morris screening method for global sensitivity
analysis, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for inverse Bayesian inference, and confidence interval
as the validation metric. The VUQ results indicated that the current empirical correlations-based
wall boiling closure relations achieved satisfactory agreement on wall superheat predictions.
However, the closure relations also demonstrate intrinsic inconsistency and fail to give consistently
accurate predictions for all quantities of interest over the well-developed nucleate boiling
regime.
