Diagnostics of the beam transverse profile with ever more demanding spatial resolution is required
by the progress on novel particle accelerators - such as laser and plasma driven accelerators - and
by the stringent beam specifications of the new generation of X-ray facilities. In a linac driven
Free-Electron-Laser (FEL), the spatial resolution constraint joins with the further requirement
for the diagnostics to be minimally invasive in order to protect radiation sensitive components
- such as the undulators - and to preserve the lasing mechanism. As for high resolution measurements
of the beam transverse profile in a FEL, wire-scanners (WS) are the top-ranked diagnostics. Nevertheless,
conventional WS consisting of a metallic wire (beam-probe) stretched onto a frame (fork) can provide
at best a rms spatial resolution at the micrometer scale along with an equivalent surface of impact
on the electron beam. In order to improve the spatial resolution of a WS beyond the micrometer scale
along with the transparency to the lasing, PSI and FERMI are independently pursuing the technique
of the nano-lithography to fabricate a free-standing and sub-micrometer wide WS beam-probe fully
integrated into a fork. Free-standing WS with a geometrical resolution of about 250 nm have been
successfully tested at SwissFEL where low charge electron beams with a vertical size of 400-500
nm have been characterized. Further experimental tests carried out at SwissFEL at the nominal beam
charge of 200 pC confirmed the resilience to the heat-loading of the nano-fabricated WS. In this
work, details on the nano-fabrication of free-standing WS as well as results of the electron-beam
characterization are presented.
