Although the extragalactic nature of quasars was discussed as early as 1960, it was rejected largely
because of preconceived ideas about what appeared to be an unrealistically high radio and optical
luminosity. Following the 1962 occultations of the strong radio source 3C 273 at Parkes, and the
subsequent identification with an apparent stellar object, Maarten Schmidt recognized that the
relatively simple hydrogen line Balmer series spectrum implied a redshift of 0.16 Successive radio
and optical measurements quickly led to the identification of other quasars with increasingly
large redshifts and the general, although for some decades not universal, acceptance of quasars
as being by far the most distant and the most luminous objects in the Universe. Curiously, 3C 273,
which is one of the strongest extragalactic sources in the sky, was first catalogued in 1959 and the
magnitude 13 optical counterpart was observed at least as early as 1887. Since 1960, much fainter
optical counterparts were being routinely identified using accurate radio interferometer positions,
measured primarily at the Caltech Owens Valley Radio Observatory. However, 3C 273 eluded identification
until the series of lunar occultation observations led by Cyril Hazard, although inexplicitly
there was an earlier misidentification with a faint galaxy located about an arc minute away from
the true position. Ironically, due to calculation error, the occultation position used by Schmidt
to determine the redshift of 3C 273 was in error by 14 arcseconds, and a good occultation position
was not derived until after Schmidt had obtained his 200 inch spectrum.
