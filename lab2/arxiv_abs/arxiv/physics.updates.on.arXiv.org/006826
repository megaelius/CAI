Primary neuronal cultures have been widely used to study neuronal morphology, neurophysiology,
neurodegenerative processes, and molecular mechanism of synaptic plasticity underlying learning
and memory. Yet, the unique behavioral properties of neurons make them challenging to study - with
phenotypic differences expressed as subtle changes in neuronal arborization rather than easy
to assay features such as cell count. The need to analyze morphology, growth, and intracellular
transport has motivated the development of increasingly sophisticated microscopes and image
analysis techniques. Due to its high-contrast, high-specificity output, many assays rely on confocal
fluorescence microscopy, genetic methods, or antibody staining techniques. These approaches
often limit the ability to measure quantitatively dynamic activity such as intracellular transport
and growth. In this work, we describe a method for label-free live-cell cell imaging with antibody
staining specificity by estimating the associated fluorescent signals via quantitative phase
imaging and deep convolutional neural networks. This computationally inferred fluorescence
image is then used to generate a semantic segmentation map, annotating subcellular compartments
of live unlabeled neural cultures. These synthetic fluorescence maps were further applied to study
the time-lapse development of hippocampal neurons, highlighting the relationships between the
cellular dry mass production and the dynamic transport activity within the nucleus and neurites.
Our implementation provides a high-throughput strategy to analyze neural network arborization
dynamically, with high specificity and without the typical phototoxicity and photobleaching
limitations associated with fluorescent markers.
