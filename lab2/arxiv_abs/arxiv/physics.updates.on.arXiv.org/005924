The Computer-Assisted Diagnosis systems could save workloads and give objective diagnostic to
ophthalmologists. At first, feature extraction is a fundamental step. One of these retinal features
is the fovea. The fovea is a small fossa on the fundus. The main vessels diverge from the optic nerve
head and follow a specific course that can be geometrically modeled as a parabola, with a common vertex
inside the optic nerve head and the fovea located along the apex of this parabola curve. Therefore,
based on this assumption, the main retinal blood vessels are segmented and fitted to a parabolic
model. With respect to the core vascular structure, we can thus detect fovea in the fundus images.
For the vessel segmentation, our algorithm addresses the image locally where homogeneity of features
is more likely to occur. The algorithm is composed of 4 steps: multi-overlapping windows, local
Radon transform, vessel validation, and parabolic fitting. In order to extract blood vessels,
sub-vessels should be extracted in local windows. The high contrast between blood vessels and image
background in the images cause the vessels to be associated with peaks in the Radon space. The largest
vessels, using a high threshold of the Radon transform, determine the main course or overall configuration
of the blood vessels which when fitted to a parabola, leads to the future localization of the fovea.
In effect, with an accurate fit, the fovea normally lies along the slope joining the vertex and the
focus. The darkest region along this line is indicative of the fovea. To evaluate our method, we used
220 fundus images from a rural database (MUMS-DB) and one public one (DRIVE). The results show that
among 20 images of the first public database (DRIVE) we detected fovea in 85\% of them. Also for the
MUMS-DB database among 200 images, we detect fovea correctly in 83% on them.
