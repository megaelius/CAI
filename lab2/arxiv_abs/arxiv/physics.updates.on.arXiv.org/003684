The voter model with multiple states has found applications in areas as diverse as population genetics,
opinion formation, species competition and language dynamics, among others. In a single step of
the dynamics, an individual chosen at random copies the state of a random neighbor in the population.
In this basic formulation it is assumed that the copying is perfect, and thus an exact copy of an individual
is generated at each time step. Here we introduce and study a variant of the multi-state voter model
in mean-field that incorporates a degree of imperfection or error in the copying process, which
leaves the states of the two interacting individuals similar but not exactly equal. This dynamics
can also be interpreted as a perfect copying with the addition of noise; a minimalistic model for
flocking. We found that the ordering properties of this multi-state noisy voter model, measured
by a parameter $\psi$ in [0, 1], depend on the amplitude $\eta$ of the copying error or noise and the
population size N. In the case of perfect copying $\eta=0$ the system reaches an absorbing configuration
with complete order ($\psi=1$) for all values of N. However, for any degree of imperfection $\eta>0$,
we show that the average value of $\psi$ at the stationary state decreases with N as $\langle \psi
\rangle \simeq 6/(\pi^2 \eta^2 N)$ for $\eta \ll 1$ and $\eta^2 N \gtrsim 1$, and thus the system becomes
totally disordered in the thermodynamic limit $N \to \infty$. We also show that $\langle \psi \rangle
\simeq 1-1.64 \, \eta^2 N$ in the vanishing small error limit $\eta \to 0$, which implies that complete
order is never achieved for $\eta > 0$. These results are supported by Monte Carlo simulations of
the model, which allow to study other scenarios as well.
