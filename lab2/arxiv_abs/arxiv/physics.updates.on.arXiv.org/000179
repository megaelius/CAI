By suitable reformulations, we review the mathematical frameworks of six different approaches
to the description of non-equilibrium dynamics with the purpose to set up a unified formulation
of the Maximum Entropy Production Principle (MEPP) valid in all these contexts. in this way, we extend
to such frameworks the concept of Steepest Entropy Ascent dynamics introduced by the present author
in previous work on quantum thermodynamics. Actually, the present formulation constitutes a generalization
also in the quantum thermodynamics framework. The analysis emphasizes that in the SEA implementation
of the MEPP, a key role is played by the geometrical metric with respect to which to measure the length
of a trajectory in state space. The metric tensor turns out to be directly related to the inverse of
the Onsager's generalized conductivity tensor. We conclude that in most of the existing theories
of non-equilibrium the time evolution of the state representative can be seen to actually follow
in state space the path of SEA with respect to a suitable metric connected with the generalized conductivities.
The resulting unified family of SAE dynamical models are all intrinsically consistent with the
second law of thermodynamics. The nonnegativity of the entropy production is a general and readily
proved feature of SEA dynamics. In several of the different approaches to non-equilibrium description
we consider here, the SEA concept has not been investigated before. Therefore, it is hoped that the
present unifying approach may prove useful in providing a fresh basis for effective, thermodynamically
consistent, numerical models and theoretical treatments of irreversible conservative relaxation
towards equilibrium from far non-equilibrium states.
