In recent years researchers in oil-gas industry have established that the contribution of memory
is significant for the modeling of fluid flow in unconventional reservoirs. Mathematically, a
memory-based fluid flow model can be described by the system of integro-differential equations.
Despite the fact that a large number of journal articles are devoted to numerical methods for the
forward solution of such equations, the problems of optimization and optimal control of these systems
are actual and insufficiently studied. We consider the one-dimensional model of gas filtration
and diffusion as a model with memory. The system includes a partial differential equation for filtration
in fractures and weakly singular Volterra integral equation of the second kind, which describes
the diffusion of gas from blocks with closed nanopores. Numerical simulation, obtained using a
Navot-trapezoidal algorithm, shows that the effect of memory influences on the distribution and
the time evolution of pressure and density in comparison with the classical double porosity model.
The pressure-constrained maximization of discounted cumulative gas production was chosen as
a basic optimization problem. The appearance of memory in the model makes the standard adjoint-based
approach not applicable since it was developed only for conventional systems of partial differential
equations. The novel adjoint model for media with memory was obtained from the necessary conditions
of optimality using the classical theory of calculus of variations and efficiently applied to production
optimization problem. In conclusion we compare optimal control scenarios for the model with memory
and for the classical double porosity model. Analysis has shown the importance of memory accounting
in reservoir optimization problems.
