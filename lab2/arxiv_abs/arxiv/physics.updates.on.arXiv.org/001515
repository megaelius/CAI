The dynamics of cascaded-order Brillouin lasers make them ideal for applications such as rotation
sensing, highly coherent optical communications, and low-noise microwave signal synthesis.
Remark- ably, when implemented at the chip-scale, recent experimental studies have revealed that
Brillouin lasers can operate in the fundamental linewidth regime where optomechanical and quantum
noise sources dominate. To explore new opportunities for enhanced performance, we formulate a
simple model to describe the physics of cascaded Brillouin lasers based on the coupled mode dynamics
governed by electrostriction and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. From this model, we obtain
analytical formulas describing the steady state power evolution and accompanying noise properties,
including expressions for phase noise, relative intensity noise and power spectra for beat notes
of cascaded laser orders. Our analysis reveals that cascading modifies the dynamics of intermediate
laser orders, yielding noise properties that differ from single-mode Brillouin lasers. These
modifications lead to a Stokes order linewidth dependency on the coupled order dynamics and a broader
linewidth than that predicted with previous single order theories. We also derive a simple analytical
expression for the higher order beat notes that enables calculation of the Stokes linewidth based
on only the relative measured powers between orders instead of absolute parameters, yielding a
method to measure cascaded order linewidth as well as a prediction for sub-Hz operation. We validate
our results using stochastic numerical simulations of the cascaded laser dynamics.
