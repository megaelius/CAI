Many real-world complex networks simultaneously exhibit topological features of scale-free
behaviour and hierarchical organization. In this regard, deterministic scale-free [A.-L. Barab\'asi
\etal, Physica A, 299, 3 (2001)] and pseudofractal scale-free [S. N. Dorogovtsev \etal, Phy. Rev.
E, 65, 6 (2002)] networks constitute notable models which simultaneously incorporate the aforementioned
properties. The rules governing the formation of such networks are completely deterministic.
However, real-world networks are presumably neither completely deterministic, nor perfectly
hierarchical. Therefore, we suggest here perfectly hierarchical scale-free networks with randomly
rewired edges as better representatives of practical networked systems. In particular, we preserve
the scale-free degree distribution of the various deterministic networks but successively relax
the hierarchical structure while rewiring them. We utilize the framework of master stability function
in investigating the synchronizability of dynamical systems coupled on such rewired networks.
Interestingly, this reveals that the process of rewiring is capable of significantly enhancing,
as well as, deteriorating the synchronizability of the resulting networks. We investigate the
influence of rewiring edges on the topological properties of the rewired networks and, in turn,
their relation to the synchronizability of the respective topologies. Finally, we compare the
synchronizability of deterministic scale-free and pseudofractcal scale-free networks with
that of random scale-free networks (generated using the classical Barab\'asi-Albert model of
growth and preferential attachment) and find that the latter ones promote synchronizability better
than their deterministic counterparts.
