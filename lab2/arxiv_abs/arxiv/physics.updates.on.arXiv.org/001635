Despite its prevalence and physical importance in biology, the mechanical properties of molecular
collagen are far from established. The flexibility of the triple helix is unresolved, with descriptions
from different experimental techniques ranging from flexible to semirigid. Furthermore, it is
unknown how collagen type (homo- vs. heterotrimeric) and source (tissue-derived vs. recombinant)
influence flexibility. Using SmarTrace, a chain tracing algorithm we devised, we performed statistical
analysis of collagen conformations collected with atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine
the protein's mechanical properties. Our results show that types I, II and III collagens - the key
fibrillar varieties - exhibit molecular flexibilities that are very similar. However, collagen
conformations are strongly modulated by salt, transitioning from compact to extended as KCl concentration
increases, in both neutral and acidic pH. While analysis with a standard worm-like chain model suggests
that the persistence length of collagen can attain almost any value within the literature range,
closer inspection reveals that this modulation of collagen's conformational behaviour is not
due to changes in flexibility, but rather arises from the induction of curvature (either intrinsic
or induced by interactions with the mica surface). By modifying standard polymer theory to include
innate curvature, we show that collagen behaves as an equilibrated curved worm-like chain (cWLC)
in two dimensions. Analysis within the cWLC model shows that collagen's curvature depends strongly
on pH and salt, while its persistence length does not. These results show that triple-helical collagen
is well described as semiflexible, irrespective of source, type, pH and salt environment.
