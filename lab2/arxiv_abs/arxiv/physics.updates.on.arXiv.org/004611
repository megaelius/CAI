We present a model-based, output-only parameter identification method for self-sustained oscillators
forced by dynamic noise, which we illustrate experimentally with an aeroacoustic setup: a turbulent
jet impinging a beer bottle and producing a whistling tone in a finite range of jet angles and velocities.
Given a low-order model of the system, the identification analyzes stationary time series of a single
observable: acoustic pressure fluctuations in the bottle. As this observable exhibits the characteristics
of weakly non-linear self-oscillations, we choose as a minimal model the Van der Pol (VdP) oscillator:
a linear acoustic oscillator (bottle) subject to stochastic forcing and non-linear deterministic
forcing (turbulent jet). Although very simple, the VdP oscillator driven by random noise proves
to be a sufficient phenomenological description of the aeroacoustic limit cycle for model-based
linear growth rate identification. The associated stochastic amplitude equation allows us to
describe the stochastic fluctuations of the acoustic amplitude resulting from a competition between
(i) linear growth rate from the coherent unsteady vortex force, (ii) random forcing from the turbulence,
(iii) non-linear saturation of the coherent flapping of the jet. Finally, the associated adjoint
Fokker-Planck equation reveals the deterministic potential well and the stochastic forcing intensity
governing these random fluctuations. Additional experiments with an external control validate
the identification results. We observe that different operating conditions can yield similar
statistics but different dynamics, showing that the identification method can disentangle deterministic
and stochastic effects in systems forced stochastically. This output-only identification approach
can be used in a wide range of phenomena exhibiting stationary self-sustained oscillations in the
presence of random forcing.
