Doping $La_2CuO_4$ with alkaline-earth, $Ae= Sr,Ba$, generates holes in the $La_{2-y-x}Ln_yAe_xCuO_4$
crystals. A small fraction of the holes, $\check{p} \le 0.02$, suppresses 3D-AFM. The remaining
holes reside at $O$ atoms. The superlattice, formed by the $O$ atoms, gives rise to charge density
stripes and magnetization stripes with incommensurability $q_{c,m}(x) \propto \sqrt{x-\check{p}}$.
Antiparallel orientation of magnetic moments $\mathbf{m}(O)$ naturally explains the coupling
$q_m(x) = \frac{1}{2} q_c(x)$ below the threshold of temperature dependence, $T < T'$. The setoff
value $\check{p}$ depends on the doping level and temperature. At $T \approx 0$ its value is $\check{p}
= 0.02$ for $x < 0.09$, but less, $\check{p} \approx 0.015$, for $0.09 < x < 0.14$. For higher $Ae$ doping
of $La_{2-x}Ae_xCuO_4$, a limited concentration of $Ae$ atoms replaces $La$ atoms and thereby
generates holes of constant density, $p(Sr) = 0.125$ or $p(Ba) = 0.14$. Their $O$ superlattice gives
rise to charge density stripes with $q_c(x) = 0.235$ (Sr) or 0.25 (Ba) for $x > p(Ae)$. The latter stripes
are 1:4 commensurate with the crystal lattice. The former stripes' incommensurability is caused
by 1:4 commensuration of the substituting $Sr^{2+}$ ions. Above the threshold temperature, $T
> T'$, electron-hole pairs are thermally generated, residing at $Cu^+$ ions and $O$ atoms. The latter,
adding to the $Ae$ generated holes, account for the increase of $q_c(x,T)$ with temperature. The
magnetic moments of the thermally generated $Cu^+$ ions oppose indirectly (in terms of antiparallel
compensation) the magnetic moments of the $O$ atoms. This breaks the locking of the incommensurability
of charge density and magnetization stripes, $q_m(x) \ne \frac{1}{2} q_c(x)$. The degree of antiparallel
compensation is determined by the relative magnitude of magnetic moments, $r = m(Cu^{2+})/m(O)$.
