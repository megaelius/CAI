The time periodic circuit theory is exploited to derive some useful properties of the spatial translation
operator (ABCD matrix) of space time modulated circuits, which unlike its linear time invariant
counterpart changes from one point to another along the structure. By casting the problem in an eigenvalue
problem form, the equivalency between solutions at different positions is highlighted. We also
prove that all points in the ($\beta$,$\omega$) plane parallel to the modulation velocity $\nu_m$
are equivalent in the sense that the eigenvectors are related by a shift operator. Additionally,
the wave propagation inside the space time periodic circuit as well as the terminal characteristics
are rigorously determined via the expansion of the total solution in terms of the eigenmodes, and
after imposing the suitable boundary conditions. To validate and demonstrate the usefulness of
the developed framework, two examples are provided. In the first, a space time modulated composite
right left handed transmission line is studied and results are compared with time domain simulation.
The second example is concerned with the characterization of the non-reciprocal behaviour observed
on a nonlinear transmission line that was manufactured in our lab. Circuit parameters, extracted
from measurements, are used to predict the wave behaviour inside the TL and its effect on the terminal
properties. Using the developed machinery it is shown that the passive interaction between different
harmonics results in an observed non-reciprocal behaviour, where $S_{21}\neq S_{12}$. The frequencies
at which non-reciprocity occurs and its strength agree with time domain simulation and measurements.
