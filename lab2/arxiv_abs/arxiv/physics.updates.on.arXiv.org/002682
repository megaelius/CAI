Ultracold atom-traps on a chip enhances the practical application of atom traps in quantum information
processing, sensing, and metrology. Plasmon mediated near-field optical potentials are promising
for trapping atoms. The combination of plasmonic nanostructures and ultracold atoms has the potential
to create a two dimensional array of neutral atoms with lattice spacing smaller than that of lattices
created from interfering light fields -- the optical lattices. We report the design, fabrication
and characterization of a nano-scale array of near-field optical traps for neutral atoms using
plasmonic nanostructures. The building block of the array is a metallic nano-disc fabricated on
the surface of an ITO-coated glass substrate. We numerically simulate the electromagnetic field-distribution
using Finite Difference Time Domain method around the nanodisc, and calculate the intensity, optical
potential and the dipole force for $^{87}$Rb atoms. The optical near-field generated from the fabricated
nanostructures is experimentally characterized by using Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy.
We find that the optical potential and dipole force has all the desired characteristics to trap cold
atoms when a blue-detuned light-field is used to excite the nanostructures. This trap can be used
for effective trapping and manipulation of isolated atoms and also for creating a lattice of neutral
atoms having sub-optical wavelength lattice spacing. Near-field measurements are affected by
the influence of tip on the sub-wavelength structure. We present a deconvolution method to extract
the actual near-field profile from the measured data.
