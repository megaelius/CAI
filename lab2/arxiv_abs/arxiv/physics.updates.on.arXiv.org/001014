We study the effect of cavity collapse in non-ideal explosives as a means of controlling their sensitivity.
The aim is to understand the origin of localised temperature peaks (hot spots) which play a key role
at the early stages of ignition. Thus we perform 2D and 3D numerical simulations of shock induced
gas-cavity collapse in nitromethane. Ignition is the result of a complex interplay between fluid
dynamics and exothermic chemical reaction. To understand the relative contribution between these
two processes we consider in this first part of the work the evolution of the physical system in the
absence of chemical reactions. We employ a multi-phase mathematical formulation which accounts
for the large density difference across the gas-liquid interface without generating spurious
temperature peaks. The mathematical and physical models are validated against experimental,
analytic and numerical data. Previous studies identified the impact of the upwind side of the cavity
wall to the downwind one as the main reason for the generation of a hot-spot outside of the cavity;
this is also observed in this work. However, it is apparent that the topology of the temperature field
is more complex than previously thought and additional hot spots locations exist, arising from
the generation of Mach stems rather than jet impact. To explain the generation mechanisms and topology
of the hot spots we follow the complex wave patterns generated and identify the temperature elevation
or reduction generated by each wave. This allows to track each hot spot back to its origins. We show
that the highest hot spot temperatures can be more than twice the post-incident shock temperature
of the neat material and can thus lead to ignition. By comparing the maximum temperature observed
in the domain in 2D and 3D simulations we show that 3D calculations are necessary to avoid belated
ignition times in reactive scenarios.
