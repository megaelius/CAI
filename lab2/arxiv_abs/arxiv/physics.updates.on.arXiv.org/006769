This paper investigates the generative designing of a bracket that aids in the rotation of a linkage
mounted on it with a revolute joint. Generative design is a term that is generally used when we care
about weight reduction and performance gain in the manufacturing sector. Optimization is also
a similar term. The only difference between the two is that generative design considers stress analysis
while optimization considers load paths to give the required result. For a critical analysis of
a generatively designed bracket, Autodesk Fusion 360 is used, which has in-built functionality
of working on the generative design on the cloud, given Preserve and Obstacle geometries, Starting
Shape and Resolution, Load cases and Constraints, Materials and Manufacturing methods. The generative
bracket's iterative solutions are explored and further validated with simulations such as stress
simulations, thermal simulations, buckling simulations, and modal frequencies, thus leading
to a proper result for forming design and mesh. After post-processing the bracket's design and mesh,
its CAD is further converted to CAM to send it for 3D printing under a suitable manufacturing method.
The final generative bracket design is linked and employed into the initial assembly to check its
proper working with the linkage, machine interface, and joints. The generated design considering
various parameters is the best finish for performance enhancement and weight reduction. This paper
will act as a basis for designing parts involving multiple studies and environments that will be
a topic of industrial research in future technologies.
