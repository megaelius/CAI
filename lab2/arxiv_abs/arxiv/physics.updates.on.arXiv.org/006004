Stars form as an end product of the gravitational collapse of cold, dense gas in magnetized molecular
clouds. This multi-scale scenario occurs via the formation of two quasi-hydrostatic cores and
involves complex physical processes, which require a robust, self-consistent numerical treatment.
The aim of this study is to understand the formation and evolution of the second Larson core and the
dependence of its properties on the initial cloud core mass. We used the PLUTO code to perform high
resolution, 1D and 2D RHD collapse simulations. We include self-gravity and use a grey FLD approximation
for the radiative transfer. Additionally, we use for the gas EOS density- and temperature-dependent
thermodynamic quantities to account for the effects such as dissociation, ionisation, and molecular
vibrations and rotations. Properties of the second core are investigated using 1D studies spanning
a wide range of initial cloud core masses from 0.5 to 100 $M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expand to 2D
collapse simulations for a few cases of 1, 5, 10, and 20 $M_{\odot}$. We follow the evolution of the
second core for $\geq$ 100 years after its formation, for each of these non-rotating cases. Our results
indicate a dependence of several second core properties on the initial cloud core mass. For the first
time, due to an unprecedented resolution, our 2D non-rotating collapse studies indicate that convection
is generated in the outer layers of the second core, which is formed due to the gravitational collapse
of a 1 $M_{\odot}$ cloud core. Additionally, we find large-scale oscillations of the second accretion
shock front triggered by the standing accretion shock instability, which has not been seen before
in early evolutionary stages of stars. We predict that the physics within the second core would not
be significantly influenced by the effects of magnetic fields or an initial cloud rotation.
