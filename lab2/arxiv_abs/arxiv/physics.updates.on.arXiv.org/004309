Scale free dynamics are observed in a variety of physical and biological systems. These include
neural activity in which evidence for scale freeness has been reported using a range of imaging modalities.
Here, we derive the ways in which connections within a network must transform - relative to system
size - in order to maintain scale freeness and test these theoretical transformations via simulations.
First, we explore the known invariance of planetary motion for orbits varying in size. Using parametric
empirical Bayesian modelling and a generic dynamical systems model, we show that we recover Kepler's
third law from orbital timeseries, using our proposed transformations; thereby providing construct
validation. We then demonstrate that the dynamical critical exponent is inversely proportional
to the time rescaling exponent, in the context of coarse graining operations. Using murine calcium
imaging data, we then show that the dynamical critical exponent can be estimated in an empirical
biological setting. Specifically, we compare dynamical critical exponents - associated with
spontaneous and task states in two regions of imaged cortex - that are classified as task-relevant
and task-irrelevant. We find, consistently across animals, that the task-irrelevant region exhibits
higher dynamical critical exponents during spontaneous activity than during task performance.
Conversely, the task-relevant region is associated with higher dynamical critical exponents
in task vs. spontaneous states. These data support the idea that higher dynamical critical exponents,
within relevant cortical structures, underwrite neuronal processing due to the implicit increase
in cross-scale information transmission.
