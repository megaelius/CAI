MRI offers outstanding soft tissue contrast that may reduce uncertainties in target and organ-at-risk
delineation and enable online adaptive image-guided treatment. Spatial distortions resulting
from non-linearities in the gradient fields and non-uniformity in the main magnetic field must
be accounted for across the imaging field-of-view to prevent systematic errors during treatment
delivery. This work presents a modular phantom and software application to characterize geometric
distortion (GD) within the large field-of-view MRI images required for radiation therapy simulation.
The modular phantom is assembled from a series of rectangular foam blocks containing high-contrast
fiducial markers in a known configuration. The modular phantom design facilitates transportation
of the phantom between different MR scanners and MR-guided linear accelerators and allows the phantom
to be adapted to fit different sized bores or coils. The phantom was evaluated using a 1.5T MR-guided
linear accelerator (MR-Linac) and 1.5T and 3.0T diagnostic scanners. Performance was assessed
by varying acquisition parameters to induce image distortions in a known manner. Imaging was performed
using T1 and T2 weighted pulse sequences with 2D and 3D distortion correction algorithms and the
receiver bandwidth (BW) varied as 250-815 Hz/pixel. Phantom set-up reproducibility was evaluated
across independent set-ups. The software was validated by comparison with a non-modular phantom.
Average geometric distortion was 0.94+/-0.58 mm for the MR-Linac, 0.90+/-0.53 mm for the 1.5 T scanner,
and 1.15+/-0.62 mm for the 3.0T scanner, for a 400 mm diameter volume-of-interest. GD increased,
as expected, with decreasing BW, and with the 2D versus 3D correction algorithm. Differences in
GD attributed to phantom set-up were 0.13 mm or less. Differences in GD for the two software applications
were less than 0.07 mm.
