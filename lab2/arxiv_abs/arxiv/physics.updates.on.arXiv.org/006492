In this study we performed a feasibility investigation on implementing a fast and accurate dose
calculation based on a deep learning technique. A two dimensional (2D) fluence map was first converted
into a three dimensional (3D) volume using ray traversal algorithm. A 3D U-Net like deep residual
network was then established to learn a mapping between this converted 3D volume, CT and 3D dose distribution.
Therefore an indirect relationship was built between a fluence map and its corresponding 3D dose
distribution without using significantly complex neural networks. 200 patients, including nasopharyngeal,
lung, rectum and breast cancer cases, were collected and applied to train the proposed network.
Additional 47 patients were randomly selected to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method through
comparing dose distributions, dose volume histograms (DVH) and clinical indices with the results
from a treatment planning system (TPS), which was used as the ground truth in this study. Results:
The proposed deep learning based dose calculation algorithm achieved good predictive performance.
For 47 tested patients, the average per-voxel bias of the deep learning calculated value and standard
deviation (normalized to the prescription), relative to the TPS calculation, is 0.17%. The average
deep learning calculated values and standard deviations for relevant clinical indices were compared
with the TPS calculated results and the t-test p-values demonstrated the consistency between them.
Conclusions: In this study we developed a new deep learning based dose calculation method. This
approach was evaluated by the clinical cases with different sites. Our results demonstrated its
feasibility and reliability and indicated its great potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy
of radiation dose calculation for different treatment modalities
