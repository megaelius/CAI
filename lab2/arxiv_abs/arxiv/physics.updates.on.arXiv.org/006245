Synchronization and chaos are two well known and ubiquitous phenomena in nature. Interestingly,
under specific conditions, coupled chaotic systems can display synchronization in some of their
observables. Here, we experimentally investigate bichromatic synchronization on the route to
chaos of two non-identical mechanically coupled optomechanical nanocavities. Electromechanical
near-resonant excitation of one of the resonators evidences hysteretic behaviors of the coupled
mechanical modes which can, under amplitude modulation, reach the chaotic regime. The observations,
allowing to measure directly the full phase space of the system, are accurately modeled by coupled
periodically forced Duffing resonators thanks to a complete calibration of the experimental parameters.
This shows that, besides chaos transfer from the mechanical to the optical frequency domain, spatial
chaos transfer between the two nonidentical subsystems occurs. Upon simultaneous excitations
of the coupled membranes modes, we also demonstrate bichromatic chaos synchronization between
quadratures at the two distinct carrier frequencies of the normal modes. Their respective quadrature
amplitudes are consistently synchronized thanks to the modal orthogonality breaking induced
by the nonlinearity. Meanwhile, their phases show complex dynamics with imperfect synchronization
in the chaotic regime. Our generic model agrees again quantitatively with the observed synchronization
dynamics. These results set the ground for the experimental study of yet unexplored collective
dynamics of e.g synchronization in arrays of strongly coupled, nanoscale nonlinear oscillators
for applications ranging from precise measurements to multispectral chaotic encryption and random
bit generation, and to analog computing, to mention a few.
