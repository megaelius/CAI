Large liquid argon detectors offer one of the best avenues for the detection of galactic weakly interacting
massive particles (WIMPs) via their scattering on atomic nuclei. The liquid argon target allows
exquisite discrimination between nuclear and electron recoil signals via pulse-shape discrimination
of the scintillation signals. Atmospheric argon (AAr), however, has a naturally occurring radioactive
isotope, $^{39}$Ar, a $\beta$ emitter of cosmogenic origin. For large detectors, the atmospheric
$^{39}$Ar activity poses pile-up concerns. The use of argon extracted from underground wells,
deprived of $^{39}$Ar, is key to the physics potential of these experiments. The DarkSide-20k dark
matter search experiment will operate a dual-phase time projection chamber with 50 tonnes of radio-pure
underground argon (UAr), that was shown to be depleted of $^{39}$Ar with respect to AAr by a factor
larger than 1400. Assessing the $^{39}$Ar content of the UAr during extraction is crucial for the
success of DarkSide-20k, as well as for future experiments of the Global Argon Dark Matter Collaboration
(GADMC). This will be carried out by the DArT in ArDM experiment, a small chamber made with extremely
radio-pure materials that will be placed at the centre of the ArDM detector, in the Canfranc Underground
Laboratory (LSC) in Spain. The ArDM LAr volume acts as an active veto for background radioactivity,
mostly $\gamma$-rays from the ArDM detector materials and the surrounding rock. This article describes
the DArT in ArDM project, including the chamber design and construction, and reviews the background
required to achieve the expected performance of the detector.
