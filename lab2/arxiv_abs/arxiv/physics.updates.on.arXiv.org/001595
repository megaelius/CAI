First, this paper broaches the definition of science and the epistemic yield of tenets and approaches:
phenomenological (descriptive only), well-founded (solid first principles, conducive to deep
understanding), provisional (falsifiable if universal, verifiable if existential), and imaginary
(fictitious entities or processes, conducive to empirically unsupported beliefs). The Big-Bang
pardigm and the {\Lambda}CDM "concordance model" involve such beliefs: the emanation of the universe
out of a non-physical stage, cosmic inflation (invented ad hoc), {\Lambda} (fictitious energy),
and exotic dark matter. They fail in the confidence check that is required in empirical science.
They also face a problem in delimiting what expands from what does not. In the more well-founded cosmology
that emerges, energy is conserved, the universe is persistent (not transient) and the 'perfect
cosmological principle' holds. Waves and other perturbations that propagate at c (the escape velocity
from the universe) expand exponentially with distance. This dilatation results from gravitation.
The cosmic web of galaxies does not expand. Potential {\Phi} varies as -H/(cz) instead of -1/r. Inertial
forces arise from gravitational interaction with the rest of the universe (not with space). They
are increased where the universe appears blueshifted and decreased more than proportionately
at very low accelerations. A cut-off acceleration a0 = 0.168 cH is deduced. This explains the successful
description of galaxy rotation curves by MoND. A fully elaborated physical theory is still pending.
The recycling of energy via a cosmic ocean filled with photons (the CMB), neutrinos and gravitons,
and wider implications for science, are briefly discussed.
