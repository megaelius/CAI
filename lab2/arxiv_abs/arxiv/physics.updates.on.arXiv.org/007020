Tunable diode laser induced fluorescence (TDLIF) measurements are discussed and quantitatively
evaluated for nitrogen admixtures in argon plasma under the influence of a strong magnetic field.
TDLIF measurements were used to evaluate light-transport properties in a strongly magnetized
optically thick argon/nitrogen plasma under different pressure conditions. Therefore, a coupled
system of rate balance equations was constructed to describe laser pumping of individual magnetic
sub-levels of $\mathrm{2p_8}$ state through frequency-separated sub-transitions originating
from $\mathrm{1s_4}$ magnetic sub-levels. The density distribution (alignment) of $\mathrm{2p_8}$
multiplet was described by balancing laser pumping with losses including radiative decay, transfer
of excitation between the neighboring sub-levels in the $\mathrm{2p_8}$ multiplet driven by neutral
collisions (argon and nitrogen) and quenching due to electron and neutral collisions. Resulting
$\mathrm{2p_8}$ magnetic sub-level densities were then used to model polarization dependent
fluorescence, considering self-absorption, which could be directly compared with polarization-resolved
TDLIF measurements. This enables to estimate the disalignment rate constant for the $\mathrm{2p_8}$
state due to collisions by molecular nitrogen. A comparison to molecular theory description is
given providing satisfactory agreement. The presented measurement method and model can help to
describe optical emission of argon and argon-nitrogen admixtures in magnetized conditions and
provides a basis for further description of optical emission spectra in magnetized plasmas.
