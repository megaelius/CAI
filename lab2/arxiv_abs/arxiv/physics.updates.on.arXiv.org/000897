We developed an algorithm for high-quality, non-invasive maternal and fetal ECG (fECG) monitoring.
We tested its ability to extract fECG from a single channel maternal thoracic ECG signal rather than
the routine abdominal signal, and compare it with other algorithms. At 126dG, ECG was attached to
near-term ewe and fetal shoulders, manubrium and xyphoid processes (n=12). Fetal ECG served as
the ground-truth to which the fetal ECG signal extracted from the simultaneously-acquired maternal
ECG was compared. The fECG extraction algorithm requires three steps. First, the de-shape short-time
Fourier transform (STFT) is applied to estimate the maternal instantaneous heart rate, and hence
maternal R peaks. Second, the nonlocal Euclidean median (NLEM) is applied to recover the maternal
ECG. By direct subtraction, we obtain the rough fECG. Third, the fetal R peaks and fECG are obtained
by applying the deshape STFT and the NLEM. All fetuses were in good health during surgery. In all animals,
our algorithm and two widely applied single lead fetal ECG extraction algorithms failed to extract
any fECG from the thorax maternal ECG signal with the F1 less than 50%. The applied fECG extraction
algorithms might be unsuitable for the thoracic maternal ECG signal, or the latter does not contain
strong enough fECG signal, although the lead is near the mother's abdomen. Fetal sheep model is widely
used to mimic various fetal conditions, yet ECG recordings in a public data set form are not available
to test the predictive ability of fECG and FHR. A challenge is the requirement to perform a sterile
fetal surgical instrumentation with precordial ECG leads. We are making this data set openly available
to other researchers and inviting others to share their maternal/fetal ECGs to foster non-invasive
fECG acquisition in this animal model.
