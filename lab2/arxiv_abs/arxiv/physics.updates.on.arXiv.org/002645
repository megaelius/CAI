In recent papers, a few physicists studying Black Hole perturbation theory in General Relativity
have tried to construct the initial part of a differential sequence based on the Kerr metric, using
methods similar to the ones they already used for studying the Schwarzschild geometry. Of course,
such a differential sequence is well known for the Minkowski metric and successively contains the
Killing (order 1), the Riemann (order 2) and the Bianchi (order 1 again) operators in the linearized
framework, as a particular case of the {\it Vessiot structure equations}. In all these cases, they
discovered that the {\it compatibility conditions} (CC) for the corresponding Killing operator
were involving {\it a mixture of both second order and third order CC} and their idea has been to exhibit
only a {\it minimal number of generating ones}. However, even if they exhibited a link between these
differential sequences and the number of parameters of the Lie group preserving the background
metric, they have been unable to provide an intrinsic explanation of this fact, being limited by
the technical use of Weyl spinors, complex Teukolsky scalars or Killing-Yano tensors. Using the
formal theory of systems of partial differential equations and Lie pseudogroups, the purpose of
this difficult computational paper is to provide new intrinsic differential and homological methods
involving the Spencer operator in order to revisit and solve these questions, not only in the previous
cases but also in the specific case of any Lie group or Lie pseudogroup of transformations. These
new tools are now available as computer algebra packages.
