The starting point of the present review is to acknowledge that there are innumerable reports of
non-seismic types of earthquake precursory phenomena that are intermittent and seem not to occur
systematically, while associated reports are not widely accepted by the geoscience community
at large because no one could explain their origins. We review a unifying theory for a solid-state
mechanism, based on decades of research bridging semi-conductor physics, chemistry and rock physics.
A synthesis has emerged that all pre-earthquake phenomena could trace back to one fundamental physical
process: the activation of electronic charges (electrons and positive holes) in rocks subjected
to ever-increasing tectonic stresses prior to any major seismic activity, via the rupture of peroxy
bonds. In the second part of the review, we critically examine satellite and ground station data,
recorded before past large earthquakes, as they have been claimed to provide evidence that precursory
signals tend to become measurable days, sometimes weeks before the disasters. We review some of
the various phenomena that can be directly predicted by the peroxy defect theory , namely, radon
gas emanations, corona discharges, thermal infrared emissions, air ionization, ion and electron
content in the ionosphere, and electro-magnetic anomalies. Our analysis demonstrates the need
for further systematic investigations, in particular with strong continuous statistical testing
of the relevance and confidence of the precursors. Only then, the scientific community will be able
to assess and improve the performance of earthquake forecasts.
