Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBPs) are widely used to treat bone density loss and skeletal
disorders. The adsorption, retention, diffusion, and release of (NBPs) in bone minerals are governed
by their binding affinities to such minerals. Extensive crystal growth, nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies have been conducted to measure the binding
affinities of NBPs to bone minerals, but the results have been inconsistent. In this work, we examined
the binding free energies of zoledronate (ZOL), risedronate (RIS), pamidronate (PAM), alendronate
(ALN), and ibandronate (IBN) to neat and protonated hydroxyapatite (HAP) surfaces including (001),
(010), and (101) facets through molecular dynamics. Our simulation results showed that nitrogen-containing
functional groups and surface protonation influence the binding affinities of BPs to HAP surfaces.
The hydrophilic behavior of nitrogen-containing functional groups enabled ZOL have a larger binding
free energy than RIS and IBN at neat HAP surfaces. The protonated and slender amine groups of PAM and
IBN enabled them have larger binding free energies and wider potential wells than that of ZOL, RIS,
and IBN at neat and protonated HAP surfaces. In general, surface protonation in general reduced
the binding affinities of NBPs except protonated (010) surfaces. NBPs preferred to immerse at the
grooves of protonated (010) surfaces with high binding free energies, and the immersions were consistent
with a site-binding model developed from (ITC) measurements. Based on our simulations results
we propose that the binding rank is ALN > PAM > ZOL > IBN > RIS which is consistent with NMR and ITC studies,
and the rank at neat (001) surfaces is ZOL > ALN > IBN > RIS, which correlates with crystal growth studies.
The simulation results helped to unify diverged observations in the literature.
