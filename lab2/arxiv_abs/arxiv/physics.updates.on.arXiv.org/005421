Purpose: Multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) poses a challenge in proton CT (pCT) image reconstruction.
The assumption of straight paths is replaced with Bayesian models of the most likely path (MLP).
Current MLP-based pCT reconstruction approaches assume a water scattering environment. We propose
an MLP formalism based on accurate determination of scattering moments in inhomogeneous media.
Methods: Scattering power relative to water (RScP) was calculated for a range of human tissues and
investigated against relative stopping power (RStP). Monte Carlo simulation was used to compare
the new inhomogeneous MLP formalism to the water approach in a slab geometry and a human head phantom.
An MLP-Spline-Hybrid method was investigated for improved computational efficiency. Results:
A piecewise-linear correlation between RStP and RScP was shown, which may assist in iterative pCT
reconstruction. The inhomogeneous formalism predicted Monte Carlo proton paths through a water
cube with thick bone inserts to within 1.0 mm for beams ranging from 210 to 230 MeV incident energy.
Improvement in accuracy over the conventional MLP ranged from 5% for a 230 MeV beam to 17% for 210 MeV.
There was no noticeable gain in accuracy when predicting 200 MeV proton paths through a clinically
relevant human head phantom. The MLP-Spline-Hybrid method reduced computation time by half while
suffering negligible loss of accuracy. Conclusions: We have presented an MLP formalism that accounts
for material composition. In most clinical cases a water scattering environment can be assumed,
however in certain cases of significant heterogeneity the proposed algorithm may improve proton
path estimation.
