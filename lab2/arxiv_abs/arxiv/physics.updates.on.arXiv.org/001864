Breakthrough Starshot is an initiative to prove ultra-fast light-driven nanocrafts, and lay the
foundations for a first launch to Alpha Centauri within the next generation. Along the way, the project
could generate important supplementary benefits to solar system exploration. A number of hard
engineering challenges remain to be solved before these missions can become a reality. A system
model has been formulated as part of the Starshot systems engineering work. This paper presents
the model and describes how it computes cost-optimal point designs. Using the model, three scenarios
are examined: A 0.2 c mission to Alpha Centauri, a 0.01 c solar system precursor mission, and a ground-based
test facility based on a vacuum tunnel. All assume that the photon pressure from a 1.06 {\mu}m wavelength
beam accelerates a circular dielectric sail. The 0.2 c point design assumes \$0.01/W lasers, \$500/m$^2$
optics, and \$50/kWh energy storage to achieve \$8.3B capital cost for the ground-based beam director.
In contrast, the energy needed to accelerate each sail costs \$7M. Beam director capital cost is
minimized by a 4.2 m diameter sail that is accelerated for 10 min. The 0.01 c point design assumes \$1/W
lasers, \$10k/m$^2$ optics, and \$100/kWh energy storage to achieve \$517M capital cost for the
beam director and \$8k energy cost to accelerate each 19 cm diameter sail. The ground-based test
facility assumes \$100/W lasers, \$1M/m$^2$ optics, \$500/kWh energy storage, and \$10k/m vacuum
tunnel. To reach 20 km/s, fast enough to escape the solar system from Earth, takes 0.3 km of vacuum
tunnel, 16 kW of lasers, and a 0.9 m diameter telescope, all of which costs \$6M. The system model predicts
that, ultimately, Starshot scales to cruise velocities of greater than 0.9 c.
