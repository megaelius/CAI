Within the context that Greece promises a success story in the fight against the disease, this paper
proposes a novel method to study the evolution of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve in relation
to the anti-COVID-19 policies applied to control the pandemic. Based on the ongoing spreading of
COVID-19 and the insufficient data for applying classic time-series approaches, the analysis
builds on the visibility graph algorithm to study the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve as a complex
network. By using the modularity optimization algorithm, the generated visibility graph is divided
into communities defining periods of different connectivity in the time-series body. These periods
reveal a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting with a power
pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern intermediates, being followed by
a couple of exponential patterns, and ending up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that
the evolution of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation. The network analysis
also illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low-degree nodes, implying a low
probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and high uncertainty in the variability
of other values below the average. The overall approach contributes to the scientific research
by proposing a novel method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which
allows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better forecasting,
and provides insights of good policy and decision-making practices and management that may help
other countries improve their performance in the war against COVID-19.
