The study of nuclei farther from the valley of $\beta$-stability goes hand-in-hand with shorter-lived
nuclei produced in smaller abundances than their more stable counterparts. The measurement, to
high precision, of nuclear masses therefore requires innovations in technique in order to keep
up. TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TITAN) facility deploys three ion traps, with
a fourth in the commissioning phase, to perform and support Penning trap mass spectrometry and in-trap
decay spectroscopy on some of the shortest-lived nuclei ever studied. We report on recent advances
and updates to the TITAN facility since the 2012 EMIS Conference. TITAN's charge breeding capabilities
have been improved and in-trap decay spectroscopy can be performed in TITAN's electron beam ion
trap (EBIT). Higher charge states can improve the precision of mass measurements, reduce the beam-time
requirements for a given measurement, improve beam purity and opens the door to access, via in-trap
decay and recapture, isotopes not available from the ISOL method. This was recently demonstrated
during TITAN's mass measurement of $^{30}$Al. The EBIT's decay spectroscopy setup was commissioned
with a successful branching ratio and half-life measurement of $^{124}$Cs. Charge breeding in
the EBIT increases the energy spread of the ion bunch sent to the Penning trap for mass measurement
so a new Cooler Penning Trap (CPET), which aims to cool highly charge ions with an electron plasma,
is undergoing online commissioning. Already, CPET has demonstrated the trapping and self-cooling
of a room-temperature electron plasma which was stored for several minutes. A new detector has been
installed inside the CPET magnetic field which will allow for in-magnet charged particle detection.
