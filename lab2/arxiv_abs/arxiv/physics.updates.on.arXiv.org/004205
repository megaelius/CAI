With recent advances in air breathable engines comes more extreme temperature environments that
engine components must tolerate. During the design of these engines, it is necessary to understand
how material fatigue failures occur at these new, higher operating temperatures. In providing
understanding, the following fundamental study focuses on the statistical nature of crack jumps
(changes in crack length over time) during fatigue in a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy,
Inconel 718 (IN718). In situ measurement of the crack length at several loading conditions were
conducted using a direct current potential drop (DCPD) measurement method. Experimental data
was collected at six different fatigue peak loads (R=0.15) for a statistically significant number
of trials (n>=17). Calibration curves to relate electrical potential to crack length were derived
from FEA and compared to analytical equations. It was determined that the mean normalized change
in crack length over subsequent cycles increases with peak load. The standard deviation of the crack
lengths remains constant for all loading cases. The signal-to-noise ratio was found to be best at
or above a peak load of 1600N (29.65% of YS) for the given sample geometry. Results of the normalized
change in crack length for a single case deviated from a Gaussian distribution. However, when all
trials were considered at a single load, the distribution of the normalized change in crack length
conformed to a Gaussian distribution. This lack of conformity for a single case can be explained
by the history dependence of prior crack events on the crack growth for an individual specimen. This
temporal information as the crack evolves, which is often overlooked in fatigue experiments, is
hypothesized to be well suited for a machine learning approach that can better predict fatigue failures
in superalloys.
