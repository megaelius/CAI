In this paper, we propose novel practicable GLHUA invisible cloak, our cloak absorbs the incident
wave and, in the meantimely, creates outgoing wave that make it to be invisible cloak and analytical
electromagnetic wave without exceeding light speed propagation. Ten more discoveries and creations
are reported. 1. New GLHUA annular layer electromagnetic (EM) invisible cloak with relative parameter
not less than 1. 2. Analytical EM wave solution of EM full wave equation with the GLHUA 1 cloak materials
is found, In annular layer cloak,$R_1 \le r \le R_2 $, $R_1>0$,$R_2>R_1$, $\varepsilon_r = \mu_r
= \frac{{R_2 ^2 }}{{r^2 }}$, $\varepsilon_\theta = \varepsilon_\phi = \mu_\theta = \mu_\phi =
\frac{{R_2 - R_1 }}{{r - R_1 }}$. 3. A GLHUA expansion method to find an exact analytical EM wave propagation
in the GLHUA double cloak is propsed. 4.Novel negative space is proposed.5. GLHUANP transformation
is proposed, whichmaps negative infinity,$ - \infty $ to $R_1$ and $-R_2$ to $R_2$. 6. The GLHUANP
transformation creates GLHUA 2 cloak. 7.We find analytical EM wave without exceeding light speed
propagation in the cloak. 8. GLHUA 1 and GLHUA 2 cloaks absorb the incident wave and, in the meantimely,
create outgoing wave that make them invisible cloak and analytical electromagnetic wave through
them.9. GLHUAF transformation is proposed and 10.GLHUAF invisible cloak with double negative
materials is created. 11. We discover a novel GLHUA wave attached in the inner sphere surface $r =
R_1$ , which is absorb and create bridge. 12. The wave front and ray tracing in GLHUA cloak are discontinuous,
the continuous ray redirection method can not be used to study GLHUA invisible cloak. In my arXiv:1612.02857,
