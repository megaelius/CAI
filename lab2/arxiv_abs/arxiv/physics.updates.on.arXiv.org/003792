Exact nonadiabatic quantum evolution preserves many geometric properties of the molecular Hilbert
space. In a companion paper [S. Choi and J. Van\'{\i}\v{c}ek, 2019], we presented numerical integrators
of arbitrary-order of accuracy that preserve these geometric properties exactly even in the adiabatic
representation, in which the molecular Hamiltonian is not separable into a kinetic and potential
terms. Here, we focus on the separable Hamiltonian in diabatic representation, where the split-operator
algorithm provides a popular alternative because it is explicit and easy to implement, while preserving
most geometric invariants. Whereas the standard version has only second-order accuracy, we implemented,
in an automated fashion, its recursive symmetric compositions, using the same schemes as in the
companion paper, and obtained integrators of arbitrary even order that still preserve the geometric
properties exactly. Because the automatically generated splitting coefficients are redundant,
we reduce the computational cost by pruning these coefficients and lower memory requirements by
identifying unique coefficients. The order of convergence and preservation of geometric properties
are justified analytically and confirmed numerically on a one-dimensional two-surface model
of NaI and a three-dimensional three-surface model of pyrazine. As for efficiency, we find that
to reach a convergence error of 10$^{-10}$, a 600-fold speedup in the case of NaI and a 900-fold speedup
in the case of pyrazine are obtained with the higher-order compositions instead of the second-order
split-operator algorithm. The pyrazine results suggest that the efficiency gain survives in higher
dimensions.
