The microphysics of ~GeV cosmic ray (CR) transport on galactic scales remain deeply uncertain,
with almost all studies adopting simple prescriptions (e.g. constant-diffusivity). We explore
different physically-motivated, anisotropic, dynamical CR transport scalings in high-resolution
cosmological FIRE simulations of dwarf and ~$L_{\ast}$ galaxies where scattering rates vary with
local plasma properties motivated by extrinsic turbulence (ET) or self-confinement (SC) scenarios,
with varying assumptions about e.g. turbulent power spectra on un-resolved scales, Alfven-wave
damping, etc. We self-consistently predict observables including $\gamma$-rays ($L_{\gamma}$),
grammage, residence times, and CR energy densities to constrain the models. We demonstrate many
non-linear dynamical effects (not captured in simpler models) tend to enhance confinement. For
example, in multi-phase media, even allowing arbitrary fast transport in neutral gas does not substantially
reduce CR residence times (or $L_{\gamma}$), as transport is rate-limited by the ionized WIM and
'inner CGM' gaseous halo ($10^{4}-10^{6}$ K gas within 10-30 kpc), and $L_{\gamma}$ can be dominated
by trapping in small 'patches.' Most physical ET models contribute negligible scattering of ~1-10
GeV CRs, but it is crucial to account for anisotropy and damping (especially of fast modes) or else
scattering rates would violate observations. We show that the most widely-assumed scalings for
SC models produce excessive confinement by factors >100 in the WIM and inner CGM, where turbulent
and Landau damping dominate. This suggests either a breakdown of quasi-linear theory used to derive
the CR transport parameters in SC, or that other novel damping mechanisms dominate in intermediate-density
ionized gas.
