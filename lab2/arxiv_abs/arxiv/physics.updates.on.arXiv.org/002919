Electron dynamics and energization are one of the key components of magnetic field dissipation
in collisionless reconnection. In 2D numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection, the main
mechanism that limits the current density and provides an effective dissipation is most probably
the electron pressure tensor term, that has been shown to break the frozen-in condition at the x-point.
In addition, the electron-meandering-orbit scale controls the width of the electron dissipation
region, where the electron temperature has been observed to increase both in recent Magnetospheric
Multiple-Scale (MMS) observations as well as in laboratory experiments, such as the Magnetic Reconnection
Experiment (MRX). By means of two-dimensional full-particle simulations in an open system, we
investigate how the energy conversion and particle energization depend on the guide field intensity.
We study the energy transfer from magnetic field to the plasma, ${\bf E}\cdot {\bf J}$ and the threshold
guide field separating two regimes where either the parallel component, $E_{||}J_{||}$, or the
perpendicular component, ${\bf E}_{\perp}\cdot {\bf J}_{\perp}$, dominate the energy transfer,
confirming recent MRX results and also consistent with MMS observations. We calculate the energy
partition between fields, kinetic, and thermal energy of different species, from electron to ion
scales, showing there is no significant variation for different guide field configurations. Finally
we study possible mechanisms for electron perpendicular heating by examining electron distribution
functions and self-consistently evolved particle orbits in high guide field configurations.
