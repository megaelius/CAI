Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The contraction
and relaxation of left ventricle (LV) is the main driving force of blood circulation. Altered LV
hemodynamics is believed to be associated with the initiation and progression of many CVDs. Thus,
understanding and evaluating the flow pattern inside a patient LV is thought to be essential to capture,
and subsequently treat, cardiovascular dysfunction at early stages to reduce the mortality and
morbidity rates. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, often derived from patient-specific
medical imaging, have been used to provide a more fundamental understanding of individual LV flow
patterns and pressure fields. Such image-based modeling may advance diagnostic capabilities,
treatment protocols and help guide clinicians to choose the most effective therapy of CVDs. Most
prior ventricular flow studies obtained LV wall geometries from in vivo ultrasound-based or cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images with limited resolution. The model geometries were often
highly simplified and usually lacked the papillary muscles (PM) and the corrugated trabecular
structures of the LV. Since the LV flow pattern is sensitive to geometry, it is important to understand
the effect of this simplification on modeling intraventricular flow and pressure. Here we apply
CFD modeling to a subject-specific porcine LV model with detailed ventricular structures and motion
obtained from previous solid mechanics finite-element (FE) simulations based on high-resolution
image data. We simplified the detailed LV endocardial surfaces to remove PM and trabecular structures
and built a smoothed model that resembles the resolution of in vivo MRI images. We then compare the
simulated LV flow pattern and pressure of the simplified models to those of the complex model.
