We demonstrate the fabrication of $\sim$1.08 $\mu$m deep microfluidic cavities with characteristic
size as large as 7 mm $\times$ 11 mm or 11 mm diameter, using a silicon$-$glass anodic bonding technique
that does not require posts to act as separators to define cavity height. Since the phase diagram
of $^3$He is significantly altered under confinement, posts might act as pinning centers for phase
boundaries. The previous generation of cavities relied on full wafer-bonding which is more prone
to failure and requires dicing post-bonding, whereas the these cavities are made by bonding a pre-cut
piece of Hoya SD-2 glass to a patterned piece of silicon in which the cavity is defined by etching.
Anodic bonding was carried out at 425 $^{\circ}$C with 200 V, and we observe that pressurizing the
cavity to failure ($>$ 30 bar pressure) results in glass breaking, rather than the glass-silicon
bond separation. In this article, we discuss the detailed fabrication of the cavity, its edges,
and details of the junction between the coin silver fill line and the silicon base of the cavity that
enables a low internal-friction joint. This feature is important for mass coupling torsional oscillator
experimental assays of the superfluid inertial contribution where a high quality factor ($Q$)
improves frequency resolution. The surface preparation that yields well-characterized smooth
surfaces to eliminate pinning sites, the use of transparent glass as a cover permitting optical
access, low temperature capability and attachment of pressure-capable ports for fluid access
may be features that are important in other applications.
