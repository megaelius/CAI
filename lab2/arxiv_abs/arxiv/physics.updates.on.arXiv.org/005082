We describe an efficient near-field to far-field transformation for optical quasinormal modes,
which are the dissipative modes of open cavities and plasmonic resonators with complex eigenfrequencies.
As an application of the theory, we show how one can compute the reservoir modes (or regularized quasinormal
modes) outside the resonator, which are essential to use in both classical and quantum optics. We
subsequently demonstrate how to efficiently compute the quantum optical parameters necessary
in the theory of quantized quasinormal modes [Franke et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 213901 (2019)].
To confirm the accuracy of our technique, we directly compare with a Dyson equation approach currently
used in the literature (in regimes where this is possible), and demonstrate several order of magnitude
improvement for the calculation run times. We also introduce an efficient pole approximation for
computing the quantized quasinormal mode parameters, since they require an integration over a
range of frequencies. Using this approach, we show how to compute regularized quasinormal modes
and quantum optical parameters for a full 3D metal dimer in under one minute on a standard desktop
computer. Our technique is exemplified by studying the quasinormal modes of metal dimers and a hybrid
structure consisting of a gold dimer on top of a photonic crystal beam. In the latter example, we show
how to compute the quantum optical parameters that describe a pronounced Fano resonance, using
structural geometries that cannot practically be solved using a Dyson equation approach. All calculations
for the spontaneous emission rates are confirmed with full-dipole calculations in Maxwell's equations
and are shown to be in excellent agreement.
