We introduce novel sets of measures with the goal of describing dynamical properties of force networks
in dense particulate systems. The presented approach is based on persistent homology and allows
for extracting precise, quantitative measures that describe the evolution of geometric features
of the interparticle forces, without necessarily considering the details related to individual
contacts between particles. The networks considered emerge from discrete element simulations
of two dimensional particulate systems consisting of compressible frictional circular disks.
We quantify the evolution of the networks for slowly compressed systems undergoing jamming transition.
The main findings include uncovering significant but localized changes of force networks for unjammed
systems, global (system-wide) changes as the systems evolve through jamming, to be followed by
significantly less dramatic evolution for the jammed states. We consider both connected components,
related in loose sense to force chains, and loops, and find that both measures provide a significant
insight into the evolution of force networks. In addition to normal, we consider also tangential
forces between the particles and find that they evolve in the consistent manner. Consideration
of both frictional and frictionless systems leads us to the conclusion that friction plays a significant
role in determining the dynamical properties of the considered networks. We find that the proposed
approach describes the considered networks in a precise yet tractable manner, allowing to identify
novel features which could be difficult or impossible to describe using other approaches.
