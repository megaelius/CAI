This paper takes James David Forbes' Encyclopaedia Britannica entry, Dissertation Sixth, as a
lens to examine physics as a cognitive, practical, and social, enterprise. Forbes wrote this survey
of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century mathematical and physical sciences, in 1852-6, when British
"physics" was at a pivotal point in its history, situated between a discipline identified by its
mathematical methods - originating in France - and one identified by its university laboratory
institutions. Contemporary encyclopaedias provided a nexus for publishers, the book trade, readers,
and men of science, in the formation of physics as a field. Forbes was both a witness, whose account
of the progress of physics or natural philosophy can be explored at face value, and an agent, who exploited
the opportunity offered by the Encyclopaedia Britannica in the mid nineteenth-century to enrol
the broadly educated public, and scientific collective, illuminating the connection between
the definition of physics and its forms of social practice. Forbes used the terms "physics" and "natural
philosophy" interchangeably. He portrayed the field as progressed by the natural genius of great
men, who curated the discipline within an associational culture that engendered true intellectual
spirit. Although this societal mechanism was becoming ineffective, Forbes did not see university
institutions as the way forward. Instead, running counter to his friend William Whewell, he advocated
inclusion of the mechanical arts (engineering), and a strictly limited role for mathematics. He
revealed tensions when the widely accepted discovery-based historiography conflicted with intellectual
and moral worth, reflecting a nineteenth-century concern with spirit that cuts across twentieth-century
questions about discipline and field.
