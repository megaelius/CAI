This work presents the mathematical and computational aspects of a smooth dissipative particle
dynamics with dynamic virtual particle allocation method (SDPD-DV) for modeling and simulation
of mesoscopic fluids in wall-bounded domains. The SDPD-DV method is realized with fluid particles,
boundary particles and dynamically allocated virtual particles near solid boundaries. The physical
domain in SDPD-DV contains external and internal solid boundaries, periodic inlets and outlets,
and the fluid region. The solid boundaries of the domain are represented with boundary particles
which have an assigned position, wall velocity, and temperature upon initialization. The fluid
domain is discretized with fluid particles placed in a global index. The algorithm for nearest neighbor
particle search is based on a combination of the linked-cell and Verlet-list approaches and utilizes
large rectangular cells for computational efficiency. The density model of a fluid particle in
the proximity of a solid boundary includes the contribution from the virtual particles in its truncated
support domain. The thermodynamic properties of a virtual particle are identical to those of the
corresponding fluid particle. Additional verification involves SDPD-DV simulations of transient,
planar, Couette liquid water flow. The top plate is moving at and separated by 10-3 m from the bottom
stationary plate. The numerical results are in very good agreement with the analytical solutions.
Additional SDPD-DV verification is accomplished with the simulation of a body-force driven, low-Reynolds
number flow of water over a cylinder of radius . The SDPD-DV field velocity and pressure are compared
with those obtained by FLUENT.
