Following the idea of three wave resonant interactions of lower hybrid waves it is shown that quantum
-modified lower hybrid (QLH) wave in electron positron ion plasma with spatial dispersion can decay
into another QLH wave ( where electron and positrons are activated whereas ions remain in the background)
and another ultra low frequency QULH (where ions are mobile). Quantum effects like Bohm potential,
exchange correlation and Fermi pressure on the lower hybrid wave significantly reshaped the dispersion
properties of lower hybrid waves. Later a set of nonlinear Zakharov equations have been derived
to consider the formation of QLH wave solitons with the nonlinear contribution coming from the QLH
waves. Further, modulational instability of the lower hybrid wave solitons is investigated and
consequently it's growth rates are examined for different limiting cases. Since the growth rate
associated with the three-wave resonant interaction are generally smaller than the growth associated
with the modulational instability, therefore only latter have been investigated. Soliton solutions
from the set of coupled Zakharov and NLS equations in the quasi-stationary regime have been studied.
Ordinary solitons are attribute of nonlinearity whereas a cusp soliton solution featured by nonlocal
nonlinearity have also studied. Such an approach to lower hybrid waves and cusp solitons study in
Fermi gas comprising electron positron and ions is new and important. The general results obtained
in this quantum plasma theory will have widespread applicability, particularly for processes
in high energy plasma-laser interactions set for laboratory astrophysics and solid state plasmas.
