Analytic energy gradients are presented for a variational two-electron reduced-density-matrix-driven
complete active space self-consistent field (v2RDM-CASSCF) procedure that employs the density-fitting
(DF) approximation to the two-electron repulsion integrals. The DF approximation significantly
reduces the computational cost of v2RDM-CASSCF gradient evaluation, in terms of both the number
of floating-point operations and memory requirements, enabling geometry optimizations on much
larger chemical systems than could previously be considered at the this level of theory [E. Maradzike
et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2017, 13, 4113-4122]. The efficacy of v2RDM-CASSCF for computing
equilibrium geometries and harmonic vibrational frequencies is assessed using a set of 25 small
closed- and open-shell molecules. Equilibrium bond lengths from v2RDM-CASSCF differ from those
obtained from configuration-interaction-driven CASSCF (CI-CASSCF) by 0.62 pm and 0.05 pm, depending
on whether the optimal reduced-density matrices from v2RDM-CASSCF satisfy two-particle N-representability
conditions (PQG) or PQG plus partial three-particle conditions (PQG+T2), respectively. Harmonic
vibrational frequencies, which are obtained by finite differences of v2RDM-CASSCF analytic energy
gradients, similarly demonstrate that quantitative agreement between v2RDM- and CI-CASSCF requires
the consideration of partial three-particle N-representability conditions. Lastly, optimized
geometries are obtained for the lowest-energy singlet and triplet states of the linear polyacene
series up to dodecacene (C50H28), in which case the active space is comprised of 50 electrons in 50
orbitals. The v2RDM-CASSCF singlet-triplet energy gap extrapolated to an infinitely-long linear
acene molecule is found to be 7.8 kcal/mol
