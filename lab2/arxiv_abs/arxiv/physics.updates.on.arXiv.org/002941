A lot of plasma physics problems are not amenable to exact solutions due to many reasons. It is worth
mentioning among them, for example, nonlinearity of the motion equations, variable coefficients
or non lineal conditions on known or unknown borders. To solve these problems, different types of
approximations which are combinations of analytical and numerical simulation methods are put
into practice. The problem of plasma behavior in numerous varieties of a minimum-B magnetic trap
where the plasma is heated under electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) conditions is the subject of
numerical simulation studies. At present, the ECR minimum-B trap forms the principal part of the
multicharge ion sources. In this work, a scheme of the relativistic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code
elaborated for an ECR plasma heating study in minimum-B traps is presented. For a PIC numerical simulation,
the code is applied to an ECR plasma confined in a minimum-B trap formed by two current coils generating
a mirror magnetic configuration and a hexapole permanent magnetic bars to suppress the MHD instabilities.
The plasma is maintained in a cylindrical chamber excited at $TE_{111}$ mode by $2.45$ $GHz$ microwave
power. In the obtained magnetostatic field, the ECR conditions are fulfilled on a closed surface
of ellipsoidal type. Initially, a Maxwellian homogeneous plasma from ionic temperature of $2$
$eV$ being during $81.62$ $ns$, that correspond to $200$ cycles of microwaves with an amplitude
in the electric field of $1$ $kV/cm$ is heated. The electron population can be divided conditionally
into a cold group of energies smaller than $0.2$ $keV$, a warm group whose energies are in a range of
$3-10$ $keV$ and hot electrons whose energies are found higher than $10$ $keV$.
