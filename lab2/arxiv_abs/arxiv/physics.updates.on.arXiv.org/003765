We examine the impact of the ion dynamics on laser-driven electron acceleration in an initially
empty channel irradiated by an ultra-high intensity laser pulse with $I > 10^{22}$ W/cm$^2$. The
negative charge of the accelerated electrons inside the channel generates a quasi-static transverse
electric field that causes gradual ion expansion into the channel. Once the ions fill the channel,
the pinching force from the quasi-static magnetic field generated by the accelerated electrons
becomes uncompensated due to the reduction of the quasi-static transverse electric field. As a
result there are two distinct populations of accelerated electrons: those that accelerate ahead
of the expanding ion front while moving predominantly forward and those that accelerate in the presence
of the ions in the channel while performing strong transverse oscillations. The ions diminish the
role of the longitudinal laser electric field, making the transverse electric field the dominant
contributor to the electron energy. The ion expansion also has a profound impact on the gamma-ray
emission, causing it to become volumetrically distributed while reducing the total emitted energy.
We formulate a criterion for the laser pulse duration that must be satisfied in order to minimize
the undesired effect from the ions and to allow the electrons to remain highly collimated. \textcolor{black}{We
demonstrate the predictive capability of this criterion by applying it to assess the impact of a
given pre-pulse on ion expansion. Our results provide a} guideline for future experiments at multi-PW
laser facilities with ultra-high intensities.
