Self assembly is a ubiquitous process in synthetic and biological systems, broadly defined as the
spontaneous self-organization of multiple subunits (e.g. macromolecules, particles) into ordered
multi-unit structures. The vast majority of equilibrium assembly processes give rise to two ``states'':
one consisting of dispersed disassociated subunits, and the other, a bulk-condensed state of unlimited
size. This review focuses on the more specialized class of {\it self-limiting assembly}, which
describes equilibrium assembly processes resulting in finite-size structures. These systems
pose a generic and basic question, how do thermodynamic processes involving non-covalent interactions
between identical subunits ``measure'' and select the size of assembled structures? In this review,
we begin with an introduction to the basic statistical mechanical framework for assembly thermodynamics,
and use this to highlight the key physical ingredients that ensure equilibrium assembly will terminate
at finite dimensions. Then, examples of self-limiting assembly systems will be introduced and
classified within this framework based on two broad categories: {\it self-closing assemblies}
and {\it open-boundary assemblies}. These will include well-known cases -- micellization of amphiphiles
and shell/tubule formation of tapered subunits -- as well as less widely known classes of assemblies,
such as short-range attractive/long-range repulsive systems and geometrically-frustrated
assemblies. For each of these self-limiting mechanisms, we describe the physical mechanisms that
select equilibrium assembly size, as well as potential limitations of finite-size selection.
Finally, we discuss alternative mechanisms for finite-size assemblies and draw contrasts with
the size-control that these can achieve relative to self-limitation in equilibrium, single-species
assemblies.
