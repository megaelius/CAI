We are concerned with a two-dimensional ($2$-D) Riemann problem for compressible flows modeled
by the pressure gradient system that is a $2$-D hyperbolic system of conservation laws. The Riemann
initial data consist of four constant states in four sectorial regions such that two shock waves
and two vortex sheets are generated between the adjacent states. This Riemann problem can be reduced
to a boundary value problem in the self-similar coordinates with the Riemann initial data as its
asymptotic boundary data, along with two sonic circles determined by the Riemann initial data,
for a nonlinear system of mixed-composite type. The solutions keep the four constant states and
four planar waves outside the outer sonic circle. The two shocks keep planar until they meet the outer
sonic circle at two different points and then generate a diffracted shock to be expected to connect
these two points, whose exact location is {\it apriori} unknown which is regarded as a free boundary.
Then the $2$-D Riemann problem can be reformulated as a free boundary problem, in which the diffracted
transonic shock is the one-phase free boundary to connect the two points, while the other part of
the outer sonic circle forms the part of the fixed boundary of the problem. We establish the global
existence of a solution of the free boundary problem, as well as the $C^{0,1}$--regularity of both
the diffracted shock across the two points and the solution across the outer sonic boundary which
is optimal. One of the key observations here is that the diffracted transonic shock can not intersect
with the inner sonic circle in the self-similar coordinates. As a result, this $2$-D Riemann problem
is solved globally, whose solution contains two vortex sheets and one global $2$-D shock connecting
the two original shocks generated by the Riemann data.
