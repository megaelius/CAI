Objective:We propose a novel iterative-optimizationinspired direct targeting strategy (DTS)
for smart nanosystems, which harness swarms of externally manipulable nanoswimmers assembled
by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for knowledgeaided tumor sensitization and targeting. We aim
to demonstrate through computational experiments that the proposed DTS can significantly enhance
the accumulation of MNPs in the tumor site, which serve as a contrast agent in various medical imaging
modalities, by using the shortest possible physiological routes and with minimal systemic exposure.
Methods: The epicenter of a tumor corresponds to the global maximum of an externally measurable
objective function associated with an in vivo tumor-triggered biophysical gradient; the domain
of the objective function is the tissue region at a high risk of malignancy; swarms of externally
controllable magnetic nanoswimmers for tumor sensitization are modeled as the guess inputs. The
objective function may be resulted from a passive phenomenon such as reduced blood flow or increased
kurtosis of microvasculature due to tumor angiogenesis; otherwise, the objective function may
involve an active phenomenon such as the fibrin formed during the coagulation cascade activated
by tumortargeted "activator" nanoparticles. Subsequently, the DTS can be interpreted from the
iterative optimization perspective: guess inputs (i.e., swarms of nanoswimmers) are continuously
updated according to the gradient of the objective function in order to find the optimum (i.e., tumor)
by moving through the domain (i.e., tissue under screening). Along this line of thought, we propose
the computational model based on the gradient descent (GD) iterative method to describe the GD-inspired
DTS, which takes into account the realistic in vivo propagation scenario of nanoswimmers.
