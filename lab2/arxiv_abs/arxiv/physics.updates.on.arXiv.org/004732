We present a self-calibrating, SI-traceable broadband Rydberg-atom-based radio-frequency
(RF) electric field probe (the Rydberg Field Probe or RFP) and measurement instrument (Rydberg
Field Measurement System or RFMS). The RFMS comprises an atomic RF field probe (RFP), connected
by a ruggedized fiber-optic patch cord to a portable mainframe control unit with a software interface
for RF measurement and analysis including real-time field readout and RF waveform visualization.
The instrument employs electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) readout of spectral signatures
from RF-sensitive Rydberg states of an atomic vapor for continuous, pulsed, and modulated RF field
measurement. The RFP exploits resonant and off-resonant Rydberg-field interactions to realize
broadband RF measurements at frequencies ranging from ~10 MHz to sub-THz over a wide dynamic range.
The RFMS incorporates an RF-field-free atomic reference and a laser-frequency tracker to ensure
reliability and accuracy of the RF measurement. We characterize the RFP and measure polar field
and polarization patterns of the RFP at 12.6 GHz RF in the far-field of a standard gain horn antenna.
Measurements at 2.5 GHz are also performed. Measured patterns are in good agreement with simulations.
A detailed calibration procedure and uncertainty analysis are presented that account for deviations
from an isotropic response over a $4\pi$ solid angle, arising from dielectric structures external
to the atomic measurement volume. Contributions to the measurement uncertainty from the fundamental
atomic measurement method and associated analysis as well as material, geometry, and hardware
design choices are accounted for. A calibration (C) factor is used to establish absolute-standard
SI-traceable calibration of the RFP. Pulsed and modulated RF field measurement, and time-domain
RF-pulse waveform imaging are also demonstrated.
