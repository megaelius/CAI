We consider the nonlinear optimal control of bypass transition in a boundary layer flow subjected
to a pair of free stream vortical perturbations using a receding horizon approach. The optimal control
problem is solved using the Lagrange variational technique that results in a set of adjoint equations,
used to obtain the optimal wall actuation (blowing and suction from a control slot located in the
transition region). The receding horizon approach enables the application of control action over
a longer time period, and allows the extraction of time-averaged statistics as well as investigation
of the control effect downstream of the control slot. The results show that the controlled flow energy
is initially reduced in the streamwise direction and then increased because transition still occurs.
The distribution of the optimal control velocity responds to the flow activity above and upstream
of the control slot. The control effect propagates downstream of the slot and the flow energy is reduced
up to the exit of the computational domain. The mean drag reduction is 55% and 10% in the control region
and downstream of the slot, respectively. The control mechanism is investigated by examining the
second order statistics and the two-point correlations. It is found that in the upstream (left)
side of the slot, the controller counteracts the near wall high speed streaks and reduces the turbulent
shear stress; this is akin to opposition control in channel flow, and since the time-average control
velocity is positive, it is more similar to blowing-only opposition control. In the downstream
(right) side of the slot, the controller reacts to the impingement of turbulent spots that have been
produced upstream and inside the boundary layer (top-bottom mechanism). The control velocity
is positive and increases in the streamwise direction, and the flow behavior is similar to that of
uniform blowing.
