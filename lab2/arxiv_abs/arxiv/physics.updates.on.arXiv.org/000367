The article contains an overview of authors achievements in development of alternative quantum-chemical
approaches oriented towards revival of the classical tradition of qualitative chemical thinking
instead of obtaining numerical results. The above-mentioned tradition is concluded to be based
mainly on principles (rules) of additivity, transferability and locality of molecular properties.
Accordingly, model Hamiltonian matrices are used in the approaches under development (called
quasi-classical alternatives), wherein algebraic parameters play the role of matrix elements
and these are assumed to be transferable for similar atoms and/or atomic orbitals in addition. Further,
passing to delocalized descriptions of electronic structures (as usual) is expected to be the main
origin of difficulties seeking to formulate quasi-classical alternatives. In the framework of
the canonical method of molecular orbitals (MOs), delocalization is shown to be partially avoidable
by invoking a recently-suggested approach to secular (eigenvalue) equations for model Hamiltonian
matrices, wherein the usual initial imposing of the zero-determinant condition is replaced by
a certain reformulation of the problem itself. The most efficient way of achieving the same end,
however, is shown to consist in passing to non-canonical one-electron problems. The latter may
be exemplified by the block-diagonalization problem for the relevant Hamiltonian matrix following
from the Brillouin theorem and yielding non-canonical (localized) MOs and by the commutation equation
for the respective one-electron density matrix (charge- bond order matrix). In this connection,
most of attention is paid in the article to perturbative solutions of the above-mentioned non-canonical
problems and to their implications, including common quantum-chemical descriptions of entire
classes of chemical compounds.
