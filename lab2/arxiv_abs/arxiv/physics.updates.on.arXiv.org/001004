This memo contains a collection of formulas describing the electromagnetic energy, momentum and
spin distribution of an optical field formed in dielectric media separated by a plane interface
when an incident monochromatic plane wave is totally reflected. The formulas are based on the Abraham
momentum definition and include the momentum decomposition into the orbital (canonical) and spin
parts as well as explicit dual-symmetric separation of the electric and magnetic contributions.
This material was prepared in February 2013 but it had not been finalized and published because of
the difficulties in physical interpretation of singular terms in the spin and orbital momentum
expressions associated with the sharp interface. Meanwhile, it has become clear that the "naive"
Abraham approach is not correct for this problem and the electromagnetic spin and momentum in inhomogeneous
media are better characterized by the more elaborated relations based on the Minkowski paradigm
[see, e.g., Phys. Rev. A 83, 013823 (2011); 86, 055802 (2012); arXiv:1706.05493]. In application
to the total-reflection situation this Minkowski-based description was recently illustrated
in arXiv:1706.06263, so the present material is mainly of historical interest. However, it seems
useful to make it known for a wide audience, at least for comparison with the recent improved approaches
and for suitable references. The last section, treating the ponderomotive action experienced
by a Mie particle in the evanescent wave, is independent of the Abraham - Minkowski controversy.
The numerical calculations preserve their validity, and association of the various force and torque
components with corresponding components of the optical momentum and spin remains legal in the
Minkowski pattern. The results of the last section were partly used in other published works [e.g.,
Nature Commun. 5, 3300 (2014)].
