In the statistical mechanics of quantum harmonic oscillators, the zero-point energy can either
be included (Schr\"odinger oscillators) or omitted (Planck oscillators). For the usual results,
the type of oscillator makes no difference but, looking more closely, it turns out that including
or not this energy is not without consequences. The chemical potential {\mu}s of a Schr\"odinger
oscillator set is calculated in the canonical formalism and this shows there is a temperature T0
for which {\mu}s=0; below this temperature, {\mu}s>0. When Planck oscillators are used instead,
the chemical potential {\mu}p is negative for all temperatures. If the problem is approached in
phonon terms and the system is considered to be in contact with a reservoir of particles (conditions
of the grand canonical ensemble), a sort of critical temperature Tc is found, for which the number
of particles in the system diverges. For Schr\"odinger oscillators with {\mu}s=0, it turns out
that Tc=T0, i.e. T0 is a reminder, in the canonical ensemble, of the divergent behavior in the number
of particles when under the conditions of the grand canonical ensemble. Also, a modified Einstein
solid (MES) model is introduced. In this model the frequency of the oscillators changes with the
volume of the solid, and this change is characterized by a certain value of the Gr\"uneisen parameter.
The bulk modulus of this solid can be calculated using Planck oscillators, and it becomes negative
for certain temperature and volume values, which is physically incorrect. When Schr\"odinger
oscillators are used, the bulk modulus is always positive. Therefore, the different behavior of
both types of oscillators would indicate that only Schr\"odinger oscillators lead to correct results.
