Turbulent motions are essential to the mixing of entrained fluids and are also capable of amplifying
weak initial magnetic fields by small-scale dynamo action. Here we perform a systematic study of
turbulent mixing in magnetized media, using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations
that include a scalar concentration field. We focus on how mixing depends on the magnetic Prandtl
number, Pm, from 1 to 4 and the Mach number, M}, from 0.3 to 2.4. For all subsonic flows, we find that
the velocity power spectrum has a k^-5/3 slope in the early, kinematic phase, but steepens due to
magnetic back reactions as the field saturates. The scalar power spectrum, on the other hand, flattens
compared to k^-5/3 at late times, consistent with the Obukohov-Corrsin picture of mixing as a cascade
process. At higher Mach numbers, the velocity power spectrum also steepens due to the presence of
shocks, and the scalar power spectrum again flattens accordingly. Scalar structures are more intermittent
than velocity structures in subsonic turbulence while for supersonic turbulence, velocity structures
appear more intermittent than the scalars only in the kinematic phase. Independent of the Mach number
of the flow, scalar structures are arranged in sheets in both the kinematic and saturated phases
of the magnetic field evolution. For subsonic turbulence, scalar dissipation is hindered in the
strong magnetic field regions, probably due to Lorentz forces suppressing the buildup of scalar
gradients, while for supersonic turbulence, scalar dissipation increases monotonically with
increasing magnetic field strength. At all Mach numbers, mixing is significantly slowed by the
presence of dynamically-important small-scale magnetic fields, implying that mixing in the interstellar
medium and in galaxy clusters is less efficient than modeled in hydrodynamic simulations.
