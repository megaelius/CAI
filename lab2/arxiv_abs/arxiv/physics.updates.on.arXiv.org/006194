Several planetary bodies in our solar system undergo a forced libration owing to gravitational
interactions with their orbital companions, leading to complex fluid motions in their metallic
liquid cores or subsurface oceans. In this study, we numerically investigate flows in longitudinally
librating spherical shells. We focus on the Ekman number dependencies of several shear layers when
the libration frequency is less than twice of the rotation frequency and the libration amplitude
is small. Time-dependent flows mainly consist of inertial waves excited at the critical latitudes
due to the Ekman pumping singularities, forming conical shear layers. In particular, previous
theoretical studies have proposed different scalings for the conical shear layers spawned from
the critical latitudes at the inner boundary. Our numerical results favor the velocity amplitude
scaling $\mathrm{O}(\varepsilon E^{1/12})$ predicted by Le Diz\`es \& Le Bars (2017) over the
scaling $\mathrm{O}(\varepsilon E^{1/6})$ initially proposed by Kerswell (1995), though the
Ekman numbers in our calculations are not sufficiently small to pin down this scaling. Non-linear
interactions in the boundary layers drive a mean zonal flow with several geostrophic shears. Our
numerical results show that geostrophic shears associated with the critical latitudes at the inner
and outer boundaries exhibit the same scalings, i.e. an amplitude of $\mathrm{O}(\varepsilon^2
E^{-1/10})$ over a width of $\mathrm{O}(E^{1/5})$. Apart from the geostrophic shear associated
with the critical latitude, our numerical results show that the reflection of inertial waves can
induce a geostrophic shear with an amplitude of $\mathrm{O}(\varepsilon^2 E^{-1/6})$ over a width
of $\mathrm{O}(E^{1/3})$.
