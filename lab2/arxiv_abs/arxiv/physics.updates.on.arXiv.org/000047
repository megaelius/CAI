We analyze the occurrence and the values of record-breaking temperatures in daily and monthly temperature
observations. Our aim is to better understand and quantify the statistics of temperature records
in the context of global warming. Similar to earlier work we employ a simple mathematical model of
independent and identically distributed random variables with a linearly growing expectation
value. This model proved to be useful in predicting the increase (decrease) in upper (lower) temperature
records in a warming climate. Using both station and re-analysis data from Europe and the United
States we further investigate the statistics of temperature records and the validity of this model.
The most important new contribution in this article is an analysis of the statistics of record values
for our simple model and European reanalysis data. We estimate how much the mean values and the distributions
of record temperatures are affected by the large scale warming trend. In this context we consider
both the values of records that occur at a certain time and the values of records that have a certain
record number in the series of record events. We compare the observational data both to simple analytical
computations and numerical simulations. We find that it is more difficult to describe the values
of record breaking temperatures within the framework of our linear drift model. Observations from
the summer months fit well into the model with Gaussian random variables under the observed linear
warming, in the sense that record breaking temperatures are more extreme in the summer. In winter
however a significant asymmetry of the daily temperature distribution hides the effect of the slow
warming trends. Therefore very extreme cold records are still possible in winter. This effect is
even more pronounced if one considers only data from subpolar regions.
