Halos and elves are Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) produced in the lower ionosphere as a consequence
of lightning-driven electromagnetic fields. These events can influence the upper-atmospheric
chemistry and produce optical emissions. We have developed different two-dimensional self-consistent
models that couple electrodynamical equations with a chemical scheme to simulate halos and elves
produced by vertical cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning discharges, Compact Intra-cloud Discharges
(CIDs) and Energetic In-cloud Pulses (EIPs). The optical emissions from radiative relaxation
of excited states of molecular and atomic nitrogen and oxygen have been calculated. We have upgraded
previous local models of halos and elves to calculate for the first time the vibrationally detailed
optical spectra of elves triggered by CIDs and EIPs. According to our results, the optical spectra
of elves do not depend on the type of parent lightning discharge. Finally, we have quantified the
local chemical impact in the upper atmosphere of single halos and elves. In the case of the halo, we
follow the cascade of chemical reactions triggered by the lightning-produced electric field during
a long-time simulation of up to one second. We obtain a production rate of NO molecules by single halos
and elves of 10$^{16}$ and 10$^{14}$ molecules/J, respectively. The results of these local models
have been used to estimate the global production of NO by halos and elves in the upper atmopshere at
$\sim10^{-7}$ Tg~N/y. This global chemical impact of halos and elves is seven orders of magnitude
below the production of NO in the troposphere by lightning discharges.
