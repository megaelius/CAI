This paper develops a propagation model of electromagnetic signals emitted at frequencies of 20
and 40 MHz for the Ecuadorian jungle. It is expected that the results obtained at the end of this research
will be applied to produce a complete coverage map for wireless communications technologies, which
will optimize the radio spectrum in operations carried out by the Armed Forces in the Ecuadorian
border jungle. The final expression found is an adjustment function that relates the Receiving
Power (PRX) to factors that determine the geometry of the Fresnell Zone (Connectivity). The resulting
model of the research improves the discrepancy between the simulated power (PRX) in commercial
software and a sample of measured wireless transmissions in situ. The analysis was based on the results
and methodology presented by Longley-Rice. It was determined the non-normality of the discrepancy
between the losses (LLR) calculated by Longley-Rice Model (LMR) and the data obtained in the field,
It was added correction coefficients on the expression of LMR. Subsequently, the mathematical
expression was linearized to implement multivariate linear adjustment techniques. Alternative
formulations to the Linear Regression model were sought and their goodness of fit was compared;
all these techniques are introduced theoretically. To conclude, an analysis of the error of the
found model is made. Mathematical modeling software such as MATLAB and SPSS were used for the formulation
and numerical analysis, whose algorithms are also introduced. Finally, we propose future lines
of research that allow a global understanding of the behavior of telecommunications technologies
under hostile environments.
