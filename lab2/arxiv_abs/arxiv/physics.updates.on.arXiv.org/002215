Despite simplicity, the synchronous cellular automaton [D.A. Young, Math. Biosci. 72, 51 (1984)]
enables reconstructing basic features of patterns of skin. Our extended model allows studying
the formatting of patterns and their temporal evolution also on the favourable and hostile environments.
As a result, the impact of different types of an environment is accounted for the dynamics of patterns
formation. The process is based on two diffusible morphogens, the short-range activator and the
long-range inhibitor, produced by differentiated cells (DCs) represented as black pixels. For
a neutral environment, the extended model reduces to the original one. However, even the reduced
model is statistically sensitive to a type of the initial distribution of DCs. To compare the impact
of the uniform random distribution of DCs (R-system) and the non-uniform distribution in the form
of random Gaussian-clusters (G-system), we chose inhibitor as the control parameter. To our surprise,
in the neutral environment, for the chosen inhibitor-value that ensures stable final patterns,
the average size of final G-populations is lower than in the R-case. In turn, when we consider the
favourable environment, the relatively bigger shift toward higher final concentrations of DCs
appears in the G. Thus, in the suitably favourable environment, this order can be reversed. Furthermore,
the different critical values of the control parameter for the R and the G suggest some dissimilarities
in temporal evolution of both systems. In particular, within the proper ranges of the critical values,
their oscillatory behaviours are different. The respective temporal evolutions are illustrated
by a few examples.
