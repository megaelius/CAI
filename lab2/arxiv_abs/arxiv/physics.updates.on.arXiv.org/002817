Here we present an extensive and accurate description of the RF-sputtering processing parameters,
showing a holistic control of the quality of ITO thin films in the visible and particularly near-infrared
spectral region. We alter key material-film property factors such as the oxygen concentration
and thermally annealing the samples. Using this approach, we thence develop an interdependently-complete
set of metrology processes for determining the conductivity, carrier density, and mobility of
these ITO films and bring them in congruence with values obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry.
These results are then cross-validated using a variety of measuring techniques to include Hall
measurement, 4-Probe, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. In this regard, we ultimately are able
to derive the relationship between the Oxygen flow-rate and complex refractive index, mobility
and carrier density, as well as identifying the effects of thermal annealing to the optical and electrical
response of ITO thin films. We further provide a crossectional film thickness-dependent carrier
distribution as a function of thermal carrier activation. Interestingly, we find an ability to
tune the resistivity gradient by restoring the film crystalline structure upon thermal treatment.
Lastly, we show ENZ film properties across the telecommunication band by tuning the sputtering
process conditions. Such self-consistent process and precise control of ITOs properties electrical,
spectral, and optical parameters serves a wide application space such as in optoelectronics, metamaterials,
metatronics, quantum technologies, energy-harvesting, and sensing.
