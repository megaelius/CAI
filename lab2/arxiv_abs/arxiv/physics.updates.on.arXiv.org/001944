The efficient method for computing the sensitivities is the adjoint method. The cost of solving
an adjoint equation is comparable to the cost of solving the governing equation. Once the adjoint
solution is obtained, the sensitivities to any number of parameters can be obtained with little
effort. There are two methods to develop the adjoint equations: continuous method and discrete
method. In the continuous method, the control theory is applied to the forward governing equation
and produces an analytical partial differential equation for solving the adjoint variable; in
the discrete method, the control theory is applied to the discrete form of the forward governing
equation and produces a linear system of equations for solving the adjoint variable. In this article,
an adjoint sensitivity analysis framework is developed using both the continuous and discrete
methods. These two methods are assessed with the faucet flow for steady-state problem and one transient
test case based on the BFBT benchmark for transient problem. Adjoint sensitivities from both methods
are verified by sensitivities given by the perturbation method. Adjoint sensitivities from both
methods are physically reasonable and match each. The sensitivities obtained with discrete method
is found to be more accurate than the sensitivities from the continuous method. The continuous method
is computationally more efficient than the discrete method because of the analytical coefficient
matrices and vectors. However, difficulties are observed in solving the continuous adjoint equation
for cases where the adjoint equation contains sharp discontinuities in the source terms; in such
cases, the continuous method is not as robust as the discrete adjoint method.
