The objective of this work is to investigate linear modal and algebraic instability in Poiseuille
flows with fluids close to their vapour-liquid critical point. Close to this critical point, the
ideal gas assumption does not hold and large non-ideal fluid behaviours occur. As a representative
non-ideal fluid, we consider supercritical carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) at pressure of 80 bar, which
is above its critical pressure of 73.9 bar. The Poiseuille flow is characterized by the Reynolds
number ($Re=\rho_{w}^{*}u_{r}^{*}h^{*}/\mu_{w}^{*}$), the product of Prandtl ($Pr=\mu_{w}^{*}C_{pw}^{*}/\kappa_{w}^{*}$)
and Eckert number ($Ec=u_{r}^{*2}/C_{pw}^{*}T_{w}^{*}$), and the wall temperature that in addition
to pressure determines the thermodynamic reference condition. For low Eckert numbers, the flow
is essentially isothermal and no difference with the well-known stability behaviour of incompressible
flows is observed. However, if the Eckert number increases, the viscous heating causes gradients
of thermodynamic and transport properties, and non-ideal gas effects become significant. Three
regimes of the laminar base flow can be considered, subcritical (temperature in the channel is entirely
below its pseudo-critical value), transcritical, and supercritical temperature regime. If compared
to the linear stability of an ideal gas Poiseuille flow, we show that the base flow is more unstable
in the subcritical regime, inviscid unstable in the transcritical regime, while significantly
more stable in the supercritical regime. Following the corresponding states principle, we expect
that qualitatively similar results will be obtained for other fluids at equivalent thermodynamic
states.
