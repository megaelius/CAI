An exact relation is derived between scalar dissipation due to molecular diffusivity and the randomness
of stochastic Lagrangian trajectories for flows without bounding walls. This "Lagrangian fluctuation-dissipation
relation" equates the scalar dissipation for either passive or active scalars to the variance of
scalar inputs associated to initial scalar values and internal scalar sources, as those are sampled
backward in time by the stochastic Lagrangian trajectories. As an important application, we reconsider
the phenomenon of "Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity" or persistent non-determinism of Lagrangian
particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity. Previous work on the
Kraichnan (1968) model of turbulent scalar advection has shown that anomalous scalar dissipation
is associated in that model to Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity. There has been controversy,
however, regarding the validity of this mechanism for scalars advected by an actual turbulent flow.
We here completely resolve this controversy by exploiting the fluctuation-dissipation relation.
For either a passive or active scalar advected by any divergence-free velocity field, including
solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and away from walls, we prove that anomalous
scalar dissipation requires Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity. For passive scalars we prove
furthermore that spontaneous stochasticity yields anomalous dissipation for suitable initial
scalar distributions, so that the two phenomena are there completely equivalent. These points
are illustrated by numerical results from a database of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, which
provide both additional support to the results and physical insight into the representation of
diffusive effects by stochastic Lagrangian particle trajectories.
