Twisted light carries a well-defined orbital angular momentum (OAM) per photon. The quantum number
l of its OAM can be arbitrarily set, making it an excellent light source to realize high-dimensional
quantum entanglement and ultra-wide bandwidth optical communication structures. To develop
solid-state optoelectronic systems compatible with such promising light sources, a timely challenging
task is to efficiently and coherently transfer the optical OAM of light to certain solid-state optoelectronic
materials. Among the state-of-the-art emergent materials, atomically thin monolayer transition
metal dichalcogenide (ML-TMD), featured by ultra-strong light-matter interaction due to its
reduced dimensionality, renders itself a potential material suitable for novel applications.
In this study, we carried out photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy studies of ML-MoS2 under photoexcitation
of twisted light with well-defined quantized OAM. We mainly observed pronounced increases in the
spectral peak energy for every increment of l of the incident twisted light. The observed non-linear
l-dependence of the spectral blue shifts evidences the OAM transfer from the exciting twisted light
to the valley excitons in ML-TMDs, which is well accounted for by our analysis and computational
simulation. Even more excitingly, the twisted light excitation is shown to make excitonic transitions
relative to the transferred OAM, enabling us to infer the exciton band dispersion from the measured
spectral shifts. Consequently, the measured non-linear l-dependent spectral shifts revealed
an unusual lightlike exciton band dispersion of valley excitons in ML-TMDs that is predicted by
previous theoretical studies and evidenced for the first time via our experimental setup that utilizes
the unique twisted light source.
