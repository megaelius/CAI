Tomographic imaging techniques using the Coulomb scattering of cosmic-ray muons are increasingly
being exploited for the non-destructive assay of shielded containers in a wide range of applications.
One such application is the characterisation of legacy nuclear waste materials stored within industrial
containers. The design, assembly and performance of a prototype muon tomography system developed
for this purpose are detailed in this work. This muon tracker comprises four detection modules,
each containing orthogonal layers of Saint-Gobain BCF-10 2mm-pitch plastic scintillating fibres.
Identification of the two struck fibres per module allows the reconstruction of the incoming and
Coulomb-scattered muon trajectories. These allow the container content, with respect to the atomic
number Z of the scattering material, to be determined through reconstruction of the scattering
location and magnitude. On each detection layer, the light emitted by the fibre is detected by a single
Hamamatsu H8500 MAPMT with two fibres coupled to each pixel via dedicated pairing schemes developed
to ensure the identification of the struck fibre. The PMT signals are read out to QDCs. The design
and assembly of the detector system are detailed and presented alongside results from performance
studies with data collected after construction. These results reveal high stability during extended
collection periods with detection efficiencies in the region of 80% per layer. Minor misalignments
of millimetre order have been identified and corrected in software. A first image reconstructed
from a test configuration of materials has been obtained using software based on the Maximum Likelihood
Expectation Maximisation algorithm. The results highlight the high spatial resolution provided
by the detector system. Clear discrimination between the low, medium and high-Z materials assayed
is also observed.
