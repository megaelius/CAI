In a geocentric kinematically rotating ecliptical coordinate system in geodesic motion through
the deformed spacetime of the Sun, both the node $\Omega$ and the inclination $I$ of an artificial
satellite of the spinning Earth are affected by the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric De Sitter and
gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring effects. By choosing a circular orbit with $I = \Omega = 90\deg$
for a potential new spacecraft, which we propose to name ELXIS, it would be possible to measure each
of the gravitomagnetic precessions separately at a percent level, or, perhaps, even better depending
on the level of accuracy of the current and future global ocean tide models since the competing classical
long-term perturbations on $I,~\Omega$ due to the even and odd zonal harmonics $J_\ell,~\ell=2,~3,~4,\ldots$
of the geopotential vanish. Moreover, a suitable linear combination of $I,~\Omega$ would be able
to cancel out the solid and ocean tidal perturbations induced by the $K_1$ tide and, at the same time,
enforce the geodetic precessions yielding a secular trend of $-8.3~\textrm{milliarcseconds~per~year}$,
thus strengthening the goal of a $\simeq 10^{-5}$ test of the De Sitter effect recently proposed
in the literature in the case of an equatorial coordinate system. Relatively mild departures $\Delta
I = \Delta\Omega\simeq 0.01-0.1\deg$ from the ideal orbital configuration with $I = \Omega = 90\deg$
are allowed. Present-day, uncontroversial levels of relative accuracy in testing the geodetic
and the gravitomagnetic effects in the field of the Earth are $9\times 10^{-4}$ (Lunar Laser Ranging)
and $1.9\times 10^{-1}$ (Gravity Probe B), respectively.
