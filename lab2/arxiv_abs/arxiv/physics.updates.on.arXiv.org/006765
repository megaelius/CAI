We present spectral analysis modal methods (SAMMs) to perform POD in the frequency domain using
non-time-resolved Particle Image Velocity (PIV) data combined with unsteady surface pressure
measurements. In particular, time-resolved unsteady surface pressure measurements are synchronized
with non-time-resolved planar PIV measurements acquired at 15 Hz in a Mach 0.6 cavity flow. Leveraging
the spectral linear stochastic estimation (LSE) method of Tinney et al. (2006), we first estimate
the cross correlations between the velocity field and the unsteady pressure sensors via sequential
time shifts, followed by a Fast Fourier transform to obtain the pressure-velocity cross spectral
density matrix. This leads to a linear multiple-input / multiple-output (MIMO) model that determines
the optimal transfer functions between the input cavity wall pressure and the output velocity field.
Two variants of SAMMs are developed and applied. The first, termed "SAMM-SPOD", combines the MIMO
model with the SPOD algorithm of Towne et al. (2018). The second, called "SAMM-RR'', adds independent
sources and uses a sorted eigendecomposition of the input pressure cross-spectral matrix to enable
an efficient reduced-rank eigendecomposition of the velocity cross-spectral matrix. In both
cases, the resulting rank-1 POD eigenvalues associated with the Rossiter frequencies exhibit
very good agreement with those obtained using independent time-resolved PIV measurements. The
results demonstrate that SAMMs provide a methodology to perform space-time POD without requiring
a high-speed PIV system, while avoiding potential pitfalls associated with traditional time-domain
LSE.
