The turbulent amplification of cosmic magnetic fields depends upon the material properties of
the host plasma. In many hot, dilute astrophysical systems, such as the intracluster medium (ICM)
of galaxy clusters, the rarity of particle--particle collisions allows departures from local
thermodynamic equilibrium. These departures exert anisotropic viscous stresses on the plasma
motions that inhibit their ability to stretch magnetic-field lines. We present a numerical study
of the fluctuation dynamo in a weakly collisional plasma using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations
endowed with a field-parallel viscous (Braginskii) stress. When the stress is limited to values
consistent with a pressure anisotropy regulated by firehose and mirror instabilities, the Braginskii-MHD
dynamo largely resembles its MHD counterpart. If instead the parallel viscous stress is left unabated
-- a situation relevant to recent kinetic simulations of the fluctuation dynamo and to the early
stages of the dynamo in a magnetized ICM -- the dynamo changes its character, amplifying the magnetic
field while exhibiting many characteristics of the saturated state of the large-Prandtl-number
(${\rm Pm}\gtrsim{1}$) MHD dynamo. We construct an analytic model for the Braginskii-MHD dynamo
in this regime, which successfully matches magnetic-energy spectra. A prediction of this model,
confirmed by our simulations, is that a Braginskii-MHD plasma without pressure-anisotropy limiters
will not support a dynamo if the ratio of perpendicular and parallel viscosities is too small. This
ratio reflects the relative allowed rates of field-line stretching and mixing, the latter of which
promotes resistive dissipation of the magnetic field. In all cases that do exhibit a dynamo, the
generated magnetic field is organized into folds that persist into the saturated state and bias
the chaotic flow to acquire a scale-dependent spectral anisotropy.
