Weakly collisional space plasmas are rarely in local thermal equilibrium and often exhibit non-Maxwellian
electron and ion velocity distributions that lead to the growth of microinstabilities, that is,
enhanced electric and magnetic fields at relatively short wavelengths. These instabilities play
an active role in the evolution of space plasmas, as does ubiquitous broadband turbulence induced
by turbulent structures. This study compares certain properties of a 2.5 dimensional Particle-In-Cell
(PIC) simulation for the forward cascade of Alfvenic turbulence in a collisionless plasma against
the same properties of turbulence observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission spacecraft
in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The PIC simulation is of decaying turbulence which develops
both coherent structures and anisotropic ion velocity distributions with the potential to drive
kinetic scale instabilities. The uniform background magnetic field points perpendicular to the
plane of the simulation. Growth rates are computed from linear theory using the ion temperature
anisotropies and ion beta values for both the simulation and the observations. Both the simulation
and the observations show that strong anisotropies and growth rates occur highly intermittently
in the plasma, and the simulation further shows that such anisotropies preferentially occur near
current sheets. This suggests that, though microinstabilities may affect the plasma globally
, they act locally and develop in response to extreme temperature anisotropies generated by turbulent
structures. Further studies will be necessary to understand why there is an apparent correlation
between linear instability theory and strongly intermittent turbulence.
