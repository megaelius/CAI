How much knowledge is there in an economy? In recent years, data on the mix of products that countries
export has been used to construct measures of economic complexity that estimate the knowledge available
in an economy and predict future economic growth. Here we introduce a new metric of economic complexity
(ECI+) that measures the total exports of an economy corrected by how difficult it is to export each
product. We use data from 1973 to 2013 to compare the ability of ECI+, the Economic Complexity Index
(ECI), and Fitness complexity, to predict future economic growth using 5, 10, and 20-year panels
in a pooled OLS, a random effects model, and a fixed effects model. We find that ECI+ outperforms ECI
and Fitness in its ability to predict economic growth and in the consistency of its estimators across
most econometric specifications. We then combine ECI+ with measures of physical capital, human
capital, and institutions, to select a robust model of economic growth and test the robustness of
ECI+. We find that the ability of ECI+ to predict growth is robust to these controls, and also, that
human capital, political stability, and control of corruption, are positively associated with
future economic growth, and initial level of income, is negatively associated with growth, in agreement
with the traditional growth literature. Finally, we use ECI+ to generate economic growth predictions
for the next 20 years and compare these predictions with the ones obtained using ECI and Fitness.
These findings improve the methods available to estimate the knowledge intensity of economies
using exports data and confirm the economic relevance of export structures.
