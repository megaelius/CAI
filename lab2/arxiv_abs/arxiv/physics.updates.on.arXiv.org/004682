Not all symmetries are on a par. For instance, within Newtonian mechanics, we seem to have a good grasp
on the empirical significance of boosts, by applying it to subsystems. This is exemplified by the
thought experiment known as Galileo's ship: the inertial state of motion of a ship is immaterial
to how events unfold in the cabin, but is registered in the values of relational quantities such as
the distance and velocity of the ship relative to the shore. But the significance of gauge symmetries
seems less clear. For example, can gauge transformations in Yang-Mills theory---taken as mere
descriptive redundancy---exhibit a similar relational empirical significance as the boosts
of Galileo's ship? This question has been debated in the last fifteen years in philosophy of physics.
I will argue that the answer is `yes'. And that underlying this `yes' answer lies the true significance
of gauge symmetries: an inherent non-locality, or holism, of certain physical systems. Holism
has important implications for the relational empirical significance of gauge: in direct analogy
to the boosts of Galileo's ships, in gauge theory there are different states of joint systems whose
difference is solely due to different relations between the subsystem states composing the whole.
That is, given two subsystems' physical information, the universal state obtained by the composition
of the subsystems is not always uniquely determined (Gomes, Riello, 2019). While for Galileo's
ship the relational variety of the joint system is encoded in boosts and translations, in gauge theory
this variety has the structure of the finite-dimensional Lie group of the theory.
