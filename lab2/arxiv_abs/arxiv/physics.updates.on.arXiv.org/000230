Gyrokinetic simulations have greatly improved our theoretical understanding of turbulent transport
in fusion devices. Most gyrokinetic models in use are delta-f simulations in which the slowly varying
radial profiles of density and temperature are assumed to be constant for turbulence saturation
times, and only the turbulent electromagnetic fluctuations are calculated. New massive simulations
are being built to self-consistently determine the radial profiles of density and temperature.
However, these new codes have failed to realize that modern gyrokinetic formulations, composed
of a gyrokinetic Fokker-Planck equation and a gyrokinetic quasineutrality equation, are only
valid for delta-f simulations that do not reach the longer transport time scales necessary to evolve
radial profiles. In tokamaks, due to axisymmetry, the evolution of the axisymmetric radial electric
field is a challenging problem requiring substantial modifications to gyrokinetic treatments.
In this thesis, I study the effect of turbulence on the global electric field and plasma flows. By
studying the current conservation equation, or vorticity equation, I prove that the long wavelength,
axisymmetric flow must remain neoclassical and I show that the tokamak is intrinsically ambipolar,
i.e., the radial current is zero to a very high order for any long wavelength radial electric field.
Intrinsic ambipolarity is the origin of the problems with the modern gyrokinetic approach since
the lower order gyrokinetic quasineutrality (if properly evaluated) is effectively independent
of the radial electric field. I propose a new gyrokinetic formalism to solve for the global radial
electric field.
