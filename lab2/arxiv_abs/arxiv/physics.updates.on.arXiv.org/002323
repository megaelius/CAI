Networks are often made up of several layers that exhibit diverse degrees of interdependencies.
A multilayer interdependent network consists of a set of graphs $G$ that are interconnected through
a weighted interconnection matrix $ B $, where the weight of each inter-graph link is a non-negative
real number $ p $. Various dynamical processes, such as synchronization, cascading failures in
power grids, and diffusion processes, are described by the Laplacian matrix $ Q $ characterizing
the whole system. For the case in which the multilayer graph is a multiplex, where the number of nodes
in each layer is the same and the interconnection matrix $ B=pI $, being $ I $ the identity matrix, it
has been shown that there exists a structural transition at some critical coupling, $ p^* $. This
transition is such that dynamical processes are separated into two regimes: if $ p > p^* $, the network
acts as a whole; whereas when $ p<p^* $, the network operates as if the graphs encoding the layers were
isolated. In this paper, we extend and generalize the structural transition threshold $ p^* $ to
a regular interconnection matrix $ B $ (constant row and column sum). Specifically, we provide upper
and lower bounds for the transition threshold $ p^* $ in interdependent networks with a regular interconnection
matrix $ B $ and derive the exact transition threshold for special scenarios using the formalism
of quotient graphs. Additionally, we discuss the physical meaning of the transition threshold
$ p^* $ in terms of the minimum cut and show, through a counter-example, that the structural transition
does not always exist. Our results are one step forward on the characterization of more realistic
multilayer networks and might be relevant for systems that deviate from the topological constrains
imposed by multiplex networks.
