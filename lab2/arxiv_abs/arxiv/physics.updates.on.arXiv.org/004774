The particle-in-cell (PIC) method is widely used to model the self-consistent interaction between
discrete particles and electromagnetic fields. It has been successfully applied to problems across
plasma physics including plasma based acceleration, inertial confinement fusion, magnetically
confined fusion, space physics, astrophysics, high energy density plasmas. In many cases the physics
involves how relativistic particles are generated and interact with plasmas. However, when relativistic
particles stream across the grid both in vacuum and in plasma there are many numerical issues that
may arise which can lead to incorrect physics. We present a detailed analysis of how discretized
Maxwell solvers used in PIC codes can lead to numerical errors to the fields that surround particles
that move at relativistic speeds across the grid. Expressions for the axial electric field as integrals
in k space are presented. Two types of errors to these expressions are identified. The first arises
from errors to the numerator of the integrand and leads to unphysical fields that are antisymmetric
about the particle. The second arises from errors to the denominator of the integrand and lead to
Cerenkov like radiation in "vacuum". These fields are not anti-symmetric, extend behind the particle,
and cause the particle to accelerate or decelerate depending on the solver and parameters. The unphysical
fields are studied in detail for two representative solvers - the Yee solver and the FFT based solver.
A solution for eliminating these unphysical fields by modifying the k operator in the axial direction
is also presented. Using a customized finite difference solver, this solution was successfully
implemented into OSIRIS. Results from the customized solver are also presented. This solution
will be useful for a beam of particles that all move in one direction with a small angular divergence.
