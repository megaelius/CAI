We employ Gaussian process (GP) regression to adjust for systematic errors in D3-type dispersion
corrections introducing the associated, statistically improved model D3-GP. We generated a data
set containing interaction energies for 1,248 molecular dimers, which resemble the dispersion-dominated
systems contained in the S66 data set. Our systems do not only represent equilibrium structures,
but also dimers with various relative orientations and conformations at both shorter and longer
distances. To train our D3-GP model, we engineered two different vectorial representations of
(supra-)molecular systems, both derived from the matrix of atom-pairwise D3(BJ) interaction
terms: (a) a distance-resolved interaction energy histogram and (b) eigenvalues of the interaction
matrix ordered according to their decreasing absolute value. We harness the prediction variance
obtained from GP regression to select optimal training sets in an automated fashion. The larger
the variance, the more information the corresponding data point may add to the training set. For
a given set of molecular systems, variance-based sampling can approximately determine the smallest
subset being subjected to reference calculations such that all dispersion corrections for the
remaining systems fall below a predefined accuracy threshold. Our refined learning algorithm
selects multiple (instead of single) systems which can be subjected to reference calculations
simultaneously. We refer to the underlying selection strategy as batch-wise variance-based sampling
(BVS). BVS-guided active learning is an essential component of our D3-GP workflow, which is implemented
in a black-box fashion. This approach leads overall to a self-improving model (D3-GP) that predicts
system-focused and GP-refined D3-type dispersion corrections for any given system of reference
data.
