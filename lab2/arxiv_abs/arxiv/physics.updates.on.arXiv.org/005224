Accurate calculation of the ion-ion recombination rate coefficient has been of long-standing
interest, as it controls the ion concentration in gas phase and aerosol systems. We describe the
development of a hybrid continuum-molecular dynamics approach to determine the ion-ion recombination
rate coefficient. The approach is based on the limiting sphere method classically used for transition
regime collision phenomena in aerosols. When ions are sufficiently far from one another, ion-ion
relative motion is described by diffusion equations while within a critical distance, molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations are used to model ion-ion motion. MD simulations are parameterized using
the AMBER force-field as well as by considering partial charges on atoms. Ion-neutral gas collisions
are modeled in two mutually exclusive cubic domains composed of 103 gas atoms each, which remain
centered on the recombining ions throughout calculations. Example calculations are reported
for NH4+ recombination with NO2- in He, across a pressure range from 10 kPa to 10,000 kPa. Excellent
agreement is found in comparison of calculations to literature values for the 100 kPa recombination
rate coefficient (1e-12 cubic meters per second) in He. We also recover the experimentally observed
increase in recombination rate coefficient with pressure at sub-atmospheric pressures, and the
observed decrease in recombination rate coefficient in the high pressure continuum limit. We additionally
find that non-dimensionalized forms of rate coefficients are consistent with recently developed
equations for the dimensionless charged particle-ion collision rate coefficient based on Langevin
dynamics simulations.
