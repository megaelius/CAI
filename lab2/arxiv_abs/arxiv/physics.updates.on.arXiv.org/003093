Probabilistic inversion within a multiple-point statistics framework is often computationally
prohibitive for high-dimensional problems. To partly address this, we introduce and evaluate
a new training-image based inversion approach for complex geologic media. Our approach relies
on a deep neural network of the generative adversarial network (GAN) type. After training using
a training image (TI), our proposed spatial GAN (SGAN) can quickly generate 2D and 3D unconditional
realizations. A key characteristic of our SGAN is that it defines a (very) low-dimensional parameterization,
thereby allowing for efficient probabilistic inversion using state-of-the-art Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In addition, available direct conditioning data can be incorporated
within the inversion. Several 2D and 3D categorical TIs are first used to analyze the performance
of our SGAN for unconditional geostatistical simulation. Training our deep network can take several
hours. After training, realizations containing a few millions of pixels/voxels can be produced
in a matter of seconds. This makes it especially useful for simulating many thousands of realizations
(e.g., for MCMC inversion) as the relative cost of the training per realization diminishes with
the considered number of realizations. Synthetic inversion case studies involving 2D steady-state
flow and 3D transient hydraulic tomography with and without direct conditioning data are used to
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed SGAN-based inversion. For the 2D case, the inversion
rapidly explores the posterior model distribution. For the 3D case, the inversion recovers model
realizations that fit the data close to the target level and visually resemble the true model well.
