We address the double hydrogen transfer (DHT) dynamics of the porphycene molecule: A complex paradigmatic
system where the making and breaking of H-bonds in a highly anharmonic potential energy surface
requires a quantum mechanical treatment not only of the electrons, but also of the nuclei. We combine
density-functional theory calculations, employing hybrid functionals and van der Waals corrections,
with recently proposed and optimized path-integral ring-polymer methods for the approximation
of quantum vibrational spectra and reaction rates. Our full-dimensional ring-polymer instanton
simulations show that below 100 K the concerted DHT tunneling pathway dominates, but between 100
K and 300 K there is a competition between concerted and stepwise pathways when nuclear quantum effects
are included. We obtain ground-state reaction rates of $2.19 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$
at 150 K and $0.63 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 100 K, in good agreement with experiment. We
also reproduce the puzzling N-H stretching band of porphycene with very good accuracy from thermostatted
ring-polymer molecular dynamics simulations. The position and lineshape of this peak, centered
at around 2600 cm$^{-1}$ and spanning 750 cm$^{-1}$, stems from a combination of very strong H-bonds,
the coupling to low-frequency modes, and the access to $cis$-like isomeric conformations, which
cannot be appropriately captured with classical-nuclei dynamics. These results verify the appropriateness
of our general theoretical approach and provide a framework for a deeper physical understanding
of hydrogen transfer dynamics in complex systems.
