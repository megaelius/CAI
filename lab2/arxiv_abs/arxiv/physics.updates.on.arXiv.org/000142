SinaWeibo is a Twitter-like social network service emerging in China in recent years. People can
post weibos (microblogs) and communicate with others on it. Based on a dataset of 650 million weibos
from August 2009 to January 2012 crawled from APIs of SinaWeibo, we study the hot ones that have been
reposted for at least 1000 times. We find that hot weibos can be roughly classified into eight categories,
i.e. Entertainment & Fashion, Hot Social Events, Leisure & Mood, Life & Health, Seeking
for Help, Sales Promotion, Fengshui & Fortune and Deleted Weibos. In particular, Leisure &
Mood and Hot Social Events account for almost 65% of all the hot weibos. This reflects very well the
fundamental dual-structure of the current society of China: On the one hand, economy has made a great
progress and quite a part of people are now living a relatively prosperous and fairly easy life. On
the other hand, there still exist quite a lot of serious social problems, such as government corruptions
and environmental pollutions. It is also shown that users' posting and reposting behaviors are
greatly affected by their identity factors (gender, verification status, and regional location).
For instance, (1) Two thirds of the hot weibos are created by male users. (2) Although verified users
account for only 0.1% in SinaWeibo, 46.5% of the hot weibos are contributed by them. Very interestingly,
39.2% are written by SPA users. A more or less pathetic fact is that only 14.4% of the hot weibos are
created by grassroots (individual users that are neither SPA nor verified). (3) Users from different
areas of China have distinct posting and reposting behaviors which usually reflect very their local
cultures. Homophily is also examined for people's reposting behaviors.
