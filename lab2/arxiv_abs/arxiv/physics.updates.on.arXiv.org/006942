Online users are typically active on multiple social media networks (SMNs), which constitute a
multiplex social network. It is becoming increasingly challenging to determine whether given
accounts on different SMNs belong to the same user; this can be expressed as an interlayer link prediction
problem in a multiplex network. To address the challenge of predicting interlayer links , feature
or structure information is leveraged. Existing methods that use network embedding techniques
to address this problem focus on learning a mapping function to unify all nodes into a common latent
representation space for prediction; positional relationships between unmatched nodes and their
common matched neighbors (CMNs) are not utilized. Furthermore, the layers are often modeled as
unweighted graphs, ignoring the strengths of the relationships between nodes. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework based on multiple types of consistency between embedding vectors
(MulCEV). In MulCEV, the traditional embedding-based method is applied to obtain the degree of
consistency between the vectors representing the unmatched nodes, and a proposed distance consistency
index based on the positions of nodes in each latent space provides additional clues for prediction.
By associating these two types of consistency, the effective information in the latent spaces is
fully utilized. Additionally, MulCEV models the layers as weighted graphs to obtain better representation.
In this way, the higher the strength of the relationship between nodes, the more similar their embedding
vectors in the latent representation space will be. The results of our experiments on several real-world
datasets demonstrate that the proposed MulCEV framework markedly outperforms current embedding-based
methods, especially when the number of training iterations is small.
