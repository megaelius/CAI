Significant work on the structure of turbulent flow over non-flat surfaces continues to be reported
in the roughness regime at high Reynolds numbers where the cumulative effect of surface undulations
on the averaged and integrated turbulence quantities is well documented. For such cases, the surface
topology plays an important role for transitional roughness Reynolds numbers that is hard to characterize.
In this work, we attempt to develop a bottom up understanding of the mechanisms underlying turbulence
generation and transport, particularly within the region of the turbulent boundary layer affected
by the surface i.e. surface layer or roughness sublayer. This way, we relate surface characteristics
with turbulence generation mechanisms, Reynolds stress transport and the resulting drag increase.
We perform a suite of direct numerical simulations of fully developed turbulent flow between two
infinitely wide, 2D sinusoidally wavy surfaces at a friction Reynolds number, $Re_{\tau}=180$,
with different mean surface slopes (and fixed inner-scaled undulation height, $a^+\sim 13$),
$\zeta$ corresponding to the `waviness' regime. The increase in wave slope enhances near surface
turbulent mixing resulting in increased total drag, higher fraction of form drag, faster approach
to isotropy and thereby, modulation of the buffer layer. The primary near-surface streamwise and
vertical turbulence generation occurs in the leeward side of the wave and is qualitatively independent
of $\zeta$ when plotted relative to the wave phase. In contrast, the spanwise variance is produced
through pressure-rate-of-strain mechanism, primarily, in the windward side of the wave although
very little flow separation is observed in these conditions. Finally, we also observe significant
dispersion effects in the production structure that impact both the qualitative and quantitative
aspects of turbulence generation.
