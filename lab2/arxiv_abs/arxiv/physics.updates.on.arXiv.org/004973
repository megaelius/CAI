The Integrated Science Investigations of the Sun (IS$\odot$IS) instrument suite includes two
Energetic Particle instruments: EPI-Hi, designed to measure ions from ~1-200 MeV/nuc, and EPI-Lo,
designed to measure ions from ~20 keV/nuc to ~15 MeV/nuc. We present an analysis of eight energetic
proton events observed across the energy range of both instruments during PSP's first two orbits
in order to examine their combined energy spectra. Background corrections are applied to help resolve
spectral breaks between the two instruments and are shown to be effective. In doing so we demonstrate
that, even in the early stages of calibration, IS$\odot$IS is capable of producing reliable spectral
observations across broad energy ranges. In addition to making groundbreaking measurements very
near the Sun, IS$\odot$IS also characterizes energetic particle populations over a range of heliocentric
distances inside 1 au. During the first two orbits, IS$\odot$IS observed energetic particle events
from a single corotating interaction region (CIR) at three different distances from the Sun. The
events are separated by two Carrington rotations and just 0.11 au in distance, however the relationship
shown between proton intensities and proximity of the spacecraft to the source region shows evidence
of the importance of transport effects on observations of energetic particles from CIRs. Future
IS$\odot$IS observations of similar events over larger distances will help disentangle the effects
of CIR-related acceleration and transport. We apply similar spectral analyses to the remaining
five events, including four that are likely related to stream interaction regions (SIRs) and one
solar energetic particle (SEP) event.
