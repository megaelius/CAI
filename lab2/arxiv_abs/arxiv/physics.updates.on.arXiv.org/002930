In this work, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations coupled to free energy calculations
to identify for the first time a limit of stability (spinodal) and a change in the nucleation mechanism
in aqueous NaCl solutions. This is a system of considerable atmospheric, geological and technical
significance. We find that the supersaturated metastable NaCl solution reaches its limit of stability
at sufficiently high salt concentrations, as indicated by the composition dependence of the salt
chemical potential, indicating the transition to a phase separation by spinodal decomposition.
However, the metastability limit of the NaCl solution does not correspond to spinodal decomposition
with respect to crystallization. We find that beyond this spinodal, a liquid/amorphous separation
occurs in the aqueous solution, whereby the ions first form disordered clusters. We term these clusters
as "amorphous salt". We also identify a transition from one- to two-step crystallization mechanism
driven by a spinodal. In particular, crystallization from aqueous NaCl solution beyond the spinodal
is a two-step process, in which the ions first phase-separate into disordered amorphous salt clusters,
followed by the crystallization of ions in the amorphous salt phase. In contrast, in the aqueous
NaCl solution at concentrations lower than the spinodal, crystallization occurs via a one-step
process, as the ions aggregate directly into crystalline nuclei. The change of mechanism with increasing
supersaturation underscores the importance of an accurate determination of the driving force
for phase separation. The study has broader implications on the mechanism for nucleation of crystals
from solutions at high supersaturations.
