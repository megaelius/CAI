The interaction of a thin viscous film with an elastic sheet results in coupling of pressure and deformation,
which can be utilized as an actuation mechanism for surface deformations in a wide range of applications,
including microfluidics, optics, and soft robotics. Implementation of such configurations inherently
takes place over finite domains and often requires some pre-stretching of the sheet. Under the assumptions
of strong pre-stretching and small deformations of the lubricated elastic sheet, we use the linearized
Reynolds and Foppl-von Karman equations to derive closed-form analytical solutions describing
the deformation in a finite domain due to external forces, accounting for both bending and tension
effects. We provide a closed-form solution for the case of a square-shaped actuation region and
present the effect of pre-stretching on the dynamics of the deformation. We further present the
dependence of the deformation magnitude and timescale on the spatial wavenumber, as well as the
transition between stretching- and bending-dominant regimes. We also demonstrate the effect
of spatial discretization of the forcing (representing practical actuation elements) on the achievable
resolution of the deformation. Extending the problem to an axisymmetric domain, we investigate
the effects arising from nonlinearity of the Reynolds and Foppl-von Karman equations and present
the deformation behavior as it becomes comparable to the initial film thickness and dependent on
the induced tension. These results set the theoretical foundation for implementation of microfluidic
soft actuators based on elastohydrodynanmics.
