With recent advances in dynamic scanning probe microscopy techniques, it is now a routine to image
the sub-molecular structure of molecules with atomically-engineered tips which are prepared
via controlled modification of the tip termination and are chemically well-defined. The enhanced
spatial resolution is possible as atomically-engineered tips can preserve their integrity in
the repulsive interaction regime. Although the mechanism of improved spatial resolution has been
investigated both experimentally and theoretically, the ultimate temporal resolution while
preserving picometer scale spatial resolution still remains an open question. Here, we computationally
analyze the temporal resolution of atomic force microscopy imaging with atomically-engineered
tips. Our computational results reveal that non-metal terminated tips, e.g. oxygen-terminated
copper, are well-suited for enhanced temporal resolution up to video rate imaging velocities while
preserving picometer range spatial resolution. Contrarily, the highest-attainable spatial
resolution of atomically-engineered tips with low-stiffness, e.g. CO-terminated, deteriorate
with increasing imaging velocity. Our results reveal that when atomically-engineered tips terminated
with molecules are in use, imaging velocities in the order of nanometers per second at most are inevitable
even for atomically flat surfaces to retain atomic resolution and avoid slip-stick motion. In addition
to shedding light on the temporal resolution of atomic force microscopy imaging with atomically-engineered
tips, our numerical results provide an outlook to the scalability of atom-by-atom fabrication
using scanning probe microscopy techniques.
