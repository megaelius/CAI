CCFE perform Monte-Carlo transport simulations on large and complex tokamak models such as ITER.
Such simulations are challenging since streaming and deep penetration effects are equally important.
In order to make such simulations tractable, both variance reduction (VR) techniques and parallel
computing are used. It has been found that the application of VR techniques in such models significantly
reduces the efficiency of parallel computation due to 'long histories'. VR in MCNP can be accomplished
using energy-dependent weight windows. The weight window represents an 'average behaviour' of
particles, and large deviations in the arriving weight of a particle give rise to extreme amounts
of splitting being performed and a long history. When running on parallel clusters, a long history
can have a detrimental effect on the parallel efficiency - if one process is computing the long history,
the other CPUs complete their batch of histories and wait idle. Furthermore some long histories
have been found to be effectively intractable. To combat this effect, CCFE has developed an adaptation
of MCNP which dynamically adjusts the WW where a large weight deviation is encountered. The method
effectively 'de-optimises' the WW, reducing the VR performance but this is offset by a significant
increase in parallel efficiency. Testing with a simple geometry has shown the method does not bias
the result. This 'long history method' has enabled CCFE to significantly improve the performance
of MCNP calculations for ITER on parallel clusters, and will be beneficial for any geometry combining
streaming and deep penetration effects.
