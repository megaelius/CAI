This article is based on the Planckon densely piled vacuum model and the principle of cosmology.
With the Planck era as initial conditions and including the early inflation, we have solved the Einstein-Friedmann
equations to describe the evolution of the universe. The results are: 1) the ratio of the dark energy
density to the vacuum quantum fluctuation energy density is $\frac{{{\rho }_{de}}}{{{\rho }_{vac}}}\sim{{(\frac{{{t}_{P}}}{{{T}_{0}}})}^{2}}\sim{{10}^{-122}}
$; 2) at the inflation time ${{t}_{\inf }}={{10}^{-35}}s$, the calculated universe radiation
energy density is $\rho ({{t}_{\inf }})\sim{{10}^{-16}}{{\rho }_{vac}}$ and the corresponding
temperature is ${{E}_{c}}\sim{{10}^{15}}GeV$ consistent with the GUT phase transition temperature;
3) the expanding universe with vacuum as its environment is a non-equilibrium open system constantly
exchanging energy with vacuum; during its expansion, the Planckons in the universe lose quantum
fluctuation energy and create the cosmic expansion quanta-cosmons, the energy of cosmons is the
lost part of the vacuum quantum fluctuation energy and contributes to the universe energy with the
calculated value ${{E}_{\cos mos}}={{10}^{22}}{{M}_{\otimes }}{{c}^{2}}$ (where ${{M}_{\otimes
}}$ is solar mass); 4) the total energy of the universe, namely the negative gravity energy plus the
positive universe energy is zero; 5) the negative gravity potential and the gravity acceleration
related to the creation of cosmons are derived with the nature of outward repulsive force, indicating
that the cosmon may be the candidate of the dark energy quantum; 6) both the initial Planck era solution
and the infinite asymptotic solution of the Einstein-Friedman equations are unstable: the former
tends to expand and the latter tends to shrink, so that the Einstein-Friedman universe will undergo
a cyclic evolution of successive expansion and shrinking.
