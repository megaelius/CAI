In this paper we combine concepts from Riemannian Optimization and the theory of Sobolev gradients
to derive a new conjugate gradient method for direct minimization of the Gross-Pitaevskii energy
functional with rotation. The conservation of the number of particles constrains the minimizers
to lie on a manifold corresponding to the unit $L^2$ norm. The idea developed here is to transform
the original constrained optimization problem to an unconstrained problem on this (spherical)
Riemannian manifold, so that fast minimization algorithms can be applied as alternatives to more
standard constrained formulations. First, we obtain Sobolev gradients using an equivalent definition
of an $H^1$ inner product which takes into account rotation. Then, the Riemannian gradient (RG)
steepest descent method is derived based on projected gradients and retraction of an intermediate
solution back to the constraint manifold. Finally, we use the concept of the Riemannian vector transport
to propose a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method for this problem. It is derived at the continuous
level based on the "optimize-then-discretize" paradigm instead of the usual "discretize-then-optimize"
approach, as this ensures robustness of the method when adaptive mesh refinement is performed in
computations. We evaluate various design choices inherent in the formulation of the method and
conclude with recommendations concerning selection of the best options. Numerical tests demonstrate
that the proposed RCG method outperforms the simple gradient descent (RG) method in terms of rate
of convergence. While on simple problems a Newton-type method implemented in the {\tt Ipopt} library
exhibits a faster convergence than the (RCG) approach, the two methods perform similarly on more
complex problems requiring the use of mesh adaptation. At the same time the (RCG) approach has far
fewer tunable parameters.
