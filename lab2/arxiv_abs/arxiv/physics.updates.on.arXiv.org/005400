Satellite-based communications, navigation systems and many scientific instruments rely on
observations of trans-ionospheric signals. The quality of these signals can be deteriorated by
ionospheric scintillation which can have detrimental effects on the mentioned applications.
Therefore, monitoring of ionospheric scintillation and quantifying its effect on the ground are
of significant interest. In this work, we develop a methodology which estimates the scintillation
induced ionospheric uncertainties in the sky and translates their impact to the end-users on the
ground. First, by using the risk concept from decision theory and by exploiting the intensity and
duration of scintillation events (as measured by the S4 index), we estimate ionospheric risk maps
that could readily give an initial impression on the effects of scintillation on the satellite-receiver
communication. However, to better understand the influence of scintillation on the positioning
accuracy on the ground, we formulate a new weighted dilution of precision (WPDOP) measure that incorporates
the ionospheric scintillation risks as weighting factors for the given satellite-receiver constellations.
These weights depend implicitly on scintillation intensity and duration thresholds which can
be specified by the end-user based on the sensitivity of the application, for example. We demonstrate
our methodology by using scintillation data from South America, and produce ionospheric risk maps
which illustrate broad scintillation activity, especially at the equatorial anomaly. Moreover,
we construct ground maps of WPDOP over a grid of hypothetical receivers which reveal that ionospheric
scintillation can also affect such regions of the continent that are not exactly under the observed
ionospheric scintillation structures. Particularly, this is evident in cases when only the Global
Positioning System (GPS) is available.
