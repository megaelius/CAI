We present an efficient deep learning technique for the model reduction of the Navier-Stokes equations
for unsteady flow problems. The proposed technique relies on the Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) and the stochastic gradient decent method.Of particular interest is to predict the unsteady
fluid forces for different bluff body shapes at low Reynolds number. The discrete convolution process
with a non-linear rectification is employed to approximate the mapping between the bluff-body
shape and the fluid forces. The deep neural network is fed by the Euclidean distance function as the
input and the target data generated by the full-order Navier-Stokes computations for primitive
bluff body shapes. The convolutional networks are iteratively trained using the stochastic gradient
descent method with the momentum term to predict the fluid force coefficients of different geometries
and the results are compared with the full-order computations. We also attempt to provide a physical
analogy of the stochastic gradient method with the momentum term with the simplified form of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes momentum equation. A systematic convergence and sensitivity study
is performed to identify the effective dimensions of the deep-learned CNN process such as the convolution
kernel size, the number of kernels and the convolution layers. Within the error threshold, the prediction
based on our deep convolutional network has a speed-up nearly three orders of magnitude compared
to the full-order results and consumes an insignificant fraction of computational resources.
The proposed CNN-based approximation procedure has a profound impact on the parametric design
of bluff bodies and the feedback control of separated flows.
