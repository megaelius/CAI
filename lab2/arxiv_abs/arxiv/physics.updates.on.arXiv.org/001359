We review the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature and over a broad density range relevant
for warm dense matter (WDM) applications. We provide an overview of different simulation techniques,
focusing on recent developments in the dielectric formalism and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Our
primary focus is on two novel QMC methods: Permutation blocking path integral MC (PB-PIMC) and configuration
PIMC (CPIMC). In fact, a combination of PB-PIMC and CPIMC has allowed for a highly accurate description
of the warm dense UEG over a broad density-temperature range. We are able to effectively avoid the
notorious fermion sign problem, without invoking uncontrolled approximations such as the fixed
node approximation. Furthermore, a new finite-size correction scheme is presented that makes
it possible to treat the UEG in the thermodynamic limit without loss of accuracy. In addition, we
in detail discuss the construction of a parametrization of the exchange-correlation free energy
that provides a complete description of the UEG and is of crucial importance as input for the simulation
of real WDM applications. Further, we test previous theories, including restricted PIMC, finite-temperature
Green functions, the classical mapping by Perrot and Dharma-wardana, and various dielectric methods
such as the random phase approximation, or the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj\"olander, Vashishta-Singwi
and the recent Tanaka scheme for the local field correction. Thus, for the first time, thorough benchmarks
of important approximation schemes regarding various quantities such as different energies,
in particular the exchange-correlation free energy, and the static structure factor, are possible.
Finally, we outline a way how to rigorously extend our QMC studies to the inhomogeneous electron
gas and present first ab initio data for the static density response and for the static local field
correction.
