We introduce the concept of a photonic Dirac monopole, appropriate for photonic crystals, metamaterials
and 2D materials, by utilizing the Dirac-Maxwell correspondence. We show that even in vacuum, the
reciprocal momentum space of both Maxwell's equations and the massless Dirac equation (Weyl equation)
possess a magnetic monopole. The critical distinction is the nature of magnetic monopole charges,
which are integer valued for photons but half-integer for electrons. This inherent difference
is directly tied to the spin and ultimately connects to the bosonic or fermionic behavior. We also
show the presence of photonic Dirac strings, which are line singularities in the underlying Berry
gauge potential. While the results in vacuum are intuitively expected, our central result is the
application of this topological Dirac-Maxwell correspondence to 2D photonic (bosonic) materials,
as opposed to conventional electronic (fermionic) materials. Intriguingly, inside matter, the
presence of photonic Dirac monopoles is captured by the nonlocal quantum Hall conductivity. For
both 2D photonic and electronic media, the nontrivial topological phases emerge in the context
of massive particles with broken time-reversal symmetry. However, the bulk dynamics of these bosonic
and fermionic Chern insulators are characterized by spin-1 and spin-1/2 skyrmions in momentum
space, which have fundamentally different interpretations. This is exemplified by their opposing
spin-1 and spin-1/2 helically quantized edge states. Our work sheds light on the recently proposed
quantum gyroelectric phase of matter and the essential role of photon spin quantization in topological
bosonic phases.
