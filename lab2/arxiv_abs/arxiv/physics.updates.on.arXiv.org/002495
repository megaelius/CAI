Phase balanced states are a highly under-explored class of solutions of the Kuramoto model and other
coupled oscillator models on networks. So far, coupled oscillator research focused on phase synchronized
solutions. Yet, global constraints on oscillators may forbid synchronized state, rendering phase
balanced states as the relevant stable state. If for example oscillators are driving the contractions
of a fluid filled volume, conservation of fluid volume constraints oscillators to balanced states
as characterized by a vanishing Kuramoto order parameter. It has previously been shown that stable,
balanced patterns in the Kuramoto model exist on circulant graphs. However, which non-circulant
graphs first of all allow for balanced states and what characterizes the balanced states is unknown.
Here, we derive rules of how to build non-circulant, planar graphs allowing for balanced states
from the simple cycle graph by adding loops or edges to it. We thereby identify different classes
of small planar networks allowing for balanced states. Investigating the balanced states' characteristics,
we find that the variance in basin stability scales linearly with the size of the graph for these networks.
We introduce the balancing ratio as a new order parameter based on the basin stability approach to
classify balanced states on networks and evaluate it analytically for a subset of the network classes.
Our results offer an analytical description of non-circulant graphs supporting stable, balanced
states and may thereby help to understand the topological requirements on oscillator networks
under global constraints.
