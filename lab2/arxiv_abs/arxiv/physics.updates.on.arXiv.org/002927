Homogeneous droplet nucleation has been studied for almost a century but has not yet been fully understood.
In this work, we used the density gradient theory (DGT) and considered the influence of capillary
waves (CW) on the predicted size-dependent surface tensions and nucleation rates for selected
$n$-alkanes. The DGT model was completed by an equation of state (EoS) based on the perturbed-chain
statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) and compared to the classical nucleation theory
and the Peng--Robinson EoS. It was found that the critical clusters are practically free of CW because
they are so small that even the smallest CW wavelengths do not fit into their finite dimensions. The
CW contribute to the entropy of the system and thus decrease the surface tension. A correction for
the effect of CW on the surface tension is presented. The effect of the different EoSs is relatively
small because by a fortuitous coincidence their predictions are similar in the relevant range of
critical cluster sizes. The difference of the DGT predictions to the classical nucleation theory
computations is important but not decisive. Of the effects investigated, the most pronounced is
the suppression of the CW which causes a sizable decrease of the predicted nucleation rates. The
major difference between experimental nucleation rate data and theoretical predictions remains
in the temperature dependence. For normal alkanes, this discrepancy is much stronger than observed,
e.g., for water. The theoretical corrections developed here have a minor influence on the temperature
dependency. We provide empirical equations correcting the predicted nucleation rates to values
comparable with experiments.
