While the relation between visualization and scientific understanding has been a topic of long-standing
discussion, recent developments in physics have pushed the boundaries of this debate to new and
still unexplored realms. For it is claimed that, in certain theories of quantum gravity, spacetime
'disappears': and this suggests that one may have sensible physical theories in which spacetime
is completely absent. This makes the philosophical question whether such theories are intelligible,
even more pressing. And if such theories are intelligible, the question then is how they manage to
do so. In this paper, we adapt the contextual theory of scientific understanding, developed by one
of us, to fit the novel challenges posed by physical theories without spacetime. We construe understanding
as a matter of skill rather than just knowledge. The appeal is thus to understanding, rather than
explanation, because we will be concerned with the tools that scientists have at their disposal
for understanding these theories. Our central thesis is that such physical theories can provide
scientific understanding, and that such understanding does not require spacetimes of any sort.
Our argument consists of four consecutive steps: (a) We argue, from the general theory of scientific
understanding, that although visualization is an oft-used tool for understanding, it is not a necessary
condition for it; (b) we criticise certain metaphysical preconceptions which can stand in the way
of recognising how intelligibility without spacetime can be had; (c) we catalogue tools for rendering
theories without a spacetime intelligible; and (d) we give examples of cases in which understanding
is attained without a spacetime, and explain what kind of understanding these examples provide.
