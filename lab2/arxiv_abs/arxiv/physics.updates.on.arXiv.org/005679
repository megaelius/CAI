Scientific knowledge has been accepted as the main driver of development, allowing for longer,
healthier, and more comfortable lives. Still, public support to scientific research is wavering,
with large numbers of people being uninterested or even hostile towards science. This is having
serious social consequences, from the anti-vaccination community to the recent "post-truth"
movement. Such lack of trust and appreciation for science was first justified as lack of knowledge,
leading to the "Deficit Model" \cite{Durant:1989, Bauer:2007}. As an increase in scientific information
did not necessarily lead to a greater appreciation, this model was largely rejected, giving rise
to "Public Engagement Models" \cite{Miller:2001}. These try to offer more nuanced, two-way, communication
pipelines between experts and the general public, strongly respecting non-expert knowledge,
possibly even leading to an undervaluing of science. Therefore, we still lack an encompassing theory
that can explain public understanding of science, allowing for more targeted and informed approaches.
Here, we use a large dataset from the Science and Technology Eurobarometer surveys, over 25 years
in 34 countries \cite{Bauer:2012}, and find evidence that a combination of confidence and knowledge
is a good predictor of attitudes towards science. This is contrary to current views, that place knowledge
as secondary, and in line with findings in behavioral psychology, particularly the Dunning-Kruger
effect, as negative attitudes peak at intermediate levels of knowledge, where confidence is largest.
We propose a new model, based on the superposition of the Deficit and Dunning-Kruger models and discuss
how this can inform science communication.
