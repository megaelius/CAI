Bacteria in aquatic environments often interact with particulate matter. A key example is bacterial
degradation of marine snow responsible for carbon export from the upper ocean in the biological
pump. The ecological interaction between bacteria and sinking particles is regulated by their
encounter rate, which is therefore important to predict accurately in models of bacteria-particle
interactions. Models available to date cover the diffusive encounter regime, valid for sinking
particles larger than the typical run length of a bacterium. The majority of sinking particles,
however, are small, and the encounter process is then ballistic rather than diffusive. In the ballistic
regime, the shear generated by the particle's motion can be important in reorienting bacteria and
thus determining the encounter rate, yet the effect of shear is not captured in current encounter
rate models. Here, we combine analytical and numerical calculations to quantify the encounter
rate between sinking particles and non-motile or motile microorganisms in the ballistic regime,
explicitly accounting for the hydrodynamic shear created by the particle and its coupling with
microorganism shape. We complement results with selected experiments on non-motile diatoms.
We find that the shape-shear coupling has a considerable effect on the encounter rate and encounter
location through the mechanisms of hydrodynamic focusing and screening, whereby elongated microorganisms
preferentially orient normally to the particle surface downstream of the particle (focusing)
and tangentially to the particle surface upstream of the particle (screening). We study these mechanisms
as a function of the key dimensionless parameters: the ratio of particle sinking speed to microorganism
swimming speed, the ratio of particle radius to microorganism length, and the microorganism's
aspect ratio.
