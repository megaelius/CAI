The deficiency of macro (N, P, S, Ca, Mg and K) and micro (Zn, Cu, B, Mo, Cl, Mn and Fe) minerals has a major
effect on plant development. The lack of some nutrient minerals especially of nitrogen, potassium,
calcium, phosphorus and iron is a huge problem for agriculture and early warning and prevention
of the problem will be very useful for agro-industry. Methods currently used to determine nutritional
deficiency in plants are soil analysis, plant tissue analysis, or combined methods. But these methods
are slow and expensive. In this study, a new method for determining nutrient deficiency in plants
based on the prompt fluorescence of chlorophyll a is proposed. In this paper bean plants are grown
on a complete nutrient solution (control) were compared with those grown in a medium, which lacked
one of these elements - N, P, K, Ca and Fe. In this article the mineral deficiency in nutrient solution
was evaluated by the stress response of the plants estimated by leaves photosynthetic activity.
The photosynthetic activity was estimated by analysis of the chlorophyll fluorescence using JIP-test
approach that reflects functional activity of Photosystems I and II and of electron transfer chain
between them, as well as the physiological state of the photosynthetic apparatus as whole. Next
the fluorescence transient recorded from plants grown in nutrient solution with deficiency of
N, P, K, Ca and Iron, as an input data in Artificial Neural Network was used. This ANN was train to recognise
deficiency of N, P, K, Ca and Iron in bean plants. The results obtained were of high recognition accuracy.
The ANN of fluorescence transient was presented as a possible approach to identify/predict the
nutrient deficiency using the fast chlorophyll fluorescence records.
