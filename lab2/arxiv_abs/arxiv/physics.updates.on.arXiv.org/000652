The demixing of a binary fluid mixture, under gravity, is a two stage process. Initially droplets,
or in general aggregates, grow diffusively by collecting supersaturation from the bulk phase.
Subsequently, when the droplets have grown to a size, where their Peclet number is of order unity,
buoyancy substantially enhances droplet growth. The dynamics approaches a finite-time singularity
where the droplets are removed from the system by precipitation. The two growth regimes are separated
by a bottleneck of minimal droplet growth. Here, we present a low-dimensional model addressing
the time span required to cross the bottleneck, and we hence determine the time, \Delta t, from initial
droplet growth to rainfall. Our prediction faithfully captures the dependence of \Delta t on the
ramp rate of the droplet volume fraction, \xi, the droplet number density, the interfacial tension,
the mass diffusion coefficient, the mass density contrast of the coexisting phases, and the viscosity
of the bulk phase. The agreement of observations and the prediction is demonstrated for methanol/hexane
and isobutoxyethanol/water mixtures where we determined \Delta t for a vast range of ramp rates,
\xi, and temperatures. The very good quantitative agreement demonstrates that it is sufficient
for binary mixtures to consider (i) droplet growth by diffusive accretion that relaxes supersaturation,
and (ii) growth by collisions of sedimenting droplets. An analytical solution of the resulting
model provides a quantitative description of the dependence of \Delta t on the ramp rate and the material
constants. Extensions of the model that will admit a quantitative prediction of \Delta t in other
settings are addressed.
