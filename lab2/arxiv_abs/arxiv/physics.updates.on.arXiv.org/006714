As a part of interstellar dust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are processed by the interaction
with vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons that are emitted by hot young stars. This interaction leads
to the emission of the well-known aromatic infrared bands but also of electrons, which can significantly
contribute to the heating of the interstellar gas.Our aim is to investigate the impact of molecular
size on the photoionization properties of cationic PAHs.Methods. Trapped PAH cations of sizes
between 30 and 48 carbon atoms were submitted to VUV photons in the range of 9 to 20 eV from the DESIRS
beamline at the synchrotron SOLEIL. All resulting photoproducts including dications and fragment
cations were mass-analyzed and recorded as a function of photon energy.Photoionization is found
to be predominant over dissociation at all energies, which differs from an earlier study on smaller
PAHs. The photoionization branching ratio reaches 0.98 at 20 eV for the largest studied PAH. The
photoionization threshold is observed to be between 9.1 and 10.2 eV, in agreement with the evolution
of the ionization potential with size. Ionization cross sections were indirectly obtained and
photoionization yields extracted from their ratio with theoretical photoabsorption cross sections,
which were calculated using time-dependent density functional theory. An analytical function
was derived to calculate this yield for a given molecular size.Large PAH cations could be efficiently
ionized in H i regions and provide a contribution to the heating of the gas by photoelectric effect.
Also, at the border of or in H ii regions, PAHs could be exposed to photons of energy higher than 13.6
eV. Our work provides recipes to be used in astronomical models to quantify these points.
