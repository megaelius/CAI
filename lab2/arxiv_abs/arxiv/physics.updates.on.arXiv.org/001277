ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is one of four major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) at CERN. The High Level Trigger (HLT) is a compute cluster, which reconstructs collisions
as recorded by the ALICE detector in real-time. It employs a custom online data-transport framework
to distribute data and workload among the compute nodes. ALICE employs subdetectors sensitive
to environmental conditions such as pressure and temperature, e.g. the Time Projection Chamber
(TPC). A precise reconstruction of particle trajectories requires the calibration of these detectors.
Performing the calibration in real time in the HLT improves the online reconstructions and renders
certain offline calibration steps obsolete speeding up offline physics analysis. For LHC Run 3,
starting in 2020 when data reduction will rely on reconstructed data, online calibration becomes
a necessity. Reconstructed particle trajectories build the basis for the calibration making a
fast online-tracking mandatory. The main detectors used for this purpose are the TPC and ITS (Inner
Tracking System). Reconstructing the trajectories in the TPC is the most compute-intense step.
We present several improvements to the ALICE High Level Trigger developed to facilitate online
calibration. The main new development for online calibration is a wrapper that can run ALICE offline
analysis and calibration tasks inside the HLT. On top of that, we have added asynchronous processing
capabilities to support long-running calibration tasks in the HLT framework, which runs event-synchronously
otherwise. In order to improve the resiliency, an isolated process performs the asynchronous operations
such that even a fatal error does not disturb data taking. We have complemented the original loop-free
HLT chain with ZeroMQ data-transfer components. [...]
