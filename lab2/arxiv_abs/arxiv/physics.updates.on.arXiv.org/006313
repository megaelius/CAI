In the de Broglie-Bohm formulation of quantum theory, the quantum force exactly cancels the Coulomb
attractive force in atomic \emph{s}-states. In this paper it is contended, based on energy conservation,
that the force on a charge in a time-advanced electromagnetic field is of opposite sign to the Lorentz
force due to the retarded field, and that such an advanced classical electromagnetic force accounts
for part of Bohm's quantum force. If Coulomb attraction is negated, then some other mechanism must
bind electrons to the nuclei of atoms. It is proposed magnetic interactions between relativistically-moving
charges may account for atomic binding without assumption of a Coulomb potential. If charged spin-half
particles always move luminally, as the Dirac theory implies, and so moving give rise to the intrinsic
magnetic moment, then magnetic spin-spin interactions stronger than currently recognized are
to be expected. Part of the magnetic interaction between equal-mass Dirac particles has been previously
shown to be radial and inverse-square, of equal strength to Coulomb interaction, and sinusoidally
modulated by interparticle separation with a spatial period equal the de Broglie wavelength. The
Coulomb-like spin-spin interaction is further elaborated to show explicit correspondence with
the de Broglie matter wave and Schr\"odinger wavefunction. It is proposed spin-spin interactions
as expected according to this line of reasoning can properly account for the formation of atoms,
if the electromagnetic interaction in atoms is classical and time symmetric, and if quarks and leptons
are composed of more-fundamental spin-half particles.
