Low-loss photonic integrated circuits (PIC) and microresonators have enabled novel applications
ranging from narrow-linewidth lasers, microwave photonics, to chip-scale optical frequency
combs and quantum frequency conversion. To translate these results into a widespread technology,
attaining ultralow optical losses with established foundry manufacturing is critical. Recent
advances in fabrication of integrated Si3N4 photonics have shown that ultralow-loss, dispersion-engineered
microresonators can be attained at die-level throughput. For emerging nonlinear applications
such as integrated travelling-wave parametric amplifiers and mode-locked lasers, PICs of length
scales of up to a meter are required, placing stringent demands on yield and performance that have
not been met with current fabrication techniques. Here we overcome these challenges and demonstrate
a fabrication technology which meets all these requirements on wafer-level yield, performance
and length scale. Photonic microresonators with a mean Q factor exceeding 30 million, corresponding
to a linear propagation loss of 1.0 dB/m, are obtained over full 4-inch wafers, as determined from
a statistical analysis of tens of thousands of optical resonances and cavity ringdown with 19 ns
photon storage time. The process operates over large areas with high yield, enabling 1-meter-long
spiral waveguides with 2.4 dB/m loss in dies of only 5x5 mm size. Using a modulation response measurement
self-calibrated via the Kerr nonlinearity, we reveal that, strikingly, the intrinsic absorption-limited
Q factor of our Si3N4 microresonators exceeds a billion. Transferring the present Si3N4 photonics
technology to standard commercial foundries, and merging it with silicon photonics using heterogeneous
integration technology, will significantly expand the scope of today's integrated photonics
and seed new applications.
