We present a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian method to simulate cloud cavitation in a compressible
liquid. The method is designed to capture the strong, volumetric oscillations of each bubble and
the bubble-scattered acoustics. The dynamics of the bubbly mixture is formulated using volume-averaged
equations of motion. The continuous phase is discretized on an Eulerian grid and integrated using
a high-order, finite-volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme, while the gas
phase is modeled as spherical, Lagrangian point-bubbles at the sub-grid scale, each of whose radial
evolution is tracked by solving the Keller-Miksis equation. The volume of bubbles is mapped onto
the Eulerian grid as the void fraction by using a regularization (smearing) kernel. In the most general
case, where the bubble distribution is arbitrary, three-dimensional Cartesian grids are used
for spatial discretization. In order to reduce the computational cost for problems possessing
translational or rotational homogeneities, we spatially average the governing equations along
the direction of symmetry and discretize the continuous phase on two-dimensional or axi-symmetric
grids, respectively. We specify a regularization kernel that maps the three-dimensional distribution
of bubbles onto the field of an averaged two-dimensional or axi-symmetric void fraction. A closure
is developed to model the pressure fluctuations at the sub-grid scale as synthetic noise. For the
examples considered here, modeling the sub-grid pressure fluctuations as white noise agrees a
priori with computed distributions from three-dimensional simulations, and suffices, a posteriori,
to accurately reproduce the statistics of the bubble dynamics. The numerical method and its verification
are described by considering test cases of the dynamics of a single bubble and cloud cavitaiton induced
by ultrasound fields.
