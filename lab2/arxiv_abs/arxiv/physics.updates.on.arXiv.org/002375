In the standard cosmological framework of the 0th-order FLRW metric and the use of perfect fluids
in the stress-energy tensor, dark energy with an equation-of-state parameter $w < -1$ (known as
phantom dark energy) implies negative kinetic energy and vacuum instability when modeled as a scalar
field. However, the accepted values for present-day $w$ from Planck and WMAP9 include a significant
range of values less than $-1$. A flip of the sign in front of the kinetic energy term in the Lagrangian
remedies the negative kinetic energy but introduces ghostlike instabilities, which perhaps may
be rendered unobservable, but certainly not without great cost to the theory. Staying within the
confines of observational constraints and general relativity, we treat dark energy as a quantum
scalar field in the background of this 1st-order FLRW space-time, find an approximation for the
Green's function, and calculate the expectation value of the field's kinetic energy for $w<-1$
using adiabatic expansion to renormalize and obtain a finite value. We find that the kinetic energy
is positive for values of $w$ less than $-1$ in 0th- or 1st-order FLRW space, thus giving more theoretical
credence to observational values of $w<-1$ and demonstrating that phantom dark energy does not
categorically have negative kinetic energy. For a nonminimal coupling parameter $\xi=0$, kinetic
energy is positive for $w \gtrsim -1.22$, which includes virtually all values of constant $w$ allowed
by cosmological data constraints, and more negative values of $w$ give positive kinetic energy
for non-zero values of $\xi$. Also, our results are generally applicable for a massive free field
or a field with a small potential in a 0th- or 1st-order FLRW background dominated by a fluid with a
constant $w$. [abridged]
