The cross-spectral density (CSD) of the non-linear forcing in resolvent analyses is here quantified
for the first time for turbulent channel flows. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) at $Re_{\tau}
=179$ and $Re_{\tau} =543$ are performed. The CSDs are computed for highly energetic structures
typical of buffer-layer and large-scale motions, for different temporal frequencies. The CSD
of the non-linear forcing is shown not to be uncorrelated (white) in space, which implies the forcing
is structured. Since the non-linear forcing is non-solenoidal by construction and the velocity
of an incompressible flow is affected only by the solenoidal part of the forcing, this solenoidal
part is evaluated. It is shown that the solenoidal part of the non-linear forcing is the combination
of oblique streamwise vortices and a streamwise component which counteract each other, as in a destructive
interference. It is shown that a rank-2 approximation of the forcing, with only the most energetic
SPOD (spectral proper orthogonal decomposition) modes, leads to the bulk of the response. The projections
of the non-linear forcing onto the right-singular vectors of the resolvent are evaluated. The left-singular
vectors of the resolvent associated with very low-magnitude singular values are non-negligible
since the non-linear forcing term has a non-negligible projection onto the linear sub-optimals
of resolvent analysis. The same projections are computed when the forcing is modelled with an eddy-viscosity
approach. It is clarified that this modelling improves the accuracy of the prediction since the
projections are closer to those associated with the non-linear forcing from DNS data.
