Hydrogen bond patterns, proton ordering, and phase transitions of monolayer ice in two-dimensional
hydrophobic confinement are fundamentally different from those found for bulk ice. To investigate
the behavior of quasi-2D ice, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of water confined between
fixed graphene plates at a distance of 0.65 nm. While experimental results are still limited and
theoretical investigations are often based on a single force field model, this work presents a systematic
study using different water force fields, i.e. SPCE, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/ICE, TIP5P. The water
occupancy of the graphene capillary at a pressure of 1000 MPa is determined to be between 13.5 and
13.9 water molecules per square nanometer, depending on the choice of the water force field. To ensure
complete sampling of the configurational space and to overcome barriers separating metastable
structures, these simulations are based on the replica exchange molecular dynamics technique.
We report different tetragonal hydrogen bond patterns which are classified as nearly square or
as rhombic. While many of these arrangements are flat, in some cases puckered arrangements are found,
too. Also the proton ordering of the quasi-2D water structures is considered, allowing to identify
them as ferroelectric, ferrielectric or antiferroelectric. For temperatures between 200 K and
400 K we find several second-order phase transitions from one ice structure to another, changing
in many cases both the arrangements of the oxygen atoms and the proton ordering. For temperatures
between 400 K and 600 K there are melting-like transitions from a monolayer of ice to a monolayer of
liquid water. These first-order phase transitions have a latent heat between 3.4 and 4.0 kJ/mol.
