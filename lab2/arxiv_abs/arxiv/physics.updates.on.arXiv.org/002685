Many real-world systems are profitably described as complex networks that grow over time. Preferential
attachment and node fitness are two simple growth mechanisms that not only explain certain structural
properties commonly observed in real-world systems, but are also tied to a number of applications
in modeling and inference. While there are statistical packages for estimating various parametric
forms of the preferential attachment function, there is no such package implementing non-parametric
estimation procedures. The non-parametric approach to the estimation of the preferential attachment
function allows for comparatively finer-grained investigations of the `rich-get-richer' phenomenon
that could lead to novel insights in the search to explain certain nonstandard structural properties
observed in real-world networks. This paper introduces the R package PAFit, which implements non-parametric
procedures for estimating the preferential attachment function and node fitnesses in a growing
network, as well as a number of functions for generating complex networks from these two mechanisms.
The main computational part of the package is implemented in C++ with OpenMP to ensure scalability
to large-scale networks. We first introduce the main functionalities of PAFit through simulated
examples, and then use the package to analyze a collaboration network between scientists in the
field of complex networks. The results indicate the joint presence of `rich-get-richer' and `fit-get-richer'
phenomena in the collaboration network. The estimated attachment function is observed to be near-linear,
which we interpret as meaning that the chance an author gets a new collaborator is proportional to
their current number of collaborators. Furthermore, the estimated author fitnesses reveal a host
of familiar faces from the complex networks community among the field's topmost fittest network
scientists.
