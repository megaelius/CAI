We revisit the electromagnetic problem of wave incidence upon a uniform, dissipative dielectric
slab of finite thickness. While this problem is easily solved via interface field continuity, we
treat it under the viewpoint of radiative self-consistency, with interior current sources gauged
by ohmic/polarization comparisons against those of the exterior medium. Radiative self-consistency
yields an integral equation over the slab field giving a fully constructive buildup of the reflected/transmitted
contributions, without any need for implicit determination via boundary conditions. Solution
steps lead to an exact cancellation of the interior field, and bring in still other contributions
of a reference medium variety, required to balance the incoming excitation. Such balancing provides
the linear conditions for slab field determination. This two-step solution provides evidence
of Ewald-Oseen extinction, even though the analytic framework here differs from the proofs available.
We solve the balancing equations by vector manipulation without determinants, and then offer a
boundary value confirmation in the special case of perpendicular incidence. In an appendix, we
allow the the upper/lower half spaces to differ, the upper serving as reference and remote launch
site of the incoming excitation. Effective currents now exist both within the slab and throughout
an entire half space, necessitating a provision for cross-talk between slab and the radiating half
space. The appendix provides an accelerated presentation of these generalized features, but stops
short of an explicit field solution by reason of algebraic inflation. All logical details are however
displayed in plain view. The self-consistency program is far more elegant and physically far more
satisfying than the prevailing method of scattered fields guessed as to their structure and then
fixed by boundary conditions.
