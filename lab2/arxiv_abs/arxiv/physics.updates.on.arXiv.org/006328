SWinvert is a workflow developed at The University of Texas at Austin for the inversion of surface
wave dispersion data. SWinvert encourages analysts to investigate inversion uncertainty and
non-uniqueness in shear wave velocity (Vs) by providing a systematic procedure and open-source
tools for surface wave inversion. In particular, the workflow enables the use of multiple layering
parameterizations to address the inversion's non-uniqueness, multiple global searches for each
parameterization to address the inverse problem's non-linearity, and quantification of Vs uncertainty
in the resulting profiles. To encourage its adoption, the SWinvert workflow is supported by an open-source
Python package, SWprepost, for surface wave inversion pre- and post-processing and an application
on the DesignSafe-CyberInfracture, SWbatch, that enlists high-performance computing for performing
batch-style surface wave inversion through an intuitive and easy-to-use web interface. While
the workflow uses the Dinver module of the popular open-source Geopsy software as its inversion
engine, the principles presented can be readily extended to other inversion programs. To illustrate
the effectiveness of the SWinvert workflow and to develop a set of benchmarks for use in future surface
wave inversion studies, synthetic experimental dispersion data for 12 subsurface models of varying
complexity are inverted. While the effects of inversion uncertainty and non-uniqueness are shown
to be minimal for simple subsurface models characterized by broadband dispersion data, these effects
cannot be ignored in the Vs profiles derived for more complex models with band-limited dispersion
data. The SWinvert workflow is shown to provide a methodical procedure and a powerful set of tools
for performing rigorous surface wave inversions and quantifying the uncertainty in the resulting
Vs profiles.
