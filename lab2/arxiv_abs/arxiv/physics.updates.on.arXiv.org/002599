It has been developed a model of the DNA in MATLAB, where it has been taken into account each one of the
component atoms. It is possible to have a sequence length of even 10000 basis pairs with the possibility
for introducing all types of sequences. It was studied the DNA damage in a single strain and in double
strain, SSB and DSB respectively as a product of ionising radiation from X-rays when interacting
with the DNA immersed in water. This is a theoretical and experimental study in-vitro that quantifies
the SSB and DSB with respect to different Gy's of radiation, this allows the understanding and prediction
about the exact risks of the exposition. It has been developed for energies corresponding to the
17.6 KeV however the energy parameters are also variable which allows the simulation of all type
of ionising radiation. For this simulation it is also taken into account the indirect damage as a
product of the free electrons and radicals from the water effects. The information of the spatial
distribution of the electrones is obtained form Geant4 and afterwards it is implemented in Matlab
where rays are created with tri-dimensional random trajectories through Monte Carlo simulations.
The experimental confirmation was developed by radiating DNA samples immersed in water with a X-rays
unit with Molibdeno target and it is observed and quantified the damage level through Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM). It was obtained a direct relation between the damage and the radiation dose in
the experiment and in the model and it is concluded that for 17.6 KeV the deterioration for interaction
is observed very low doses but the mutagenic damage only appears until the 17 Gy.
