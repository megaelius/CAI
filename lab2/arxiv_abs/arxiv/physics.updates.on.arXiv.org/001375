Anomalous diffusion has been investigated in many polymer and biological systems. The analysis
of PFG anomalous diffusion relies on the ability to obtain the signal attenuation expression. However,
the general analytical PFG signal attenuation expression based on the fractional derivative has
not been previously reported. Additionally, the reported modified-Bloch equations for PFG anomalous
diffusion in the literature yielded different results due to their different forms. Here, a new
integral type modified-Bloch equation based on the fractional derivative for PFG anomalous diffusion
is proposed, which is significantly different from the conventional differential type modified-Bloch
equation. The merit of the integral type modified-Bloch equation is that the original properties
of the contributions from linear or nonlinear processes remain unchanged at the instant of the combination.
From the modified-Bloch equation, the general solutions are derived, which includes the finite
gradient pulse width (FGPW) effect. The numerical evaluation of these PFG signal attenuation expressions
can be obtained either by the Adomian decomposition, or a direct integration method that is fast
and practicable. The theoretical results agree with the continuous-time random walk (CTRW) simulations
performed in this paper. Additionally, the relaxation effect in PFG anomalous diffusion is found
to be different from that in PFG normal diffusion. The new modified-Bloch equations and their solutions
provide a fundamental tool to analyze PFG anomalous diffusion in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
