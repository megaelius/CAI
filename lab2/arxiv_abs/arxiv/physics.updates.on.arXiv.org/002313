The passage of time is tracked by counting oscillations of a frequency reference, such as Earth's
revolutions or swings of a pendulum. By referencing atomic transitions, frequency (and thus time)
can be measured more precisely than any other physical quantity, with the current generation of
optical atomic clocks reporting fractional performance below the $10^{-17}$ level. However,
the theory of relativity prescribes that the passage of time is not absolute, but impacted by an observer's
reference frame. Consequently, clock measurements exhibit sensitivity to relative velocity,
acceleration and gravity potential. Here we demonstrate optical clock measurements surpassing
the present-day ability to account for the gravitational distortion of space-time across the surface
of Earth. In two independent ytterbium optical lattice clocks, we demonstrate unprecedented levels
in three fundamental benchmarks of clock performance. In units of the clock frequency, we report
systematic uncertainty of $1.4 \times 10^{-18}$, measurement instability of $3.2 \times 10^{-19}$
and reproducibility characterised by ten blinded frequency comparisons, yielding a frequency
difference of $[-7 \pm (5)_{stat} \pm (8)_{sys}] \times 10^{-19}$. While differential sensitivity
to gravity could degrade the performance of these optical clocks as terrestrial standards of time,
this same sensitivity can be used as an exquisite probe of geopotential. Near the surface of Earth,
clock comparisons at the $1 \times 10^{-18}$ level provide 1 cm resolution along gravity, outperforming
state-of-the-art geodetic techniques. These optical clocks can further be used to explore geophysical
phenomena, detect gravitational waves, test general relativity and search for dark matter.
