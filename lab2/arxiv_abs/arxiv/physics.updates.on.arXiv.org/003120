Monitoring Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) effects is necessary to capture resistant patients
and stop or change treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the tumor response at an early stage,
after the first doses of the NAC, based on the variability of the backscattered ultrasound energy,
and backscatter statistics. The backscatter statistics has not previously been used to monitor
NAC effects. The B-mode ultrasound images and raw radio frequency data from breast tumors were obtained
using an ultrasound scanner before chemotherapy and 1 week after each NAC cycle. Twenty-four malignant
breast cancers, qualified for neoadjuvant treatment before surgery, were included in the study.
The shape parameter of the homodyned K distribution and integrated backscatter, along with the
tumor size in the longest dimension, were determined based on ultrasound data and used as markers
for NAC response. Cancer tumors were assigned to responding and non-responding groups, according
to histopathological evaluation, which was a reference in assessing the utility of markers. Statistical
analysis was performed to rate the ability of markers to predict NAC response based on data obtained
after subsequent therapeutic doses. Statistically significant differences between groups were
obtained after 2, 3, 4, and 5 doses of NAC for quantitative ultrasound markers and after 5 doses for
the assessment based on maximum tumor dimension. After the second and third NAC courses the marker,
which was a linear combination of both quantitative ultrasound parameters, was characterized
by an AUC of 0.82 and 0.91, respectively. The introduction of statistical parameters of ultrasonic
backscatter to monitor the effects of chemotherapy can increase the effectiveness of monitoring
and contribute to a better personalization of NAC therapy.
