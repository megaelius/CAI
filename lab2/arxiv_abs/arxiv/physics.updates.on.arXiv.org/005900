Heat transfer via phase change is a major contributor to heat removal in numerous engineering applications.
Thin films of liquid result in increased heat transfer due to a reduction of conduction resistance,
in addition the pressure jump at the liquid-vapor interface also affects the rate and direction
of rate of phase change. Because of these effects the morphology of the substrate surface is expected
to affect the film shape, hence heat transfer, especially in thin films. In this study, the influence
of surface characteristics on the rate of phase change from micron and sub-micron sized 2-D droplets-i.e.
films extending to infinity-forming on a substrate are modeled. Surface film profiles are generated
on both flat and non-flat surfaces, triangular or wavy in nature, and a kinetic model for quasi-equilibrium
phase change is applied. Due to the presence of intermolecular forces at the contact line, which
render the solution of the augmented Young-Laplace equation stiff, an implicit scheme is employed
for the numerical integration. To verify the method, the predictions of a molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation of a nano sized droplet present on a V-grooved surface is compared to the continuum model.
The augmented Young-Laplace equation is solved numerically along with a phase change model originating
from kinetic theory to calculate the shape of the two-phase interface forming the droplet and study
the effect of various parameters on the rate of phase change. Results are obtained for droplets with
liquid pressures higher and lower than that of vapor, resulting in opposite contribution to phase
change due to the pressure jump at the interface. The results show that the heat transfer rate can
be substantially altered due primarily to the combined effects of surface morphology and disjoining
pressure.
