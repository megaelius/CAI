We employ classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular-level structure
of water during the isothermal compression of hexagonal ice (I$h$) and low-density amorphous (LDA)
ice at low temperatures. In both cases, the system transforms to high-density amorphous ice (HDA)
via a first-order-like phase transition. We employ a sensitive local order metric (LOM) [Martelli
et. al., Phys. Rev. B, 97, 064105 (2018)], that can discriminate among different crystalline and
non crystalline ice structures and is based on the positions of the oxygen atoms in the first and/or
second hydration shell. Our results confirm that LDA and HDA are indeed amorphous, i.e., they lack
of polydispersed ice domains. Interestingly, HDA contains a small number of domains that are reminiscent
of the unit cell of ice IV, although the hydrogen-bond network (HBN) of these domains differ from
the HBN of ice IV. The presence of ice IV-like domains provides some support to the hypothesis that
HDA could be the result of a detour on the HBN rearrangement along the I$h$-to-ice IV pressure induced
transformation. Both nonequilibrium LDA-to-HDA and I$h$-to-HDA transformations are two-steps
processes where a small distortion of the HBN first occurs at low pressures and then, a sudden, extensive
re-arrangement of hydrogen bonds at the corresponding transformation pressure follows. Interestingly,
the I$h$-to-HDA and LDA-to-HDA transformations occur when LDA and I$h$ have similar local order,
as quantified by the site-averaged LOMs. Since I$h$ has a perfect tetrahedral HBN, while LDA does
not, it follows that higher pressures are needed to transform I$h$ into HDA than that for the conversion
of LDA to HDA. In correspondence with both first-order-like phase transitions, the samples are
composed of a large HDA cluster that percolates within the I$h$/LDA samples.
