Many animals live in societies where individuals frequently interact socially with each other.
The social structures of these systems have in recent years been studied in many species by means
of network analysis. Animal social networks is now a well-established research area that has provided
important insights into animal behaviour, ecology, and social evolution. Animal social network
research, however, seems to not be well known by scientists outside of the animal behaviour field.
Here we provide an introduction to animal social networks for complex systems researchers. We believe
that a better integration of animal social networks with the interdisciplinary field of complex
systems would be mutually beneficial for various reasons. Increased collaboration with complex
systems researchers could be valuable in solving challenges of particular importance to animal
social network research. Furthermore, high-resolution datasets of social networks from different
animal species can potentially be very useful for investigating general hypotheses about complex
systems. In this paper, we describe what animal social networks are and how they are scientifically
important; we give an overview of the methods commonly used to study animal social networks; and
finally we highlight challenges in the study of animal social networks where interaction between
animal social network research and general complex systems research could be particularly valuable.
We hope that this will help to facilitate future interdisciplinary collaborations involving animal
social networks, and lead to better integration of these networks into the field of complex systems.
