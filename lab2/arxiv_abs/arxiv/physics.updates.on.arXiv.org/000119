In this chapter the complex systems are discussed in the context of economic and business policy
and decision making. It will be showed and motivated that social systems are typically chaotic,
non-linear and/or non-equilibrium and therefore complex systems. It is discussed that the rapid
change in global consumer behaviour is underway, that further increases the complexity in business
and management. For policy making under complexity, following principles are offered: openness
and international competition, tolerance and variety of ideas, self-reliability and low dependence
on external help. The chapter contains four applications that build on the theoretical motivation
of complexity in social systems. The first application demonstrates that small economies have
good prospects to gain from the global processes underway, if they can demonstrate production flexibility,
reliable business ethics and good risk management. The second application elaborates on and discusses
the opportunities and challenges in decision making under complexity from macro and micro economic
perspective. In this environment, the challenges for corporate management are being also permanently
changed: the balance between short term noise and long term chaos whose attractor includes customers,
shareholders and employees must be found. The emergence of chaos in economic relationships is demonstrated
by a simple system of differential equations that relate the stakeholders described above. The
chapter concludes with two financial applications: about debt and risk management. The non-equilibrium
economic establishment leads to additional problems by using excessive borrowing; unexpected
downturns in economy can more easily kill companies. Finally, the demand for quantitative improvements
in risk management is postulated.
