Negative solutions are possible for Einstein's Special Relativity equation, as well as Dirac's,
Maxwell's, and Schrodinger's equations; and Schrodinger's equation utilizes antitime to calculate
quantum probabilities. Also, since no ground state seems to exist for matter, Dirac predicted that
negative matter must exist to keep all of matter from disappearing into negative energy states.
And Einstein showed that all things are relative except the speed of light. Together, these imply
that 4 negative dimensions (Ds) are overlapped by the 4 positive Ds; that positive and negative matters
reside in these 2 separate sets of Ds; and that their separateness prevents their mutual annihilation.
Light would then exist as an oscillation of the interface between these 2 sets of Ds, with the 2 relative
matters varying equally on each side; thus allowing light to remain constant. And since 2 negatives
make a positive, the 2 sets would move as one, even though they are opposites. This means that the 2
sets always remain exactly overlapped; and so, the negative Ds remain disguised. Our universe therefore
could be a dual universe. Also, 8+2 Ds makes a total of 10 Ds; 4x4=16 interactions, and 10+16 = 26. So
our 4 D world could act as a 10/26 D world; which matches the 2 sets within which string theory is self-
consistent. And this is why N =10. Also, an initial matter singularity would be balanced by antimatter
being infinitely spread out at the opposite end of time; so a dual universe would allow an initial
singularity to exist with both a known position and momentum, without violating quantum mechanics.
And since a dual universe having two equal sets of Ds and matter would always be exactly balanced;
a dual universe would be extremely stable all thorough its existence. And this means that our universe
is likely to be a dual universe.
