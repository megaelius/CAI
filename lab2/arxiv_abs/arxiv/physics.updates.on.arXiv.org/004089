Datasets in engineering applications are often limited and contaminated, mainly due to unavoidable
measurement noise and signal distortion. Thus, using conventional data-driven approaches to
build a reliable discriminative model, and further applying this identified surrogate to uncertainty
analysis remains to be very challenging. A deep learning approach is presented to provide predictions
based on limited and noisy data. To address noise perturbation, the Bayesian learning method that
naturally facilitates an automatic updating mechanism is considered to quantify and propagate
model uncertainties into predictive quantities. Specifically, hierarchical Bayesian modeling
(HBM) is first adopted to describe model uncertainties, which allows the prior assumption to be
less subjective, while also makes the proposed surrogate more robust. Next, the Bayesian inference
is seamlessly integrated into the DL framework, which in turn supports probabilistic programming
by yielding a probability distribution of the quantities of interest rather than their point estimates.
Variational inference (VI) is implemented for the posterior distribution analysis where the intractable
marginalization of the likelihood function over parameter space is framed in an optimization format,
and stochastic gradient descent method is applied to solve this optimization problem. Finally,
Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain an unbiased estimator in the predictive phase of Bayesian
inference, where the proposed Bayesian deep learning (BDL) scheme is able to offer confidence bounds
for the output estimation by analyzing propagated uncertainties. The effectiveness of Bayesian
shrinkage is demonstrated in improving predictive performance using contaminated data, and various
examples are provided to illustrate concepts, methodologies, and algorithms of this proposed
BDL modeling technique.
