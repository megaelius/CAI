Medical conditions due to acute cell injury, such as stroke and heart attack, are of tremendous impact
and have attracted huge amounts of research effort. The biomedical research that seeks cures for
these conditions has been dominated by a qualitative, inductive mindset. Although the inductive
approach has not been effective in developing medical treatments, it has amassed enough information
to allow construction of quantitative, deductive models of acute cell injury. In this work we develop
a modeling approach by extending an autonomous nonlinear dynamic theory of acute cell injury that
offered new ways to conceptualize cell injury but possessed limitations that decrease its effectiveness.
Here we study the global dynamics of the cell injury theory using a nonautonomous formulation. Different
from the standard scenario in nonlinear dynamics that is determined by the steady state and fixed
points of the model equations, in this nonautonomous model with a trivial fixed point, the system
property is dominated by the transient states and the corresponding dynamic processes. The model
gives rise to four qualitative types of dynamical patterns that can be mapped to the behavior of cells
after clinical acute injuries. The nonautonomous theory predicts the existence of a latent stress
response capacity (LSRC) possessed by injured cells. The LSRC provides a theoretical explanation
of how therapies, such as hypothermia, can prevent cell death after lethal injuries. The nonautonomous
theory of acute cell injury provides an improved quantitative framework for understanding cell
death and recovery and lays a foundation for developing effective therapeutics for acute injury.
