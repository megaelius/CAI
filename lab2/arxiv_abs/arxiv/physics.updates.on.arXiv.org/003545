Materials combining both a high refractive index and a wide band gap are of great interest for optoelectronic
and sensor applications. However, these two properties are typically described by an inverse correlation
with high refractive index appearing in small gap materials and vice-versa. Here, we conduct a first-principles
high-throughput study on more than 4000 semiconductors (with a special focus on oxides). Our data
confirm the general inverse trend between refractive index and band gap but interesting outliers
are also identified. The data are then analyzed through a simple model involving two main descriptors:
the average optical gap and the effective frequency. The former can be determined directly from
the electronic structure of the compounds, but the latter cannot. This calls for further analysis
in order to obtain a predictive model. Nonetheless, it turns out that the negative effect of a large
band gap on the refractive index can counterbalanced in two ways: (i) by limiting the difference
between the direct band gap and the average optical gap which can be realized by a narrow distribution
in energy of the optical transitions and (ii) by increasing the effective frequency which can be
achieved through either a high number of transitions from the top of the valence band to the bottom
of the conduction or a high average probability for these transitions. Focusing on oxides, we use
our data to investigate how the chemistry influences this inverse relationship and rationalize
why certain classes of materials would perform better. Our findings can be used to search for new
compounds in many optical applications both in the linear and non-linear regime (waveguides, optical
modulators, laser, frequency converter, etc.).
