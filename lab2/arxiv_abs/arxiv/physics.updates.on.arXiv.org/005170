Investigating student learning and understanding of conceptual physics is a primary research
area within Physics Education Research (PER). Multiple quantitative methods have been employed
to analyze commonly used mechanics conceptual inventories: the Force Concept Inventory (FCI)
and the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE). Recently, researchers have applied network
analytic techniques to explore the structure of the incorrect responses to the FCI identifying
communities of incorrect responses which could be mapped on to common misconceptions. In this study,
the method used to analyze the FCI, Modified Module Analysis (MMA), was applied to a large sample
of FMCE pretest and post-test responses ($N_{pre}=3956$, $N_{post}=3719$). The communities
of incorrect responses identified were consistent with the item groups described in previous works.
As in the work with the FCI, the network was simplified by only retaining nodes selected by a substantial
number of students. Retaining nodes selected by 20\% of the students produced communities associated
with only four misconceptions. The incorrect response communities identified for men and women
were substantially different, as was the change in these communities from pretest to post-test.
The 20% threshold was far more restrictive than the 4% threshold applied to the FCI in the prior work
which generated similar structures. Retaining nodes selected by 5% or 10% of students generated
a large number of complex communities. The communities identified at the 10\% threshold were generally
associated with common misconceptions producing a far richer set of incorrect communities than
the FCI; this may indicate that the FMCE is a superior instrument for characterizing the breadth
of student misconceptions about Newtonian mechanics.
