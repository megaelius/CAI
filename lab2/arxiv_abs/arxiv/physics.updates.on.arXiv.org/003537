The information contained in social systems, and the part of it that animals actually possess, is
a driver of the evolution of sociality, cognition, and animal culture. However, it is difficult
to detect how much information individuals actually have about their social worlds. Even when information
can be detected, differences in methodology make cross-species comparisons difficult. We present
a new method for detecting social information in dominance hierarchies, that infers individual-level
rules for aggression based on how aggression decisions are influenced by differences in social
rank. We apply this method to 172 social groups across 85 species in 22 orders. By looking for heuristics
that depend upon rank information, we can back-infer the types of information individuals possess
about the macro-level properties of their group. Summary measures of these heuristics then place
groups within a taxonomy, providing a biologically-relevant "social assay" to quantify the amount
of social information and to identify consensus strategies at the group level. The majority of animal
groups in our dataset (112 groups, 65%) follow a downward heuristic to structure their fights, spreading
aggression relatively equally across lower-ranked opponents but 50 groups (29%) use strategies
that are indicative of more detailed rank information. Strategies are not phylogenetically constrained
and groups within the same species can use different strategies, indicating that the choice of heuristics
may be contextual and that the structuring of aggression by social information should not be considered
a fixed characteristic. Instead, individuals may be able to plastically respond to local conditions
by increasing or decreasing the complexity of their strategies. Our approach provides new opportunities
to study the use of social information across species and the evolution of social complexity and
cognition.
