The analysis of the deflection of coronal mass ejection (CME) events plays an important role in the
improvement of the forecasting of their geo-effectiveness. Motivated by the scarcity of comprehensive
studies of CME events with focus on the governing conditions that drive deflections during their
early stages, we performed an extensive analysis of 13 CME events that exhibited large deflections
during their early development in the low corona. The study was carried out by exploiting solar corona
imaging observations at different heights and wavelengths from instruments onboard several space
and ground solar observatories, namely the Project for Onboard Autonomy 2 (PROBA2), Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO), Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft, and from National Solar Observatory (NSO). The selected events
were observed between October 2010 and September 2011, to take advantage of the location in near
quadrature of the STEREO spacecraft and Earth in this time period. In particular, we determined
the 3D trajectory of the front envelope of the CMEs and their associated prominences with respect
to their solar sources by means of a forward modeling and tie-pointing tool, respectively. By using
a potential field source surface model, we estimated the coronal magnetic fields of the ambient
medium through which the events propagate to investigate the role of the magnetic energy distribution
in the non-radial propagation of both structures (front envelope and prominence) and in their kinematic
properties. The ambient magnetic environment during the eruption and early stages of the events
is found to be crucial in determining the trajectory of the CME events, in agreement with previous
reports.
