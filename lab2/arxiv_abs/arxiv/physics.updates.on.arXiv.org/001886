We investigate an agent-based model of opinion dynamics with two types of social response: conformity
and independence. Conformity is introduced to the model analogously as in the Sznajd model or $q$-voter
model, which means that only unanimous group exerts peer pressure on individuals. The novelty,
in relation to previous versions of the $q$-voter model, is memory possessed by each agent and external
noise $T$, which plays the role of social temperature. Each agent has its own memories of past experiences
related to the social costs and benefits of being independent or conformist. If an agent was awarded
in past more for being independent, it will have a greater tendency to be independent than conformist
and vice versa. We will show that depending on the social temperature $T$ the system spontaneously
organizes into one of two regimes. Below a certain critical social temperature $T_c$, all agents
in the society acquire personal traits (so called person state). Some of them become permanent conformists
and others start to behave forever independently. This means that initially homogeneous population
becomes heterogeneous, and agents respond differently to social influence. For $T>T_c$, all agents
with equal probabilities behave independently or conform to peer pressure (so called situation
state). This regime change between person and situation state, which reminds the idea of an annealed
vs. quenched disorder, affects also public opinion. Particularly interesting results are obtained
for individualistic societies, in which public opinion is non-monotonic function of $T$, which
means that there is an optimal social temperature for which an agreement in the society is the highest.
