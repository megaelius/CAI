A high-yield production of high-quality boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) was reported recently
in several publications. A boron-rich material is evaporated by a laser or plasma in a nitrogen-rich
atmosphere to supply precursor gaseous species for nucleation and growth of BNNTs. Either hydrogen
was added or pressure was increased in the system to achieve high yield and high purity of the synthesized
nanotubes. According to the widely-accepted root grow mechanism, upon the gas cooling, boron droplets
form first, then they adsorb nitrogen from surrounding gas species, and BNNTs grow on their surfaces.
However, what are these precursor species that provide nitrogen for the growth is still an open question.
To answer this question, we performed thermodynamic calculations of B-N mixture composition considering
broad set of gas species. In enhancement of previous studies, the condensation of boron is now taken
into account and is shown to have drastic effect on the gas chemical composition. B2N molecules were
identified to be a major source of nitrogen for growth of BNNTs. Presence of B2N molecules in a B-N
gas mixture was verified by our spectroscopic measurements during a laser ablation of boron-rich
targets in nitrogen. It was shown that the increase of pressure has a quantitative effect on the mixture
composition yielding increase of the precursor density. The effect of hydrogen addition was studied
as well. In addition, thermodynamics was applied in conjunction with agglomeration theory to predict
the size of boron droplets upon growth of BNNTs. Analytical relations for identification of crucial
species densities were derived.
