Many experimental techniques such as tagging photodissociation and helium nanodroplet isolation
spectroscopy operate at very low temperatures in order to investigate hydrogen bonding. To elucidate
the differences between such ultra-cold and usual ambient conditions, different hydrogen bonded
systems are studied systematically from 300 K down to about 1 K using path integral simulations that
explicitly consider both, the quantum nature of the nuclei and thermal fluctuations. For that purpose,
finite sized water clusters, specifically the water dimer and hexamer, protonated water clusters
including the Zundel and Eigen complexes, as well as hexagonal ice as a condensed phase representative
are compared directly as a function of temperature. While weaker hydrogen bonds, as present in the
neutral systems, show distinct structural differences between ambient conditions and the ultra-cold
regime, the stronger hydrogen bonds of the protonated water clusters are less perturbed by temperature
compared to their quantum ground state. In all studied systems, the quantum delocalization of the
nuclei is found to vary drastically with temperature. Interestingly, upon reaching temperatures
of about 1 K, the spatial quantum delocalization of the heavy oxygens approaches that of the protons
for relatively weak spatial constraints, and even significantly exceeds the latter in case of the
centered hydrogen bond in the Zundel complex. These findings are relevant for comparisons between
experiments on hydrogen bonding carried out at ultra-cold versus ambient conditions as well as
to understand quantum delocalization phenomena of nuclei by seamlessly extending our insights
into noncovalent interactions down to ultra-low temperatures.
