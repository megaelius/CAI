Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) detects light-induced ultrasound waves to reconstruct
the optical absorption contrast of the biological tissues. Due to its relatively deep penetration
(several centimeters in soft tissue), high spatial resolution, and inherent functional sensitivity,
PACT has great potential for imaging mouse brains with endogenous and exogenous contrasts, which
is of immense interest to the neuroscience community. However, conventional PACT either assumes
homogenous optical fluence within the brain or uses a simplified attenuation model for optical
fluence estimation. Both approaches underestimate the complexity of the fluence heterogeneity
and can result in poor quantitative imaging accuracy. To optimize the quantitative performance
of PACT, we explore for the first time 3D Monte Carlo simulation to study the optical fluence distribution
in a complete mouse brain model. We apply the MCX Monte Carlo simulation package on a digital mouse
(Digimouse) brain atlas that has complete anatomy information. To evaluate the impact of the brain
vasculature on light delivery, we also incorporate the whole-brain vasculature in the Digimouse
atlas. The simulation results clearly show that the optical fluence in the mouse brain is heterogeneous
at the global level and can decrease by a factor of five with increasing depth. Moreover, the strong
absorption and scattering of the brain vasculature also induce the fluence disturbance at the local
level. Our results suggest that both global and local fluence heterogeneity contributes to the
reduced quantitative accuracy of the reconstructed PACT images of mouse brain.
