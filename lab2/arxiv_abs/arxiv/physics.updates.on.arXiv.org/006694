Ground-based measurements of frozen precipitation are heavily influenced by interactions of
surface winds with gauge-shield geometry. The Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC), which photographs
hydrometeors in free-fall from three different angles while simultaneously measuring their fall
speed, has been used in the field at multiple mid-latitude and polar locations both with and without
wind shielding. Here we show results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the airflow
and corresponding particle trajectories around the unshielded MASC and compare these results
to Arctic field observations with and without a Belfort double Alter shield. Simulations in the
absence of a wind shield show a separation of flow at the upstream side of the instrument, with an upward
velocity component just above the aperture, which decreases the mean particle fall speed by 55%(74%)
for a wind speed of 5 m/s(10 m/s). MASC-measured fall speeds compare well with Ka-band Atmospheric
Radiation Measurement (ARM) Zenith Radar (KAZR) mean Doppler velocities only when winds are light
(<5 m/s) and the MASC is shielded. MASC-measured fall speeds that do not match KAZR measured velocities
tend to fall below a threshold value that increases approximately linearly with wind speed but is
generally <0.5 m/s. For those events with wind speeds <1.5 m/s, hydrometeors fall with an orientation
angle mode of 12 degrees from the horizontal plane, and large, low-density aggregates are as much
as five times more likely to be observed. We conclude that accurate MASC observations of the microphysical,
orientation, and fall speed characteristics of snow particles require shielding by a double wind
fence and restriction of analysis to events where winds are light (<5 m/s). Hydrometeors do not generally
fall in still air, so adjustments to these properties' distributions within natural turbulence
remain to be determined.
