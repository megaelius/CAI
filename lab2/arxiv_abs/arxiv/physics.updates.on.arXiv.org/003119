Biofilms are a cluster of bacteria embedded in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that contain
a complex composition of polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA (eDNA). Desirable
mechanical properties of the biofilms are critical for their survival, propagation, and dispersal,
and the response of mechanical properties to different treatment conditions also sheds light on
biofilm control and eradication in vivo and on engineering surfaces. However, it is challenging
yet important to interrogate mechanical behaviors of biofilms with a high spatial resolution because
biofilms are very heterogeneous. Moreover, biofilms are viscoelastic, and their time-dependent
mechanical behavior is difficult to capture. Herein, we developed a powerful technique that combines
the high spatial resolution of the atomic force microscope (AFM) with a rigorous history-dependent
viscoelastic analysis to deliver highly spatial-localized biofilm properties within a wide time-frequency
window. By exploiting the use of static force spectroscopy in combination with an appropriate viscoelastic
framework, we highlight the intensive amount of time-dependent information experimentally available
that has been largely overlooked. It is shown that this technique provides a detailed nanorheological
signature of the biofilms even at the single-cell level. We share the computational routines that
would allow any user to perform the analysis from experimental raw data. The detailed localization
of mechanical properties in space and in time-frequency domain provides insights on the understanding
of biofilm stability, cohesiveness, dispersal, and control.
