We model the binding energies of rovibrational levels of the RbYb molecule using experimental data
from two-color photoassociation spectroscopy in mixtures of ultracold $^{87}$Rb with various
Yb isotopes. The model uses a theoretical potential based on state-of-the-art \emph{ab initio}
potentials, further improved by least-squares fitting to the experimental data. We have fixed
the number of bound states supported by the potential curve, so that the model is mass scaled, that
is, it accurately describes the bound state energies for all measured isotopic combinations. Such
a model enables an accurate prediction of the s-wave scattering lengths of all isotopic combinations
of the RbYb system. The reduced mass range is broad enough to cover the full scattering lengths range
from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. For example, the $^{87}$Rb$^{174}$Yb system is characterized by
a large positive scattering length of $+880(120)$~a.u., while $^{87}$Rb$^{173}$Yb has $a=-626(88)$~a.u..
On the other hand $^{87}$Rb$^{170}$Yb has a very small scattering length of $-14.5(1.8)$~a.u.
confirmed by the pair's extremely low thermalization rate. For isotopic combinations including
$^{85}$Rb the variation of the interspecies scattering lengths is much smoother ranging from $+39.0(1.6)$
a.u. for $^{85}$Rb$^{176}$Yb to $+230(10)$ a.u. in the case of $^{85}$Rb$^{168}$Yb. Hyperfine
corrections to these scattering lengths are also given. We further complement the fitted potential
with interaction parameters calculated from alternative methods. The recommended value of the
van der Waals coefficient is $C_6$=2837(13)~a.u. and is in agreement and more precise than the current
state-of-the-art theoretical predictions (S. G. Porsev, M. S. Safronova, A. Derevianko, and C.W.
Clark, arXiv:1307.2654 (2013)).
