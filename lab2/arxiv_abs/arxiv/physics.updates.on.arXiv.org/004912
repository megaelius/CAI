Despite the search for supersymmetry based on abelian and non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge field theory,
the Maxwell equations, as the earliest gauge field theory, are non-symmetric because of the undefined
term of magnetic current density. This article reports on the theoretical quantization of this
term based on spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spatial geometry of a gauge group (G-group) of
quantum charged (QC) particles. A locally supersymmetric background-independent spatial geometry
of the G-group is developed based on the commutative string field interaction (SFI) between infinite
number of QC particles and the grand monopole and the noncommutative SFI of each pair of adjacent
QC particles in the G-group. Two adjoint and disjoint currents are associated with the commutative
and noncommutative SFIs, respectively, based on the spin of a QC particle. The adjoint and disjoint
currents are associated with a zero resistivity between a QC particle and the grand monopole and
an infinite resistivity between each pair of adjacent QC particles correlated to their microscopic
commutative and noncommutative SFIs in the G-group, respectively. This article demonstrates
that the two corresponding resistivities are finite (greater than zero and less than infinity)
for the macroscopic commutative and noncommutative SFIs of the G-group. Therefore, the adjoint
and disjoint currents are related to the classical macroscopic currents known as electric and magnetic
currents, respectively. Because the microscopic adjoint current associated with the commutative
SFI has already been related to the macroscopic electric current density in the Maxwell equations,
it is proposed that the microscopic disjoint current associated with the noncommutative SFI is
related to the undefined magnetic current density in these equations.
