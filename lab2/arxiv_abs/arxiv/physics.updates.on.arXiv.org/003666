General Relativity is the best theory of gravity that we have so far. It not only provides a relativistic
description of the gravitational interaction but also of the spacetime geometry, which makes it
quite special in comparison with other theories. The field equations are non-linear partial differential
equations that can be arranged as a hyperbolic system of evolution equations together with some
constraint equations. The structure of the hyperbolic evolution operator is special in the sense
that evolution of smooth initial data leads to smooth solutions, assuming an adequate gauge choice
and the absence of matter fields whose evolution can generate shock-type discontinuities. Numerical
Relativity consists in the study of formulations of the full Einstein equations together with the
development of the corresponding numerical methods/algorithms for the study of problems where
a general relativistic description is required, in particular for those with high-accuracy requirements.
In this paper, we advocate the use of Pseudo-Spectral Collocation (PSC) methods in combination
with high-order bit precision algorithms for this kind of problems. The main reason is that the PSC
method provides exponential convergence (for smooth problems, as is the case in many problems in
relativistic gravitation) and is very amenable for high-precision arithmetics since we can use
different bit precision without the need of changing the structure of the numerical algorithms.
Moreover, the PSC method provides high-compression storage of the information. We illustrate
these ideas in some problems in relativistic gravitational collapse, whose dynamics exhibits
self-similarity properties that require very precise numerical simulations to be properly captured
and characterized.
