The formation and stability of social hierarchies is a question of general relevance. Here, we propose
a simple model for establishing social hierarchy via pair-wise interactions between individuals
and investigate its stability. In each interaction or fight, the probability of "winning" depends
solely on the relative societal status of the participants, and the winner has a gain of status whereas
there is an equal loss to the loser. The interactions are characterized by two parameters. The first
parameter represents how much can be lost, and the second parameter represents the degree to which
even a small difference of status can guarantee a win for the higher-status individual. Depending
on the parameters, the resulting status distributions reach either a continuous unimodal form
or lead to a totalitarian end state with one dominant high-status individual and all other individuals
having zero status. However, we find that in the latter case long-lived intermediary distributions
often exist, which can give the illusion of a stable society. Moreover, by implementing a simple,
but realistic rule that restricts interactions to sufficiently similar-status individuals,
the stable or long-lived distributions acquire high-status structure corresponding to a dominant
class. We compare our model predictions to human societies using household income as a proxy for
societal status and find agreement over their entire range from the low-to-middle-status parts
to the characteristic high-status "tail". We discuss how the model provides a conceptual framework
for understanding the origin of social hierarchy and the factors which lead to the preservation
or deterioration of the societal structure.
