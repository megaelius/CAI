As an extension of previous theoretical study on the coherent structure resonance due to space charge
effects [Chao Li and R. A. Jameson, Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 21, 024204, 2018], this paper aims to demonstrate
how the beam, as a whole, is spontaneously affected when the predicted mixed coherent 2nd/4th order
structure resonance stop band around $90^{\circ}$ phase advance is crossed. The beam characteristics
during the structure resonance crossing, such as the rms emittance growth and the appearance of
2-fold/4-fold structure in phase space, are well explained by the mixture characteristic of different
orders of structure resonance. The related `attracting' and `repulsive' effects in the structure
resonance stop band from below and above crossing are considered as a natural beam reaction to the
coherent structure resonance that the beam spontaneously moves to a structure resonance free region
then the space charge takes a weaker importance. In the PIC simulation, it is found that the emittance
growth is positively related to the time that the beam spends inside the structure resonance stop
band. As a potential candidate mechanism, the incoherent particle-core resonance also has been
checked. It is found that this incoherent resonance has basic difficulties in explaining the results
obtained from the self-consistent PIC simulation. The incoherent particle-core resonance might
lead to phase space distortion, emittance growth, or beam halo formation only on a long-time scale.
This clarity of the discrepancies between coherent and incoherent resonance mechanisms will lead
to a better understanding of the numerical study and experimental researches obtained recently.
In addition, similar understanding can be extended to the study of higher order structure resonance.
