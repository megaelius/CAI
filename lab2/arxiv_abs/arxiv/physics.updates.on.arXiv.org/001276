ALICE (A Large Heavy Ion Experiment) is one of the four major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) at CERN, which is today the most powerful particle accelerator worldwide. The High Level Trigger
(HLT) is an online compute farm of about 200 nodes, which reconstructs events measured by the ALICE
detector in real-time. The HLT uses a custom online data-transport framework to distribute data
and workload among the compute nodes. ALICE employs several calibration-sensitive subdetectors,
e.g. the TPC (Time Projection Chamber). For a precise reconstruction, the HLT has to perform the
calibration online. Online-calibration can make certain Offline calibration steps obsolete
and can thus speed up Offline analysis. Looking forward to ALICE Run III starting in 2020, online
calibration becomes a necessity. The main detector used for track reconstruction is the TPC. Reconstructing
the trajectories in the TPC is the most compute-intense step during event reconstruction. Therefore,
a fast tracking implementation is of great importance. Reconstructed TPC tracks build the basis
for the calibration making a fast online-tracking mandatory. We present several components developed
for the ALICE High Level Trigger to perform fast event reconstruction and to provide features required
for online calibration. As first topic, we present our TPC tracker, which employs GPUs to speed up
the processing, and which bases on a Cellular Automaton and on the Kalman filter. Our TPC tracking
algorithm has been successfully used in 2011 and 2012 in the lead-lead and the proton-lead runs.
We have improved it to leverage features of newer GPUs and we have ported it to support OpenCL, CUDA,
and CPUs with a single common source code. This makes us vendor independent. As second topic, we present
framework extensions required for online calibration. ...
