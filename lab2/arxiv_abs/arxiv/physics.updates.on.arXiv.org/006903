Generalized Burridge-Knopoff (GBK) models display rich dynamics, characterized by instabilities
and multiple bifurcations. GBK models consist of interconnected masses that can slide on a rough
surface under friction. All masses are connected to a plate, which slowly provides energy to the
system. The system displays long periods of quiescence, interrupted by fast, dynamic events (avalanches)
of energy relaxation. During these events, clusters of blocks slide abruptly, simulating seismic
slip and earthquake rupture. Here we propose a theory for preventing GBK avalanches, control its
dynamics and incite slow-slip. We exploit the dependence of friction on pressure and use it as a backdoor
for altering the dynamics of the system. We use the mathematical Theory of Control and, for the first
time, we succeed in (a) stabilizing and restricting chaos in GBK models, (b) guaranteeing slow frictional
dissipation and (c) tuning the GBK system toward desirable global asymptotic equilibria of lower
energy. Our control approach is robust and does not require exact knowledge of the frictional behavior
of the system. Finally, GBK models are known to present Self-Organized Critical (SOC) behavior.
Therefore, the presented methodology shows an additional example of SOC Control (SOCC). Given
that the dynamics of GBK models show many analogies with earthquakes, we expect to inspire earthquake
mitigation strategies regarding anthropogenic and/or natural seismicity. In a wider perspective,
our control approach could be used for improving understanding of cascade failures in complex systems
in geophysics, access hidden characteristics and improve their predictability by controlling
their spatio-temporal behavior in real-time.
