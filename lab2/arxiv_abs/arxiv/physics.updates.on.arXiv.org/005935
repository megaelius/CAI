We propose a simple SIR model in order to investigate the impact of various confinement strategies
on a most virulent epidemic. Our approach is motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main
hypothesis is the existence of two populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement
and for which the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non confined for
various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The model, initially formulated as
a differential system, is discretised following a specific procedure, the discrete system serving
as an integrator for the differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is observed
in the COVID-19 epidemic. Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure
of our model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by just analysing data
from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable
part of the world months before it became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal
feature of all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a rekindling of
the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second epidemic peak to be lower than the first
one. This is possible in all the scenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but
typically a progressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the progressive
exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too different. From our results, the most
promising strategy is that of a stepwise exit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible,
with the major part of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but obeying
rigorous distancing constraints.
