Currently in HDR brachytherapy planning, a manual fine-tuning of an objective function is necessary
to obtain case-specific valid plans. This study intends to facilitate this process by proposing
a patient-specific inverse planning algorithm for HDR prostate brachytherapy: GPU-based multi-criteria
optimization (gMCO). Two GPU-based optimization engines including simulated annealing (gSA)
and a quasi-Newton optimizer (gL-BFGS) were implemented to compute multiple plans in parallel.
After evaluating the equivalence and the computation performance of these two optimization engines,
one preferred optimization engine was selected for the gMCO algorithm. Five hundred sixty-two
previously treated prostate HDR cases were divided into validation set (100) and test set (462).
In the validation set, the number of Pareto optimal plans to achieve the best plan quality was determined
for the gMCO algorithm. In the test set, gMCO plans were compared with the physician-approved clinical
plans. Over 462 cases, the number of clinically valid plans was 428 (92.6%) for clinical plans and
461 (99.8%) for gMCO plans. The number of valid plans with target V100 coverage greater than 95% was
288 (62.3%) for clinical plans and 414 (89.6%) for gMCO plans. The mean planning time was 9.4 s for
the gMCO algorithm to generate 1000 Pareto optimal plans. In conclusion, gL-BFGS is able to compute
thousands of SA equivalent treatment plans within a short time frame. Powered by gL-BFGS, an ultra-fast
and robust multi-criteria optimization algorithm was implemented for HDR prostate brachytherapy.
A large-scale comparison against physician approved clinical plans showed that treatment plan
quality could be improved and planning time could be significantly reduced with the proposed gMCO
algorithm.
