Neoclassical transport in the presence of non-axisymmetric magnetic fields causes a toroidal
torque known as neoclassical toroidal viscosity (NTV). The toroidal symmetry of ITER will be broken
by the finite number of toroidal field coils and by test blanket modules (TBMs). The addition of ferritic
inserts (FIs) will decrease the magnitude of the toroidal field ripple. 3D magnetic equilibria
with toroidal field ripple and ferromagnetic structures are calculated for an ITER steady-state
scenario using the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC). Neoclassical transport quantities
in the presence of these error fields are calculated using the Stellarator Fokker-Planck Iterative
Neoclassical Conservative Solver (SFINCS). These calculations fully account for $E_r$, flux
surface shaping, multiple species, magnitude of ripple, and collisionality rather than applying
approximate analytic NTV formulae. As NTV is a complicated nonlinear function of $E_r$, we study
its behavior over a plausible range of $E_r$. We estimate the toroidal flow, and hence $E_r$, using
a semi-analytic turbulent intrinsic rotation model and NUBEAM calculations of neutral beam torque.
The NTV from the $\rvert n \rvert = 18$ ripple dominates that from lower $n$ perturbations of the TBMs.
With the inclusion of FIs, the magnitude of NTV torque is reduced by about 75% near the edge. We present
comparisons of several models of tangential magnetic drifts, finding appreciable differences
only for superbanana-plateau transport at small $E_r$. We find the scaling of calculated NTV torque
with ripple magnitude to indicate that ripple-trapping may be a significant mechanism for NTV in
ITER. The computed NTV torque without ferritic components is comparable in magnitude to the NBI
and intrinsic turbulent torques and will likely damp rotation, but the NTV torque is significantly
reduced by the planned ferritic inserts.
