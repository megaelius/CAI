Here we propose a semi-analytical technique that accurately reconstructs ocean's density stratification
profile, and hence, the pycnocline depth, simply from the free surface elevation data. The ocean
surface contains the signature of internal gravity waves (IGWs), which are generated when stably
stratified ocean water is forced to move back and forth over submarine topography by barotropic
tides. Since IGWs, in turn, contain the information of ocean's density stratification, the latter
can in principle be reconstructed from the free surface signature. We consider a simple theoretical
model that approximates a continuously stratified ocean as discrete layers of constant buoyancy
frequency; this facilitates the derivation of a closed-form dispersion relation. First, we numerically
simulate IGW generation for toy ocean scenarios and subsequently perform space-time Fourier transform
(STFT) of the free surface. Free surface STFT yields IGW spectra which has wavenumbers corresponding
to the tidal frequency. Density profile reconstruction has been performed by substituting these
IGW wavenumbers into the dispersion relation. Next we consider a more realistic situation in which
rotation is included; moreover the bottom topography, density and shear profiles are representative
of the Strait of Gibraltar. While density reconstruction is 94.4% accurate in the absence of shear,
the accuracy decreases to 90.2% when moderate shear is present. Since shear causes loss of coherence
in IGW beams, density reconstruction can be adversely affected in those regions of the global ocean
where shear is very strong. Finally, using wavenumbers obtained from multi-satellite altimetry
data near the Hawaiian Ridge, we have reconstructed actual density profile with 94.4% accuracy.
Since shear is either low or moderate in most parts of the global ocean, we expect our proposed technique
to be broadly applicable.
