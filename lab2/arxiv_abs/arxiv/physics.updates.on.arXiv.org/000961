This paper presents a study on the influence of welding residual stresses (RS) on fatigue crack propagation
rate (FCPR) in mode I. The objective of this work is to develop a novel methodology that allows a variation
of a RS field in the studied specimen while keeping constant all other variables influencing FCPR.
This led to the development of a novel specimen geometry, named CT-RES, in which RS are introduced
by weld bead deposition far from the region in which fatigue crack propagation (FCP) occurs. As a
consequence, the effect of factors influencing FCPR other than RS such as microstructural changes
or plastic deformation, often introduced by welding processes, can be avoided. The welding RS introduced
in the CT-RES specimen were determined by the contour method and the weight functions method was
used to calculate the stress intensity factor (SIF), Kres, resulting from the RS as the fatigue crack
propagates into the specimen. The evolution of cyclic stress ratio at the crack tip, Rlocal, was
then computed from Kres to quantify the influence of RS on the cyclic stress ratio. The results show
that for a given stress intensity range, dK, the FCPR of the welded geometry with fixed externally
low R ratio (R = 0.1), but constantly increasing Rlocal, is the same as for the as-machined geometry
without RS, solicited at high cyclic stress ratio (R = 0.7). These observations partially validate
the BS7910 standard philosophy in which the remaining life of a flawed structure in presence of tensile
RS is calculated from a high cyclic stress ratio (R > 0.5) crack propagation curve to eliminate crack
closure effects.
