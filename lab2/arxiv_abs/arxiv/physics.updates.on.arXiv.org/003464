Currently, one of the best performing and most popular earthquake forecasting models rely on the
working hypothesis that: "locations of past background earthquakes reveal the probable location
of future seismicity". As an alternative, we present a class of smoothed seismicity models (SSMs)
based on the principles of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model, which forecast the
location, time and magnitude of all future earthquakes using the estimates of the background seismicity
rate and the rates of future aftershocks of all generations. Using the Californian earthquake catalog,
we formulate six controlled pseudo-prospective experiments with different combination of three
target magnitude thresholds: 2.95, 3.95 or 4.95 and two forecasting time horizons: 1 or 5 year. In
these experiments, we compare the performance of:(1) ETAS model with spatially homogenous parameters
or GETAS (2) ETAS model with spatially variable parameters or SVETAS (3) three declustering based
SSMs (4) a simple SSM based on undeclustered data and (5) a model based on strain rate data, in forecasting
the location and magnitude of all (undeclustered) target earthquakes during many testing periods.
In all conducted experiments, the SVETAS model comes out with consistent superiority compared
to all the competing models. Consistently better performance of SVETAS model with respect to declustering
based SSMs highlights the importance of forecasting the future aftershocks of all generations
for developing better earthquake forecasting models. Among the two ETAS models themselves, accounting
for the optimal spatial variation of the parameters leads to strong and statistically significant
improvements in forecasting performance.
