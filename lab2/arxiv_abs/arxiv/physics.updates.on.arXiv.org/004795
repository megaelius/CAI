Simulating the dynamics of ions near polarizable nanoparticles (NPs) using coarse-grained models
is extremely challenging due to the need to solve the Poisson equation at every simulation timestep.
Recently, a molecular dynamics (MD) method based on a dynamical optimization framework bypassed
this obstacle by representing the polarization charge density as virtual dynamic variables, and
evolving them in parallel with the physical dynamics of ions. We highlight the computational gains
accessible with the integration of machine learning (ML) methods for parameter prediction in MD
simulations by demonstrating how they were realized in MD simulations of ions near polarizable
NPs. An artificial neural network based regression model was integrated with MD simulation and
predicted the optimal simulation timestep and optimization parameters characterizing the virtual
system with $94.3\%$ success. The ML-enabled auto-tuning of parameters generated accurate dynamics
of ions for $\approx 10$ million steps while improving the stability of the simulation by over an
order of magnitude. The integration of ML-enhanced framework with hybrid OpenMP/MPI parallelization
techniques reduced the computational time of simulating systems with thousands of ions and induced
charges from thousands of hours to tens of hours, yielding a maximum speedup of $\approx 3$ from ML-only
acceleration and a maximum speedup of $\approx 600$ from the combination of ML and parallel computing
methods. Extraction of ionic structure in concentrated electrolytes near oil-water emulsions
demonstrates the success of the method. The approach can be generalized to select optimal parameters
in other MD applications and energy minimization problems.
