Finite-size neutrally buoyant particles in a channel flow are known to accumulate at specific equilibrium
positions or spots in the channel cross-section if the flow inertia is finite at the particle scale.
Experiments in different conduit geometries have shown that while reaching equilibrium locations,
particles tend also to align regularly in the streamwise direction. In this paper, the Force Coupling
Method was used to numerically investigate the inertia-induced particle alignment, using square
channel geometry. The method was first shown to be suitable to capture the quasi-steady lift force
that leads to particle cross-streamline migration in channel flow. Then the particle alignment
in the flow direction was investigated by calculating the particle relative trajectories as a function
of flow inertia and of the ratio between the particle size and channel hydraulic diameter. The flow
streamlines were examined around the freely rotating particles at equilibrium, revealing stable
small-scale vortices between aligned particles. The streamwise inter-particle spacing between
aligned particles at equilibrium was calculated and compared to available experimental data in
square channel flow (Gao {\it et al.} Microfluidics and Nanofluidics {\bf 21}, 154 (2017)). The
new result highlighted by our numerical simulations is that the inter-particle spacing is unconditionally
stable only for a limited number of aligned particles in a single train, the threshold number being
dependent on the confinement (particle-to-channel size ratio) and on the Reynolds number. For
instance, when the particle Reynolds number is $\approx1$ and the particle-to-channel height
size ratio is $\approx0.1$, the maximum number of stable aligned particles per train is equal to
3. This agrees with statistics realized on the experiments of (Gao {\it et al.} Microfluidics and
Nanofluidics {\bf 21}, 154 (2017)).
