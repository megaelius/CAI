When a magnetosheath jet (localized dynamic pressure enhancements) compresses ambient magnetosheath
at a (relative) speed faster than the local magnetosonic speed, a bow wave or shock can form ahead
of the jet. Such bow waves or shocks were recently observed to accelerate particles, thus contributing
to magnetosheath heating and particle acceleration in the extended environment of Earth bow shock.
To further understand the characteristics of jet-driven bow waves, we perform a statistical study
to examine which solar wind conditions favor their formation and whether it is common for them to
accelerate particles. We identified 364 out of 2859 (13%) magnetosheath jets to have a bow wave or
shock ahead of them with Mach number typically larger than 1.1. We show that large solar wind plasma
beta, weak interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, large solar wind Alfven Mach number,
and strong solar wind dynamic pressure present favorable conditions for their formation. We also
show that magnetosheath jets with bow waves or shocks are more frequently associated with higher
maximum ion and electron energies than those without them, confirming that it is common for these
structures to accelerate particles. In particular, magnetosheath jets with bow waves have electron
energy flux enhanced on average by a factor of 2 compared to both those without bow waves and the ambient
magnetosheath. Our study implies that magnetosheath jets can contribute to shock acceleration
of particles especially for high Mach number shocks. Therefore, shock models should be generalized
to include magnetosheath jets and concomitant particle acceleration.
