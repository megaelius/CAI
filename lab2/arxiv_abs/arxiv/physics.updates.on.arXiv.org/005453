Molecule-electrode interfaces in molecular electronic junctions are prone to chemical reactions,
structural changes, and localized heating effects caused by electric current. These can be exploited
for device functionality or may be degrading processes that limit performance and device lifetime.
We develop a nonequilibrium Green's function based transport theory in which the central region
atoms and, more importantly, atoms on molecule-electrode interfaces are allowed to move. The separation
of time-scales of slow nuclear motion and fast electronic dynamics enables the algebraic solution
of the Kadanoff-Baym equations in the Wigner space. As a result, analytical expressions for dynamical
corrections to the adiabatically computed Green's functions are produced. These dynamical corrections
depend not only on the instantaneous molecular geometry but also on the nuclear velocities. To make
the theoretical approach fully self-consistent, the same time-separation approach is used to
develop expressions for the adiabatic, dissipative, and stochastic components of current-induced
forces in terms of adiabatic Green's functions. Using these current induced forces, the equation
of motion for the nuclear degrees of freedom is cast in the form of a Langevin equation. The theory
is applied to model molecular electronic junctions. We observe that the interplay between the value
of the spring constant for the molecule-electrode chemical bond and electronic coupling strength
to the corresponding electrode is critical for the appearance of structural instabilities and,
consequently, telegraphic switching in the electric current. The range of model parameters is
identified to observe structurally stable molecular junctions as well as various different kinds
of current-induced telegraphic switching. The interfacial structural instabilities are also
quantified based on current noise calculations.
