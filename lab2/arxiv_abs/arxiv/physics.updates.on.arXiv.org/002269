Understanding the statistics of fluctuation driven flows in the boundary layer of magnetically
confined plasmas is desired to accurately model the lifetime of the vacuum vessel components. Mirror
Langmuir probes (MLPs) are a novel diagnostic that uniquely allow to sample the plasma parameters
on a time scale shorter than the characteristic time scale of their fluctuations. Sudden large-amplitude
fluctuations in the plasma degrade the precision and accuracy of the plasma parameters reported
by MLPs for cases in which the probe bias range is of insufficient amplitude. While some data samples
can readily be classified as valid and invalid, we find that such a classification may be ambiguous
for up to 40% of data sampled for the plasma parameters and bias voltages considered in this study.
In this contribution we employ an autoencoder (AE) to learn a low-dimensional representation of
valid data samples. By definition, the coordinates in this space are the features that mostly characterize
valid data. Ambiguous data samples are classified in this space using standard classifiers for
vectorial data. This way, we avoid to define complicate threshold rules to identify outliers, which
requires strong assumptions and introduce biases in the analysis. Instead, these rules are learned
from the data by statistical inference By removing the outliers that are identified in the latent
low-dimensional space of the AE, we find that the average conductive and convective radial heat
flux are between approximately 5 and 15% lower as when removing outliers identified by threshold
values. For contributions to the radial heat flux due to triple correlations, the difference is
up to 40%.
