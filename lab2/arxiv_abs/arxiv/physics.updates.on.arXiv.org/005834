The impact of 400 keV $Ar^+$ ion irradiation on the magnetic and electrical properties of in-plane
magnetized magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) stacks was investigated by ferromagnetic resonance,
vibrating sample magnetometry and current-in-plane tunneling techniques. The irradiation-induced
changes of the magnetic anisotropy, coupling energies and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) exhibited
a correlated dependence on the ion fluence, which allowed us to distinguish between two irradiation
regimes. In the low-fluence regime, ${\Phi} < 10^{14} cm^{-2}$, the parameters required for having
a functioning MTJ were preserved: the anisotropy of the FeCoB free layer (FL) was weakly modulated
following a small decrease in the saturation magnetization $M_S$; the TMR decreased continuously;
the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) and the exchange bias (EB) decreased slightly. In the high-fluence
regime, ${\Phi} > 10^{14} cm^{-2}$, the MTJ was rendered inoperative: the modulation of the FL anisotropy
was strong, caused by a strong decrease in $M_S$, ascribed to a high degree of interface intermixing
between the FL and the Ta capping; the EB and IEC were also lost, likely due to intermixing of the layers
composing the synthetic antiferromagnet; and the TMR vanished due to the irradiation-induced
deterioration of the MgO barrier and MgO/FeCoB interfaces. We demonstrate that the layers surrounding
the FL play a decisive role in determining the trend of the magnetic anisotropy evolution resulting
from the irradiation, and that an ion-fluence window exists where such a modulation of magnetic
anisotropy can occur, while not losing the TMR or the magnetic configuration of the MTJ.
