Most real-world networks are not isolated. In order to function fully, they are interconnected
with other networks, and this interconnection influences their dynamic processes. For example,
when the spread of a disease involves two species, the dynamics of the spread within each species
(the contact network) differs from that of the spread between the two species (the interconnected
network). We model two generic interconnected networks using two adjacency matrices, A and B, in
which A is a 2N*2N matrix that depicts the connectivity within each of two networks of size N, and B
a 2N*2N matrix that depicts the interconnections between the two. Using an N-intertwined mean-field
approximation, we determine that a critical susceptable-infected-susceptable (SIS) epidemic
threshold in two interconnected networks is 1/{\lambda}1(A+\alpha B), where the infection rate
is \beta within each of the two individual networks and \alpha\beta in the interconnected links
between the two networks and {\lambda}1(A+\alpha B) is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix A+\alpha
B. In order to determine how the epidemic threshold is dependent upon the structure of interconnected
networks, we analytically derive {\lambda}1(A+\alpha B) using perturbation approximation for
small and large \alpha, the lower and upper bound for any \alpha as a function of the adjacency matrix
of the two individual networks, and the interconnections between the two and their largest eigenvalues/eigenvectors.
We verify these approximation and boundary values for {\lambda}1(A+\alpha B) using numerical
simulations, and determine how component network features affect {\lambda}1(A+\alpha B).
