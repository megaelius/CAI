Recent studies conclude that the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic decreased power sector
CO$_2$ emissions worldwide. We analyze the statistical significance of CO$_2$ emissions reductions
in the U.S power sector from March through July 2020 and we present model-informed expectations
of the likelihood of sustained reductions in CO$_2$ emissions. We use Gaussian process (GP) regression
to assess whether CO$_2$ emissions reductions would have occurred with reasonable probability
in the absence of COVID-19 considering uncertainty due to factors unrelated to the pandemic. We
show that CO$_2$ emissions are lower than levels expected in the absence of COVID-19 for each month
from March through July 2020 but that those monthly reductions are not statistically significant
considering hypothesis tests at 5% significance levels. To make predictions about whether COVID-19-related
CO$_2$ emissions reductions will be sustained in the power sector, we assess the relative impacts
of the pandemic on electricity generation (E) and on the carbon intensity of electricity supply
(C/E). E is on average 2.9\% lower than what we would expect in the absence of COVID-19 from March through
July 2020. We expect E to rebound alongside a recovery of the U.S. economy. C/E is determined to be
2.7% lower on average than what we would expect in the absence of COVID-19 from March through July
2020. Reductions in C/E are mostly attributable to reductions in the share of coal-fired electricity
generation. We analyze the expected profitability through 2021 of the 845 coal-fired power plant
units operating in the U.S. We find that only 76 of those units, representing 1.3% of total coal generation
capacity, were expected to be profitable prior to COVID-19 but are no longer expected to be profitable.
We conclude that COVID-19 is unlikely to have a material impact on U.S. power sector CO$_2$ emissions
in the long-run.
