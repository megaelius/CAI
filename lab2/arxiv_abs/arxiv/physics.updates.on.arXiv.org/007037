Animals and robots must right themselves after flipping over on the ground. The discoid cockroach
pushes its wings against the ground in an attempt to dynamically self-right by a somersault. However,
because this maneuver is strenuous, the animal often fails to overcome the potential energy barrier
and makes continual attempts. In this process, the animal flails its legs, whose lateral perturbation
eventually leads it to roll to the side to self-right. Our previous work developed a cockroach-inspired
robot capable of leg-assisted, winged self-righting, and a robot simulation study revealed that
the outcome of this strategy depends sensitively on wing-leg coordination (measured by the phase
between their motions). Here, we further elucidate why this is the case by developing a template
to model the complex hybrid dynamics resulting from discontinuous contact and actuation. We used
the template to calculate the potential energy barrier that the body must overcome to self-right,
mechanical energy contribution by wing pushing and leg flailing, and mechanical energy dissipation
due to wing-ground collision. The template revealed that wing-leg coordination (phase) strongly
affects self-righting outcome by changing mechanical energy budget. Well-coordinated appendage
motions (good phase) accumulate more mechanical energy than poorly-coordinated motions (bad
phase), thereby better overcoming the potential energy barrier to self-right more successfully.
Finally, we demonstrated practical use of the template for predicting a new control strategy to
further increase self-righting performance and informing robot design.
