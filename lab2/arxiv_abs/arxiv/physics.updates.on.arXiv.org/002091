This paper examines the scientific performance of South Africa since 1994 (post-apartheid) until
2014 in comparisons with the rest of the world, utilizing relative indicator. It provides a view
over current standing of South Africa in the scientific world as well as its temporal evolution after
the apartheid. This study focuses on four major aspects of scientific performance, namely quantity,
productivity, impact and quality, as the main attributes of scientific perfomance on national
level. These are measured by re-based (relative) publication, publication per population or GDP,
citations and citations per publication respectively. The study focuses on scientific outputs
(in the form of papers published in peer-reviewed journals) and their impact (measured by the citations
they have received) to bring into a light a homogeneous comprehension of South Africa's scientific
performance in all these four aspects. Indicators are adopted cautiously by considering the measures
put forward recently for scientometrics indicators and their usage in the long-term comparisons
studies. The temporal evolution of these indicators for South Africa are discussed in the context
of three major groups of countries, namely African countries, developing countries, and developed
(including BRICS) countries. It aims to examine the process of transition of South Africa from a
developing world economy system into a knowledge-based and innovation-driven one of the developed
world. The study reveals that South Africa has shown steady increase in its scientific performance
during the studied period when compared to the rest of the world. However, due to the increasing competition
from the other developing countries, South Africa's position stands the same during this period,
while countries such as China, Iran, Turkey and Malaysia have shown great jump at least in the quantity
of their scientific performance.
