Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline materials consisting of metal centers and organic
linkers forming open and porous structures. They have been extensively studied due to various possible
applications exploiting their large amount of internal surface area. Phonon properties of MOFs
are, however, still largely unexplored, despite their relevance for thermal and electrical conductivities,
thermal expansion, and mechanical properties. Here, we use quantum-mechanical simulations to
provide an in-depth analysis of the phonon properties of isoreticular MOFs. We consider phonon
band structures, spatial confinements of modes, projected densities of states, and group velocity
distributions. We find that more complex linkers shift the spectral weight of the phonon density
of states towards higher frequencies, while increasing the mass of the metal atoms in the nodes has
the opposite effect. Due to the high porosity of MOFs, we observe a particularly pronounced polarization
dependence of the dispersion of acoustic phonons with rather high group velocities for longitudinal
acoustic modes. Interestingly, also for several optical phonon modes group velocities amounting
to several thousand m/s are obtained. For heterogeneous systems like MOFs, correlating group velocities
and the displacement of modes is particularly relevant. Here we find that high group velocities
are generally associated with delocalized vibrations, while the inverse correlation does not
necessarily hold. To quantify anharmonicities, we calculate mode Gr\"uneisen parameters, which
we find to be significant only for phonons with frequencies below ~3 THz. The presented results provide
the foundations for an in-depth understanding of the vibrational properties of MOF, and, thus,
pave the way for a future rational design of systems with well-defined phonon properties.
