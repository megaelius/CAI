The inertialess fluid-structure interactions of active and passive inextensible filaments and
slender- rods are ubiquitous in nature, from the dynamics of semi-flexible polymers and cytoskeletal
filaments to cellular mechanics and flagella. The coupling between the geometry of deformation
and the phys- ical interaction governing the dynamics of bio-filaments is complex. Governing equations
negotiate elastohydrodynamical interactions with non-holonomic constraints arising from the
filament inex- tensibility. Such elastohydrodynamic systems are structurally convoluted, prone
to numerical erros, thus requiring penalization methods and high-order spatiotemporal propagators.
The asymptotic coarse-graining formulation presented here exploits the momentum balance in the
asymptotic limit of small rod-like elements which are integrated semi-analytically. This greatly
simplifies the elas- tohydrodynamic interactions and overcomes previous numerical instability.
The resulting matricial system is straightforward and intuitive to implement, and allows for a
fast and efficient computation, over than a hundred times faster than previous schemes. Only basic
knowledge of systems of linear equations is required, and implementation achieved with any solver
of choice. Generalisations for complex interaction of multiple rods, Brownian polymer dynamics,
active filaments and non-local hydrodynamics are also straightforward. We demonstrate these
in four examples commonly found in biological systems, including the dynamics of filaments and
flagella. Three of these systems are novel in the literature. We additionally provide a Matlab code
that can be used as a basis for further generalisations.
