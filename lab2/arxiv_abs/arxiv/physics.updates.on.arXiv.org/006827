Biological invasion, whereby populations of motile and proliferative individuals lead to moving
fronts that invade into vacant regions, are routinely studied using partial differential equation
(PDE) models based upon the classical Fisher--KPP model. While the Fisher--KPP model and extensions
have been successfully used to model a range of invasive phenomena, including ecological and cellular
invasion, an often--overlooked limitation of the Fisher--KPP model is that it cannot be used to
model biological recession where the spatial extent of the population decreases with time. In this
work we study the \textit{Fisher--Stefan} model, which is a generalisation of the Fisher--KPP
model obtained by reformulating the Fisher--KPP model as a moving boundary problem. The nondimensional
Fisher--Stefan model involves just one single parameter, $\kappa$, which relates the shape of
the density front at the moving boundary to the speed of the associated travelling wave, $c$. Using
numerical simulation, phase plane and perturbation analysis, we construct approximate solutions
of the Fisher--Stefan model for both slowly invading and slowly receding travelling waves, as well
as for rapidly receding travelling waves. These approximations allow us to determine the relationship
between $c$ and $\kappa$ so that commonly--reported experimental estimates of $c$ can be used to
provide estimates of the unknown parameter $\kappa$. Interestingly, when we reinterpret the Fisher--KPP
model as a moving boundary problem, many disregarded features of the classical Fisher--KPP phase
plane take on a new interpretation since travelling waves solutions with $c < 2$ are not normally
considered. This means that our analysis of the Fisher--Stefan model has both practical value and
an inherent mathematical value.
