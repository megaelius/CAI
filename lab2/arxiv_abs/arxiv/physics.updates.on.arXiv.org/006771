Convective flows coupled with solidification or melting in water bodies play a major role in shaping
geophysical landscapes. Particularly in relation to the global climate warming scenario, it is
essential to be able to accurately quantify how water-body environments dynamically interplay
with ice formation or melting process. Previous studies have revealed the complex nature of icing
process, but have often ignored one of the most remarkable particularity of water, its density anomaly,
and the induced stratification layers, interacting and coupled in a complex way in presence of turbulence
and phase change. By combining experiments, numerical simulations and theoretical model, we investigate
solidification of fresh water, properly considering phase transition, water density anomaly,
and real physical properties of ice and water phases, which we show to be essential for correctly
predicting the different qualitative and quantitative behaviors. We identify, with increasing
thermal driving, four distinct flow-dynamics regimes, where different levels of coupling among
ice front, stably and unstably stratified water layers occur. Despite the complex interaction
between the ice front and fluid motions, remarkably, the average ice thickness and growth rate can
be well captured with the theoretical model. It is revealed that the thermal driving has major effects
on the temporal evolution of the global icing process, which can vary from a few days to a few hours
in the current parameter regime. Our model can be extended towards general situations where icing
dynamics may also be influenced by factors like, e.g., undercooling conditions or water layer depth.
