We report a detailed experimental characterization of the periodic bubbling regimes that take
place in an axisymmetric air-water jet when the inner air stream is forced by periodic modulations
of the pressure at the upstream air feeding chamber. When the forcing pressure amplitude is larger
than a certain critical value, the bubble formation process is effectively driven by the selected
frequency, leading to the formation of nearly monodisperse bubbles whose volume is reduced by increasing
the forcing frequency. We reveal the existence of two different breakup modes, M1 and M2, under effective
forcing conditions. The bubble formation in mode M1 resembles the natural bubbling process, featuring
an initial radial expansion of an air ligament attached to the injector, whose initial length is
smaller than the wavelength of a small interfacial perturbation induced by the oscillating air
flow rate. The expansion stage is followed by a ligament collapse stage, which begins with the formation
of an incipient neck that propagates downstream while collapsing radially inwards, leading to
the pinch-off of a new bubble. These two stages take place faster than in the unforced case as a consequence
of the the air flow modulation induced by the forcing system. The breakup mode M2 takes place with
an intact ligament longer than one disturbance wavelength, whereby the interface already presents
a local necking region at pinch-off, and leads to the formation of bubbles from the tip of an elongated
air filament without an expansion stage. Scaling laws that provide closed expressions for the bubble
volume, the intact ligament length, and the transition from the M1 breakup mode to the M2, as functions
of the relevant governing parameters, are deduced from the experimental data.
