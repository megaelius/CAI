Particle-laden flows in helical channels are of interest for their applications in spiral particle
separators used in the mining and mineral processing industries. In this paper, we extend the previous
work of Lee, Stokes, Bertozzi (2013) by studying thin-film flows of mono-disperse particle-laden
fluid in helically-wound channels of arbitrary centreline curvature and torsion, and arbitrary
cross-sectional shape. In the case where the particles are uniformly distributed through the depth
of the film, significant analytic progress can be made: the governing equations reduce to a single
nonlinear ordinary differential equation, which is readily integrated numerically to obtain
the solution subject to appropriate boundary conditions. Motivated by possible application to
the design of spiral separators, we consider the effects of changing the channel centreline geometry,
the cross-sectional shape and the particle density on the resulting flows and the radial distribution
of particles. Our results support the findings in Arnold, Stokes, Green (2016) regarding the effect
of channel centreline geometry and cross-sectional shape on flows in particle-free regions. In
particle-rich regions, similar effects are seen, although the primary velocity is lower due to
increased effective mixture viscosity. \ys{Of key interest, is the effect of channel geometry
on the focusing of the particles, for given fluxes of fluid and particles. We find that introducing
a trench into the channel cross-section, a feature often used in commercial spiral particle separators,
leads to smaller radial width of the particle-rich region, i.e. sharper focusing of the particles,
which is consistent with experiments showing that channel geometry influences particle separation
in a spiral separator.
