In this article, we propose a novel conservative diffuse-interface method for the simulation of
compressible two-phase flows. The proposed method discretely conserves the mass of each phase,
momentum and total energy of the system. We use the baseline five-equation model and propose interface-regularization
(diffusion-sharpening) terms in such a way that the resulting model (a) maintains the conservative
property of the underlying baseline model, (b) lets us use a central-difference scheme for the discretization
of all the operators in the model, which leads to a non-dissipative implementation that is crucial
for the simulation of turbulent flows and acoustics. Furthermore, the provable strengths of the
proposed model are: (a) the model maintains the boundedness property of the volume fraction field,
which is a physical realizability requirement for the simulation of two-phase flows, (b) the proposed
model is such that the transport of volume fraction field inherently satisfies the total-variation-diminishing
property without having to add any flux limiters that destroys the non-dissipative nature of the
scheme, (c) the proposed interface-regularization terms in the model do not spuriously contribute
to the kinetic energy of the system and therefore does not affect the non-linear stability of the
numerical simulation, (d) the model is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. Finally,
we present numerical simulations using the model and assess (a) the accuracy of evolution of the
interface shape, (b) implementation of surface tension effects, (c) propagation of acoustics
and their interaction with material interfaces, (d) the accuracy and robustness of the numerical
scheme for simulation of complex high Reynolds number flows, and (e) performance and scalability
of the method.
