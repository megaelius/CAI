Scientists of many countries in which English is not the primary language routinely use a variety
of manuscript preparation, correction or editing services, a practice that is openly endorsed
by many journals and scientific institutions. These services vary tremendously in their scope;
at one end there is simple proof-reading, and at the other extreme there is in-depth and extensive
peer-reviewing, proposal preparation, statistical analyses, re-writing and co-writing. In
this paper, the various types of service are reviewed, along with authorship guidelines, and the
question is raised of whether the high-end services surpass most guidelines' criteria for authorship.
Three other factors are considered. First, the ease of collaboration possible in the internet era
allows multiple iterations between authors and the editing service, so essentially, papers can
be co-written. Second, 'editing services' often offer subject-specific experts who comment not
only on the language, but interpret and improve scientific content. Third, the trend towards heavily
multi-authored papers implies that the threshold necessary to earn authorship is declining. The
inevitable conclusion is that at some point the contributions by 'editing services' should be deemed
sufficient to warrant authorship. Trying to enforce any guidelines would likely be futile, but
nevertheless, it might be time to revisit the ethics of using some of the high-end 'editing services'.
In an increasingly international job market, recognizing this problem might prove progressively
more important in authorship disputes, the allocation of research grants, and hiring decisions
