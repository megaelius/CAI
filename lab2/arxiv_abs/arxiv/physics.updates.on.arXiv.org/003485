Metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) are regarded as good candidates for many technological applications,
where their functional environment is often an aqueous solution. The correct description of metal
oxide electronic structure is still a challenge for local and semilocal density functionals, whereas
hybrid functional methods provide an improved description, and local atomic function based codes
such as CRYSTAL17 outperform plane wave codes when it comes to hybrid functional calculations.
However, the computational cost of hybrids are still prohibitive for systems of real sizes, in a
real environment. Therefore, we here present and critically assess the accuracy of our electrostatic
embedding quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) coupling between CRYSTAL17 and AMBER16,
and demonstrate some of its capabilities via the case study of TiO2 NPs in water. First, we produced
new Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters that improve the accuracy of water-water interactions in the
B3LYP/TIP3P coupling. Then, we applied our QM/MM coupling methodology to describe the interaction
of a 1 nm wide multilayer of water surrounding a spherical TiO2 nanoparticle (NP). Optimizing the
QM/MM water water parameters was found to have little to no effect on the local NP properties, which
provide insights into the range of influence that can be attributed to the LJ term in the QM/MM coupling.
The effect of adding additional water in an MM fashion on the geometry optimized nanoparticle structure
is small, but more evident effects are seen in its electronic properties. We also show that there
is good transferability of existing QM/MM LJ parameters for organic molecules water interactions
to our QM/MM implementation, even though these parameters were obtained with a different QM code
and QM/MM implementation, but with the same functional.
