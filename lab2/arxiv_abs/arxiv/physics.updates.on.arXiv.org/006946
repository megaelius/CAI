Credibility building activities in computational research include verification and validation,
reproducibility and replication, and uncertainty quantification. Though orthogonal to each
other, they are related. This paper presents validation and replication studies in electromagnetic
excitations on nanoscale structures, where the quantity of interest is the wavelength at which
resonance peaks occur. The study uses the open-source software PyGBe: a boundary element solver
with trecode acceleration and GPU capability. We replicate a result by Rockstuhl et al. (2005, doi:10/dsxw9d)
with a two-dimensional boundary element method on silicon carbide particles, despite differences
in our method. The second replication case from Ellis et al. (2016, doi:10/f83zcb) looks at aspect
ratio effects on high-order modes of localized surface phonon-polariton nanostructures. The
results partially replicate: the wavenumber position of some mode match, but for other modes they
differ. With virtually no information about the original simulations, explaining the discrepancies
is not possible. A comparison with experiments that measured polarized reflectance of silicon
carbide nano pillars provides a validation case. The wavenumber of the dominant mode and two more
do match, but differences remain in other minor modes. Results in this paper were produced with strict
reproducibility practices, and we share reproducibility packages for all, including input files,
execution scripts, secondary data, post-processing code and plotting scripts, and the figures
(deposited in Zenodo). In view of the many challenges faced, we propose that reproducible practices
make replication and validation more feasible.
