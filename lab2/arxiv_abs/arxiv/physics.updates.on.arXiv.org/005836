Physicists usually understand that physics cannot (and should not) derive that $c\approx 3\cdot
10^8m/s$ and $\hbar \approx 1.054\cdot 10^{-34}kg\cdot m^2/s$. At the same time they usually believe
that physics should derive the value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and that the solution
of the dark energy problem depends on this value. However, background space in General Relativity
(GR) is only a classical notion while on quantum level symmetry is defined by a Lie algebra of basic
operators. We prove that the theory based on Poincare Lie algebra is a special degenerate case of
the theories based on de Sitter (dS) or anti-de Sitter (AdS) Lie algebras in the formal limit $R\to\infty$
where R is the parameter of contraction from the latter algebras to the former one, and $R$ has nothing
to do with the radius of background space. As a consequence, $R$ is necessarily finite, is fundamental
to the same extent as $c$ and $\hbar$, and a question why $R$ is as is does not arise. Following our previous
publications, we consider a system of two free bodies in dS quantum mechanics and show that in semiclassical
approximation the cosmological dS acceleration is necessarily nonzero and is the same as in GR if
the radius of dS space equals $R$ and $\Lambda=3/R^2$. This result follows from basic principles
of quantum theory. It has nothing to do with existence or nonexistence of dark energy and therefore
for explaining cosmological acceleration dark energy is not needed. The result is obtained without
using the notion of dS background space (in particular, its metric and connection) but simply as
a consequence of quantum mechanics based on the dS Lie algebra. Therefore, $\Lambda$ has a physical
meaning only on classical level and the cosmological constant problem and the dark energy problem
do not arise.
