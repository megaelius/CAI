The anomalous properties of ambient water at normal pressure and temperatures from 0 C to 100 C are
mainly due to the physics of hydrogen bonds in supramolecular structures (SMS). Lifetime, composition,
and degree of ordering of SMS are temperature dependent and this affects temperature dependences
(TDs) of all water characteristics. To clarify the nature of movements responsible for SMS restructuring,
we used activation energies (EA) of known TDs 13 characteristics of water and 10 parameters of its
microstructure. The bimodality of thermodynamics of water was taken into account, dividing EA
into two components - thermal (ET) and conformational (ER). Values of EA, ER and ET were determined
using Arrhenius approximations, and thermal component TDs was represented by function T\b{eta}.
A physically adequate choice of \b{eta} values ensured accuracy of approximations. It was found
that EA for dynamic characteristics is comparable to hydrogen bond energy and an order of magnitude
greater than ET. For static characteristics of water ER = ET at extreme points. The values of EA macro
characteristics and corresponding parameters of microstructure of water are qualitatively correlated
with each other. Based on these data, the extremums TDs of density, isobaric heat capacity, and kinks
of dynamic characteristics TDs at 25 C, were associated with transformation and decay of ice-like
hexagonal clusters in SMS. Extremums TDs of compressibility and sound velocity were explained
by the reaction of the molecular dynamics of water to action of anisotropic external factor. Spontaneous
polarization of Drude oscillators at extreme points of TDs static characteristics was used as the
basis for the long-range mechanism in SMS phase transitions. For role of order parameter that triggers
this process, frequency of oscillations of O-H bond was proposed.
