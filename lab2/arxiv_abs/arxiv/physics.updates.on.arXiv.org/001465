Polar precipitation archived in ice caps contains information on past temperature conditions.
Such information can be retrieved by measuring the water isotopic signals of $\delta{}^{18}\mathrm{O}$
and $\delta\mathrm{D}$ in ice cores. These signals have been attenuated during densification
due to molecular diffusion in the firn column, where the magnitude of the diffusion is isotopologoue
specific and temperature dependent. By utilizing the differential diffusion signal, dual isotope
measurements of $\delta{}^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and $\delta\mathrm{D}$ enable multiple temperature
reconstruction techniques. This study assesses how well six different methods can be used to reconstruct
past surface temperatures from the diffusion-based temperature proxies. Two of the methods are
based on the single diffusion lengths of $\delta{}^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and $\delta\mathrm{D}$,
three of the methods employ the differential diffusion signal, while the last uses the ratio between
the single diffusion lengths. All techniques are tested on synthetic data in order to evaluate their
accuracy and precision. We perform a benchmark test to thirteen high resolution Holocene data sets
from Greenland and Antarctica, which represent a broad range of mean annual surface temperatures
and accumulation rates. Based on the benchmark test, we comment on the accuracy and precision of
the methods. Both the benchmark test and the synthetic data test demonstrate that the most precise
reconstructions are obtained when using the single isotope diffusion lengths, with precisions
of approximately $1.0\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$. In the benchmark test, the single isotope diffusion
lengths are also found to reconstruct consistent temperatures with a root-mean-square-deviation
of $0.7\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$.
