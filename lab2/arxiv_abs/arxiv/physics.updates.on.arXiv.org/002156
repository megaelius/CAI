The increased attention to energy savings has contributed to more widespread use of energy recovery
systems for building ventilation. We investigate the efficiency of such systems under different
outdoor conditions using exergy analysis and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. This analysis makes
it possible to assess performance in terms of loss of work potential, to account for the different
quality of energy and to localize and compare the different sources of loss in the system. It also
enables the use of exergy efficiency as a single performance parameter, in contrast to the several
indicators that are commonly used. These more common indicators are difficult to compare and relate
to each other. Further, since there is no obvious optimal trade-off between them, it is challenging
to combine them and develop a global performance indicator that allows for a sensible comparison
of different technical solutions and different types of recovery devices. We illustrate the concepts
by applying the analysis to a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) and to a structurally similar membrane
energy recovery ventilator (MERV) that can exchange both heat and moisture. We show how the exergy
efficiency can be used to identify the range of operating conditions for which the recovery ventilator
is not beneficial as the energy cost is greater than the energy recovery. This is not trivial using
traditional performance parameters, yet it is a natural outcome of exergy analysis. In addition,
we identify the mechanism by which work potential is lost, which can help the eventual optimization
of both the recovery process and the auxiliary systems present in ventilation systems.
