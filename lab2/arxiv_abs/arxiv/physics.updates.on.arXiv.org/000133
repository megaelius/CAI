Protein rigidity and flexibility can be analyzed accurately and efficiently using the program
FIRST. Previous studies using FIRST were designed to analyze the rigidity and flexibility of proteins
using a single static (snapshot) structure. It is however well known that proteins can undergo spontaneous
sub-molecular unfolding and refolding, or conformational dynamics, even under conditions that
strongly favour a well-defined native structure. These (local) unfolding events result in a large
number of conformers that differ from each other very slightly. In this context, proteins are better
represented as a thermodynamic ensemble of `native-like' structures, and not just as a single static
low-energy structure. Working with this notion, we introduce a novel FIRST-based approach for
predicting rigidity/flexibility of the protein ensemble by (i) averaging the hydrogen bonding
strengths from the entire ensemble and (ii) by refining the mathematical model of hydrogen bonds.
Furthermore, we combine our FIRST-ensemble rigidity predictions with the ensemble solvent accessibility
data of the backbone amides and propose a novel computational method which uses both rigidity and
solvent accessibility for predicting hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). To validate our predictions,
we report a novel site specific HDX experiment which characterizes the native structural ensemble
of Acylphosphatase from hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso AcP). The sub-structural
conformational dynamics that is observed by HDX data, is closely matched with the FIRST-ensemble
rigidity predictions, which could not be attained using the traditional single `snapshot' rigidity
analysis. Moreover, the computational predictions of regions that are protected from HDX and those
that undergo exchange are in very good agreement with the experimental HDX profile of Sso AcP.
