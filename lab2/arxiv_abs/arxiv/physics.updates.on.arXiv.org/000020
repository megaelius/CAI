The apparatus of the ALICE experiment at CERN will be upgraded in 2017/18 during the second long shutdown
of the LHC (LS2). A major motivation for this upgrade is to extend the physics reach for charmed and
beauty particles down to low transverse momenta. This requires a substantial improvement of the
spatial resolution and the data rate capability of the ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS). To achieve
this goal, the new ITS will be equipped with 50 um thin CMOS Pixel Sensors (CPS) covering either the
3 innermost layers or all the 7 layers of the detector. The CPS being developed for the ITS upgrade
at IPHC (Strasbourg) is derived from the MIMOSA 28 sensor realised for the STAR-PXL at RHIC in a 0.35
um CMOS process. In order to satisfy the ITS upgrade requirements in terms of readout speed and radiation
tolerance, a CMOS process with a reduced feature size and a high resistivity epitaxial layer should
be exploited. In this respect, the charged particle detection performance and radiation hardness
of the TowerJazz 0.18 um CMOS process were studied with the help of the first prototype chip MIMOSA
32. The beam tests performed with negative pions of 120 GeV/c at the CERN-SPS allowed to measure a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the non-irradiated chip in the range between 22 and 32 depending
on the pixel design. The chip irradiated with the combined dose of 1 MRad and 10^13 n_eq/cm^2 was observed
to yield a SNR ranging between 11 and 23 for coolant temperatures varying from 15 C to 30 C. These SNR
values were measured to result in particle detection efficiencies above 99.5% and 98% before and
after irradiation respectively. These satisfactory results allow to validate the TowerJazz 0.18
um CMOS process for the ALICE ITS upgrade.
