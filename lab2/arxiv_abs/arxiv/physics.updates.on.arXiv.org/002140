We analyze two alterations of the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics
that preserve the central properties of spontaneous healing and infection capacity of a vertex
increasing unlimitedly with its degree. All models have the same epidemic thresholds in mean-field
theories but depending on the network properties, simulations yield a dual scenario, in which the
epidemic thresholds of the modified SIS models can be either dramatically altered or remain unchanged
in comparison with the standard dynamics. For uncorrelated synthetic networks having a power-law
degree distribution with exponent $\gamma<5/2$, the SIS dynamics are robust exhibiting essentially
the same outcomes for all investigated models. A threshold in better agreement with the heterogeneous
rather than quenched mean-field theory is observed in the modified dynamics for exponent $\gamma>5/2$.
Differences are more remarkable for $\gamma>3$ where a finite threshold is found in the modified
models in contrast with the vanishing threshold of the original one. This duality is elucidated
in terms of epidemic lifespan on star graphs. We verify that the activation of the modified SIS models
is triggered in the innermost component of the network given by a $k$-core decomposition for $\gamma<3$
while it happens only for $\gamma<5/2$ in the standard model. For $\gamma>3$, the activation in
the modified dynamics is collective involving essentially the whole network while it is triggered
by hubs in the standard SIS. The duality also appears in the finite-size scaling of the critical quantities
where mean-field behaviors are observed for the modified, but not for the original dynamics. Our
results feed the discussions about the most proper conceptions of epidemic models to describe real
systems and the choices of the most suitable theoretical approaches to deal with these models.
