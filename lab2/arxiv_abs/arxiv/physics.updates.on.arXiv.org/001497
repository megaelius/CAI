Finding life on other worlds is a fascinating area of astrobiology and planetary sciences. Presently,
over 3500 exoplanets, representing a very wide range of physical and chemical environments, are
known. Tardigrades (water bears) are microscopic invertebrates that inhabit almost all terrestrial,
freshwater and marine habitats, from the highest mountains to the deepest oceans. Thanks to their
ability to live in a state of cryptobiosis, which is known to be an adaptation to unpredictably fluctuating
environmental conditions, these organisms are able to survive when conditions are not suitable
for active life; consequently, tardigrades are known as the toughest animals on Earth. In their
cryptobiotic state, they can survive extreme conditions, such as temperatures below -250{\deg}C
and up to 150{\deg}C, high doses of ultraviolet and ionising radiation, up to 30 years without liquid
water, low and high atmospheric pressure, and exposure to many toxic chemicals. Active tardigrades
are also resistant to a wide range of unfavourable environmental conditions, which makes them an
excellent model organism for astrobiological studies. In our study, we have established a metric
tool for distinguishing the potential survivability of active and cryptobiotic tardigrades on
rocky-water and water-gas planets in our solar system and exoplanets, taking into consideration
the geometrical means of surface temperature and surface pressure of the considered planets. The
Active Tardigrade Index (ATI) and Cryobiotic Tardigrade Index (CTI) are two metric indices with
minimum value 0 (= tardigrades cannot survive) and maximum 1 (= tardigrades will survive in their
respective state). Values between 0 and 1 indicate a percentage chance of the active or cryptobiotic
tardigrades surviving on a given exoplanet.
