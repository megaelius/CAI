Resonant electron interaction with whistler-mode chorus waves is recognized as one of the main
drivers of radiation belt dynamics. For moderate wave intensity, this interaction is well described
by quasi-linear theory. However, recent statistics of parallel propagating chorus waves have
demonstrated that 5-20% of the observed waves are sufficiently intense to interact nonlinearly
with electrons. Such interactions include phase trapping and phase bunching (nonlinear scattering)
effects not described by the quasi-linear diffusion. For sufficiently long (large) wave-packets,
these nonlinear effects can result in very rapid electron acceleration and scattering. In this
paper we introduce a method to include trapping and nonlinear scattering into the kinetic equation
describing the evolution of the electron distribution function. We use statistics of Van Allen
Probes and Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) observations
to determine the probability distribution of intense, long wave-packets as function of power and
frequency. Then we develop an analytical model of particle resonance of an individual particle
with an intense chorus wave-packet and derive the main properties of this interaction: probability
of electron trapping, energy change due to trapping and nonlinear scattering. These properties
are combined in a nonlocal operator acting on the electron distribution function. When multiple
waves are present, we average the obtained operator over the observed distributions of waves and
examine solutions of the resultant kinetic equation. We also examine energy conservation and its
implications in systems with the nonlinear wave-particle interaction.
