During the 1920s and 1930s strong relationships established between Italy and other European countries
such as Germany, Great Britain and France, as well as with some physicists of the U.S. scientific
community. Bruno Rossi, a leading personality in the study of cosmic rays and the pioneer of this
research field in Italy since the early 1930s, is a prominent example in this sense. During those
turbulent years in European history, when physics underwent major changes and the traditional
internationalism of physics assumed a more institutionalised character, his early work was crucial
in transforming the field in a branch of modern physics. His friendly relationship with eminent
scientists -notably Enrico Fermi, Walther Bothe, Werner Heisenberg, Hans Bethe, Homi Bhabha-
was instrumental for the exchange of knowledge about experimental practises and for theoretical
discussions, as well as in attracting the attention of physicists such as Arthur Compton, Louis
Leprince-Ringuet, Pierre Auger and Patrick Blackett on the problem of cosmic rays. Relying on material
coming from different archives in Europe and United States, this case study is aiming at providing
a glimpse on the intersection between national and international dimensions during the 1930s,
at a time when the study of cosmic-rays was still very much in its infancy, strongly interlaced with
nuclear physics, and full of uncertain, contradictory and puzzling results. Nevertheless, as
a source of high-energy particles it became a proving ground for testing the validity of the laws
of quantum electrodynamics and gave a fundamental contribution to the first steps of particle physics.
