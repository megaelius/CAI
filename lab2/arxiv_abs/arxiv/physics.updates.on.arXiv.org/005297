Background: One of the common causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young people is hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the primary prevention of SCD is with an implantable cardioverter defibrillators
(ICD). Concerning the incidence of appropriate ICD therapy and the complications associated with
ICD implantation and discharge, patients with implanted ICDs are closely monitored and interrogation
reports are generated from clinical consultations. Methods: In this study, we compared the performance
of structured device data and unstructured interrogation reports for extracting information
of ICD therapy and heart rhythm. We sampled 687 reports with a gold standard generated through manual
chart review. A rule-based natural language processing (NLP) system was developed using 480 reports
and the information in the corresponding device data was aggregated for the task. We compared the
performance of the NLP system with information aggregated from structured device data using the
remaining 207 reports. Results: The rule-based NLP system achieved F-measure of 0.92 and 0.98 for
ICD therapy and heart rhythm while the performance of aggregating device data was significantly
lower with F-measure of 0.78 and 0.45 respectively. Limitations of using only structured device
data include no differentiation of real events from management events, data availability, and
disparate perspectives of vendor and data granularity while using interrogation reports needs
to overcome non-representative keyword/pattern and contextual errors. Conclusions: Extracting
phenotyping information from data generated in real-world requires the incorporation of medical
knowledge. It is essential to analyze, compare, and harmonize multiple data sources for real-world
evidence generation.
