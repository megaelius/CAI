We study numerically the properties of (statistically) homogeneous soliton gas depending on soliton
density (proportional to number of solitons per unit length) and soliton velocities, in the framework
of the focusing one-dimensional Nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger (NLS) equation. In order to model such
soliton gas we use N-soliton solutions (N-SS) with $N\sim 100$, which we generate with specific
implementation of the dressing method combined with 100-digits arithmetics. We examine the major
statistical characteristics, in particular the kinetic and potential energies, the kurtosis
and the probability density function (PDF) of wave intensity. We show that in the case of small soliton
density the kinetic and potential energies, as well as the kurtosis, are very well described by the
analytical relations derived without taking into account soliton interactions. With increasing
soliton density and velocities, soliton interactions enhance, and we observe increasing deviations
from these relations leading to increased absolute values for all of these three characteristics.
For rarefied soliton gas, the PDF of wave intensity deviates from the exponential (Rayleigh) PDF
drastically, transforming much closer to it at densities corresponding to essential interaction
between the solitons. Rogue waves emerging in soliton gas are multi-soliton collisions, and yet
some of them have spatial profiles very similar to those of the Peregrine solutions of different
orders. We present example of three-soliton collision, for which even the temporal behavior of
the maximal amplitude is well-approximated by the Peregrine solution of the second order.
