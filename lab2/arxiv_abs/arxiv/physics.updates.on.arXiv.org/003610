We study the error scaling properties of large-eddy simulation (LES) in the outer region of wall-bounded
turbulence at moderately high Reynolds numbers. In order to avoid the additional complexity of
wall-modeling, we perform LES of turbulent channel flows in which the no-slip condition at the wall
is replaced by a Neumann condition supplying the exact mean wall-stress. The statistics investigated
are the mean velocity profile, turbulence intensities, and kinetic energy spectra. The errors
follow $(\Delta/L)^{\alpha}Re_\tau^{\gamma}$, where $\Delta$ is the characteristic grid resolution,
$Re_\tau$ is the friction Reynolds number, and $L$ is the meaningful length-scale to normalize
$\Delta$ in order to collapse the errors across the wall-normal distance. We show that $\Delta$
can be expressed as the $L_2$-norm of the grid vector and that $L$ is well represented by the ratio
of the friction velocity and mean shear. The exponent $\alpha$ is estimated from theoretical arguments
for each statistical quantity of interest and shown to roughly match the values computed by numerical
simulations. For the mean profile and kinetic energy spectra, $\alpha\approx1$, whereas the turbulence
intensities converge at a slower rate $\alpha<1$. The exponent $\gamma$ is approximately $0$,
i.e. the LES solution is independent of the Reynolds number. The expected behavior of the turbulence
intensities at high Reynolds numbers is also derived and shown to agree with the classic log-layer
profiles for grid resolutions lying within the inertial range. Further examination of the LES turbulence
intensities and spectra reveals that both quantities resemble their filtered counterparts from
direct numerical simulation (DNS) data, but that the mechanism responsible for this similarity
is related to the balance between the input power and dissipation rather than to filtering.
