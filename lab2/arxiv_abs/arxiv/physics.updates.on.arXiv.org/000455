Recovery of society after a large scale disaster generally consists of two phases, short- and long-term
recoveries. The main goal of the short-term recovery is to bounce the damaged system back to the operating
standards enabling residents in damaged cities to survive, and fast supply with vital resources
to them is one of its important elements. We propose a general principle by which the required redistribution
of vital resources between the affected and neighbouring cities can be efficiently implemented.
The short-term recovery is a rescuer operation where uncertainty in evaluating the state of damaged
region is highly probable. To allow for such an operation the developed principle involves two basic
components. The first one of ethic nature is the triage concept determining the current city priority
in the resource delivery. The second one is the minimization of the delivery time subjected to this
priority. Finally a certain plan of the resource redistribution is generated according to this
principle. Several specific examples are studied numerically. It elucidates, in particular,
the effects of system characteristics such as the city limit capacity in resource delivery, the
type of initial resource allocation among the cities, the number of cities able to participate in
the resource redistribution, and the damage level in the affected cities. As far as the uncertainty
in evaluating the state of damaged region is concerned, some specific cases were studied. It assumes
the initial communication system has crashed and formation of a new one and the resource redistribution
proceed synchronously. The obtained results enable us to consider the resource redistribution
plan governed by the proposed method semi-optimal and rather efficient especially under uncertainty.
