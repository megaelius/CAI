A promising method for obtaining ceramic components with additive manufacturing (AM) is to use
a two-step process of first printing the artifact in polymer and then converting it to ceramic using
pyrolysis to form polymer derived ceramics (PDCs). AM of ceramic components using PDCs has been
demonstrated with a number of high-cost techniques, but data is lacking for fused filament fabrication
(FFF)-based 3-D printing. This study investigates the potential to use the lower-cost, more widespread
and accessible FFF-based 3-D printing of PDCs. Low-cost FFF machines have a resolution limit set
by the nozzle width, which is inferior to the resolutions obtained with expensive SLA or SLS AM systems.
To match the performance a partial PDC conversion is used here, where only the outer surface of the
printed polymer frame is converted to ceramic. Here the FFF-based 3-D printed sample is coated with
a preceramic polymer and then it is converted into the corresponding PDC sample with a high temperature
pyrolysis process. A screening experiment is performed on commercial filaments to obtain ceramic
3-D prints by surface coating both hard thermoplastics: poly lactic acid (PLA), polycarbonate
(PC), nylon alloys, polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), and co-polyesters; and flexible materials including: flexible PLA, thermoplastic
elastomer and thermoplastic polyurethane filaments. Mass and volume changes were quantified
for the soaking and pyrolysis steps to form a hollow ceramic skin. All 3-D printing materials extruded
at 250 microns successfully produced ceramics skins of less than 100 microns. Details on the advantages
and disadvantages of the different 3-D printing polymer precursors are discussed for this processing
regime. The results are analyzed and discussed in order to provide guidance for more widespread
application of AM of PDCs.
