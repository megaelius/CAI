Cases have shown that WENO schemes usually behave robustly on problems containing shocks with high
pressure ratios when uniformed or smooth grids are present, while nonlinear schemes based on WENO
interpolations might relatively be liable to numerical instability. In the meanwhile, the latter
have manifested their advantages in computations on grids of bad quality, because the free-stream
preservation is easily realized there, and what is more flux-splitting schemes with low dissipations
can be engaged inherently as well. Targeting at above dissatisfactions, a method by hybridizing
WENO implementations of interpolation and reconstruction-wise operation for upwind-biased
schemes with flux splitting employed is proposed and corresponding third-, fifth- and seventh-order
upwind-biased schemes are proposed. Based on the understandings of [Q. Li, et al. Commun. Comput.
Phys. 22 (2017) 64-94], the free-stream preservation of proposed schemes is achieved with incorporation
of frozen grid metrics in WENO reconstructions-wise operations on split fluxes. In proposed schemes,
flux-splitting schemes with low dissipation can also be applied for the flux on a cell edge. As a byproduct,
an implementation of WENO scheme with free-stream preservation is obtained. Numerical examples
are provided as following with the third- and fifth-order schemes being tested. In tests of free-stream
preservation, the property is achieved as expected (including two implementations of WENO). The
computation of 1-D Sod problem shows the capability of proposed schemes on solving ordinary shock
discontinuity. 2-D vortex preservation and double Mach reflection are tested on uniformed and
randomized grids. The accomplishment by proposed schemes manifests their capability and robustness
on solving problems under rigorous circumstances.
