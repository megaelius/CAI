Radio-frequency (RF) contacts-which are an example of electrical contacts-are commonly employed
on accelerators and nuclear fusion experimental devices. RF contacts with a current load of 2 kA
for steady-state operation were designed for application to the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER) device. In contrast to the typical working conditions of general commercial
electrical contacts, those of RF contacts employed on fusion devices include high vacuum, high
temperature, and neutron radiation. CuCrZr is currently of interest as a base material for the manufacture
of louvers of RF contacts, which has excellent thermal and electrical properties and has low creep
rate at 250 {\textdegree}C. In this study, a hard Au coating (Au-Ni) was electroplated on CuCrZr
samples and the samples were then subjected to thermal aging treatment at 250 {\textdegree}C for
500 h in order to simulate the vacuum-commissioning process of the ITER. The effects of thermal aging
on the hardness, elastic modulus, crystallite size, and compositions of the coating were investigated
via microstructural and mechanical characterizations of the coating material. Metal atom migration
in different coating layers during thermal aging was characterized and evaluated via scanning
electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy observations of the cross-sectional
surfaces, and the obtained results could be used to directly select the coating thickness for the
final RF contact component. The contact resistance-an important parameter of the RF contact-was
measured in a dedicated testbed built to simulate fusion reactor conditions between CuCrZr pins
and stainless steel plates coated with Au-Ni and Rh, respectively.
