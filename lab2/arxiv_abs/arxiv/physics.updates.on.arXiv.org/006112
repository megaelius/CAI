Research into the processes of photoionised nebulae plays a significant part in our understanding
of stellar evolution. It is extremely difficult to visually represent or model ionised nebula,
requiring astronomers to employ sophisticated modelling code to derive temperature, density
and chemical composition. Existing codes are available that often require steep learning curves
and produce models derived from mathematical functions. In this article we will introduce PyCross:
PyCloudy Rendering Of Shape Software. This is a pseudo 3D modelling application that generates
photoionisation models of optically thin nebulae, created using the Shape software. Currently
PyCross has been used for novae and planetary nebulae, and it can be extended to Active Galactic Nuclei
or any other type of photoionised axisymmetric nebulae. Functionality, an operational overview,
and a scientific pipeline will be described with scenarios where PyCross has been adopted for novae
(V5668 Sagittarii (2015) & V4362 Sagittarii (1994)) and a planetary nebula (LoTr1). Unlike the
aforementioned photoionised codes this application does not require any coding experience, nor
the need to derive complex mathematical models, instead utilising the select features from Cloudy/PyCloudy
and Shape. The software was developed using a formal software development lifecycle, written in
Python and will work without the need to install any development environments or additional python
packages. This application, Shape models and PyCross archive examples are freely available to
students, academics and research community on GitHub for download (https://github.com/karolfitzgerald/PyCross_OSX_App).
