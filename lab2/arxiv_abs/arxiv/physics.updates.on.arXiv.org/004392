Numerical work on shockwave/boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs) to date has largely focused
on span-periodic quasi-2D configurations that neglect the influence lateral confinement has
on the core flow. The present study is concerned with the effect of flow confinement on Mach 2 laminar
SBLI in rectangular ducts. An oblique shock generated by a 2 degree wedge forms a conical swept SBLI
with sidewall boundary layers before reflecting from the bottom wall of the domain. Multiple large
regions of flow-reversal are observed on the sidewalls, bottom wall and at the corner intersection.
The main interaction is found to be strongly three-dimensional and highly dependent on the geometry
of the duct. Comparison to quasi-2D span-periodic simulations showed sidewalls strengthen the
interaction by 31% for the baseline configuration with an aspect ratio of one. The length of the shock
generator and subsequent trailing edge expansion fan position was shown to be a critical parameter
in determining the central separation length. By shortening the length of the shock generator,
control of the interaction and suppression of the central interaction is demonstrated. Parametric
studies of shock strength and duct aspect ratio were performed to find limiting behaviours. For
the largest aspect ratio of four, three-dimensionality was visible across 30% of the span width
away from the wall. Topological features of the three-dimensional separation are identified and
shown to be consistent with `owl-like' separations of the first kind. The reflection of the initial
conical swept SBLIs is found to be the most significant factor determining the flow structures downstream
of the main interaction.
