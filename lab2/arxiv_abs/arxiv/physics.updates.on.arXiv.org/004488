Purpose: Hip fractures are a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Automatic identification
and classification of hip fractures using deep learning may improve outcomes by reducing diagnostic
errors and decreasing time to operation. Methods: Hip and pelvic radiographs from 1118 studies
were reviewed and 3034 hips were labeled via bounding boxes and classified as normal, displaced
femoral neck fracture, nondisplaced femoral neck fracture, intertrochanteric fracture, previous
ORIF, or previous arthroplasty. A deep learning-based object detection model was trained to automate
the placement of the bounding boxes. A Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet)
was trained on a subset of the bounding box images, and its performance evaluated on a held out test
set and by comparison on a 100-image subset to two groups of human observers: fellowship-trained
radiologists and orthopaedists, and senior residents in emergency medicine, radiology, and orthopaedics.
Results: The binary accuracy for fracture of our model was 93.8% (95% CI, 91.3-95.8%), with sensitivity
of 92.7% (95% CI, 88.7-95.6%), and specificity 95.0% (95% CI, 91.5-97.3%). Multiclass classification
accuracy was 90.4% (95% CI, 87.4-92.9%). When compared to human observers, our model achieved at
least expert-level classification under all conditions. Additionally, when the model was used
as an aid, human performance improved, with aided resident performance approximating unaided
fellowship-trained expert performance. Conclusions: Our deep learning model identified and
classified hip fractures with at least expert-level accuracy, and when used as an aid improved human
performance, with aided resident performance approximating that of unaided fellowship-trained
attendings.
