The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and constrained search formalism of density functional theory are
in principle sufficient to address the question of mapping from an excited-state density of an interacting
many-electron system to the external potential. Which is also equally applicable to the model noninteracting
system. Be it the lowest (non)degenerate excited state of a given symmetry or any other many-particle
quantum states with differing symmetry and thus corresponding to arbitrary order of excitations,
the analogue of Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and constrained search formalism can uniquely establish
the one-to-one density-to-potential mapping. We have rigorously investigated and also shown
by examples that the existence of multiple effective/external potentials for excited-states
and the seemingly contradictory results in connection to the applicability of Gunnarsson-Lundqvist
theorem even for the lowest excited-state is not truly a failure or violation of Hohenberg-Kohn/Gunnarsson-Lundqvist
theorem. Rather these are nothing but our limited understanding of the subtle differences between
the ground and excited-state density-functional theory. So these are in fact no issues in the context
of the foundational aspects of excited-state density-functional formalism. Our critical analysis
outlines that the multiplicity of potentials for a given density (i.e. the symmetries of the quantum
states involve) never guarantee the violation of one-to-one correspondence between the two most
valuable physical quantities of interest in modern density-functional theory. By furthering
the existing theories and basic principles, we have provided a firm footing to the density -to-potential
mapping for excited-states in general. We have shown that our proposed criterions based on generalized
constrained search formalism keep the excited-state density-to-potential mapping intact.
