The Level-1 Muon Barrel Trigger of the ATLAS Experiment at LHC makes use of Resistive Plate Chamber
(RPC) detectors. The on-detector trigger electronics modules are able to identify muons with predefined
transverse momentum values (pT) by executing a coincidence logic on signals coming from the various
detector layers. Then, on-detector trigger boards transfer trigger data to the off-detector electronics.
A complex trigger system processes the incoming data by combining trigger information from the
Barrel and the End-cap regions, and by providing the combined muon candidate to the Central Trigger
Processor (CTP). For almost a decade, the Level-1 Trigger system has been operating very well, despite
the challenging requirements on trigger efficiency and performance, and the continuously increasing
LHC luminosity. In order to cope with these constraints, various upgrades for the full trigger system
were already deployed, and others have been designed to be installed in the next years. Most of the
upgrades to the trigger system rely on state-of-the-art technologies, thus allowing to increase
the processing power and data transfer bandwidth, and to design more complex trigger menus. As a
consequence, more trigger candidates might be selected by the system, thus supporting new physics
studies or topological selections. In this work, we discuss the design of the first prototype of
the new Barrel Interface Board, designed around a Xilinx FPGA, which will be used to transfer RPC
trigger data to the CTP system. The main requirement for the board is to support the optical transmission
of the trigger data with fixed latency and to allow the implementation of new trigger algorithms.
We describe the hardware implementation and the results of the first functional and integration
tests.
