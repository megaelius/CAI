Jet droplets from bubble bursting are determined by a limited parametrical space: the liquid properties
(surface tension $\sigma$, viscosity $\mu$, and density $\rho$), mother bubble size $R_o$ and
acceleration of gravity $g$. A detailed physical description of the ejection process to model the
ejected droplet radius $R$ and its initial launch speed $V$ is provided, leading to the scaling law:
$R/R_o=k_d\left(\text{Oh}_1-\text{Oh}+k_{\text{Bo,1}} \text{Bo}\right)^{5/4}\left(\text{Oh}+\text{Oh}_2\right)^{-1/2}$,
where Oh$=\mu/(\rho \sigma R_o)^{1/2}$ and Bo$=\rho g R_o^2/\sigma$ are the Ohnesorge and Bond
numbers. Oh$_1$ is the critical Ohnersoge number above which no droplet ejection takes place, and
Oh$_2$ is a new critical Ohnesorge number indicating when viscous effects vanish. This scaling
law begets an extraordinary collapse of all published experimental measurements collected with
Oh$_1=0.038$ (Walls et al. 2015 {\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 92}, 021002(R) reported Oh$_1=0.037$),
Oh$_2=0.0045$, $k_{\text{Bo,1}}=0.006$, and $k_d=0.9$ (scaling prefactor). The scaling law
for the jet speed $V$ is also obtained from the same physical principles, but given that it drastically
varies along the ejection process, one should write $V/V_o=k_v \left(\text{Oh}+\text{Oh}_2-
k_{\text{Bo,2}}\text{Bo}\right)^{1/2}\left(\text{Oh}_1-\text{Oh}+k'_{\text{Bo,1}}
\text{Bo}\right)^{-3/4}$, where $k'_{\text{Bo,1}}$ and $k_{\text{Bo,2}}$ should be introduced
for a complete physical description. Those parameters depend on the criteria to measure the jet
speed. Reliable measurements of $V$ taken with a homogeneous criterium (e.g., the front jet speed
when it reaches the free surface) from different authors yield $k'_{\text{Bo,1}}=0.14$ and $k_{\text{Bo,2}}=0.004$,
with the scaling prefactor $k_v=13.5$.
