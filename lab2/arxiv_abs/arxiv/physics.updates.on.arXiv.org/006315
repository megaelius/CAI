Titan's abundant lakes and seas exchange methane vapor and energy with the atmosphere via a process
generally known as air-sea interaction. This turbulent exchange process is investigated with
an atmospheric mesoscale model coupled to a slab model representation of an underlying lake. The
impact of lake size, effective lake mixed layer depth, background wind speed, air-lake temperature
differential, and atmospheric humidity on air-sea interaction processes is studied through dozens
of two-dimensional simulations. The general, quasi-steady solution is a non-linear superposition
of a very weak background plume circulation driven by the buoyancy of evaporated methane with a stronger
opposing thermally direct (sea breeze) circulation driven by the thermal contrast between the
cold marine layer over the lake and the warmer inland air. The specific solution depends on the value
of selected atmosphere and lake property parameters, but the general solution of the superposition
of these two circulations is persistent. Consistent with previous analytical work of others, the
sensible heat flux and the latent heat flux trend toward opposite and equal values such that their
ratio, the Bowen ratio, approaches -1.0 in most, but not all, of the quasi-steady state solutions.
Importantly, in nearly all scenarios, the absolute magnitude of the fluxes trends toward very small
values such that the equilibrium solution is also nearly a trivial solution where air-sea energy
exchange is about 3 W m-2 or less. In all cases, a cool, moist, and statically stable shallow marine
layer with nearly calm winds and small turbulent flux exchanges with a colder underlying lake is
produced by the model. The temperature of the lake, the marine properties of the air, and the strength
of the sea breeze depends on the initial conditions and to a lesser degree, the boundary conditions.
