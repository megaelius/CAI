In this paper, our prime objective is to connect the curvature of our observable De Sitter Universe
with the spectroscopic study of entanglement of two atoms in an open quantum system (OQS). The OQS
considered in our work is made up of two atoms which are represented by Pauli spin tensor operators
projected along any arbitrary direction. They mimic the role of a pair of freely falling Unruh De-Witt
detectors, which are allowed to non-adiabatically interact with a conformally coupled massless
probe scalar field in the De Sitter background. The effective dynamics of the atomic detectors are
actually an outcome of their non-adiabatic interaction, which is commonly known as the Resonant
Casimir Polder Interaction (RCPI) with the thermal bath. We find from our analysis that the RCPI
of two stable entangled atoms in the quantum vacuum states in OQS depends on the De Sitter space-time
curvature relevant to the temperature of the thermal bath felt by the static observer. We also find
that, in OQS, RCPI produces a new significant contribution appearing in the effective Hamiltonian
of the total system and thermal bath under consideration. This will finally give rise to Lamb Spectroscopic
Shift, as appearing in the context of atomic and molecular physics. This analysis actually plays
a pivotal role to make the bridge between the geometry of our observed Universe to the entanglement
in OQS through Lamb Shift atomic spectroscopy. Thus, we are strongly aiming to connect the curvature
of the background space-time of our Universe to open quantum Lamb Shift spectroscopy by measuring
the quantum properties of a two entangled OQS in the atomic experiment.
