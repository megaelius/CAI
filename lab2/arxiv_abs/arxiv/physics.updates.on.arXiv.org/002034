This paper evaluates the consequences of practicing soil structure interaction (SSI) regulations
of ASCE 7-16 on seismic performance of building structures. The motivation for this research stems
from the significant changes in the new SSI provisions of ASCE 7-16 compared to the previous 2010
edition. Generally, ASCE 7 considers SSI as a beneficial effect, and allows designer to reduce the
design base shear. However, literature shows that this idea cannot properly capture the SSI effects
on nonlinear systems. ASCE 7-16 is the first edition of ASCE 7 that considers the SSI effect on yielding
systems. This study investigates the consequences of practicing the new provisions on a wide range
of buildings with different dynamic characteristics on different soil types. Ductility demand
of the structure forms the performance metric of this study, and the probability that practicing
SSI provisions, in lieu of fixed-base provisions, increases the ductility demand of the structure
is computed. The analyses are conducted within a probabilistic framework which considers the uncertainties
in the ground motion and in the properties of the soil-structure system. It is concluded that, for
structures with surface foundation on moderate to soft soils, SSI regulations of both ASCE 7-10
and ASCE 7-16 are fairly likely to result in a similar and larger structural responses than those
obtained by practicing the fixed-base design regulations. However, for squat and ordinary stiff
structures on soft soil or structures with embedded foundation on moderate to soft soils, the SSI
provisions of ASCE 7-16 result in performance levels that are closer to those obtained by practicing
the fixed-base regulations. Finally, for structures on very soft soils, the new SSI provisions
of ASCE 7-16 are likely to rather conservative designs.
