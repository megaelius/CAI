Here we present four independent advances which facilitate the computation of phonons and their
interactions from first-principles. First, we implement a group-theoretical approach to construct
the order N Taylor series of a d-dimensional crystal purely in terms of space group irreducible derivatives
(ID), which guarantees symmetry by construction and allows for a practical means of communicating
and storing phonons and their interactions. Second, we prove that the smallest possible supercell
which accommodates N given wavevectors in a d-dimensional crystal is determined using the Smith
Normal Form of the matrix formed from the corresponding wavevectors; resulting in negligible computational
cost to find said supercell, in addition to providing the maximum required multiplicity for uniform
supercells at arbitrary N and d. Third, we develop a series of finite displacement methodologies
to compute phonons and their interactions which exploit the first two developments: lone and bundled
irreducible derivative (LID and BID) approaches. LID computes a single ID, or as few as possible,
at a time in the smallest supercell possible, while BID exploits perturbative derivatives for some
order less than N (e.g. Hellman-Feynman forces) in order to extract all ID in the smallest possible
supercells using the fewest possible computations. Finally, we derive an equation for the order
N-2 volume derivatives of the phonons in terms of the order N ID. Given that the former are easily computed,
they can be used as a stringent, infinite ranged test of the ID. Our general framework is illustrated
on graphene, yielding irreducible phonon interactions to fifth order. Additionally, we provide
a cost analysis for the rock-salt structure at N=3, demonstrating a massive speedup compared to
popular finite displacement methods in the literature.
