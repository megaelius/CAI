In this article, as a new mathematical approach to origin of the basic laws of nature, using a new algebra-axiomatic
matrix formalism based on the ring theory and Clifford algebras , "it is shown that certain mathematical
forms of fundamental laws of nature, including laws governing the fundamental forces of nature
(represented by a set of two definite classes of general covariant massive field equations, with
new matrix formalisms), are derived uniquely (& completely) from only a very few axioms"; where
in agreement with the rational Lorentz group, it is also basically assumed that the components of
relativistic energy-momentum can only take rational values. Based on the definite mathematical
formalism of this axiomatic approach, along with the C, P and T symmetries (represented by the corresponding
quantum matrix operators) of the fundamentally derived field equations, it is concluded that the
universe could be realized solely with the (1+2) and (1+3)-dimensional space-times. Moreover,
it is shown that the (1+3)-dimensional cases of derived two classes of field equations, represent
respectively new massive forms of bispinor fields of spin-2, and spin-1 particles; and (1+2)-dimensional
cases of these equations represent (asymptotically) new massive forms of bispinor fields of spin-3/2
and spin-1/2 particles, respectively. On this basis, following certain forms of the gauge symmetries
of these derived fields, along with the known elementary particles, eight new elementary particles
including a spin-3/2 fermion, two chargeless leptons, two chargeless quarks, and three spin-1
(massive) bosons are predicted uniquely by this axiomatic matrix approach. As a particular result,
based on the definite formulation of derived field equations, it has also been concluded that magnetic
monopoles cannot exist in nature.
