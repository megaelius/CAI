We analyzed statistics, solar sources and properties of interplanetary coronal mass ejections
(ICMEs) in the solar wind. In comparison with the first eight years of Cycle 23, during the same period
of Cycle 24 the yearly numbers of ICMEs were less correlated with the flare numbers (0.68 vs 0.78)
and sunspot numbers (0.66 vs 0.81), whereas the ICME correlation with coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
was higher (0.77 vs 0.70). For the period January 2010 -- August 2011, we identified solar sources
of the ICMEs included in the Richardson and Cane list. The solar sources of ICME were determined from
coronagraph observations of the Earth-directed CMEs supplemented by modeling of their propagation
in the heliosphere using the kinematic models and the WSA Enlil Cone MHD-based model. A detailed
analysis of the ICME solar sources in the period under study showed that in 11 cases out of 23 the observed
ICME might be associated with two or more sources. In cases of multiple-source events, the resulting
solar wind disturbances may be described as complex (merged) structures occurred due to the stream
interactions with properties depending on the type of participating streams. As a reliable marker
for identification of interacting streams and their sources, we used the plasma ion composition,
as it becomes frozen in the low corona and remains unchanged in the heliosphere. According to the
ion composition signatures, we classified these cases into three types: complex ejecta originating
from weak and strong CME-CME interactions, as well as merged interaction regions originating from
the CME-high-speed stream interactions. We described temporal profiles of the ion composition
for the single-source and multi-source solar wind structures and compared them with the ICME signatures
determined from the kinematic and magnetic field parameters of the solar wind.
