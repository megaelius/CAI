Atoms under pressure undergo a series of processes and modification of its electronic structure.
Examples are the spontaneous ionization, stabilization of excited-state configurations that
result in a level-crossing with the ground state of the free atom, and contraction of atomic shells.
In this work, we do a systematic study of the effects of confinement with harmonic potential on the
electronic structure of atoms from H to Ne. Dynamic and static correlation is taken into account
by performing CCSD and CASSCF calculations, respectively. Because the strength of harmonic confinement
cannot be translated into pressure, we envisioned a "calibration" method to transform confinement
into pressure. We focused on the effect of confinement on: i) changes of electron distribution and
localization within the $K$ and $L$ atomic shells, ii) confinement-induced ionization pressure,
iii) level crossing of electronic states, and iv) the electron correlation energy. We found that
contraction of valence and core shells are not negligible and that the use of standard pseudopotentials
might be not adequate to study solids under extreme pressures. The critical pressure at which and
atom ionizes follows a periodic trend, and it ranges from $28$ GPa for Li to $10.8$ TPa for Ne. In Li
and a Be, pressure induces mixing of the ground state configuration with excited states. At high
pressure, the ground state of Li and Be becomes a doublet and a triplet with configurations $1s^22p$
and $1s^22s2p$ respectively. The potential consequences of these changes of configuration on
the chemistry of Be are discussed. Finally, the changes in the amount of electron correlation are
characterized and analyzed in terms of the RPA approximation. For atoms with fewer electrons in
the valence shell correlation increases, but for atoms with more electron, the increasing of kinetic
energy dominates over electron correlation.
