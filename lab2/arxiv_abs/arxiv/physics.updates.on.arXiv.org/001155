The scope of this study is to model the solar-wind environment for the Parker Solar Probe's unprecedented
distances down to 9.86 Rs in its mission phase during 2018-2025. The study is performed within the
CGAUSS project which is the German contribution to the PSP mission as part of the WISPR imager on PSP.
We present an empirical solar-wind model for the inner heliosphere which is derived from OMNI and
Helios data. The sunspot number (SSN) and its predictions are used to derive dependencies of solar-wind
parameters on solar activity and to forecast them for the PSP mission. The frequency distributions
for the solar-wind key parameters magnetic field strength, proton velocity, density, and temperature,
are represented by lognormal functions, considering the velocity distribution's bi-componental
shape. Functional relations to the SSN are compiled using OMNI data and based on data from both Helios
probes, the parameters' frequency distributions are fitted with respect to solar distance. Thus,
an empirical solar-wind model for the inner heliosphere is derived, accounting for solar activity
and solar distance. The inclusion of SSN predictions and the extrapolation down to PSP's perihelion
region enables us to estimate the solar-wind environment for PSP's planned trajectory during its
mission duration. This empirical model yields estimated solar-wind values for PSP's 1st perihelion
in 2018 at 0.16 au: 87 nT, 340 km s-1, 214 cm-3 and 503000 K. The estimates for PSP's first closest perihelion,
occurring in 2024 at 0.046 au, are 943 nT, 290 km s-1, 2951 cm-3, and 1930000 K. Since the modeled velocity
and temperature values below approximately 20 Rs appear overestimated in comparison with existing
observations, this suggests that PSP will directly measure solar-wind acceleration and heating
processes below 20 Rs as planned.
