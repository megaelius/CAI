This study endeavors to explain the relation between air pollution and particulate compounds emissions,
wind resources and energy, and the diffusion of COVID-19 infection to provide insights of sustainable
policy to prevent future epidemics. The statistical analysis here focuses on case study of Italy,
one of the countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Results reveal
two main findings: 1) cities in regions with high wind speed and a high wind energy production in MW
have a lower number of infected individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located
in hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high polluting industrialization,
low wind speed and less cleaner production have a greater number of infected individuals and total
deaths. Hence, cities with pollution industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider
low wind speed and other climatological factors that can increase stagnation of the air in the atmosphere
with potential problems for public health in the presence of viral agents. Results here suggest
that current pandemic of Coronavirus disease and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection
cannot be solved only with research and practice of medicine, immunology and microbiology but also
with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable development. Overall, then,
this study has to conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection
must also be based on sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and cleaner
production to reduce polluting industrialization and, as result, the factors determining the
spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in society.
