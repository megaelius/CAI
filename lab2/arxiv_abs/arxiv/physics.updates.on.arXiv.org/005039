Sensors and actuators based on resonant micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), such as scanning
micro mirrors, are well-established in automotive and consumer products. As the areas of application
broaden towards highly automated driving and augmented reality, the performance requirements
for the MEMS are also increasing. In particular, nonlinear system behavior is often found to cause
unexpected performance issues. Thus, accurate system models which account for nonlinear sensor
dynamics can not only increase process yield, but more importantly, lead to a comprehensive understanding
of the underlying physics and consequently to improved MEMS design. In a recent work (1, see comments
below), we have studied the possibility of a rather drastic device failure induced by nonlinearities
on the example of a resonant scanning MEMS micro mirror. On the level of a few selected chips, we have
carefully measured the complex nonlinear system behavior and modeled it by a mode-coupling phenomenon
known as spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The most intriguing feature of SPDC is
the sudden change from a rather linear to a highly nonlinear system behavior at the critical oscillation
amplitude of the mirror. However, the threshold only lies within the range of the mirrors operational
amplitude, if certain frequency resonance conditions regarding the modes of the mechanical structure
are met. As a direct consequence, the critical amplitude strongly depends on the frequency spectrum
of the MEMS design which in turn is largely influenced by fabrication imperfections. In this work,
we validate the dependence of the critical amplitude on the resonance condition by measuring it
for over 600 micro mirrors on wafer-level. Our work does not only validate the theory of SPDC with
measurements on such a large scale, but also demonstrates modeling strategies which are essential
for MEMS product design.
