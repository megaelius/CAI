We treat continuum electrodynamics as an axiomatic formal theory based on the macroscopic Maxwell--Minkowski
equations applied to a thermodynamically closed system consisting of an antireflection-coated
block of a simple linear dielectric material situated in free-space that is illuminated by a quasimonochromatic
field. We prove that valid theorems of the formal theory of Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics
are inconsistent with energy--momentum conservation laws for the unimpeded, inviscid, incompressible
flow of non-interacting particles, photons, in the continuum limit. We also show that valid theorems
of Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics are contradicted by the index-independent Lorentz factor
of von Laue's application of the Einstein theory of special relativity to a dielectric. Therefore,
the extant theoretical treatments of macroscopic electrodynamics, special relativity, and energy--momentum
conservation must be regarded as being mutually inconsistent in a region of space in which the effective
speed of light is $c/n$. Having proven the existing theories to be inconsistent, it is customary
to propose alternatives. We derive, from first principles, a self-consistent alternative theoretical
treatment of electrodynamics, special relativity, and energy--momentum conservation in an isotropic,
homogeneous, linear dielectric-filled, flat, non-Minkowski, continuous material spacetime.
There is sufficient commonality with the classic theories that the extensive theoretical and experimental
work that is correctly described by Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics, conservation, and
von Laue--Einstein dielectric special relativity has an equivalent formulation in the new theory.
The more complex issues of the Abraham--Minkowski momentum controversy and Rosen's refractive
index-dependent dielectric special relativity theory have robust resolutions in the new theory.
