We investigate effective two- and three-body interactions mediated between non-active colloidal
inclusions immersed in an active bath of chiral or non-chiral swimmers. We perform Brownian Dynamics
simulations within a standard model comprising nearly hard, disk-shaped inclusions and swimmers
in two spatial dimensions. In the absence of chirality, we corroborate previous findings by showing
that strong, repulsive, two-body forces of medium range (up to surface separations of a few swimmer
radii) emerge between colloidal inclusions in the active bath. We provide further insight into
this behavior by showing that the two-body force profiles exhibit finer details with a primary maximum
and a secondary hump (or plateau-like region) at larger separations between the inclusions, stemming
from the formation of circular high-density layers (or 'rings') of swimmers around the colloidal
inclusions at elevated self-propulsion strength. The swimmer rings around the inclusions extend
to radial distances of a few swimmer radii from the inclusion surface, giving the hard-core inclusions
a soft repulsive 'shoulder'. It is the overlap (multiple overlaps) between these shoulders that
leads to strong effective two- (three-) body interactions over an extended range between the inclusions.
We show that swimmer chirality results in significant swimmer depletion from the vicinity of the
inclusions (with depletion zones of large thickness comparable to the inclusion size, or several
swimmer radii), giving rise to relatively long-ranged, active, chirality-induced depletion
attractions at large enough swimmer chirality strength. The non-pairwise three-body forces generated
between the inclusions in the active bath turn out to be relatively large, exceeding even the two-body
forces in magnitude, displaying also distinct repulsive and attractive regimes at intermediate
to large swimmer self-propulsion strength.
