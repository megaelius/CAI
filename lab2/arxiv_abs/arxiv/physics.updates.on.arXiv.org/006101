Extensive time-series encoding the position of particles such as viruses, vesicles, or individual
proteins are routinely garnered in single-particle tracking experiments or supercomputing studies.
They contain vital clues on how viruses spread or drugs may be delivered in biological cells. Similar
time-series are being recorded of stock values in financial markets and of climate data. Such time-series
are most typically evaluated in terms of time-average mean-squared displacements, which remain
random variables for finite measurement times. Their statistical properties are different for
different physical stochastic processes, thus allowing us to extract valuable information on
the stochastic process itself. To exploit the full potential of the statistical information encoded
in measured time-series we here propose an easy-to-implement and computationally inexpensive
new methodology, based on deviations of the time-averaged mean-squared displacement from its
ensemble average counterpart. Specifically, we use the upper bound of these deviations for Brownian
motion to check the applicability of this approach to simulated and real data sets. By comparing
the probability of deviations for different data sets, we demonstrate how the theoretical bound
for Brownian motion reveals additional information about observed stochastic processes. We apply
the large-deviation method to data sets of tracer beads tracked in aqueous solution, tracer beads
measured in mucin hydrogels, and of geographic surface temperature anomalies. Our analysis shows
how the large-deviation properties can be efficiently used as a simple yet effective routine test
to reject the Brownian motion hypothesis and unveil crucial information on statistical properties
such as ergodicity breaking and short-time correlations.
