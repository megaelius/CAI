In this paper the physics- (or PDE-) integrated machine learning (ML) framework is investigated.
The Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are solved using Tensorflow library for Python via Chorin-s projection
method. The methodology for the solution is provided, which is compared with a classical solution
implemented in Fortran. This solution is integrated with a neural network (NN). Such integration
allows one to train a NN embedded in the NS equations without having the target (labeled training)
data for the direct outputs from the NN; instead, the NN is trained on the field data (quantities of
interest), which are the solutions for the NS equations. To demonstrate the performance of the framework,
a case study is formulated: the 2D lid-driven cavity with non-constant velocity-dependent dynamic
viscosity is considered. A NN is trained to predict the dynamic viscosity from the velocity fields.
The performance of the physics-integrated ML is compared with classical ML framework, when a NN
is directly trained on the available data (fields of the dynamic viscosity). Both frameworks showed
similar accuracy; however, despite its complexity and computational cost, the physics-integrated
ML offers principal advantages, namely: (i) the target outputs (labeled training data) for a NN
might be unknown and can be recovered using PDEs; (ii) it is not necessary to extract and preprocess
information (training targets) from big data, instead it can be extracted by PDEs; (iii) there is
no need to employ a physics- or scale-separation assumptions to build a closure model. The advantage
(i) is demonstrated in this paper, while the advantages (ii) and (iii) are the subjects for future
work. Such integration of PDEs with ML opens a door for a tighter data-knowledge connection, which
may potentially influence the further development of the physics-based modelling with ML for data-driven
thermal fluid models.
