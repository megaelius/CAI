We analyse the chain fountain effect -- the chain siphoning when falling from a container onto the
floor. We argue that the main reason for this effect are the inertial forces that appear in the chain
and not the momentum received by the beads of the chain from the bottom of the container, as it was considered
before. The inertia of the chain leads to an effect similar to pulling the chain over a pulley placed
up in the air, above the container. This effect have been overlooked until now because of the method
of calculating the chain velocity. In the method used before, the momentum conservation was apparently
imposed, which led to the apparent dissipation of half of the energy of the chain. Because of this
large "dissipation", this approach cannot explain the formation of the fountain effect unless
part of the "wasted" energy is recovered in the form of "kicks" from the bottom of the container. Here
we show that in a correct approach, if there is no explicit dissipation, then both the momentum and
the energy are conserved and therefore the velocity of the chain is high enough to produce the fountain
effect without relying on eventually unimportant effects, such as "kicks" from the container.
We propose an experiment, which may validate our model by producing the highest fountain chain,
while eliminating the kicks the previous model relied upon. We also analyse the equations of motion
and observe that the stationary solution is unstable. For this reason, the stationary solution
is not expected to be formed in an experiment, but the trajectory of the chain should rather fluctuate
around it. Whether the fluctuating trajectory averages to the stationary solution or not, remains
to be studied.
