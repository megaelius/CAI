An approach for compensating the influence of the interrogator noises on the readings of interferometric
sensors, interrogated by means of spectral interferometry with wavelength tuning is proposed.
Both theoretical analysis and a proof-of-principle experiment were performed for the example
of extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometers (EFPI). Two schemes, comprising of a signal and a reference
interferometers, switched in different optical channels of the interrogating unit, were proposed.
The approach is based on the fact that the fluctuations of some of the interrogator parameters produce
correlated fluctuations of the reference and signal interferometers optical path differences
(OPD) measured values. The fluctuations of the reference interferometers measured OPD can be subtracted
from the measured OPD of the signal interferometer. The fluctuations of different parameters of
the interrogator are considered, the correlation properties of the produced noises of the measured
OPD values are demonstrated. The first scheme contains two interferometers with similar parameters
and enabled a three-fold resolution improvement in the performed experiments, when the difference
of the interferometers OPDs was varied within about 10 nm. The second scheme contains two interferometers
with OPDs difference such that all interrogator fluctuations, except for the dominating one produce
uncorrelated OPD errors. With the second scheme a two-fold resolution improvement was experimentally
demonstrated, when the interferometers OPDs difference was varied within more than 1 \mum. The
proposed approach can be used for improving the resolution of interferometric sensors with relatively
large OPDs (greater than 200-300 \mum), which can be advantageous for remote materials and surface
inspection.
