We use direct numerical simulations to investigate the interaction between the temperature field
of a fluid and the temperature of small particles suspended in the flow, employing both one and two-way
thermal coupling, in a statistically stationary, isotropic turbulent flow. Using statistical
analysis, we investigate this variegated interaction at the different scales of the flow. We find
that the variance of the fluid temperature gradients decreases as the thermal response time of the
suspended particles is increased. The probability density function (PDF) of the fluid temperature
gradients scales with its variance, while the PDF of the rate of change of the particle temperature,
whose variance is associated with the thermal dissipation due to the particles, does not scale in
such a self-similar way. The modification of the fluid temperature field due to the particles is
examined by computing the particle concentration and particle heat fluxes conditioned on the magnitude
of the local fluid temperature gradient. These statistics highlight that the particles cluster
on the fluid temperature fronts, and the important role played by the alignments of the particle
velocity and the local fluid temperature gradient. The temperature structure functions, which
characterize the temperature fluctuations across the scales of the flow, clearly show that the
fluctuations of the fluid temperature increments are monotonically suppressed in the two-way
coupled regime as the particle thermal response time is increased. Thermal caustics dominate the
particle temperature increments at small scales, that is, particles that come into contact are
likely to have very large differences in their temperature. This is caused by the nonlocal thermal
dynamics of the particles...
