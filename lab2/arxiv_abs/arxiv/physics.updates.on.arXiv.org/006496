If we study the quantum effects in plasmas in terms of traditional hydrodynamics via the continuity
and Euler equations we find the quantum Bohm potential and the force of spin-spin interaction. However,
if we extend the set hydrodynamic equations beyond the 13-moments approximation, and include the
third rank tensor evolution equation along with the pressure evolution equation, we obtain the
quantum corrections to the Coulomb interaction. It is found in contrast with the fact that hydrodynamic
equations for the higher rank tensors do not contain interaction in the classic plasmas studied
in the selfconsistent (meanfield) approximation. Therefore, we present the quantum hydrodynamic
model, where the quantum effects are studied beyond the quantum Bohm potential. Developed model
is considered in two regimes: all electrons in plasmas are considered as the single fluid, and the
separate spin evolution regime, where electrons with different spin projections are considered
as two different fluids. To illustrate the fundamental meaning of found quantum effects we demonstrate
their contribution in the spectrum of the Langmuir waves and the spin-electron-acoustic waves.
It is worth to mention that the application of the pressure evolution equation ensures that the contribution
of pressure in the Langmuir wave spectrum is proportional to $(3/5)v_{Fe}^{2}$, unlike $(1/3)v_{Fe}^{2}$
appearing from hydrodynamics based on the continuity and Euler equations, where $v_{Fe}$ is the
Fermi velocity. Same correction corresponds on other plasmas phenomena like the speed of sound
for spin-electron-acoustic waves. Moreover, it is found that novel quantum effects provide the
novel wave solutions.
