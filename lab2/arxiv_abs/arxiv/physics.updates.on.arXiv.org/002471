Purpose: To investigate the validity of two Monte Carlo simulation absolute dosimetry approaches
in the case of a small field dedicated `D'-shaped collimator used for the retinoblastoma treatment
with external photon beam radiotherapy. Methods: The Monte Carlo code {\sc penelope} is used to
simulate the linac, the dedicated collimator and a water phantom. The absolute doses (in Gy per monitor
unit) for the field sizes considered are obtained within the approach of Popescu {\it et al.} in which
the tallied backscattered dose in the monitor chamber is accounted for. The results are compared
to experimental data, to those found with a simpler Monte Carlo approximation for the calculation
of absolute doses and to those provided by the analytical anisotropic algorithm. Our analysis allows
for the study of the simulation tracking parameters. Two sets of parameters have been considered
for the simulation of the particle transport in the linac target. Results: The change in the tracking
parameters produced non-negligible differences, of about 10\% or larger, in the doses estimated
in reference conditions. The Monte Carlo results for the absolute doses differ from the experimental
ones by 2.6\% and 1.7\% for the two parameter sets for the collimator geometries analyzed. For the
studied fields, the simpler approach produces absolute doses that are statistically compatible
with those obtained with the approach of Popescu {\it et al.} The analytical anisotropic algorithm
underestimates the experimental absolute doses with discrepancies larger than those found for
Monte Carlo results. Conclusions: The approach studied can be considered for absolute dosimetry
in the case of small, `D'-shaped and off-axis radiation fields. However, a detailed description
of the radiation transport in the linac target is mandatory for an accurate absolute dosimetry.
