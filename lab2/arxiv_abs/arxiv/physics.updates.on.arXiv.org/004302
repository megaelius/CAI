Nuclear Scene Data Fusion (SDF), implemented in the Localization and Mapping Platform (LAMP) fuses
three-dimensional (3D), real-time volumetric reconstructions of radiation sources with contextual
information (e.g. LIDAR, camera, etc.) derived from the environment around the detector system.
This information, particularly when obtained in real time, may be transformative for applications,
including directed search for lost or stolen sources, consequence management after the release
of radioactive materials, or contamination avoidance in security-related or emergency response
scenarios. 3D reconstructions enabled by SDF localize contamination or hotspots to specific areas
or objects, providing higher resolution over larger areas than conventional 2D approaches, and
enabling more efficient planning and response, particularly in complex 3D environments. In this
work, we present the expansion of these gamma-ray mapping concepts to neutron source localization.
Here we integrate LAMP with a custom $Cs_2LiLa(Br,Cl)_6:Ce$ (CLLBC) scintillator detector sensitive
to both gamma-rays and neutrons, which we dub Neutron Gamma LAMP (NG-LAMP). NG-LAMP enables simultaneous
neutron and gamma-ray mapping with high resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy. We demonstrate the
ability to detect and localize surrogate Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) in real-time and in 3D
based on neutron signatures alone, which is critical for the detection of heavily shielded SNM,
when gamma-ray signatures are attenuated. In this work, we show for the first time the ability to
localize, in 3D and realtime, a neutron source in the presence of a strong gamma-ray source, simultaneous
and spectroscopic localization of three gamma-ray sources and a neutron source, and finally the
localization of a surrogate SNM source based on neutron signatures alone, where gamma-ray data
are consistent with background.
