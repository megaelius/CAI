In the present work, a non-linear stochastic model is presented to study the effect of time variation
of transmission rates on the co-evolution of epidemics and its corresponding awareness over a two
layered multiplex network. In this model, the infection transmission rate of a given node in the
epidemic layer depends upon its awareness probability in the awareness layer. Similarly, the infection
information transmission rate of a node in the awareness layer depends upon its infection probability
in the epidemic layer. The spread of disease resulting from physical contacts is described in terms
of SIS (Susceptible Infected Susceptible) process over the epidemic layer and the spread of information
about the disease outbreak is described in terms of UAU (Unaware Aware Unaware) process over the
virtual interaction mediated awareness layer. The time variation of the transmission rates and
the resulting co-evolution of these mutually competing processes is studied in terms of a network
topology depend parameter({\alpha}). Using a second order linear theory it has been shown that
in the continuous time limit, the co-evolution of these processes can be described in terms of damped
and driven harmonic oscillator equations. From the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation, it is
shown that for the suitable choice of parameter({\alpha}), the two process can either exhibit sustained
oscillatory or damped dynamics. The damped dynamics corresponds to the endemic state. Further,
for the case of endemic state it is shown that the inclusion of awareness layer significantly lowers
the disease transmission rate and reduces the size of epidemic. The endemic state infection probability
of a given node corresponding to the damped dynamics is found to have dependence upon both the transmission
rates as well as on both absolute intra-layer and relative inter-layer degree of the individual
nodes.
