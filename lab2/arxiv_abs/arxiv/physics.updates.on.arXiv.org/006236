The flow in a Hele-Shaw cell with a time-increasing gap poses a unique shrinking interface problem.
When the upper plate of the cell is lifted perpendicularly at a prescribed speed, the exterior less
viscous fluid penetrates the interior more viscous fluid, which generates complex, time-dependent
interfacial patterns through the Saffman-Taylor instability. The pattern formation process
sensitively depends on the lifting speed and is still not fully understood. For some lifting speeds,
such as linear or exponential speed, the instability is transient and the interface eventually
shrinks as a circle. However, linear stability analysis suggests there exist shape invariant shrinking
patterns if the gap $b(t)$ is increased more rapidly: $\displaystyle b(t)=\left(1-\frac{7}{2}\tau
\mathcal{C} t\right)^{-{2}/{7}}$, where $\tau$ is the surface tension and $\mathcal{C}$ is a
function of the interface perturbation mode $k$. Here, we use a spectrally accurate boundary integral
method together with an efficient time adaptive rescaling scheme, which for the first time makes
it possible to explore the nonlinear limiting dynamical behavior of a vanishing interface. When
the gap is increased at a constant rate, our numerical results quantitatively agree with experimental
observations (Nase et al., Phys. Fluids, vol. 23, 2011, pp. 123101). When we use the shape invariant
gap $b(t)$, our nonlinear results reveal the existence of $k$-fold dominant, one-dimensional,
web-like networks, where the fractal dimension is reduced to almost one at late times. We conclude
by constructing a morphology diagram for pattern selection that relates the dominant mode $k$ of
the vanishing interface and the control parameter $\mathcal{C}$.
