Using electromagnetism to study analogue space-times is tantamount to considering consistency
conditions for when a given (meta-)material would provide an analogue space-time model or --- vice
versa --- characterizing which given metric could be modelled with a (meta-)material. While the
consistency conditions themselves are by now well known and studied, the form the metric takes once
they are satisfied is not. This question is mostly easily answered by keeping the formalisms of the
two research fields here in contact as close to each other as possible. While fully covariant formulations
of the electrodynamics of media have been around for a long while, they are usually abandoned for
(3+1)- or 6-dimensional formalisms. Here we shall use the fully unified and fully covariant approach.
This enables us even to generalize the consistency conditions for the existence of an effective
metric to arbitrary background metrics beyond flat space-time electrodynamics. We also show how
the familiar matrices for permittivity $\epsilon$, permeability $\mu^{-1}$, and magneto-electric
effects $\zeta$ can be seen as the three independent pieces of the Bel decomposition for the constitutive
tensor $Z^{abcd}$, i.e., the components of an orthogonal decomposition with respect to a given
observer with four-velocity $V^a$. Finally, we shall use the Moore--Penrose pseudo-inverse and
the closely related pseudo-determinant to then gain the desired reconstruction of the effective
metric in terms of the permittivity tensor $\epsilon^{ab}$, the permeability tensor $[\mu^{-1}]^{ab}$,
and the magneto-electric tensor $\zeta^{ab}$, as an explicit function $g_{\text{eff}}(\epsilon,\mu^{-1},\zeta)$.
