Frequency-encoded photonic qubits are not only more stable over long transmission distances but
also more robust against birefringent materials. A 50/50 frequency beam splitter (FBS) is the Hadamard
gate in quantum logic operation, which coherently converts a photon in one frequency or wavelength
mode to another photon in the superposition of two different modes. Previous works revealed that
the Hadamard gates or FBS's operating at the single-photon level had overall efficiencies or output-to-input
ratios less than 50%. Here, our FBS is made with the four-wave mixing (FWM) process based on the dual-$\Lambda$
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) scheme. We achieved an overall efficiency of
90$\pm$4% with coherent-state single photons, which is the best up-to-date record for 50/50 FBS.
In addition, we utilized this EIT-based scheme to perform wavelength conversion with light pulses
of photon number less than one. We obtained an output-to-input ratio of 84$\pm$4%, which is not only
the highest record currently achieved, but also the first experimental demonstration of preservation
of the quantum state in the dual-$\Lambda$ EIT scheme. This demonstration was revealed by the fidelity
of our Hadamard gate. To measure the fidelity, we propose a novel method using Hong-Ou-Mandel interference
(HOMI) for quantum process tomography. The fidelity of our Hadamard gate indicated by the HOMI's
$g^{(2)}$ measurement is 0.99$\pm$0.01. This low-loss high-fidelity Hadamard gate or wavelength
converter based on the dual-$\Lambda$ EIT scheme can lead to useful operations or devices, such
as entanglement swapping, multiplexer, etc., in long-distance quantum communication.
