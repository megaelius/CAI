Persistence is defined as the probability that the local value of a fluctuating field remains at
a particular state for a certain amount of time, before being switched to another state. Despite
being theoretically challenging, the concept of persistence has been found to have many diverse
practical applications, ranging from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to financial dynamics
to distribution of time scales in turbulent flows and many more. In this study, we carry out a detailed
analysis of the statistical characteristics of the persistence probability density functions
(PDFs) of velocity and temperature fluctuations in the surface layer of a convective boundary layer,
using a field-experimental dataset. Our results demonstrate that for the time scales smaller than
the integral scales, the persistence PDFs of turbulent velocity and temperature fluctuations
display a clear power-law behaviour, associated with self-similar eddy cascading mechanism.
Moreover, we also show that the effects of non-Gaussian temperature fluctuations act only at those
scales which are larger than the integral scales, where the persistence PDFs deviate from the power-law
and drop exponentially. Furthermore, the mean time scales of the negative temperature fluctuation
events persisting longer than the integral scales are found to be approximately equal to twice the
integral scale in highly convective conditions. However, with stability this mean time scale gradually
decreases to almost being equal to the integral scale in the near neutral conditions. Contrarily,
for the long positive temperature fluctuation events, the mean time scales remain roughly equal
to the integral scales, irrespective of stability.
