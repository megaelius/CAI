Based on the understandings regarding linear upwind schemes with flux splitting to achieve free-stream
preservation (Q. Li, etc. Commun. Comput. Phys., 22 (2017) 64-94), a series of WENO interpolation-based
and upwind-biased nonlinear schemes are proposed in this study. By means of engagement of fluxes
on midpoints, the nonlinearity of schemes is introduced through WENO interpolations, and upwind-biased
features are acquired through the choice of dependent grid stencil. Regarding the third- and fifth-order
versions, schemes with one and two midpoints are devised and carefully tested. With the integration
of the piecewise-polynomial mapping function methods (Q. Li, etc. Commun. Comput. Phys. 18 (2015)
1417-1444), the proposed schemes are found to achieve the designed orders and free-stream preservation
property. In 1-D Sod and Shu-Osher problems, all schemes succeed in yielding well predictions.
In 2-D cases, the vortex preservation, supersonic inviscid flow around cylinder at M=4, Riemann
problem and Shock-vortex interaction problems are tested. In each problem, two types of grids are
employed, i.e. the uniformed/smooth grids and the randomized/partially-randomized grids. On
the latter, the shock wave and complex flow structures are located/partially located. All schemes
fulfill computations in uniformed/smooth grids with satisfactory results. On randomized grids,
all schemes accomplish computations and yield reasonable results except the third-order one with
two midpoints engaged fails in Riemann problem and shock-vortex interaction problem. Overall
speaking, the proposed schemes manifest the capability to solve problems on grids with bad quality,
and therefore indicate their potential in engineering applications.
