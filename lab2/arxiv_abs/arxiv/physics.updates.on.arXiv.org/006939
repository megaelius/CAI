Despite the nonlinear nature of turbulence, there is evidence that the energy-injection mechanisms
sustaining wall turbulence can be ascribed to linear processes. Different scenarios stem from
linear stability theory and comprise exponential instabilities of the mean flow, neutral modes,
transient growth from non-normal operators, and parametric instabilities from temporal mean-flow
variations, among others. These mechanisms, each potentially capable of leading to the observed
turbulence structure, are rooted in theoretical and conceptual arguments. Whether the flow follows
any or a combination of them remains unclear. Here, we evaluate the linear mechanisms responsible
for the energy transfer from the streamwise-averaged mean-flow (U) to the fluctuating velocities
($\bf u'$). We use cause-and-effect analysis based on interventions. This is achieved by direct
numerical simulation of turbulent channel flows at low Reynolds number, in which the energy transfer
from $\bf U$ to $\bf u'$ is constrained to preclude a targeted linear mechanism. We show that transient
growth is sufficient for sustaining realistic wall turbulence. The self-sustaining cycle of turbulence
persists when either exponential instabilities, neutral modes, or parametric instabilities
of the mean flow are suppressed. We further show that a key component of transient growth is the Orr/push-over
mechanism induced by spanwise variations of the base flow. Finally, we demonstrate that a collection
of simulations with frozen-in-time $\bf U$ that only support transient growth gives a faithful
representation of the actual time-varying energy transfer from $\bf U$ to $\bf u'$. Our approach
provides direct cause-and-effect evaluation of the linear energy-injection mechanisms from
$\bf U$ to $\bf u'$ in the fully nonlinear system and simplifies the conceptual model of self-sustaining
wall turbulence.
