Background: Mammography is a specific type of breast imaging that uses low-dose X-rays to detect
cancer in early stage. During the exam, the women breast is compressed between two plates in order
to even out the breast thickness and to spread out the soft tissues. This technique improves exam
quality but can be uncomfortable for the patient. The perceived discomfort can be assessed by the
means of a breast biomechanical model. Alternative breast compression techniques may be computationally
investigated trough finite elements simulations.Methods: The aim of this work is to develop and
evaluate a new biomechanical Finite Element (FE) breast model. The complex breast anatomy is considered
including adipose and glandular tissues, muscle, skin, suspensory ligaments and pectoral fascias.
Material hyper-elasticity is modeled using the Neo-Hookean material models. The stress-free
breast geometry and subject-specific constitutive models are derived using tissues deformations
measurements from MR images.Findings: The breast geometry in three breast configurations were
computed using the breast stress-free geometry together with the estimated set of equivalent Young's
modulus (Ebreast_r=0.3 kPa, Ebreast_l=0.2 kPa, Eskin=4 kPa, Efascia=120 kPa). The Hausdorff
distance between estimated and measured breast geometries for prone, supine and supine tilted
configurations is equal to 2.17 mm, 1.72mm and 5.90mm respectively.Interpretation: A subject-specific
breast model allows a better characterization of breast mechanics. However, the model presents
some limitations when estimating the supine tilted breast configuration. The results show clearly
the difficulties to characterize soft tissues mechanics at large strain ranges with Neo-Hookean
material models.
