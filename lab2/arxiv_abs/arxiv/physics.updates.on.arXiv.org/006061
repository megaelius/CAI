A deep learning based non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging system is developed to image an occluded
object off a scattering surface. The neural net is trained using only handwritten digits, and yet
exhibits capability to reconstruct patterns distinct from the training set, including physical
objects. It can also reconstruct a cartoon video from its scattering patterns in real time, demonstrating
the robustness and generalization capability of the deep learning based approach. Several scattering
surfaces with varying degree of Lambertian and specular contributions were examined experimentally;
it is found that for a Lambertian surface the structural similarity index (SSIM) of reconstructed
images is about 0.63, while the SSIM obtained from a scattering surface possessing a specular component
can be as high as 0.93. A forward model of light transport was developed based on the Phong scattering
model. Scattering patterns from Phong surfaces with different degrees of specular contribution
were numerically simulated. It is found that a specular contribution of as small as 5% can enhance
the SSIM from 0.83 to 0.93, consistent with the results from experimental data. Singular value spectra
of the underlying transfer matrix were calculated for various Phong surfaces. As the weight and
the shininess factor increase, i.e., the specular contribution increases, the singular value
spectrum broadens and the 50-dB bandwidth is increased by more than 4X with a 10% specular contribution,
which indicates that at the presence of even a small amount of specular contribution the NLOS measurement
can retain significantly more singular value components, leading to higher reconstruction fidelity.
With an ordinary camera and incoherent light source, this work enables a low-cost, real-time NLOS
imaging system without the need of an explicit physical model of the underlying light transport
process.
