The predictive accuracy of wall-modeled large eddy simulation is studied by systematic simulation
campaigns of turbulent channel flow. The effect of wall model, grid resolution and anisotropy,
numerical convective scheme and subgrid-scale modeling is investigated. All of these factors
affect the resulting accuracy, and their action is to a large extent intertwined. The wall model
is of the wall-stress type, and its sensitivity to location of velocity sampling, as well as law of
the wall's parameters is assessed. For efficient exploration of the model parameter space (anisotropic
grid resolution and wall model parameter values), generalized polynomial chaos expansions are
used to construct metamodels for the responses which are taken to be measures of the predictive error
in quantities of interest (QoIs). The QoIs include the mean wall shear stress and profiles of the
mean velocity, the turbulent kinetic energy, and the Reynolds shear stress. DNS data is used as reference.
Within the tested framework, a particular second-order accurate CFD code (OpenFOAM), the results
provide ample support for grid and method parameters recommendations which are proposed in the
present paper, and which provide good results for the QoIs. Notably, good results are obtained with
a grid with isotropic (cubic) hexahedral cells, with $15\, 000$ cells per $\delta^3$, where $\delta$
is the channel half-height (or thickness of the turbulent boundary layer). The importance of providing
enough numerical dissipation to obtain accurate QoIs is demonstrated. The main channel flow case
investigated is ${\rm Re}_\tau=5200$, but extension to a wide range of ${\rm Re}$-numbers is considered.
Use of other numerical methods and software would likely modify these recommendations, at least
slightly, but the proposed framework is fully applicable to investigate this as well.
