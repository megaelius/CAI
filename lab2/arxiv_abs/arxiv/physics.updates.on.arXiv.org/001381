Thermal fluid processes are inherently multi-physics and multi-scale, involving mass-momentum-energy
transport phenomena. Thermal fluid simulation (TFS) is based on solving conservative equations,
for which - except for "first-principle" direct numerical simulation - closure relations (CRs)
are required to provide microscopic interactions. In practice, TFS is realized through reduced-order
modeling, and its CRs can be informed by observations and data from relevant and adequately evaluated
experiments and high-fidelity simulations. This paper focuses on data-driven TFS models, specifically
on the development using machine learning (ML). Five ML frameworks, dubbed Type I to V, are introduced.
The frameworks vary in their performance for different applications depending on the level of knowledge
of governing physics, the source, type, amount and quality of available data for training. Notably,
outlined for the first time in this paper, Type III models present stringent requirements on modeling,
substantial computing resources for training, and high potential in extracting value from "big
data" in thermal fluid research. The paper demonstrated the ML frameworks by three examples. First,
we utilized the heat diffusion equation with nonlinear conductivity formulated by convolutional
neural networks to illustrate the applications of Type I, II, and III ML. The results indicated a
preference for Type II ML under deficient data support. Type III ML can effectively utilize field
data, potentially generating more robust predictions than Type I and II ML. Second, we illustrated
how to employ Type I ML and Type II ML frameworks for data-driven turbulence modeling using reference
works. Third, we demonstrated Type I ML by building a deep learning (DL)-based slip closure for two-phase
flow modeling. The results showed that the DL-based closure exhibits a bounded error in prediction
domain.
