We consider an excitatory population of subthreshold Izhikevich neurons which cannot fire spontaneously
without noise. As the coupling strength passes a threshold, individual neurons exhibit noise-induced
burstings. This neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP). In the absence of STDP, stochastic burst synchronization (SBS) between noise-induced
burstings of subthreshold neurons was previously found to occur over a large range of intermediate
noise intensities. Here, we study the effect of additive STDP on the SBS by varying the noise intensity
$D$ in the Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network (SFN) for the case of symmetric preferential attachment.
This type of SFN exhibits a power-law degree distribution, and hence it becomes an inhomogeneous
one with a few "hubs" (i.e., super-connected nodes). Occurrence of a "Matthew" effect in synaptic
plasticity is found to occur due to a positive feedback process. Good burst synchronization gets
better via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strengths, while bad burst synchronization
gets worse via long-term depression (LTD). Consequently, a step-like rapid transition to SBS occurs
by changing $D$, in contrast to a relatively smooth transition in the absence of STDP. In the presence
of additive STDP, we also investigate the effects of network architecture on the SBS for a fixed $D$.
Emergences of LTP and LTD of synaptic strengths are investigated in details via microscopic studies
based on both the distributions of time delays between the burst onset times of the pre- and the post-synaptic
neurons and the pair-correlations between the pre- and the post-synaptic IIBRs (instantaneous
individual burst rates). Finally, a multiplicative STDP case (depending on states) is also investigated
in comparison with the additive STDP case (independent of states).
