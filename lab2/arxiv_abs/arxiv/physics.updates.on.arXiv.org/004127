Discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS) is a multi-scale numerical method for flows from continuum
limit to free molecular limit, and is especially suitable for the simulation of multi-scale flows,
benefiting from its multi-scale property. To reduce integration error of the DUGKS and ensure the
conservation property of the collision term in isothermal flow simulations, a Conserved-DUGKS
(C-DUGKS) is proposed. On the other hand, both DUGKS and C-DUGKS adopt Cartesian-type discrete
velocity space, in which Gaussian and Newton-Cotes numerical quadrature are used for calculating
the macroscopic physical variables in low speed and high speed flows, respectively. While, the
Cartesian-type discrete velocity space leads to huge computational cost and memory demand. In
this paper, the isothermal C-DUGKS is extended to the non-isothermal case by adopting coupled mass
and inertial energy distribution functions. Moreover, since the unstructured mesh, such as the
triangular mesh in two dimensional case, is more flexible than the structured Cartesian mesh, it
is introduced to the discrete velocity space of C-DUGKS, such that more discrete velocity points
can be arranged in the velocity regions that enclose large number of molecules, and only a few discrete
velocity points need to be arranged in the velocity regions with small amount of molecules in it.
By using the unstructured discrete velocity space, the computational efficiency of C-DUGKS is
significantly increased. A series of numerical tests in a wide range of Knudsen numbers, such as
the Couette flow, lid-driven cavity flow, two-dimensional rarefied Riemann problem and the supersonic
cylinder flows, are carried out to examine the validity and efficiency of the present method.
