Fluid-structure interactions are ubiquitous in nature and technology. However, the systems are
often so complex that numerical simulations or ad hoc assumptions must be used to gain insight into
the details of the complex interactions between the fluid and solid mechanics. In this paper, we
present experiments and theory on viscous flow in a simple bioinspired soft valve which illustrate
essential features of interactions between hydrodynamic and elastic forces at low Reynolds numbers.
The setup comprises a sphere connected to a spring located inside a tapering cylindrical channel.
The spring is aligned with the central axis of the channel and a pressure drop is applied across the
sphere, thus forcing the liquid through the narrow gap between the sphere and the channel walls.
The sphere's equilibrium position is determined by a balance between spring and hydrodynamic forces.
Since the gap thickness changes with the sphere's position, the system has a pressure-dependent
hydraulic resistance. This leads to a non-linear relation between applied pressure and flow rate:
flow initially increases with pressure, but decreases when the pressure exceeds a certain critical
value as the gap closes. To rationalize these observations, we propose a mathematical model that
reduced the complexity of the flow to a two-dimensional lubrication approximation. A closed-form
expression for the pressure-drop/flow rate is obtained which reveals that the flow rate $Q$ depends
on the pressure drop $\Delta p$, sphere radius $a$, gap thickness $h_0$, and viscosity $\eta$ as
$Q\sim \eta^{-1} a^{1/2}h_0^{5/2}\left(\Delta p_c-\Delta p\right)^{5/2}\Delta p$, where
the critical pressure $\Delta p_c$ scales with the spring constant $k$ and sphere radius $a$ as $\Delta
p_c\sim k a^{-2}$. These predictions compared favorably to the results of our experiments with
no free parameters.
