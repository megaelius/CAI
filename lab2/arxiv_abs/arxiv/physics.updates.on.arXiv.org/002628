Crucial to analyze phenomena as varied as plasmonic hot spots and the spread of cancer in living tissue,
nanoscale thermometry is challenging: probes are usually larger than the sample under study, and
contact techniques may alter the sample temperature itself. Many photostable nanomaterials whose
luminescence is temperature-dependent, such as lanthanide-doped phosphors, have been shown
to be good non-contact thermometric sensors when optically excited. Using such nanomaterials,
in this work we accomplished the key milestone of enabling far-field thermometry with a spatial
resolution that is not diffraction-limited at readout. We explore thermal effects on the cathodoluminescence
of lanthanide-doped NaYF$_4$ nanoparticles. Whereas cathodoluminescence from such lanthanide-doped
nanomaterials has been previously observed, here we use quantitative features of such emission
for the first time towards an application beyond localization. We demonstrate a thermometry scheme
that is based on cathodoluminescence lifetime changes as a function of temperature that achieves
$\sim$ 30 mK sensitivity in sub-$\mu$m nanoparticle patches. The scheme is robust against spurious
effects related to electron beam radiation damage and optical alignment fluctuations. We foresee
the potential of single nanoparticles, of sheets of nanoparticles, and also of thin films of lanthanide-doped
NaYF$_4$ to yield temperature information via cathodoluminescence changes when in the vicinity
of a sample of interest; the phosphor may even protect the sample from direct contact to damaging
electron beam radiation. Cathodoluminescence-based thermometry is thus a valuable novel tool
towards temperature monitoring at the nanoscale, with broad applications including heat dissipation
in miniaturized electronics and biological diagnostics.
