Machine learning methods have shown promise in predicting molecular properties, and given sufficient
training data machine learning approaches can enable rapid high-throughput virtual screening
of large libraries of compounds. Graph-based neural network architectures have emerged in recent
years as the most successful approach for predictions based on molecular structure, and have consistently
achieved the best performance on benchmark quantum chemical datasets. However, these models have
typically required optimized 3D structural information for the molecule to achieve the highest
accuracy. These 3D geometries are costly to compute for high levels of theory, limiting the applicability
and practicality of machine learning methods in high-throughput screening applications. In this
study, we present a new database of candidate molecules for organic photovoltaic applications,
comprising approximately 91,000 unique chemical structures.Compared to existing datasets,
this dataset contains substantially larger molecules (up to 200 atoms) as well as extrapolated
properties for long polymer chains. We show that message-passing neural networks trained with
and without 3D structural information for these molecules achieve similar accuracy, comparable
to state-of-the-art methods on existing benchmark datasets. These results therefore emphasize
that for larger molecules with practical applications, near-optimal prediction results can be
obtained without using optimized 3D geometry as an input. We further show that learned molecular
representations can be leveraged to reduce the training data required to transfer predictions
to a new DFT functional.
