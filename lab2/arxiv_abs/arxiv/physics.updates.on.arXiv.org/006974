The dissociation of ligands from proteins and other biomacromolecules occurs over a wide range
of timescales. For most pharmaceutically relevant inhibitors, these timescales are far beyond
those that are accessible by conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Consequently,
to explore ligand egress mechanisms and compute dissociation rates, it is necessary to enhance
the sampling of ligand unbinding. Random Acceleration MD (RAMD) is a simple method to enhance ligand
egress from a macromolecular binding site, which enables the exploration of ligand egress routes
without prior knowledge of the reaction coordinates. Furthermore, the tauRAMD procedure can be
used to compute the relative residence times of ligands. When combined with a machine-learning
analysis of protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (IFPs), molecular features that affect
ligand unbinding kinetics can be identified. Here, we describe the implementation of RAMD in GROMACS
2020, which provides significantly improved computational performance, with scaling to large
molecular systems. For the automated analysis of RAMD results, we developed MD-IFP, a set of tools
for the generation of IFPs along unbinding trajectories and for their use in the exploration of ligand
dynamics. We demonstrate that the analysis of ligand dissociation trajectories by mapping them
onto the IFP space enables the characterization of ligand dissociation routes and metastable states.
The combined implementation of RAMD and MD-IFP provides a computationally efficient and freely
available workflow that can be applied to hundreds of compounds in a reasonable computational time
and will facilitate the use of tauRAMD in drug design.
