Nonradiating sources of energy have traditionally been studied in quantum mechanics and astrophysics,
while receiving a very little attention in the photonics community. This situation has changed
recently due to a number of pioneering theoretical studies and remarkable experimental demonstrations
of the exotic states of light in dielectric resonant photonic structures and metasurfaces, with
the possibility to localize efficiently the electromagnetic fields of high intensities within
small volumes of matter. These recent advances underpin novel concepts in nanophotonics, and provide
a promising pathway to overcome the problem of losses usually associated with metals and plasmonic
materials for the efficient control of the light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. This review
paper provides the general background and several snapshots of the recent results in this young
yet prominent research field, focusing on two types of nonradiating states of light that both have
been recently at the center of many studies in all-dielectric resonant meta-optics and metasurfaces:
optical {\em anapoles} and photonic {\em bound states in the continuum}. We discuss a brief history
of these states in optics, their underlying physics and manifestations, and also emphasize their
differences and similarities. We also review some applications of such novel photonic states in
both linear and nonlinear optics for the nanoscale field enhancement, a design of novel dielectric
structures with high-$Q$ resonances, nonlinear wave mixing and enhanced harmonic generation,
as well as advanced concepts for lasing and optical neural networks.
