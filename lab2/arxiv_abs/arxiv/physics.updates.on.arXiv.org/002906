The aim of this work is to identify main impact factors affecting variations in the geomorphology
of the Mariana Trench which is the deepest place of the Earth, located in the west Pacific Ocean: steepness
angle and structure of the sediment compression. The Mariana Trench presents a complex ecosystem
with highly interconnected factors: geology (sediment thickness and tectonics including four
plates that Mariana trench crosses: Philippine, Pacific, Mariana, Caroline), bathymetry (coordinates,
slope angle, depth values in the observation points). To study such a complex system, an objective
method combining various approaches (statistics, R, GIS, descriptive analysis and graphical
plotting) was performed. Methodology of the research includes following clusters: R programming
language for writing codes, statistical analysis, mathematical algorithms for data processing,
analysis and visualizing diagrams, GIS for digitizing bathymetric profiles and spatial analysis.
The statistical analysis of the data taken from the bathymetric profiles was applied to environmental
factors, i.e. coordinates, depths, geological properties sediment thickness, slope angles,
etc. Finally, factor analysis was performed by R libraries to analyze impact factors of the Mariana
Trench ecosystem. Euler-Venn logical diagrams highlighted similarities between four tectonic
plates and environmental factors. The results revealed distinct correlations between the environmental
factors (sediment thickness, slope steepness, depth values by observation points, geographic
location of the profiles) affecting Mariana Trench morphology. The research demonstrated that
coding on R language provides a powerful and highly effective statistical tools, mathematical
algorithms of factor analysis to study ocean trench formation.
