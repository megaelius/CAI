We examine the relation between the absolute equilibrium state of the spectrally truncated Euler
equations (TEE) predicted by Kraichnan (1973) to the forced and dissipated flows of the spectrally
truncated Navier-Stokes (TNS) equations. In both of these idealized systems a finite number of
Fourier modes is kept contained inside a sphere of radius $k_{max}$ but while the first conserves
energy in the second energy is injected by a body-force $\bf{f}$ and dissipated by the viscosity
$\nu$. For the TNS system stochastically forced with energy injection rate $\mathcal{I}_\mathcal{E}$
we show, using an asymptotic expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation, that in the limit of small
$k_{max}\eta$ (where $\eta=(\nu^3/\mathcal{I}_\mathcal{E})^{1/4}$ the Kolmogorov lengthscale)
the flow approaches the absolute equilibrium solution of Kraichnan with such an effective "temperature"
so that there is a balance between the energy injection and the energy dissipation rate. Numerical
simulations verify the predictions of the model for small values of $k_{max}\eta$. For intermediate
values of $k_{max}\eta$ a transition from the quasi-equilibrium "thermal" state to Kolmogorov
turbulence is observed. If the forcing is applied at small scales and the dissipation acts only at
large scales then the equipartition spectrum appears at all scales for all values of $\nu$. In both
cases a finite forward or inverse flux is present even for the cases where the flow is close to the equilibrium
state solutions. However, unlike the classical turbulence where an energy cascade develops with
a mean energy flux that is large compared to its fluctuations, the quasi-equilibrium state has a
mean flux of energy that is subdominant to the large flux fluctuations observed.
