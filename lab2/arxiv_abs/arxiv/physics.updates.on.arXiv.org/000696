The interaction of organic molecules and molecular aggregates with electromagnetic fields that
are strongly confined inside optical cavities within nanoscale volumes, has allowed the observation
of exotic quantum regimes of light-matter interaction at room temperature, for a wide variety of
cavity materials and geometries. Understanding the universal features of such organic cavities
represents a significant challenge for theoretical modelling, as experiments show that these
systems are characterized by an intricate competition between coherent and dissipative processes
involving entangled nuclear, electronic and photonic degrees of freedom. In this review, we discuss
a new theoretical framework that can successfully describe organic cavities under strong light-matter
coupling. The theory combines standard concepts in chemical physics and quantum optics to provide
a microscopic description of vibronic organic polaritons that is fully consistent with available
experiments, and yet is profoundly different from the common view of organic polaritons. We show
that by introducing a new class of vibronic polariton wave functions with a photonic component that
is dressed by intramolecular vibrations, the new theory can offer a consistent solution to some
of the long-standing puzzles in the interpretation of organic cavity photoluminescence. Throughout
this review, we confront the predictions of the model with spectroscopic observations, and describe
the conditions under which the theory reduces to previous approaches. We finally discuss possible
extensions of the theory to account for realistic complexities of organic cavities such spatial
inhomogeneities and the multi-mode nature of confined electromagnetic fields.
