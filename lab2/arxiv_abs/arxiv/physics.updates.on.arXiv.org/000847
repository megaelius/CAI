The interactions between PM2.5 and meteorological factors play a crucial role in air pollution
analysis. However, previous studies that have researched the relationships between PM2.5 concentration
and meteorological conditions have been mainly confined to a certain city or district, and the correlation
over the whole of China remains unclear. Whether or not spatial and seasonal variations exit deserves
further research. In this study, the relationships between PM2.5 concentration and meteorological
factors were investigated in 74 major cities in China for a continuous period of 22 months from February
2013 to November 2014, at season, year, city, and regional scales, and the spatial and seasonal variations
were analyzed. The meteorological factors were relative humidity (RH), temperature (TEM), wind
speed (WS), and surface pressure (PS). We found that spatial and seasonal variations of their relationships
with PM2.5 do exist. Spatially, RH is positively correlated with PM2.5 concentration in North China
and Urumqi, but the relationship turns to negative in other areas of China. WS is negatively correlated
with PM2.5 everywhere expect for Hainan Island. PS has a strong positive relationship with PM2.5
concentration in Northeast China and Mid-south China, and in other areas the correlation is weak.
Seasonally, the positive correlation between PM2.5 concentration and RH is stronger in winter
and spring. TEM has a negative relationship with PM2.5 in autumn and the opposite in winter. PS is
more positively correlated with PM2.5 in autumn than in other seasons. Our study investigated the
relationships between PM2.5 and meteorological factors in terms of spatial and seasonal variations,
and the conclusions about the relationships between PM2.5 and meteorological factors are more
comprehensive and precise than before.
