The 'Ocean Worlds' of our Solar System are covered with ice, hence the water is not directly accessible.
Using melting probe technology is one of the promising technological approaches to reach those
scientifically interesting water reservoirs. Melting probes basically consist of a heated melting
head on top of an elongated body that contains the scientific payload. The traditional engineering
approach to design such melting probes starts from a global energy balance around the melting head
and quantifies the power necessary to sustain a specific melting velocity while preventing the
probe from refreezing and stall in the channel. Though this approach is sufficient to design simple
melting probes for terrestrial applications, it is too simplistic to study the probe's performance
for environmental conditions found on some of the Ocean's Worlds, e.g. a lower value of the gravitational
acceleration. This will be important, however, when designing exploration technologies for extraterrestrial
purposes. We tackle the problem by explicitly modeling the physical processes in the thin melt film
between the probe and the underlying ice. Our model allows to study melting regimes on bodies of different
gravitational acceleration, and we explicitly compare melting regimes on Europa, Enceladus and
Mars. In addition to that, our model allows to quantify the heat losses due to convective transport
around the melting probe. We discuss to which extent these heat losses can be utilized to avoid the
necessity of a side wall heating system to prevent stall, and introduce the notion of the 'Critical
Refreezing Length'. Our results allow to draw important conclusions towards the design of melting
probe technology for future missions to icy bodies in our Solar System.
