The robust and automated determination of crystal symmetry is of utmost importance in material
characterization and analysis. Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) methods can effectively
reveal the correlations between X-ray or electron-beam diffraction patterns and crystal symmetry.
Despite their promise, most of these studies have been limited to identifying relatively few classes
into which a target material may be grouped. On the other hand, the DL-based identification of crystal
symmetry suffers from a drastic drop in accuracy for problems involving classification into tens
or hundreds of symmetry classes (e.g., up to 230 space groups), severely limiting its practical
usage. Here, we demonstrate that a combined approach of shaping diffraction patterns and implementing
them in a multistream DenseNet (MSDN) substantially improves the accuracy of classification.
Even with an imbalanced dataset of 108,658 individual crystals sampled from 72 space groups, our
model achieves 80.2% space group classification accuracy, outperforming conventional benchmark
models by 17-27 percentage points (%p). The enhancement can be largely attributed to the pattern
shaping strategy, through which the subtle changes in patterns between symmetrically close crystal
systems (e.g., monoclinic vs. orthorhombic or trigonal vs. hexagonal) are well differentiated.
We additionally find that the novel MSDN architecture is advantageous for capturing patterns in
a richer but less redundant manner relative to conventional convolutional neural networks. The
newly proposed protocols in regard to both input descriptor processing and DL architecture enable
accurate space group classification and thus improve the practical usage of the DL approach in crystal
symmetry identification.
