Because the grand unification theory of gauge theories of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions
is based on principal bundle theory, and gravitational theory is based on the tangent vector bundle
theory, so people cannot unify the these four basic interactions in principal bundle theory. This
paper gives unification description theory of the grand unification theory and gravitation theory
and the new physics, i.e., the unification description theory of strong, weak, electromagnetic
and gravitational interactions and the new physics according to the general fiber bundle theory,
symmetry, quantitative causal principle (QCP) etc. Consequently, the research of this paper is
based on the exact scientific bases of physics. The Lagrangians of the well-known fundamental physics
interactions are unifiedly deduced from QCP and satisfy the gauge invariant principle of general
gauge fields interacting with Fermion and/or boson fields. The geometry and physics meanings of
gauge invariant property of different physical systems are revealed, and it is discovered that
all the Lagrangians of the well-known fundamental physics interactions are composed of the invariant
quantities in corresponding spacetime structures. The difficulties that fundamental physics
interactions and Noether theorem are not able to be unifiedly given and investigated are overcome,
the unified description and origin of the fundamental physics interactions and Noether theorem
are shown by QCP, their two-order general Euler-Lagrange Equations and Noether currents are derived
in general curved spacetime. This paper further deduces QCP from symmetric principle. Consequently,
unification description theory of the grand unification and gravitation theories and Noether
theorem based on symmetric principle and its new physics are given in this paper. This paper gives
the unification of QCP and symmetric principle.
