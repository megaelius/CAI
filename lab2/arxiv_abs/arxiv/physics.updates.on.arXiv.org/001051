The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a neutrino experiment to determine neutrino
mass hierarchy. It has a central detector used for neutrino detection, which consists of a spherical
acrylic vessel containing 20 kt LS and about 18,000 20-inch PMTs to collect light from LS. Around
the CD, there is a water pool to shield radioactivities. The WP is equipped with about 2000 PMTs to
measure cosmic ray muons by detecting Cherenkov light. As one of the important parts in JUNO offline
software, the serial simulation framework is developed based on SNiPER. It is in charge of physics
generator, detector simulation, event mixing and digitization. However Geant4 based detector
simulation of such a large detector is time-consuming and challenging. It is necessary to take full
advantages of parallel computing to speedup simulation. Starting from version 10, Geant4 supports
event-level parallelism. Even though based on pthread, it could be extended with other libraries
such as Intel TBB. Therefore it is possible to parallelize JUNO simulation framework via integrating
Geant4 and SNiPER. In this paper, our progress in developing parallelized simulation software
are presented. The SNiPER framework can run in sequential mode, Intel TBB mode or other modes. The
SNiPER task component is in charge of event loop, which is like a simplified application manager.
Two types of tasks are introduced in the simulation framework, one is global task and another is worker
task. The global task will run only once to initialize detector geometry and physics processes.
The worker tasks will be spawned after global task is done. In each worker task, a Geant4 run manager
is invoked to do the real simulation. Therefore the simulation framework and the underlying TBB
have been decoupled. Finally, the software performance of parallelized JUNO simulation software
is also presented.
