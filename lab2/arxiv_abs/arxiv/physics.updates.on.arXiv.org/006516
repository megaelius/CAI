We derive a low-scaling $G_0W_0$ algorithm for molecules, using pair atomic density fitting (PADF)
and a imaginary time representation of the Green's function and describe its implementation in
the Slater type orbital (STO) based Amsterdam density functional (ADF) electronic structure code.
We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm on a series of water clusters with up to 432 atoms
and 7776 basis functions and observe asymptotic quadratic scaling with realistic threshold qualities
controlling distance effects and basis sets of triple-$\zeta$ (TZ) plus double polarization quality.
Also owing to a very small prefactor, with these settings a $G_0W_0$ calculation for the largest
of these clusters takes only 240 CPU hours. We assess the accuracy of our algorithm for HOMO and LUMO
energies in the GW100 database. With errors of 0.26 eV for HOMO and 0.55 eV for LUMO energies on the
QZ-level for GW100, our implementation is less accurate that canonical all-electron implementations
using GTO-tpye basis sets. This is related to the well-known shortcomings of the GW space-time method
using analytical continuation techniques as well as to numerical issues of the PADF-approach of
accurately representing diffuse AO-products. We speculate, that this issue might be overcome
by using optimized auxiliary fit sets with more diffuse functions of higher angular momenta. Despite
these shortcomings, for medium and large molecules from the GW5000 database, the error of our approach
using basis sets of TZ and augmented DZ quality is decreasing with system size. On the augmented DZ
level we reproduce canonical, complete basis set limit extrapolated reference values with an accuracy
of 80 meV on average for 20 large organic molecules. We anticipate our algorithm, in its current form,
to be useful in the study of single-particle properties of large organic systems such as chromophores
and acceptor molecules.
