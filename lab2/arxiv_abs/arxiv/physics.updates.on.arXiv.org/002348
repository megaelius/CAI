This paper addresses the integral energy fluxes in natural and controlled turbulent channel flows,
where active skin-friction drag reduction techniques allow a more efficient use of the available
power. We study whether the increased efficiency shows any general trend in how energy is dissipated
by the mean velocity field (mean dissipation) and by the fluctuating velocity field (turbulent
dissipation). Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of different control strategies are performed
at Constant Power Input (CPI), so that at statistical equilibrium each flow (either uncontrolled
or controlled by different means) has the same power input, hence the same global energy flux and,
by definition, the same total energy dissipation rate. The simulations reveal that changes in mean
and turbulent energy dissipation rates can be of either sign in a successfully controlled flow.
A quantitative description of these changes is made possible by a new decomposition of the total
dissipation, stemming from an extended Reynolds decomposition, where the mean velocity is split
into a laminar component and a deviation from it. Thanks to the analytical expressions of the laminar
quantities, exact relationships are derived that link the achieved flow rate increase and all energy
fluxes in the flow system with two wall-normal integrals of the Reynolds shear stress and the Reynolds
number. The dependence of the energy fluxes on the Reynolds number is elucidated with a simple model
in which the control-dependent changes of the Reynolds shear stress are accounted for via a modification
of the mean velocity profile. The physical meaning of the energy fluxes stemming from the new decomposition
unveils their inter-relations and connection to flow control, so that a clear target for flow control
can be identified.
