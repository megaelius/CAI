Von Hoerner (1975) examined the effects of human population growth and predicted agricultural,
environmental, and other problems from observed growth rate trends. Using straightforward calculations,
VH75 predicted the "doomsday" years for these scenarios (2020-2050), when we as a species should
run out of space or food, or induce catastrophic anthropogenic climate change through thermodynamically
unavoidable direct heating of the planet. Now that over four decades have passed, in this paper we
update VH75. We perform similar calculations as that work, with improved data and trends in population
growth, food production, energy use, and climate change. For many of the impacts noted in VH75 our
work amounts to pushing the "doomsday" horizon back to the 2300s-2400s (or much further for population-driven
interstellar colonization). This is largely attributable to using worldwide data that exhibit
smaller growth rates of population and energy use in the last few decades. While population-related
catastrophes appear less likely than in VH75, our continued growth in energy use provides insight
into possible future issues. We find that, if historic trends continue, direct heating of the Earth
will be a substantial contributor to climate change by about 2260, regardless of the energy source
used, coincident with our transition to a Kardashev type-I civilization. We also determine that
either an increase of Earth's global mean temperature of 12K will occur or an unreasonably high fraction
of the planet will need to be covered by solar collectors by about 2400 to keep pace with our growth
in energy use. We further discuss the implications in terms of interstellar expansion, the transition
to type II and III civilizations, SETI, and the Fermi Paradox. We conclude that the "sustainability
solution" to the Fermi Paradox is a compelling possibility.
