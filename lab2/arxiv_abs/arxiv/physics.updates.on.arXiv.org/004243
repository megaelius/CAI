The present work is aimed to explain why we started to consider Vibrating Rays Theory (VRT) as a viable
representation of nature, and to elaborate some of its consequences. In 1846 Faraday introduced
the concept of vibrating rays, in which an atom is conceived as having rays that extend to infinity
and move with it. According to this point of view, electromagnetic radiative phenomena correspond
to vibration of these rays, which propagate at speed c relative to the rays (and the atom). Although
a discussion on this subject might seem to be out-of-date, there are many reasons that justified
this debate. The first reason is based on the fact that the constancy of the speed of light, irrespective
of the source movement, has not been demonstrated experimentally in a conclusive way. In fact, only
ballistic emission theories can be discarded by the experimental results. The second reason is
based on the fact that study of radiometric data from spacecrafts indicates the existence of different
kinds of anomalous Doppler residuals. We will show that these anomalies exhibit a signature of Vibrating
Rays Theory. The third reason is related to the time definition in a rotating frame. According to
SRT there is not a unique way to assign a time, whereas under VRT no contradictions are present. And
finally, that a properly stated Vibrating Rays Theory is compatible with all known experiments
on electromagnetism and light propagation. In the present work we will (1) explain how VRT should
be interpreted, and why past experiments were misinterpreted, (2) show the characteristics of
VRT that are present in spacecraft anomalies, (3) give a possible theoretical model (including
the possible presence of longitudinal waves), and (4) describe results in an ongoing experiment
designed to distinguish between VRT and SRT models.
