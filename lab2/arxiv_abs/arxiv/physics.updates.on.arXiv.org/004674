In addition to the common 3-body decay of the neutron $n\rightarrow p e^-\overline{\nu_e}$ there
should exist an effective 2-body subset with the electron and proton forming a Hydrogen bound state
with well defined total momentum, total spin and magnetic quantum numbers. The atomic spectroscopic
analysis of this bound system can reveal details about the underlying weak interaction as it mirrors
the helicity distributions of all outgoing particles. Thus, it is unique in the information it carries,
and an experiment unravelling this information is an analogue to the Goldhaber experiment performed
more than 60 years ago. The proposed experiment will search for monoenergetic metastable BoB H atoms
with 326 eV kinetic energy, which are generated at the center of a throughgoing beamtube of a high-flux
reactor (e.g., at the PIK reactor, Gatchina). Although full spectroscopic information is needed
to possibly reveal new physics our first aim is to prove the occurrence of this decay and learn about
backgrounds. Key to the detection is the identification of a monoerergtic line of hydrogen atoms
occurring at a rate of about 1 $\rm{s}^{-1}$ in the environment of many hydrogen atoms, however having
a thermal distribution of about room temperature. Two scenarios for velocity (energy) filtering
are discussed in this paper. The first builds on an purely electric chopper system, in which metastable
hydrogen atoms are quenched to their ground state and thus remain mostly undetectable. This chopper
system employs fast switchable Bradbury Nielsen gates. The second method exploits a strongly energy
dependent charge exchange process of metastable hydrogen picking up an electron while traversing
an argon filled gas cell, turning it into manipulable charged hydrogen. The final detection of hydrogen
occurs through multichannel plate (MCP) detector.
