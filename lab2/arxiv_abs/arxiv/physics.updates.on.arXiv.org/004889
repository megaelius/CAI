The ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates is one of the fundamental open questions in neutrino
physics. While current-generation neutrino oscillation experiments are able to produce moderate
indications on this ordering, upcoming experiments of the next generation aim to provide conclusive
evidence. In this paper we study the combined performance of the two future multi-purpose neutrino
oscillation experiments JUNO and the IceCube Upgrade, which employ two very distinct and complementary
routes towards the neutrino mass ordering. The approach pursued by the $20\,\mathrm{kt}$ medium-baseline
reactor neutrino experiment JUNO consists of a careful investigation of the energy spectrum of
oscillated $\bar{\nu}_e$ produced by ten nuclear reactor cores. The IceCube Upgrade, on the other
hand, which consists of seven additional densely instrumented strings deployed in the center of
IceCube DeepCore, will observe large numbers of atmospheric neutrinos that have undergone oscillations
affected by Earth matter. In a joint fit with both approaches, tension occurs between their preferred
mass-squared differences $ \Delta m_{31}^{2}=m_{3}^{2}-m_{1}^{2} $ within the wrong mass ordering.
In the case of JUNO and the IceCube Upgrade, this allows to exclude the wrong ordering at $>5\sigma$
on a timescale of 3--7 years --- even under circumstances that are unfavorable to the experiments'
individual sensitivities. For PINGU, a 26-string detector array designed as a potential low-energy
extension to IceCube, the inverted ordering could be excluded within 1.5 years (3 years for the normal
ordering) in a joint analysis.
