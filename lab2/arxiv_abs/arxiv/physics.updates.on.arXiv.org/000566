The Jefferson Lab Q_weak experiment determined the weak charge of the proton by measuring the parity-violating
elastic scattering asymmetry of longitudinally polarized electrons from an unpolarized liquid
hydrogen target at small momentum transfer. A custom apparatus was designed for this experiment
to meet the technical challenges presented by the smallest and most precise ${\vec{e}}$p asymmetry
ever measured. Technical milestones were achieved at Jefferson Lab in target power, beam current,
beam helicity reversal rate, polarimetry, detected rates, and control of helicity-correlated
beam properties. The experiment employed 180 microA of 89% longitudinally polarized electrons
whose helicity was reversed 960 times per second. The electrons were accelerated to 1.16 GeV and
directed to a beamline with extensive instrumentation to measure helicity-correlated beam properties
that can induce false asymmetries. Moller and Compton polarimetry were used to measure the electron
beam polarization to better than 1%. The electron beam was incident on a 34.4 cm liquid hydrogen target.
After passing through a triple collimator system, scattered electrons between 5.8 degrees and
11.6 degrees were bent in the toroidal magnetic field of a resistive copper-coil magnet. The electrons
inside this acceptance were focused onto eight fused silica Cerenkov detectors arrayed symmetrically
around the beam axis. A total scattered electron rate of about 7 GHz was incident on the detector array.
The detectors were read out in integrating mode by custom-built low-noise pre-amplifiers and 18-bit
sampling ADC modules. The momentum transfer Q^2 = 0.025 GeV^2 was determined using dedicated low-current
(~100 pA) measurements with a set of drift chambers before (and a set of drift chambers and trigger
scintillation counters after) the toroidal magnet.
