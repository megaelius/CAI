We report on the development of the thallium-doped cesium iodide (CsI:Tl) calorimeter subsystem
for the All-Sky Medium-Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO) [1]. The CsI:Tl calorimeter is one
of the three main subsystems that comprise the AMEGO instrument suite; the others include the double-sided
silicon strip detector (DSSD) tracker/converter and a cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) calorimeter.
Similar to the LAT instrument on Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the hodoscopic calorimeter consists
of orthogonally layered CsI:Tl bars. Unlike the LAT, which uses PIN photodiodes, the scintillation
light from each end of the CsI:Tl bar is read out with recently developed large-area silicon photomultiplier
(SiPM) arrays. Development of the calorimeter technology for a large space-based {\gamma}-ray
observatory is being done via funding from the NASA APRA program. Under this program, we have designed,
built and are currently testing a prototype consisting of 24 CsI:Tl bars (each with dimensions of
16.7 mm x 16.7 mm x 100 mm) hodoscopically arranged in four layers with six bars per layer. The ends
of each bar are read out with SensL ArrayJ quad SiPMs. Signal readout and processing is done with the
IDEAS SIPHRA (IDE3380) ASIC. Performance testing of this prototype was done with laboratory sources
and at an initial beam test; future testing and characterization will be done during a second beam
test (2019) and a balloon flight (2020) in conjunction with the other subsystems led by NASA-GSFC.
We will discuss the initial calibration tests, construction of the prototypes and the most up-to-date
results from laboratory and beam tests with analog/digital electronics and the SIPHRA DAQ.
