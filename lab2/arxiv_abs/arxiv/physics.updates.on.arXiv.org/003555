Metabolism and evolution are closely connected: if a mutation incurs extra energetic costs for
an organism, there is a baseline selective disadvantage that may or may not be compensated for by
other adaptive effects. A long-standing, but to date unproven, hypothesis is that this disadvantage
is equal to the fractional cost relative to the total resting metabolic expenditure. This hypothesis
has found a recent resurgence as a powerful tool for quantitatively understanding the strength
of selection among different classes of organisms. Our work explores the validity of the hypothesis
from first principles through a generalized metabolic growth model, versions of which have been
successful in describing organismal growth from single cells to higher animals. We build a mathematical
framework to calculate how perturbations in maintenance and synthesis costs translate into contributions
to the selection coefficient. This allows us to show that the hypothesis is an approximation to the
actual baseline selection coefficient. Moreover we can derive the correct prefactor in its functional
form, as well as analytical bounds on its accuracy for any given realization of the model. We illustrate
our general framework using a special case of the growth model, which we show provides a quantitative
description of metabolic expenditures in data collected from a wide array of unicellular organisms
(both prokaryotes and eukaryotes). In all these cases we demonstrate that the hypothesis is an excellent
approximation, allowing estimates of baseline selection coefficients to within 15% of their actual
values. Even in a broader biological parameter range, covering growth data from multicellular
organisms, the hypothesis continues to work well, always within an order of magnitude of the correct
result. Our work thus justifies its use as a versatile tool, setting the stage for its wider deployment.
