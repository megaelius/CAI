A concept of a high-power magnetron transmitter for operation within a wideband control feedback
loop in phase and amplitude is presented. This transmitter is proposed to drive Superconducting
RF (SRF) cavities for intensity-frontier GeV-scale proton/ion linacs. The transmitter performance
at the dynamic control was verified in experiments with CW, S-Band, 1 kW magnetrons. The wideband
control of magnetrons, required for the superconducting linacs, was realized using the magnetrons,
injection-locked by the phase-modulated signals. The capabilities of the magnetrons injection-locked
by the phase-modulated signals and adequateness for feeding of SRF cavities were verified by measurements
of the transfer function magnitude characteristics of single and 2-cascade magnetrons, by measurements
the magnetrons phase performance and by measurements of spectra of the carrier frequency. At the
ratio of power of locking signal to output power less than -13 dB (in 2-cascade scheme per magnetron,
respectively) we demonstrated a phase modulation bandwidth of over 1.0 MHz. The carrier frequency
spectrum width about of 1 Hz at the level less than -60 dBc did not demonstrate broadening at wide range
of magnitude and frequency of the phase modulation of the injection-locking signal. The wideband
dynamic control of output power of the transmitter model was first experimentally demonstrated
using two magnetrons, combined in power and injection-locked by the phase-modulated signals.
The experiments with the injection-locked magnetrons adequately emulated the wideband dynamic
control with a feedback control system, which will allow suppressing all known parasitic modulation
of the accelerating field in the SRF cavities. The magnetron transmitter concept, tests of the setups
and injection-locking of magnetrons by phase-modulated signals are discussed in this work.
