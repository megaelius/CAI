Electro-optic modulators are utilized ubiquitously ranging from applications in data communication
to photonic neural networks. While tremendous progress has been made over the years, efficient
phase-shifting modulators are challenged with fundamental tradeoffs, such as voltage-length,
index change-losses or energy-bandwidth, and no single solution available checks all boxes. While
voltage-driven phase modulators, such as based on lithium niobate, offer low loss and high speed
operation, their footprint of 10's of cm-scale is prohibitively large, especially for density-critical
applications, for example in photonic neural networks. Ignoring modulators for quantum applications,
where loss is critical, here we distinguish between current versus voltage-driven modulators.
We focus on the former, since current-based schemes of emerging thin electro-optical materials
have shown unity-strong index modulation suitable for heterogeneous integration into foundry
waveguides. Here, we provide an in-depth ab-initio analysis of obtainable modulator performance
based on heterogeneously integrating low-dimensional materials, i.e. graphene, thin films of
indium tin oxide, and transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers into a plurality of optical waveguide
designs atop silicon photonics. Using the fundamental modulator tradeoff of energy-bandwidth-product
as a design-quality quantifier, we show that a small modal cross section, such as given by plasmonic
modes, enables high-performance operation, physically realized by arguments on charge-distribution
and low electrical resistance. An in-depth design understanding of phase-modulator performance,
beyond doped-junctions in silicon, offers opportunities for micrometer-compact yet energy-bandwidth-ratio
constrained modulators with timely opportunities to hardware-accelerate applications beyond
data communication towards photonic machine intelligence.
