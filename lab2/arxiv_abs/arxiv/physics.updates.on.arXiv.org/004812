The mechanical behavior of antigorite strongly influences the strength and deformation of the
subduction interface. Although there is microstructural evidence elucidating the nature of brittle
deformation at low pressures, there is often conflicting evidence regarding the potential for
plastic deformation in the ductile regime at higher pressures. Here, we present a series of spherical
nanoindentation experiments on aggregates of natural antigorite. These experiments effectively
investigate the single-crystal mechanical behavior because the volume of deformed material is
significantly smaller than the grain size. Individual indents reveal elastic loading followed
by yield and strain hardening. The magnitude of the yield stress is a function of crystal orientation,
with lower values associated with indents parallel to the basal plane. Unloading paths reveal more
strain recovery than expected for purely elastic unloading. The magnitude of inelastic strain
recovery is highest for indents parallel to the basal plane. We also imposed indents with cyclical
loading paths, and observed strain energy dissipation during unloading-loading cycles conducted
up to a fixed maximum indentation load and depth. The magnitude of this dissipated strain energy
was highest for indents parallel to the basal plane. Subsequent scanning electron microscopy revealed
surface impressions accommodated by shear cracks and a general lack of lattice misorientation
around indents, indicating the absence of dislocations. Based on these observations, we suggest
that antigorite deformation at high pressures is dominated by sliding on shear cracks. We develop
a microphysical model that is able to quantitatively explain the Young's modulus and dissipated
strain energy data during cyclic loading experiments, based on either frictional or cohesive sliding
of an array of cracks contained in the basal plane.
