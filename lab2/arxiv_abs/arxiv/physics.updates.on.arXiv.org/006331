The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of compressible isotropic turbulence up to the supersonic
regime $Ma_{t} = 1.2$ has been investigated by high-order gas-kinetic scheme (HGKS) [{\it{Computers}}
\& {\it{Fluids, 192, 2019}}]. In this study, the coarse-grained analysis of subgrid-scale (SGS)
turbulent kinetic energy $K_{sgs}$ budget is fully analyzed for constructing one-equation SGS
model in the compressible large eddy simulation (LES). The DNS on a much higher turbulent Mach number
up to $Ma_{t} = 2.0$ has been obtained by HGKS, which confirms the super robustness of HGKS. Then,
the exact compressible SGS turbulent kinetic energy $K_{sgs}$ transport equation is derived with
density weighted filtering process. Based on the compressible $K_{sgs}$ transport equation,
the coarse-grained processes are implemented on three sets of unresolved grids with the Box filter.
The coarse-grained analysis of compressible $K_{sgs}$ budgets shows that all unresolved source
terms are dominant terms in current system. Especially, the magnitude of SGS pressure-dilation
term is in the order of SGS solenoidal dissipation term within the initial acoustic time scale. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the SGS pressure-dilation term cannot be neglected as the previous work.
The delicate coarse-grained analysis of SGS diffusion terms in compressible $K_{sgs}$ equation
confirms that both the fluctuation velocity triple correlation term and the pressure-velocity
correlation term are dominant terms. Current coarse-grained analysis gives an indication of the
order of magnitude of all SGS terms in compressible $K_{sgs}$ budget, which provides a solid basis
for compressible LES modeling in high Mach number turbulent flow.
