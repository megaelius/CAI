Background: Northern Italy was one of the most impacted areas by COVID. It is now widely assumed that
the virus was silently spreading for at least 2 weeks before the first patient was identified. During
this silent phase, and in the following weeks when the hospital system was overburdened, data collection
was not performed in an accurate enough way to estimate an epidemic curve. With the aim of assessing
both the dynamics of the introduction of the virus and the effectiveness of containment measures
introduced, we try to reconstruct the epidemic curve using all cause mortality data. Methods: we
collected all cause mortality data stratified by age from the national institute of statistics,
together with COVID-related deaths data released by other government structures. Using a SEIR
model together with estimates of the exposure to death time distribution, we fitted the reproduction
number in different phases of the spread at regional level. Results: We estimate a reproduction
number of 2.6+/-0.1 before case 1 was identified. School closures in Lombardy lowered it to 1.3.
Soft lockdown measures resulted in R<0.8 and no further reductions were observed when a hard lockdown
was introduced (e.g. Emilia-Romagna soft lockdown 0.67 +/-0.07, hard lockdown 0.69+/-0.071).
Reproduction number for the >75 age range during hard lockdown are consistently higher than for
the rest of the population (e.g. 0.98 vs 0.71 in Milan province), suggesting outbreaks in retirement
facilities. Reproduction numbers in Bergamo and Brescia provinces starting from March 7th are
markedly lower than in other areas with the same strict lockdown measures (Nearby provinces: 0.73,
Brescia: 0.52, Bergamo 0.43) supporting the hypothesis that in those provinces a large percentage
of the population had already been infected by the beginning of March.
