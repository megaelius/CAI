How to artificially encode observer in universal information coding structure like DNA ? It requires
naturally creating information Bits and natural encoding triplet code enables recognizing other
encoded information. These Bits becomes standard units of different information languages in
modern communications. Fundamental interactions build structure of Universe. Numerous multilevel
inter-species interactions selforganize biosystems. Human interactions unify these and many
others. Physical reality is only interactions identified or not yet. Each inter-action is elementary
yes-no action of impulse which models a natural Bit. Natural interactive process, transferring
Bits, models information process. Information is universal physical substance a phenomenon of
interaction which not only originates information but transfers it sequentially. Mutually interacting
processes enable creating new elements like that in chemical chain reactions. The elements, enclosing
components of reaction, memorize the interactive yes-no result similar to encoding. The energy
quantity and quality of specific interaction determine the sequence of transferring information,
its encoding, and limit the code length. The introduced formalism of both natural emergence information
and its encoding also shows advantage over non-natural encoding. The impulse sequential natural
encoding merges memory with the time of memorizing information and compensates the cost by running
time intervals of encoding. Information process binds the encoding impulse reversible microprocesses
in multiple impulses macroprocess of information irreversible dynamics. The encoding process
integrates geometrical triplet coding structure rotating double helix of sequencing cells Bits.
The results validate computer simulation, experiments in coding genetic information, experimental
encoding by spiking neurons, others.
