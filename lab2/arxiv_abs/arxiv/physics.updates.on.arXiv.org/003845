Cell migration in fibreous extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial to many physiological and pathological
processes such as tissue regeneration, immune response and cancer progression. During migration,
individual cells can generate active pulling forces via actin filament contraction, which are
transmitted to the ECM fibers through focal adhesion complexes, remodel the ECM, and eventually
propagate to and can be sensed by other cells in the system. The microstructure and physical properties
of the ECM can also significantly influence cell migration, e.g., via durotaxis and contact guidance.
Here, we develop a computational model for cell migration regulated by cell-ECM micro-mechanical
coupling. Our model explicitly takes into account a variety of cellular level processes including
focal adhesion formation and disassembly, active traction force generation and cell locomotion
due to actin filament contraction, transmission and propagation of tensile forces in the ECM, as
well as the resulting ECM remodeling. We validate our model by accurately reproducing single-cell
dynamics of MCF-10A breast cancer cells migrating on collagen gels and show that the durotaxis and
contact guidance effects naturally arise as a consequence of the cell-ECM micro-mechanical interactions
considered in the model. Moreover, our model predicts strongly correlated multi-cellular migration
dynamics, which are resulted from the ECM-mediated mechanical coupling among the migrating cell
and are subsequently verified in {\it in vitro} experiments using MCF-10A cells. Our computational
model provides a robust tool to investigate emergent collective dynamics of multi-cellular systems
in complex {\it in vivo} micro-environment and can be utilized to design {\it in vitro} micro-environments
to guide collective behaviors and self-organization of cells.
