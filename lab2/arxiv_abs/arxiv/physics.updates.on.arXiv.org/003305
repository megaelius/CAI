A multi-fidelity surrogate model for highly nonlinear multiscale problems is proposed. It is based
on the introduction of two different surrogate models and an adaptive on-the-fly switching. The
two concurrent surrogates are built incrementally starting from a moderate set of evaluations
of the full order model. Therefrom, a reduced order model (ROM) is generated. Using a hybrid ROM-preconditioned
FE solver additional effective stress-strain data is simulated while the number of samples is kept
to a moderate level by using a dedicated and physics-guided sampling technique. Machine learning
(ML) is subsequently used to build the second surrogate by means of artificial neural networks (ANN).
Different ANN architectures are explored and the features used as inputs of the ANN are fine tuned
in order to improve the overall quality of the ML model. Additional ML surrogates for the stress errors
are generated. Therefore, conservative design guidelines for error surrogates are presented
by adapting the loss functions of the ANN training in pure regression or pure classification settings.
The error surrogates can be used as quality indicators in order to adaptively select the appropriate---i.e.
efficient yet accurate---surrogate. Two strategies for the on-the-fly switching are investigated
and a practicable and robust algorithm is proposed that eliminates relevant technical difficulties
attributed to model switching. The provided algorithms and ANN design guidelines can easily be
adopted for different problem settings and, thereby, they enable generalization of the used machine
learning techniques for a wide range of applications. The resulting hybrid surrogate is employed
in challenging multilevel FE simulations for a three-phase composite with pseudo-plastic micro-constituents.
Numerical examples highlight the performance of the proposed approach.
