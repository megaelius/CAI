Movement of soil moisture associated with tree root-water uptake is ecologically important, but
technically challenging to measure. Here, the self-potential (SP) method, a passive electrical
geophysical method, is used to characterize water flow in situ. Unlike tensiometers, which use
a measurement of state (i.e. matric pressure) at two locations to infer fluid flow, the SP method
directly measures signals generated by water movement. We collected SP measurements in a two-dimensional
array at the base of a Douglas-fir tree (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in the H.J. Andrews Experimental
Forest in western Oregon over five months to provide insight on the propagation of transpiration
signals into the subsurface under variable soil moisture. During dry conditions, SP data appear
to show downward unsaturated flow, while nearby tensiometer data appear to suggest upward flow
during this period. After the trees enter dormancy in the fall, precipitation-induced vertical
flow dominates in the SP and tensiometer data. Diel variations in SP data correspond to periods of
tree transpiration. Changes in volumetric water content occurring from soil moisture movement
during transpiration are not large enough to appear in volumetric water content data. Fluid flow
and electrokinetic coupling (i.e. electrical potential distribution) were simulated using COMSOL
Multiphysics to explore the system controls on field data. The coupled model, which included a root-water
uptake term, reproduced components of both the long-term and diel variations in SP measurements,
thus indicating that SP has potential to provide spatially and temporally dense measurements of
transpiration-induced changes in water flow. This manuscript presents the first SP measurements
focusing on the movement of soil moisture in response to tree transpiration.
