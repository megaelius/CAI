In planetary fluid cores, the density depends on temperature and chemical composition, which diffuse
at very different rates. This leads to various instabilities, bearing the name of double-diffusive
convection. We investigate rotating double-diffusive convection (RDDC) in fluid spheres. We
use the Boussinesq approximation with homogeneous internal thermal and compositional source
terms. We focus on the finger regime, in which the thermal gradient is stabilising whereas the compositional
one is destabilising. First, we perform a global linear stability analysis in spheres. The critical
Rayleigh numbers drastically drop for stably-stratified fluids, yielding large-scale convective
motions where local analyses predict stability. We evidence the inviscid nature of this large-scale
double-diffusive instability, enabling the determination of the marginal stability curve at
realistic planetary regimes. In particular , we show that in stably-stratified spheres, the Rayleigh
numbers Ra at the onset evolve like $Ra $\sim$ Ek^{-1}$ , where Ek is the Ekman number. This differs
from rotating convection in unstably-stratified spheres, for which $Ra $\sim$ Ek^{-4/3}$. The
domain of existence of inviscid convection thus increases as $Ek^{-1/3}$. Second, we perform nonlinear
simulations. We find a transition between two regimes of RDDC, controlled by the strength of the
stratification. Furthermore, far from the RDDC onset, we find a dominating equatorially anti-symmetric,
large-scale zonal flow slightly above the associated linear onset. Unexpectedly, a purely linear
mechanism can explain this phenomenon, even far from the instability onset, yielding a symmetry
breaking of the nonlinear flow at saturation. For even stronger stable straficiation, the flow
becomes mainly equatorially-symmetric and intense zonal jets develop. Finally, we apply our results
to the early Earth core. Double diffusion can reduce the critical Rayleigh number by four decades
for realistic core conditions. We suggest that the early Earth core was prone to turbulent RDDC,
with large-scale zonal flows.
