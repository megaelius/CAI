While of paramount importance in material science, the dynamics of cracks still lacks a complete
physical explanation. The transition from their slow creep behavior to a fast propagation regime
is a notable key, as it leads to full material failure if the size of a fast avalanche reaches that of
the system. We here show that a simple thermodynamics approach can actually account for such complex
crack dynamics, and in particular for the non-monotonic force-velocity curves commonly observed
in mechanical tests on various materials. We consider a thermally activated failure process that
is coupled with the production and the diffusion of heat at the fracture tip. In this framework, the
rise in temperature only affects the sub-critical crack dynamics and not the mechanical properties
of the material. We show that this description can quantitatively reproduce the rupture of two different
polymeric materials (namely, the mode I opening of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates, and
the peeling of pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) tapes), from the very slow to the very fast fracturing
regimes, over seven to nine decades of crack propagation velocities. In particular, the fastest
regime is obtained with an increase of temperature of thousands of kelvins, on the molecular scale
around the crack tip. Although surprising, such an extreme temperature is actually consistent
with different experimental observations that accompany the fast propagation of cracks, namely,
fractoluminescence (i.e., the emission of visible light during rupture) and a complex morphology
of post-mortem fracture surfaces, which could be due to the sublimation of bubbles.
