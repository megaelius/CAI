Bose-Einstein condensation in strongly correlated lattices provides the possibility to coherently
generate macroscopic quantum states, which have attracted tremendous attention as ideal platforms
for quantum simulation. Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are one of such promising systems,
where their realizations of different phases of matter exhibit promising applications in condensed
matter physics, chemistry, and cosmology. Nevertheless, this is only accessible with ultralow
temperatures in the nano to micro Kelvin scale set by the typical inverse mass of an atom. Alternative
systems such as lattices of trapped ions and superconducting circuit arrays also rely on ultracold
temperatures. Exciton polaritons with extremely light effective mass, are regarded as promising
alternatives to realize Bose-Einstein condensation in lattices at higher temperatures. Along
with the condensation, an efficient exciton polariton quantum simulator would require a strong
lattice with robust trapping at each lattice site as well as strong inter-site coupling to allow
coherent quantum motion of polaritons within the lattice. However, exciton polaritons in a strong
lattice have only been shown to condense at liquid helium temperatures. Here, we report the observation
of exciton polariton condensation in a one-dimensional strong lead halide perovskite lattice
at room temperature. Modulated by deep periodic potentials, the strong lead halide perovskite
lattice exhibits a large forbidden bandgap opening up to 13.3 meV and a lattice band up to 8.5 meV wide,
which are at least 10 times larger than previous systems. Above a critical density, we observe exciton
polariton condensation into py orbital states with long-range spatial coherence at room temperature.
Our result opens the route to the implementation of polariton condensates in quantum simulators
at room temperature.
