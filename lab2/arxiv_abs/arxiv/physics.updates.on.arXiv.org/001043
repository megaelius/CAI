We present highly resolved measurements of the near-wall temperature field in thermally driven
convection at a rough surface. Our measurements have been undertaken in a very large experimental
facility called the "Barrel of Ilmenau". They provide a unique insight into the local transport
process at the interface between a hot solid surface and a surrounding fluid. In order to probe the
near-wall temperature field, we used a tiny micro-thermistor of 130 $\mu$m in diameter and 330 $\mu$m
in length with a response time $\tau_{70}$ of less than 150 ms. This sensor is forty times smaller
than the thickness of the boundary layer, and it permits a resolution better than the typical Kolmogorov
micro-scales that appear in our experiment. We demonstrate that the heat flux enhancement generally
observed at rough surfaces, basically results from an increase of the local heat transfer coefficient
at the top of the roughness elements. We also shed light on the detailed mechanism of the transition
in the scaling of the global heat transfer relation $Nu\sim Ra^{\gamma}$ that has been observed
beyond a critical Ra number $Ra_c$. In turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection with rough surfaces,
it already appears at $Ra_c\approx 10^{10}$ [Tisserand et al.{\em Phys. Fluids \/} 23, 015105(2011)]
while, for smooth plates, it has been predicted at $Ra_c\approx 10^{14}$ [[Grossmann \& Lohse {\em
Phys. Rev. Lett.\/} {\bf 86}, 3316(2001)]. We found this transition at rough surfaces to be attributed
to an earlier laminar-turbulent transition of the boundary layer at the top of the roughness elements
as well as to a modification of the temperature field in between the obstacles.
