Ten years ago, DARPA launched the 'Network Challenge', more commonly known as the 'DARPA Red Balloon
Challenge'. Ten red weather balloons were fixed at unknown locations in the US. An open challenge
was launched to locate all ten, the first to do so would be declared the winner receiving a cash prize.
A team from MIT Media Lab was able to locate them all within 9 hours using social media and a novel reward
scheme that rewarded viral recruitment. This achievement was rightly seen as proof of the remarkable
ability of social media, then relatively nascent, to solve real world problems such as large-scale
spatial search. Upon reflection, however, the challenge was also remarkable as it succeeded despite
many efforts to provide false information on the location of the balloons. At the time the false reports
were filtered based on manual inspection of visual proof and comparing the IP addresses of those
reporting with the purported coordinates of the balloons. In the ten years since, misinformation
on social media has grown in prevalence and sophistication to be one of the defining social issues
of our time. Seen differently we can cast the misinformation observed in the Red Balloon Challenge,
and unexpected adverse effects in other social mobilisation challenges subsequently, not as bugs
but as essential features. We further investigate the role of the increasing levels of political
polarisation in modulating social mobilisation. We confirm that polarisation not only impedes
the overall success of mobilisation, but also leads to a low reachability to oppositely polarised
states, significantly hampering recruitment. We find that diversifying geographic pathways
of social influence are key to circumvent barriers of political mobilisation and can boost the success
of new open challenges.
