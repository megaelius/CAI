Accurate modeling of electronic and structural properties of organic molecule-metal interfaces
are challenging problems because of the complicated electronic distribution of molecule and screening
of charges at the metallic surface. This is also the reason why the organic/inorganic system can
be engineered for several applications by fine-tuning the metallic work function. Here, we use
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with different level of functional approximations
for a systematic study of thiophene interacting with Copper surfaces. In particular, we considered
adsorbed structures with the thiophene molecule seated on the top site, with the S atom of the molecule
located on the top of a Cu atom. In this work, we find that the weak chemisorption hypothesis of thiophene
binding on the copper surface is well justified by the two meta-GGAs-based approximations, SCAN
and SCAN+rVV10. PBE-GGA and TM meta-GGA describe it as a physisorption phenomenon by significantly
underestimating the adsorption energies. Calculated adsorption energy curves reveal that non-local
dispersion interaction between the molecule and metallic surface predominantly controls the
bonding mechanism and thus, modifies the copper's work function. Our results imply that semi-local
functionals without any kind of van der Waals (vdW) correction can often misinterpret this as physisorption,
while, a fortuitous error cancellation can give a right description of this adsorption picture
for a wrong reason as in the case of SCAN. The calculated density of states of the adsorbed molecule
shows that the long-range vdW correction of SCAN+rVV10 causes more than enough hybridization between
the \textit{p} orbitals of S atom and the copper \textit{d}-bands and therefore overestimates
the adsorption energies by an average of 16\%.
