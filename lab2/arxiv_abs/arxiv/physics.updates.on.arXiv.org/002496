The recent demonstration of dissipative Kerr solitons in microresonators has opened a new pathway
for the generation of ultrashort pulses and low-noise frequency combs with gigahertz to terahertz
repetition rates, enabling applications in frequency metrology, astronomy, optical coherent
communications, and laser-based ranging. A main challenge for soliton generation, in particular
in ultra-high-Q resonators, is the sudden change of circulating intracavity power during the onset
of soliton generation. This sudden power change requires precise control of the seed laser frequency
and power or fast control of the resonator temperature. Here, we report a robust and simple way to
increase the stability range of the soliton regime by using an auxiliary laser that passively stabilizes
the intracavity power. In our experiments with fused silica resonators, we are able to extend the
pump laser frequency stability range of microresonator solitons by two orders of magnitude, which
enables soliton generation by slow and manual tuning of the pump laser into resonance and at unprecedented
low power levels. Both single- and multi-soliton mode-locked states are generated in a 1.3-mm-diameter
fused silica microrod resonator with a free spectral range of ~50.6 GHz, at a 1554 nm pump wavelength
at threshold powers <3 mW. Moreover, with a smaller 230-{\mu}m-diameter microrod, we demonstrate
soliton generation at 780 {\mu}W threshold power. The passive enhancement of the stability range
of microresonator solitons paves the way for robust and low threshold microcomb systems with substantially
relaxed stability requirements for the pump laser source. In addition, this method could be useful
in a wider range of microresonator applications that require reduced sensitivity to external perturbations.
