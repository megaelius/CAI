Light-matter interactions in conventional nanophotonic structures typically lack directionality.
For example, different from microwave antenna systems, most optical emitters (excited atoms/molecules,
quantum dots) exhibit quasi-isotropic dipolar radiation patterns with low directivity. Furthermore,
surface waves supported by conventional material substrates do not usually have a preferential
direction of propagation, and their wavefront tends to spread as it propagates along the surface,
unless the surface or the excitation are properly engineered. In this article, we theoretically
demonstrate the possibility of realizing truly unidirectional excitation and propagation of
surface-plasmon-polariton modes on a nonreciprocal platform, namely, a gyrotropic magnetized
plasma. Based on a Green function approach, we provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis
of all the available physical mechanisms that may bestow the system with directionality, both in
the sense of one-way excitation of surface waves, and directive diffractionless propagation.
The considered mechanisms include the effect of strong and weak forms of nonreciprocity, the elliptic-like
or hyperbolic-like topology of the modal dispersion surfaces, and the source polarization state,
with the associated possibility of chiral surface-wave excitation governed by angular-momentum
matching. By suitably combining all these mechanisms, we theoretically demonstrate, for the first
time, truly unidirectional surface-plasmon-polariton modes, propagating as a single ultra-narrow
diffractionless beam on a three-dimensional plasmonic platform. Our theoretical findings may
enable a new generation of nanophotonic structures and devices with highly directional response,
with important practical implications for sub-diffractive nano-optical interconnects, super-resolution
imaging, and enhanced classical and quantum light-matter interactions.
