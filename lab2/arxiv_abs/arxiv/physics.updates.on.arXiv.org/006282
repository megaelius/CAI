The Indian Scintillator Matrix for Reactor Anti-Neutrino detection - ISMRAN experiment aims to
detect electron anti-neutrinos ($\bar\nu_e$) emitted from a reactor via inverse beta decay reaction
(IBD). The setup, consisting of 1 ton segmented Gadolinium foil wrapped plastic scintillator array,
is planned for remote reactor monitoring and sterile neutrino search. The detection of prompt positron
and delayed neutron from IBD will provide the signature of $\bar\nu_e$ event in ISMRAN. The number
of segments with energy deposit ($\mathrm{N_{bars}}$) and sum total of these deposited energies
are used as discriminants for identifying prompt positron event and delayed neutron capture event.
However, a simple cut based selection of above variables leads to a low $\bar\nu_e$ signal detection
efficiency due to overlapping region of $\mathrm{N_{bars}}$ and sum energy for the prompt and delayed
events. Multivariate analysis (MVA) tools, employing variables suitably tuned for discrimination,
can be useful in such scenarios. In this work we report the results from an application of artificial
neural network -- the multilayer perceptron (MLP), particularly the Bayesian extension -- MLPBNN,
to the simulated signal and background events in ISMRAN. The results from application of MLP to classify
prompt positron events from delayed neutron capture events on Hydrogen, Gadolinium nuclei and
also from the typical reactor $\gamma$-ray and fast neutron backgrounds is reported. An enhanced
efficiency of $\sim$91$\%$ with a background rejection of $\sim$73$\%$ for prompt selection and
an efficiency of $\sim$89$\%$ with a background rejection of $\sim$71$\%$ for the delayed capture
event, is achieved using the MLPBNN classifier for the ISMRAN experiment.
