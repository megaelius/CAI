Dynamic networks, also called network streams, are an important data representation that applies
to many real-world domains. Many sets of network data such as e-mail networks, social networks,
or internet traffic networks are best represented by a dynamic network due to the temporal component
of the data. One important application in the domain of dynamic network analysis is anomaly detection.
Here the task is to identify points in time where the network exhibits behavior radically different
from a typical time, either due to some event (like the failure of machines in a computer network)
or a shift in the network properties. This problem is made more difficult by the fluid nature of what
is considered "normal" network behavior. The volume of traffic on a network, for example, can change
over the course of a month or even vary based on the time of the day without being considered unusual.
Anomaly detection tests using traditional network statistics have difficulty in these scenarios
due to their Density Dependence: as the volume of edges changes the value of the statistics changes
as well making it difficult to determine if the change in signal is due to the traffic volume or due
to some fundamental shift in the behavior of the network. To more accurately detect anomalies in
dynamic networks, we introduce the concept of Density-Consistent network statistics. On synthetically
generated graphs anomaly detectors using these statistics show a a 20-400% improvement in the recall
when distinguishing graphs drawn from different distributions. When applied to several real datasets
Density-Consistent statistics recover multiple network events which standard statistics failed
to find.
