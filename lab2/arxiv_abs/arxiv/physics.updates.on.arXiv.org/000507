Large deviations for fat tailed distributions, i.e. those that decay slower than exponential,
are not only relatively likely, but they also occur in a rather peculiar way where a finite fraction
of the whole sample deviation is concentrated on a single variable. The regime of large deviations
is separated from the regime of typical fluctuations by a phase transition where the symmetry between
the points in the sample is spontaneously broken. For stochastic processes with a fat tailed microscopic
noise, this implies that while typical realizations are well described by a diffusion process with
continuous sample paths, large deviation paths are typically discontinuous. For eigenvalues
of random matrices with fat tailed distributed elements, a large deviation where the trace of the
matrix is anomalously large concentrates on just a single eigenvalue, whereas in the thin tailed
world the large deviation affects the whole distribution. These results find a natural application
to finance. Since the price dynamics of financial stocks is characterized by fat tailed increments,
large fluctuations of stock prices are expected to be realized by discrete jumps. Interestingly,
we find that large excursions of prices are more likely realized by continuous drifts rather than
by discontinuous jumps. Indeed, auto-correlations suppress the concentration of large deviations.
Financial covariance matrices also exhibit an anomalously large eigenvalue, the market mode,
as compared to the prediction of random matrix theory. We show that this is explained by a large deviation
with excess covariance rather than by one with excess volatility.
