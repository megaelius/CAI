The reporting and evaluation of creep tests of concrete is complicated by the fact that creep is significant
even for the shortest observable load durations. Compared to the strain after 0.1 s load duration,
the strain at 2 hour duration is typically 53% greater. Most experimenters have for decades been
unaware of this fact. Consequently, the reported creep curves require correction by a time shift,
which ranges from 0 to 2 hours. This further implies a vertical shift of entire creep curve, important
for all times up to structure lifetime. To filter out the errors, it is argued that, within an initial
period during which the advance of hydration is negligible, which is normally about 1 day, the initial
basic creep must follow a power law of the time. Creep test data from the literature are used to prove
it. Corrections by time and deformation shifts are determined by minimization of the sum of squared
deviations of the power law from the creep test data. For a fixed exponent n and time shift s, the optimization
is reduced to linear regressions of two kinds, depending on whether the data are given in terms of
either the compliance function or the creep coefficient. For both, the linear regression parameters
depend nonlinearly on the chosen values of n and s. To avoid nonlinear optimization, which need not
converge to the correct result, a set of many discrete values of n and s within their realistic ranges
is selected and the (n,s) combination minimizing the objective function is obtained by a search.
Enforcing a power law form of the initial creep curve is found to lead to better data fits. The optimum
exponent n for the entire database is around 0.3, applicable to the time period cca (10 s, 1 day). After
that, the exponent transits to about 0.1, and prior to that it is about 0.08.
