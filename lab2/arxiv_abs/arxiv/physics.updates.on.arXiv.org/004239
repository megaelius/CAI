Many real networks in social sciences, biological and biomedical sciences or computer science
have an inherent structure of simplicial complexes reflecting many-body interactions. Using
the recently introduced higher order notions of adjacency and degree for simplices in a simplicial
complex, we define new centrality measures in simplicial complexes which contain meaningful information
about the relevance of an agent, and of a simplicial community of agents, in terms of other collaborative
simplicial communities or sub-communities. These measures allow not only to study the relevance
of a simplicial community in a network, but also to elucidate topological and dynamical properties
of simplicial networks. We start by defining centrality measures associated with the notions of
generalised higher order degrees valid for any dimensional comparison, they are needed to understand
the relations among different collaborative simplicial communities and to study higher order
degree distributions in simplicial complex networks. We then define notions of walks and distances
in simplicial complexes to study connectivity of simplicial networks and to generalise, to the
simplicial case, the well known closeness and betweenness centralities (needed for instance to
study the relevance of a simplicial community in terms of its ability of transmitting information).
Finally, we define a clustering coefficient for simplices in a simplicial complex which generalises
the standard graph clustering of a vertex and is essential to know not only the clustering around
a node, but the clustering around a simplicial community in a simplicial network, and it might help
to understand how cliques and simplicial communities evolve in a simplicial network.
