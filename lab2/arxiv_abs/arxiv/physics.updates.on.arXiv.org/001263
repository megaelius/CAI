The evaluation and monitoring of cells health in the human retina is crucial and follow time course
of retinal diseases, detect lesions before irreversible visual loss and to evaluate treatment
effects. Towards this goal, a major challenge is to image and quantify retinal cells in human eyes
in a non-invasive manner. Despite the phenomenal advances in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
and Adaptive Optics systems, in vivo imaging of many of these cells is limited by the fact that cell
contrast in reflection is extremely low. Here, we report on a major advance by proposing and demonstrating
a radically different method compared with OCT to visualize retinal cells with high contrast, resolution
and an acquisition time suitable for clinical use. The method uses a transscleral illumination
which provides a high numerical aperture in a dark field configuration. The light backscattered
by the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) and the choroid provides a forward illumination for the
upper layer of the retina, thus providing a transmission illumination condition. By collecting
the scattered light through the pupil, the partially coherent illumination produces dark field
images, which are combined to reconstruct a quasi-quantitative phase image with twice the numerical
aperture given by the eye's pupil. The retrieved quasi-quantitative phase images (QPI) of cells
in ex vivo human and pig's eyes are validated with those taken with a standard QPI system. We then apply
the technique in vivo on human eye, without pupil dilation, we demonstrated the feasibility to image
retinal cells up to the retinal pigment epithelium within a few seconds.
