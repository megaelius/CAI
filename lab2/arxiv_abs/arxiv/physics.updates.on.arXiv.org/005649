Aims. We investigate the formation of small scales and the dissipation of MHD wave energy through
non-linear interactions of counter-propagating, phase-mixed Alfvenic waves in a complex magnetic
field. Methods. We conducted fully 3-D, non-ideal MHD simulations of transverse waves in complex
magnetic fields. Continuous wave drivers were imposed on the foot points of magnetic field lines
and the system was evolved for several Alfven travel times. Phase-mixed waves were allowed to reflect
off the upper boundary and the interactions between the resultant counter-streaming wave packets
were analysed. Results. The complex nature of the background magnetic field encourages the development
of phase mixing, leading to a growth in currents and vorticities. Counter-propagating phase-mixed
waves induce a cascade of energy to small scales and result in more efficient energy dissipation.
This effect is enhanced in simulations with more complex magnetic fields. High-frequency drivers
excite localised field line resonances and produce efficient wave heating. However, this relies
on the formation of large amplitude oscillations on resonant field lines. Drivers with smaller
frequencies than the fundamental frequencies of field lines are not able to excite resonances and
thus do not inject sufficient Poynting flux to power coronal heating. Even in the case of high-frequency
oscillations, the rate of dissipation is likely too slow to balance coronal energy losses, even
within the quiet Sun. Conclusions. For the generalised phase-mixing presented here, complex background
field structures enhance the rate of wave energy dissipation. However, it remains difficult for
realistic wave drivers to inject sufficient Poynting flux to heat the corona. Indeed, significant
heating only occurs in cases which exhibit amplitudes that are much larger than those currently
observed in the solar atmosphere.
