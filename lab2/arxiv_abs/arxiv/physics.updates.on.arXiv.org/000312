We present a unified scaling theory for the dynamics of monomers of a semiflexible chain under good
solvent condition in the free draining limit. We consider both the cases where the contour length
$L$ is comparable to the persistence length $\ell_p$ and the case $L\gg \ell_p$. Our theory captures
the early time monomer dynamics of a stiff chain characterized by $t^{3/4}$ dependence for the mean
square displacement(MSD) of the monomers, but predicts a first crossover to the Rouse regime of
$t^{2\nu/{1+2\nu}}$ for $\tau_1 \sim \ell_p^3$, and a second crossover to the purely diffusive
dynamics for the entire chain at $\tau_2 \sim L^{5/2}$. We confirm the predictions of this scaling
theory by studying monomer dynamics of dilute solution of semi-flexible chains under good solvent
conditions obtained from our Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation studies for a large choice of chain
lengths with number of monomers per chain N = 16 - 2048 and persistence length $\ell_p = 1 - 500$ Lennard-Jones
(LJ) units. These BD simulation results further confirm the absence of Gaussian regime for a 2d swollen
chain from the slope of the plot of $\langle R_N^2 \rangle/2L \ell_p \sim L/\ell_p$ which around
$L/\ell_p \sim 1$ changes suddenly from $\left(L/\ell_p \right) \rightarrow \left(L/\ell_p
\right)^{0.5} $, also manifested in the power law decay for the bond autocorrelation function disproving
the validity of the WLC in 2d. We further observe that the normalized transverse fluctuations of
the semiflexible chains for different stiffness $\sqrt{\langle l_{\bot}^2\rangle}/L$ as a function
of renormalized contour length $L/\ell_p$ collapse on the same master plot and exhibits power law
scaling $\sqrt{\langle l_{\bot}^2\rangle}/L \sim (L/\ell_p)^\eta $ at extreme limits, where
$\eta = 0.5$ for extremely stiff chains ($L/\ell_p \gg 1$), and $\eta = -0.25$ for fully flexible
chains.
