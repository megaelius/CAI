Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of blood flow in the left ventricle (LV) and aorta are
important tools for analyzing the mechanistic links between myocardial deformation and flow patterns.
Typically, the use of image-based kinematic CFD models prevails in applications such as predicting
the acute response to interventions which alter LV afterload conditions. However, such models
are limited in their ability to analyze any impacts upon LV load or key biomarkers known to be implicated
in driving remodeling processes as LV function is not accounted for in a mechanistic sense. This
study addresses these limitations by reporting on progress made towards a novel electro-mechano-fluidic
(EMF) model that represents the entire physics of LV electromechanics (EM) based on first principles.
A biophysically detailed finite element (FE) model of LV EM was coupled with a FE-based CFD solver
for moving domains using an arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) formulation. Two clinical cases
of patients suffering from aortic coarctations (CoA) were built and parameterized based on clinical
data under pre-treatment conditions. For one patient case simulations under post-treatment conditions
after geometric repair of CoA by a virtual stenting procedure were compared against pre-treatment
results. Numerical stability of the approach was demonstrated by analyzing mesh quality and solver
performance under the significantly large deformations of the LV blood pool. Further, computational
tractability and compatibility with clinical time scales were investigated by performing strong
scaling benchmarks up to 1536 compute cores. The overall cost of the entire workflow for building,
fitting and executing EMF simulations was comparable to those reported for image-based kinematic
models, suggesting that EMF models show potential of evolving into a viable clinical research tool.
