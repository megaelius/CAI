In microdosimetry, lineal energies y are calculated from energy depositions $\epsilon$ inside
the microdosimeter divided by the mean chord length, whose value is based on geometrical assumptions
on both the detector and the radiation field. This work presents an innovative two-stages hybrid
detector (HDM: hybrid detector for microdosimetry) composed by a Tissue Equivalent Proportional
Counter (TEPC) and a silicon tracker made of 4 Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD). This design provides
a direct measurement of energy deposition in tissue as well as particles tracking with a submillimeter
spatial resolution. The data collected by the detector allow to obtain the real track length traversed
by each particle in the TEPC and thus estimates microdosimetry spectra without the mean chord length
approximation. Using Geant4 toolkit, we investigated HDM performances in terms of detection and
tracking efficiencies when placed in water and exposed to protons and carbon ions in the therapeutic
energy range. The results indicate that the mean chord length approximation underestimate particles
with short track, which often are characterized by a high energy deposition and thus can be biologically
relevant. Tracking efficiency depends on the LGAD configurations: 34 strips sensors have a higher
detection efficiency but lower spatial resolution than 71 strips sensors. Further studies will
be performed both with Geant4 and experimentally to optimize the detector design on the bases of
the radiation field of interest. The main purpose of HDM is to improve the assessment of the radiation
biological effectiveness via microdosimetric measurements, exploiting a new definition of the
lineal energy ($y_{T}$), defined as the energy deposition $\epsilon$ inside the microdosimeter
divided by the real track length of the particle.
