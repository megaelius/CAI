We reveal and investigate a new type of linear axisymmetric helical magnetorotational instability
which is capable of destabilizing viscous and resistive rotational flows with radially increasing
angular velocity, or positive shear. This instability is double-diffusive by nature and is different
from the more familiar helical magnetorotational instability, operating at positive shear above
the Liu limit, in that it works instead for a wide range of the positive shear when ${\rm (i)}$ a combination
of axial/poloidal and azimuthal/toroidal magnetic fields is applied and ${\rm (ii)}$ the magnetic
Prandtl number is not too close to unity. We study this instability first with radially local WKB
analysis and then confirm its existence using a global stability analysis of the magnetized flow
between two rotating cylinders with conducting or insulating boundaries. From an experimental
point of view, we also demonstrate the presence of the new instability in a magnetized viscous and
resistive Taylor-Couette flow with positive shear for such values of the flow parameters, which
can be realized in upcoming experiments at the DRESDYN facility. Finally, this instability might
have implications for the dynamics of the equatorial parts of the solar tachocline and dynamo action
there, since the above two necessary conditions for the instability to take place are satisfied
in this region. Our global stability calculations for the tachocline-like configuration, representing
a thin rotating cylindrical layer with the appropriate boundary conditions -- conducting inner
and insulating outer cylinders -- and the values of the flow parameters, indicate that it can indeed
arise in this case with a characteristic growth time comparable to the solar cycle period.
