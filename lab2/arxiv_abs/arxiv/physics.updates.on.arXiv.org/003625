We analyse velocity fluctuations in the solar wind at magneto-fluid scales in two datasets, extracted
from Wind data in the period 2005-2015, that are characterised by strong or weak expansion. Expansion
affects measurements of anisotropy because it breaks axisymmetry around the mean magnetic field.
Indeed, the small-scale three-dimensional local anisotropy of magnetic fluctuations ({\delta}B)
as measured by structure functions (SF_B) is consistent with tube-like structures for strong expansion.
When passing to weak expansion, structures become ribbon-like because of the flattening of SFB
along one of the two perpendicular directions. The power-law index that is consistent with a spectral
slope -5/3 for strong expansion now becomes closer to -3/2. This index is also characteristic of
velocity fluctuations in the solar wind. We study velocity fluctuations ({\delta}V) to understand
if the anisotropy of their structure functions (SF_V ) also changes with the strength of expansion
and if the difference with the magnetic spectral index is washed out once anisotropy is accounted
for. We find that SF_V is generally flatter than SF_B. When expansion passes from strong to weak,
a further flattening of the perpendicular SF_V occurs and the small-scale anisotropy switches
from tube-like to ribbon-like structures. These two types of anisotropy, common to SF_V and SF_B,
are associated to distinct large-scale variance anisotropies of {\delta}B in the strong- and weak-expansion
datasets. We conclude that SF_V shows anisotropic three-dimensional scaling similar to SF_B,
with however systematic flatter scalings, reflecting the difference between global spectral
slopes.
