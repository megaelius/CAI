Raman microscopy is one of the methods that could be used for future post-mortem analyses of samples
extracted from ITER plasma facing. This study shows that this technique is useful for studying tungsten-based
materials containing impurities including oxides and nitrides. Here, we apply pulsed laser deposition
and DC argon glow discharges to produce tungsten-containing synthetic films (compact, porous)
and nanoparticles and investigate the influence of their morphology on the measured Raman spectra.
The amounts of oxygen and/or nitrogen in the films are also investigated. Comparative data are obtained
by X-ray Photoelectrons Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, Electron Microscopies (Scanning
and Transmission), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Time-of-Flight Elastic Recoil Detection
Analysis. The power density of the laser beam used to perform Raman microscopy is varied by up to 4
orders of magnitude (0.01-20 mW/$\mu$m 2) to investigate thermal stability of films and nanoparticles.
As a first result, we give evidence that Raman microscopy is sensitive enough to detect surface native
oxides. Secondly, more tungsten oxides are detected in porous materials and nanoparticles than
in compact films, and the intensities of the Raman band correlate to their oxygen content. Thirdly,
thermal stability of these films (i.e. structural and chemical modification under laser heating)
is poor when compact films contain a sufficiently large amount of nitrogen. This finding suggests
that nitrogen can be substituted by oxygen during Raman laser induced heating occurring in ambient
air. Finally, our methodology can be used to rapidly characterize morphology and chemistry of the
samples analyzed, and also to create oxides at the micrometer scale. keywords: PLD, Raman spectroscopy,
