The Elymaean have existed as a semi-autonomous satrap and sometimes autonomous, coinciding with
the Seleucids and the Parthians in the southwest and west of Iran. This government has played an active
presence in political and economic events of the region from the mid-second century BC to the advent
of the Sasanid Empire. In this paper is tried using of archaeometry matter to Study historical coins
of Elymaean. This method is a valuable criterion for recognition of size and weight of coins. Elemental
studies of coins give us valuable information in connection with particle size, combinations percentage
of the coins, and applied metallurgy in the manufacture of these coins. These studies provide the
groundwork for the understanding of the economic and political structure and commercial communications
of the society. The difference in the level of element concentration may contain information concerning
the mine of these metals. In this paper have been studied total coins of bronze and silver belonging
to the Elymaean using PIXE Technique to be can achieve the beneficial results about the identification
of concentration of present elements, the number of mines and the number of mints through elemental
analysis and definition of the chemical composition of metals. To achieve the above-mentioned
goals, we analyzed 35 coins of Elymais. These coins involve three periods of Elymaean ( from 85 BC
to 224 AD). The observations results showed that the percentage of main elements of coins such as
silver and copper in the three periods of Elymaean were different together and coins of the first
period have had more purity. Furthermore, the analyzed coins are minted in six mints and their primal
raw materials are from three different mines. Lastly, statistical analysis in this study is performed
with SPSS software.
