Surface acoustic wave (SAW) carbon dioxide and methane sensors were developed by integrating the
nanoporous zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) metal organic framework (MOF) with SAW delay
lines for near room temperature applications. The SAW reflective delay lines with operating frequency
436 MHz were custom fabricated on Y-Z LiNbO_3, coated with 100 to 300 nm thick ZIF-8, and tested for
various gases in N_2 environment at room temperature and one atmospheric pressure. The resulting
sensors were selective to CO_2 and CH_4 against other gases such as CO, H_2, and air with a relatively
large response to CO_2 as compared to CH_4 with full reversibility and repeatability. The MOF was
also applied to bulk wave-based quartz crystal (AT-cut, resonance frequency 9 MHz) microbalance
(QCM) devices and tested for various concentrations of CO_2 and CH_4. The sensors showed linear
responses to the gas concentrations which was used to evaluate the sensor sensitivities. For 200
nm thick films, the SAW sensitivity to CO_2 and CH_4 were 0.394 deg/vol-\% (1.44 ppm/vol-\%) and
0.021 deg/vol-\% (0.08 ppm/vol-\%), respectively against the QCM sensitivities 2.18 Hz/vol-\%
(0.24 ppm/vol-\%) and 0.09 Hz/vol-\% (0.01 ppm/vol-\%), respectively to the gases. The SAW sensor
sensitivities were also evaluated for various thicknesses of the films and were found to increase
with the thickness in the studied range. In addition, the MOF-coated SAW delay line had a good response
in wireless mode, demonstrating its potential to operate remotely for detection of the gases at
atmosphere and emission sites across the energy infrastructure.
