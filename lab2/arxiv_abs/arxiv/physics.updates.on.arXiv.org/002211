Conformational flexibility of molecules involved in crystal growth and dissolution is rarely
investigated in detail, and usually considered to be negligible in the formulation of mesoscopic
models of crystal growth. In this work we set out to investigate the conformational isomerism of
ibuprofen as it approaches and is incorpo- rated in the morphologically dominant {100} crystal
face, in a range of different solvents - water, 1-butanol, toluene, cyclohexanone, cyclohexane,
acetonitrile and trichloromethane. To this end we combine extensive molecular dynamics and well-tempered
metadynamics simulations to estimate the equilibrium distribution of conformers, compute conformer-conformer
transition rates, and extract the characteristic relaxation time of the conformer population
in solution, adsorbed at the solid/liquid interface, incorporated in the crystal in contact with
the mother solution, and in the crystal bulk. We find that, while the conformational equilibrium
distribution is weakly dependent on the solvent, relaxation times are instead significantly affected
by it. Fur- thermore, differences in the relaxation dynamics are enhanced on the crystal surface,
where conformational transitions tend become slower and specific conformational transitions
are hindered. This leads to observe that the dominant mechanisms of conformational transition
can also change significantly moving from the bulk solution to the crystal interface, even for a
small molecule with limited conformational flexibility such as ibuprofen. Our findings suggests
that understanding conformational flexibility is key to provide an accurate description of the
solid/liquid interface during crystal dissolution and growth, and therefore its relevance should
be systematically assessed in the formulation of mesoscopic growth models.
