In this paper, using multiple scale analysis we derive a generalized mathematical model for amplitude
evolution, and for calculating the energy exchange in resonant and near-resonant triads consisting
of weakly nonlinear internal gravity wave packets in weakly non-uniform density stratifications
in an unbounded domain in the presence of viscous and rotational effects. Such triad interactions
are one of the mechanisms by which high wavenumber internal waves lead to ocean turbulence and mixing
via parametric subharmonic instability. Non-uniform stratification introduces detuning - mismatch
in the vertical wavenumber triad condition, which may strongly affect the energy transfer process.
We investigate in detail how factors like wave-packets' width, group speeds, nonlinear coupling
coefficients, detuning, and viscosity affect energy transfer in weakly varying stratification.
We find limitations of the well-known 'pump-wave approximation' and derive a non-dimensional
number, which can be evaluated from initial conditions, that can predict the maximum energy transferred
from the primary wave during the later stages. Two additional non-dimensional numbers, based on
various factors affecting energy transfer between near-resonant wave-packets have also been
defined. Moreover, we identify the optimal background stratification in a medium of varying stratification
for the primary wave to form a triad with no detuning so that the energy transfer is maximum. Finally,
we show that even a small change in the background stratification can cause a significant difference
in the energy transfer process between the wave-packets when they have the same order of magnitude
of energy.
