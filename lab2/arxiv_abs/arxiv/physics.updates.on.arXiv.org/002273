The structures of three negatively charged forms (anionic keto-1 and enol-1, dianonic enol-2)
of oxyluciferin (OxyLuc), which are the most probable emitters responsible for the firefly bioluminescence,
have been fully relaxed at the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) level. Absorption energies of the S1<-S0
vertical transition have been computed using different levels of theory, such as TDDFT, CC2 and
many body Green's function Theory (MBGFT). The use of MBGFT, by means of the Bethe-Salpeter (BS)
formalism, on VMC structures provides results in excellent agreement with the value (2.26(8) eV)
obtained by action spectroscopy experiments for the keto-1 form (2.32 eV). To unravel the role of
the quality of the optimized ground state geometry, BS excitation energies have also been computed
on CASSCF geometries, inducing a non negligible blue shift (0.08 and 0.07 eV for keto-1 and enol-1
forms, respectively) with respect to the VMC ones. Structural effects have been analyzed in terms
of over- or under-correlation along the conjugated bonds of OxyLuc by using different methods for
the ground-state optimization. The relative stability of the S$_1$ state for the keto-1 and enol-1
forms depends on the method chosen for the excited state calculation, thus representing a fundamental
caveat for any theoretical study on these systems. Finally, Kohn-Sham HOMO and LUMO orbitals of
enol-2 are (nearly) bound only when the dianion is embedded into a solvent (water and toluene in the
present work); excited state calculations are therefore meaningful only in presence of a dielectric
medium which localizes the electronic density. The combination of VMC for the ground state geometry
and BS formalism for the absorption spectra clearly outperforms standard TDDFT and quantum chemistry
approaches.
