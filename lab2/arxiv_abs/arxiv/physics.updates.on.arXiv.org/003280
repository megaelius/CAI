In homogeneous drift-wave (DW) turbulence, zonal flows (ZFs) can be generated via a modulational
instability (MI) that either saturates monotonically or leads to oscillations of the ZF energy
at the nonlinear stage. This dynamics is often attributed as the predator--prey oscillations induced
by ZF collisional damping; however, similar dynamics is also observed in collisionless ZFs, in
which case a different mechanism must be involved. Here, we propose a semi-analytic theory that
explains the transition between the oscillations and saturation of collisionless ZFs within the
quasilinear Hasegawa--Mima model. By analyzing phase-space trajectories of DW quanta (driftons)
within the geometrical-optics (GO) approximation, we argue that the parameter that controls this
transition is $N\sim\gamma_{{\rm MI}}/\omega_{{\rm DW}}$, where $\gamma_{{\rm MI}}$ is the
MI growth rate and $\omega_{{\rm DW}}$ is the linear DW frequency. We argue that at $N\ll1$, ZFs oscillate
due to the presence of so-called passing drifton trajectories, and we derive an approximate formula
for the ZF amplitude as a function of time in this regime. We also show that at $N\gtrsim1$, the passing
trajectories vanish and ZFs saturate monotonically, which can be attributed to phase mixing of
higher-order sidebands. A modification of $N$ that accounts for effects beyond the GO limit is also
proposed. These analytic results are tested against both quasilinear and fully-nonlinear simulations.
They also explain the earlier numerical results by Connaughton $\textit{et al}$. [J. Fluid Mech.
$\textbf{654}$, 207 (2010)] and Gallagher $\textit{et al}$. [Phys. Plasmas $\textbf{19}$, 122115
(2012)] and offer a revised perspective on what the control parameter is that determines the transition
from the oscillations to saturation of collisionless ZFs.
