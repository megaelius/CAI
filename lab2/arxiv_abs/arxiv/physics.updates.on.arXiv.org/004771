The present work reports behaviors regarding the formation and collapse of a ventilated supercavity
while varying the cavitator shapes, including triangle, disk, and cone and varying mounting struts.
Three cavitators with the same frontal area are fabricated with 3D printing and mounted on a forward
facing model (FFM). The ventilation requirements to generate (C_Qf) and sustain (C_Qc) a supercavity
are tested over a wide range of Froude number (Fr) for each cavitator and compared with backward facing
model(BFM). Compared to the triangle and disk cavitators, the cone-shaped cavitator requires
the least amount of air to generate a supercavity in nearly all of the tested flow regime except very
high Fr. The C_Qc of disk FFM is lower than that of its BFM counterpart at small Fr and exceeds the BFM
C_Qc with further increase of Fr. The cone cavitator has the smallest C_Qc among all the cavitators
across the range of Fr in our experiments. Simultaneous internal pressure and cavity dimension
measurements are conducted to elucidate the cavity sustenance behaviors. The cone-generated
cavity yields a significantly smaller maximum diameter and a shorter half-length. Cavity geometric
information and cavity pressure measurements with high-speed imaging of re-entrant jet are employed
to estimate the re-entrant jet momentum under different Fr for disk and cone cavitators. The estimated
re-entrant jet momentum shows reasonable match with the ventilation air momentum under C_Qc in
lower Fr for both cavitator cases, with the disk cavitator case yielding significantly stronger
re-entrant jet, providing support to the re-entrant jet mechanism governing on the cavity collapse.
Our study sheds some light on the cavitator design and ventilation strategy for a supercavitating
vehicle in practice.
