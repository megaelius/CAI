An optical imaging system is proposed for quantitatively assessing jugular venous response to
altered central venous pressure. The proposed system assesses sub-surface optical absorption
changes from jugular venous waveforms with a spatial calibration procedure to normalize incident
tissue illumination. Widefield frames of the right lateral neck were captured and calibrated using
a novel flexible surface calibration method. Jugular venous optical attenuation (JVA) signals
were computed using an optical model for quantifying hemodynamic changes, and a jugular venous
pulsatility map was computed using a time-synchronized arterial waveform. JVA was assessed in
three cardiovascular protocols that altered central venous pressure by inducing acute central
hypovolemia (lower body negative pressure), venous congestion (head-down tilt), and impaired
cardiac filling (Valsalva maneuver). JVA waveforms exhibited biphasic properties and sub-wave
timing consistent with jugular venous pulse dynamics with time-synchronized electrocardiogram
waves. JVA correlated strongly (median, interquartile range) with invasive central venous pressure
during graded central hypovolemia (r=0.85, [0.72, 0.95]), graded venous congestion (r=0.94,
[0.84, 0.99]), and impaired cardiac filling (r=0.94, [0.85, 0.99]). Reduced JVA during graded
acute hypovolemia was strongly correlated with reductions in stroke volume (SV) (r=0.85, [0.76,
0.92]) from baseline (SV: 79$\pm$15 mL, JVA: 0.56$\pm$0.10 a.u.) to -40 mmHg suction (SV: 59$\pm$18
mL, JVA: 0.47$\pm$0.05 a.u.; p$<$0.01). The proposed non-contact optical imaging system demonstrated
jugular venous dynamics consistent with invasive central venous monitoring during three protocols
that altered central venous pressure.
