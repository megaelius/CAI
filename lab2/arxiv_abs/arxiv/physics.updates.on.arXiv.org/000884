The behaviour of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the atmosphere is highly dependent on their
thermal properties. Here we investigate the volatility of SOA formed from alpha-pinene, beta-pinene
and limonene upon ozone- and OH-induced oxidation, and the effect of OH-induced ageing on the initially
produced SOA. For all three terpenes, the ozone-induced SOA was less volatile than the OH-induced
SOA. The thermal properties of the SOA were described using three parameters extracted from the
volatility measurements: the temperature at which 50 per cent of the volume has evaporated (TVFR0.5),
which is used as a general volatility indicator; a slope factor (SVFR), which describes the volatility
distribution; and TVFR0.1, which measures the volatility of the least volatile particle fraction.
Limonene-derived SOA generally had higher TVFR0.5 values and shallower slopes than SOA derived
from alpha- and beta-pinene. This was especially true for the ozone-induced SOA, partially because
the ozonolysis of limonene has a strong tendency to cause SOA formation and to produce extremely
low volatility VOCs (ELVOCs). Ageing by OH exposure did not reduce TVFR0.5 for any of the studied
terpenes but did increase the breadth of the volatility distribution by increasing the aerosols
heterogeneity and contents of substances with different vapour pressures, also leading to increases
in TVFR0.1. This stands in contrast to previously reported results from smog chamber experiments,
in which TVFR0.5 always increased with ageing. These results demonstrate that there are two opposing
processes that influence the evolution of SOAs thermal properties as they age, and that results
from both flow reactors and static chambers are needed to fully understand the temporal evolution
of atmospheric SOA thermal properties.
