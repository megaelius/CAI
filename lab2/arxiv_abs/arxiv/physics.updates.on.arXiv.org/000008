Experimental validation of the Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction (EMI) is performed
when an electromotive force is generated in thin copper turns, located inside a large magnetic coil.
It has been established that the electromotive force (emf) value should be dependent not only on
changes of the magnetic induction flux through a turn and on symmetry of its crossing by magnetic
power lines also. The law of EMI is applicable in sufficient approximation in case of the changes
of the magnetic field near the turn are symmetrical. Experimental study of the induced emf in arcs
and a direct section of the conductor placed into the variable field has been carried out. Linear
dependence of the induced emf on the length of the arc has been ascertained in case of the magnetic
field distribution symmetry about it. Influence of the magnetic field symmetry on the induced emf
in the arc has been observed. The curve of the induced emf in the direct section over period of current
pulse is similar to this one for the turns and arcs. The general law of EMI for a curvilinear conductor
has been deduced. Calculation of the induced emf in the turns wrapped over it and comparison with
the experimental data has been made. The proportionality factor has been ascertained for the law.
Special conditions have been described, when the induced emf may not exist in the presence of inductive
current. Theoretical estimation of the inductive current has been made at a induced low voltage
in the turn. It has been noted the necessity to take into account the concentration of current carriers
in calculation of the induced emf in semiconductors and ionized conductors.
