The necessary number of external signals or driver nodes needed to control a complex network has
emerged as an important measure of controllability. Here, we investigate how the degree sequence
of directed networks constrains the number of driver nodes. We develop a pair of algorithms that
take a directed degree sequence as input and output a network with the maximum or minimum number of
driver nodes such that the network does not have multi-links. We find an upper bound for the maximum
and a lower bound for the minimum number of driver nodes, and we show that the algorithms always find
realizations such that we reach these bounds for all real and model networks, with a few exceptions
characterized by very small system size and heterogeneous degree distributions. Exploiting these
algorithms, we introduce the notion of control complexity to quantify how hard it is to control a
network given its degree sequence, capturing the richness of its structure beyond its degree distribution.
Using a collection of real and model networks, we numerically and analytically investigate how
typical features of the degree distribution affect the range of possible number of driver nodes
and control complexity. We find that the minimum number of drivers is determined by number of sources
or sinks in the network, while the maximum number of drivers is strongly affected by the presence
of hubs. We also show that, strikingly, some real networks that require a high number of driver nodes
have very low control complexity. Finally, we discuss the relationship between our work and established
results concerning the role of degree correlations and the control profile of networks.
