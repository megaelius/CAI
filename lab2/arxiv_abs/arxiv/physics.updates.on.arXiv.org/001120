The effects of nanosecond pulsed non-equilibrium plasma discharges on ignition characteristics
and low-temperature chemistry or LTC of DME/O2/Ar mixtures are numerically investigated in a plane-to-plane
geometry at a reduced pressure of 76 Torr. Detailed numerical investigations of the two-stage ignition
process in different temperature regimes of DME have been created through a high-fidelity one-dimensional,
multi-timescale plasma-discharge model. Two different initial temperatures are set for comparison:
550K, the negative temperature coefficient regime, where LTC plays a dominate role; 800K, the intermediate
temperature regime, where LTC normally does not play an important role. The results have shown that,
in NTC regime, non-equilibrium plasma discharge improves the overall ignition delay time by 15
times with a significant improvement of approximately 250 times for the first-stage ignition.
In Intermediate temperature regime, the two-stage ignition property is reactivated by the addition
of plasma, and the overall ignition delay is shortened by approximately 75 times. This observation
suggests that, in the intermediate temperature regime, the plasma discharges can not only enhance
DME ignition characteristics but also alter the reaction pathways to a reactive LTC reaction pathway;
therefore, the two-stage ignition behavior occurred again. Further investigation suggests that
the plasma enhancement on ignition and LTC in the intermediate temperature regime is non-linear.
As the accumulative energy input to the system increases, the enhancement from the non-equilibrium
plasma discharge reaches a limit. Considering the total amount of heat release, the optimized voltage
pulse number appears to be in the range of 35-40 to provide the most efficient enhancement for the
overall ignition delay time.
