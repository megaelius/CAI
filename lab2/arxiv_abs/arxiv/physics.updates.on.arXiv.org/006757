Directional Dark Matter Detection (DDMD) can open a new signature for Weakly Massive Interacting
Particles (WIMPs) Dark Matter. The directional signature provides in addition, an unique way to
overcome the neutron and neutrino backgrounds. In order to get the directional signature, the DDM
detectors should be sensitive to low nuclear energy recoils in the keV range and have an angular resolution
better than $20^{\circ}$. We have performed experiments with low energy ($<30\,\mathrm{keV}$)
ion beam facilities to measure the angular distribution of nuclear recoil tracks in a MIMAC detector
prototype. In this paper, we study angular spreads with respect to the electron drift direction
($0^{\circ}$ incident angle) of Fluorine nuclear tracks in this low energy range, and show nuclear
recoil angle reconstruction produced by a monoenergetic neutron field experiment. We find that
a high-gain systematic effect leads to a high angular resolution along the electron drift direction.
The measured angular distribution is impacted by diffusion, and space charge or ion feedback effects,
which can be corrected for by an asymmetry factor observed in the flash-ADC profile. The estimated
angular resolution of the $0^{\circ}$ incident ion is better than $15^{\circ}$ at $10$ keV kinetic
energy and agrees with the simulations within $20$%. The distributions from the nuclear recoils
have been compared with simulated results based on a modified Garfield++ code. Our study shows that
protons would be a more adapted target than heavier nuclei for DDMD of light WIMPs. We demonstrate
that directional signature from the Galactic halo origin of a Dark Matter WIMP signal is experimentally
achievable, with a deep understanding of the operating conditions of a low pressure detector with
its diffusion mechanism.
