We assume a community whose members adopt one of two opinions $A$ or $B$. Each member appears as an
inflexible, or as a non-contrarian or contrarian floater. An inflexible sticks to its opinion,
whereas a floater may change into a floater of the alternative opinion. The occurrence of this change
is governed by the local majority rule: members meet in groups of a fixed size, and a floater then changes
its opinion provided it is a minority in the group. Subsequently, a non-contrarian floater keeps
the opinion as adopted under the local majority rule, whereas a contrarian floater adopts the alternative
opinion. Whereas the effects of on the one hand inflexibles and on the other hand non-contrarians
and contrarians have previously been studied seperately, the current approach allows us to gain
insight in the effect of their combined presence in a community. Given fixed proportions of inflexibles
$(\alpha_{A}, \alpha_{B})$ for the two opinions, and fixed fractions of contrarians $(\gamma_{A},
\gamma_{B})$ among the $A$ and $B$ floaters, we derive the update equation $p_{t+1}$ for the overall
support for opinion $A$ at time $t+1$, given $p_{t}$. The update equation is derived respectively
for local group sizes 1, 2 and 3. The associated dynamics generated by repeated local updates is then
determined to identify its asymptotic steady configuration. The full opinion flow diagram is thus
obtained, showing conditions in terms of the parameters for each opinion to eventually win the competing
dynamics. Various dynamical scenarios are thus exhibited, and it is derived that relatively small
densities of inflexibles allow for more variation in the qualitative outcome of the dynamics than
higher densities of inflexibles.
