Diffusion Kurtosis MRI (DKI) quantifies the degree of non-Gaussian water diffusion -a sensitive
biomarker for microstructure in health and disease. However, DKI is not specific to any microstructural
property per se since kurtosis might emerge from different sources. Q-space trajectory encoding
schemes have been proposed to decouple kurtosis related with the variance of different diffusion
magnitudes (isotropic kurtosis) from kurtosis related with microscopic anisotropy (anisotropic
kurtosis), under assumptions of vanishing intra-compartmental kurtosis and diffusion time independence.
Here, we introduce correlation tensor imaging (CTI) an approach that can be used to more generally
resolve different kurtosis sources. CTI exploits the versatility of the double diffusion encoding
(DDE) sequence and its associated Z tensor to resolve the isotropic and anisotropic components
of kurtosis; in addition, CTI also disentangles these two measures from restricted, time-dependent
kurtosis, thereby providing an index for intra-compartmental kurtosis. The theoretical foundations
of CTI are presented. The first, proof-of-concept CTI ex vivo experiments were performed in mouse
brain specimens revealing the underlying sources of diffusion kurtosis. We find that anisotropic
kurtosis dominates in white matter, while isotropic kurtosis is low for both white and grey matter;
by contrast, areas with substantial partial volume effects show high isotropic kurtosis. Intra-compartmental
kurtosis estimates were found to have positive values suggesting that non-Gaussian, time-dependant
restricted diffusion effects are not negligible, at least for our acquisition settings. We then
performed in vivo CTI in heathy adult rat brains, and found the results to be consistent with the ex
vivo findings, thereby demonstrating that CTI is readily incorporated into preclinical scanners
to resolve kurtosis sources in vivo.
