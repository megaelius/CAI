Topological quantum optical states in one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic cold atomic chains
are studied in this work. We propose that by introducing incommensurate modulations on the interatomic
distances of 1D periodic atomic chains, the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model can
be mimicked, although the crucial difference is the existence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions.
The discrete band structures with respect to the modulation phase, playing the role of a dimension
extension parameter, are calculated for finite chains beyond the nearest-neighbor approximation.
It is found that the present system indeed supports nontrivial topological states localized over
the boundaries. Despite the long-range dipole-dipole interactions that lead to an asymmetric
band structure, it is demonstrated that the present system inherits the topological properties
of two-dimensional integer quantum Hall systems. The spectral position, for both real and imaginary
frequencies, and number of these topologically protected edge states are still governed by the
gap labeling theorem and characterized by the topological invariant, namely, the (first) Chern
number, indicating the validity of bulk-boundary correspondence. Due to the fractal spectrum
arising from quasiperiodicity, the present system provides a large number of topological gaps
and quantum optical states readily for practical use. It is also revealed that a substantial proportion
of the topological edge states are highly subradiant with extremely low decay rates, which therefore
provide an appealing route to control single atom emission and achieve high-fidelity quantum state
storage.
