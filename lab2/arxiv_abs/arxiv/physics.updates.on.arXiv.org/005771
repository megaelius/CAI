Objectives: Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease, hard to diagnose and usually results in poor
prognosis and high mortality. Developing an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to accurately
and universally predict the early cancer risk of all kinds of pancreatic cancer is extremely important.
We propose an ensemble AI algorithm to predict universally cancer risk of all kinds of pancreatic
lesions with noncontrast CT. Methods: Our algorithm combines the radiomics method and a support
tensor machine (STM) by the evidence reasoning (ER) technique to construct a binary classifier,
called RadSTM-ER. RadSTM-ER takes advantage of the handcrafted features used in radiomics and
learning features learned automatically by the STM from the CTs for presenting better characteristics
of lesions. The patient cohort consisted of 135 patients with pathological diagnosis results where
97 patients had malignant lesions. Twenty-seven patients were randomly selected as independent
test samples, and the remaining patients were used in a 5-fold cross validation experiment to confirm
the hyperparameters, select optimal handcrafted features and train the model. Results: RadSTM-ER
achieved independent test results: an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
of 0.8951, an accuracy of 85.19%, a sensitivity of 88.89%, a specificity of 77.78%, a positive predictive
value of 88.89% and a negative predictive value of 77.78%. Conclusions: These results are better
than the diagnostic performance of the five experimental radiologists, four conventional AI algorithms,
which initially demonstrate the potential of noncontrast CT-based RadSTM-ER in cancer risk prediction
for all kinds of pancreatic lesions.
