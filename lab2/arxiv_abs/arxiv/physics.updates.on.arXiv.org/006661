In this paper we compare the heave, surge, and pitch dynamics of a submerged cylindrical point absorber,
simulated using potential flow and fully-resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models.
The potential flow model is based on the time-domain Cummins equation, whereas the CFD model uses
the fictitious domain Brinkman penalization (FD/BP) technique. The submerged cylinder is tethered
to the seabed using a power take-off (PTO) unit which restrains the heave, surge, and pitch motions
of the converter, and absorbs energy from all three modes. It is demonstrated that the potential
theory over-predicts the amplitudes of heave and surge motions, whereas it results in an insignificant
pitch for a fully-submerged axisymmetric converter. It also under-estimates the slow drift of
the buoy, which the CFD model is able to capture reliably. Further, we use fully-resolved CFD simulations
to study the performance of a 3-DOF cylindrical buoy under varying PTO coefficients, mass density
of the buoy, and incoming wave heights. It is demonstrated that the PTO coefficients predicted by
the linear potential theory are sub-optimal for waves of moderate and high steepness. The wave absorption
efficiency improves significantly when higher than the predicted value of the PTO damping is selected.
Simulations with different mass densities of the buoy show that converters with low mass densities
have an increased tension in their PTO and mooring lines. Moreover, the mass density also influences
the range of resonance periods of the device. Finally, simulations with different wave heights
show that at higher heights, the wave absorption efficiency of the converter decreases and a large
portion of available wave power remains unabsorbed.
