Recent studies within the diffusive-thermal (constant-density) approximation have shown that,
for premixed flames freely propagating in narrow adiabatic channels, the instabilities induced
by differential diffusion may result in non-symmetric solutions and/or oscillating and rotating
propagation modes. This has been shown in the context of lean mixtures, for which a single species
transport equation with a single Lewis number (corresponding to the ratio of thermal to molecular
diffusivity of the deficient reactant) can be used to describe the flame propagation problem. In
the present work we extend the analysis to mixtures of any equivalence ratio. To this end, we consider
a two-reactant model, where the different diffusivities of the two reactants introduce two different
Lewis numbers. Steady-state computations and linear stability analysis are carried out for mixtures
with large disparity between the Lewis number of the fuel (LeF) and the oxidizer (LeO), such as hydrogen-oxygen
systems. It is shown that both differential diffusion and preferential diffusion have influence
on the stability of the symmetric flame shape. For sufficiently lean and rich mixtures, the flame
behaves as dictated by the Lewis number of the deficient reactant, i.e., the flame destabilizes
toward non-symmetric solutions for large mass flow rates when the mentioned Lewis number is less
than one. In near-stoichiometric mixtures the stability of the symmetric flame depends on a weighted
average value of LeF and LeO. In particular, the symmetric solution is stable for large mass flow
rates because of the difficulties found by the less diffusive reactant to reach the reactive zone
of the flame.
