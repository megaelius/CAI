We present here a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of Lillgrund offshore wind farm,
which is located in the {\O}resund Strait between Sweden and Denmark. The simulation combines a
dynamic representation of wind turbines embedded within a Large-Eddy Simulation CFD solver, and
uses hr-adaptive meshing to increase or decrease mesh resolution where required. This allows the
resolution of both large scale flow structures around the wind farm, and local flow conditions at
individual turbines; consequently, the response of each turbine to local conditions can be modelled,
as well as the resulting evolution of the turbine wakes. This paper provides a detailed description
of the turbine model which simulates interactions between the wind, turbine rotors, and turbine
generators by calculating the forces on the rotor, the body forces on the air, and instantaneous
power output. This model was used to investigate a selection of key wind speeds and directions, investigating
cases where a row of turbines would be aligned with the wind or at specific angles to the wind. Results
shown include presentations of the spin-up of turbines, the observation of eddies moving through
the turbine array, meandering turbine wakes, and an extensive wind farm wake several kilometres
in length. The key measurement available for cross-validation with operational wind farm data
is the power output from the individual turbines, where the effect of unsteady turbine wakes on the
performance of downstream turbines was a point of interest. The results from simulations were compared
to performance measurements from the real wind farm to provide a firm quantitative validation of
this methodology. Having achieved good agreement between the model and actual wind farm measurements,
the potential of the methodology to provide a tool for further investigations of engineering and
atmospheric science problems is outlined.
