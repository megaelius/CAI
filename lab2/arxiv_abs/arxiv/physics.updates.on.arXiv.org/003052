Electro-optic signal modulation provides a key functionality in modern technology and information
networks. Photonic integration has enabled not only miniaturizing photonic components, but also
provided performance improvements due to co-design addressing both electrical and optical device
rules. However the millimeter-to-centimeter large footprint of many foundry-ready photonic
electro-optic modulators significantly limits scaling density. Furthermore, modulators bear
a fundamental a frequency-response to energy-sensitive trade-off, a limitation that can be overcome
with coupling-based modulators where the temporal response speed is decoupled from the optical
cavity photo lifetime. Thus, the coupling effect to the resonator is modulated rather then tuning
the index of the resonator itself. However, the weak electro-optic response of silicon limits such
coupling modulator performance, since the micrometer-short overlap region of the waveguide-bus
and a microring resonator is insufficient to induce signal modulation. To address these limitations,
here we demonstrate a coupling-controlled electro-optic modulator by heterogeneously integrating
a dual-gated indium-tin-oxide (ITO) phase shifter placed at the silicon microring-bus coupler
region. Our experimental modulator shows about 4 dB extinction ratio on resonance, and a about 1.5
dB off resonance with a low insertion loss of 0.15 dB for a just 4 {\mu}m short device demonstrating
a compact high 10:1 modulation-to-loss ratio. In conclusion we demonstrate a coupling modulator
using strongly index-changeable materials enabling compact and high-performing modulators
using semiconductor foundry-near materials.
