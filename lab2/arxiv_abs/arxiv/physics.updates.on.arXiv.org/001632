Tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) can reveal a new composition dependent force of nature
or disprove many models of new physics. For the first time this test is successfully carried out in
space by the MICROSCOPE satellite. Early results show no violation sourced by the Earth for Pt and
Ti test masses with random errors (after 8.26 d of integration time) of about 1e-14 and similar systematic
errors. It improves by 10 times over the best ground tests with rotating torsion balances despite
70 times less sensitivity to differential accelerations, thanks to the much stronger driving signal
in orbit. The test is limited by thermal noise higher than expected due to the poor quality factor
of the gold wires used for electric grounding. This noise was shown to decrease when the spacecraft
was set to rotate faster than planned. The result will improve by the end of the mission, as thermal
noise decreases with more data. Not so systematic errors. We investigate major non-gravitational
effects and find that the Pt-Pt zero-check sensor does not allow their separation from the signal.
The early test itself reports systematics in the Pt-Ti sensor which are not detected in the Pt-Pt
one, hence would not be distinguished from a violation. The improved test will need more measurements
to check systematics, but there is not enough time left. MICROSCOPE demonstrates the huge potential
of space for WEP tests of very high precision and indicates how to reach it. To realize the potential,
a new experiment needs the spacecraft to be in rapid, stable rotation around the symmetry axis, needs
high quality mechanical suspensions as in the most precise gravitational experiments on ground,
and must allow systematic checks. The design of the `Galileo Galilei' (GG) experiment, aiming to
test the WEP to 1e-17 and currently a candidate for a medium-sized mission of the ESA, unites all the
needed features.
