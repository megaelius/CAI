The analysis of surrounding media has been a long-standing challenge of optical fiber sensors.
Measurements are difficult due to the confinement of light to the inner core of standard fibers.
Over the last two years, new sensor concepts have enabled the analysis of liquids outside the cladding
boundary, where light does not reach. Sensing is based on opto-mechanical, forward stimulated
Brillouin scattering interactions between guided light and sound waves. In most previous works,
however, the protective polymer coating of the fiber had to be removed first. In this work, we report
the opto-mechanical analysis of liquids outside commercially available, standard single-mode
fibers with polyimide coating. The polyimide layer provides mechanical protection but can also
transmit acoustic waves from the fiber cladding towards outside media. Comprehensive analysis
of opto-mechanical coupling in coated fibers that are immersed in liquid is provided. The model
shows that forward stimulated Brillouin scattering spectra in coated fibers are more complex than
those of bare fibers, and strongly depend on the exact coating diameter and the choice of acoustic
mode. Nevertheless, sensing outside coated fibers is demonstrated experimentally. Integrated
measurements over 100 meters of fiber clearly distinguish between air, ethanol and water outside
polyimide coating. Measured spectra are in close quantitative agreement with the analytic predictions.
Further, distributed opto-mechanical time-domain reflectometry mapping of water and ethanol
outside coated fiber is reported, with a spatial resolution of 100 meters. The results represent
a large step towards practical opto-mechanical fiber sensors.
