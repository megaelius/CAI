A wide variety of interface capturing methods have been introduced for simulating two-phase flows
throughout the years. However, there is a noticeable dearth of literature focusing on objective
comparisons between these methods, especially when they are coupled to the momentum equation and
applied in physically relevant regimes. In this article, we compare two techniques for simulating
two-phase flows that possess attractive qualities, but belong to the two distinct classes of diffuse
interface (DI) and volume of fluid (VOF) methods. Both of these methods allow for mass-conserving
schemes that can naturally capture large interfacial topology changes omnipresent in realistic
two phase flows. The DI solver used in this work is based on a conservative and bounded phase field
method, developed recently. Similar to level set methods, this diffuse interface method takes
advantage of the smoothness of the phase field in computing curvature and surface tension forces.
Geometric VOF methods track the fractional tagged volume in a cell. The specific geometric VOF scheme
used here is a discretely conservative and bounded implementation that uses geometric algorithms
for unsplit advection and interface reconstruction, while employing height functions for normal
and curvature calculation. We present a quantitative comparison of these methods on Cartesian
meshes in terms of their accuracy, convergence rate, and computational cost using canonical two-dimensional
(2D) two-phase test cases: a very dense drop moving through a quiescent gas, the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability, an equilibrium static drop, an oscillating drop and the damped surface wave. We further
compare these methods in their ability to resolve thin films by simulating the impact of a water drop
on a deep water pool. Using results of these studies, we suggest qualitative guidelines for selection
of schemes for two-phase flow calculations.
