We present the stability analysis of a plane Couette flow which is stably stratified in the vertical
direction orthogonally to the horizontal shear. Interest in such a flow comes from geophysical
and astrophysical applications where background shear and vertical stable stratification commonly
coexist. We perform the linear stability analysis of the flow in a domain which is periodic in the
stream-wise and vertical directions and confined in the cross-stream direction. The stability
diagram is constructed as a function of the Reynolds number Re and the Froude number Fr, which compares
the importance of shear and stratification. We find that the flow becomes unstable when shear and
stratification are of the same order (i.e. Fr $\sim$ 1) and above a moderate value of the Reynolds
number Re$\gtrsim$700. The instability results from a resonance mechanism already known in the
context of channel flows, for instance the unstratified plane Couette flow in the shallow water
approximation. The result is confirmed by fully non linear direct numerical simulations and to
the best of our knowledge, constitutes the first evidence of linear instability in a vertically
stratified plane Couette flow. We also report the study of a laboratory flow generated by a transparent
belt entrained by two vertical cylinders and immersed in a tank filled with salty water linearly
stratified in density. We observe the emergence of a robust spatio-temporal pattern close to the
threshold values of F r and Re indicated by linear analysis, and explore the accessible part of the
stability diagram. With the support of numerical simulations we conclude that the observed pattern
is a signature of the same instability predicted by the linear theory, although slightly modified
due to streamwise confinement.
