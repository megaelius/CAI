Light propagation in ocean is influenced by the refractive-index which is related to temperature,
salinity, outer-scale, etc. Based on Hill's model 1, several spectra have been proposed to describe
the second order characteristic of refractive-index. Most recently, several oceanic spectra
based on Hill's model 4 were also proposed, which give a better precision in high wave-numbers (viscous-diffusive
range). However, the outer-scale, as a key parameter related to practical environment, has not
been introduced into any oceanic H4-based spectra. In this paper, we take the outer-scale parameter
into an H4-based spectrum which is adapted to the wide-range Prandtl/Schmidt number[Opt. Express.
20, 11111(2019)]. This outer-scaled spectrum could be used in analyzing wave propagation in limited
outer-scaled environment with different values of average temperature and salinity. Based on
the outer-scaled spectrum, we derive the beam wander formula of collimated laser beam. Numerical
calculations show that as the average temperature increases, the beam wander decreases. But the
beam wander caused by outer-scale length $L_{0}$ is more obvious than that caused by average temperature
when $L_{0}$ varies from $10 \rm m$ to $100 \rm m$, and $\langle T\rangle$ ranges from $0^{\circ}
\rm C$ to $30^{\circ} \rm C$. When salinity fluctuations prevails ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), the
influence of outer scale decreases. Meanwhile, in terms of the contribution proportion of beam
wander, the temperature-salt coupling term is the most important compared with single temperature
and salinity. But the trend of salinity proportion is the most complex, which indicates that researches
on the salinity fluctuation should be treated with caution.
