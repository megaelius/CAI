Turbulence is characterized by the non-linear cascades of energy and other inviscid invariants
across a huge range of scales, from where they are injected to where they are dissipated. Recently,
new experimental, numerical and theoretical works have revealed that many turbulent configurations
deviate from the ideal 3D/2D isotropic cases characterized by the presence of a strictly direct/inverse
energy cascade, respectively. We review recent works from a unified point of view and we present
a classification of all known transfer mechanisms. Beside the classical cases of direct and inverse
cascades, the different scenarios include: split cascades to small and large scales simultaneously,
multiple/dual cascades of different quantities, bi-directional cascades where direct and inverse
transfers of the same invariant coexist in the same scale-range and finally equilibrium states
where no cascades are present, including the case when a condensate is formed. We classify all transitions
as the control parameters are changed and we analyse when and why different configurations are observed.
Our discussion is based on a set of paradigmatic applications: helical turbulence, rotating and/or
stratified flows, MHD and passive/active scalars where the transfer properties are altered as
one changes the embedding dimensions, the thickness of the domain or other relevant control parameters,
as the Reynolds, Rossby, Froude, Peclet, or Alfven numbers. We discuss the presence of anomalous
scaling laws in connection with the intermittent nature of the energy dissipation in configuration
space. An overview is also provided concerning cascades in other applications such as bounded flows,
quantum, relativistic and compressible turbulence, and active matter, together with implications
for turbulent modelling. Finally, we present a series of open problems and challenges that future
work needs to address.
