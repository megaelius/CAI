Excited-state dynamics simulations are a powerful tool to investigate photo-induced reactions
of molecules and materials and provide complementary information to experiments. Since the applicability
of these simulation techniques is limited by the costs of the underlying electronic structure calculations,
we develop and assess different machine learning models for this task. The machine learning models
are trained on {\emph ab initio} calculations for excited electronic states, using the methylenimmonium
cation (CH$_2$NH$_2^+$) as a model system. For the prediction of excited-state properties, multiple
outputs are desirable, which is straightforward with neural networks but less explored with kernel
ridge regression. We overcome this challenge for kernel ridge regression in the case of energy predictions
by encoding the electronic states explicitly in the inputs, in addition to the molecular representation.
We adopt this strategy also for our neural networks for comparison. Such a state encoding enables
not only kernel ridge regression with multiple outputs but leads also to more accurate machine learning
models for state-specific properties. An important goal for excited-state machine learning models
is their use in dynamics simulations, which needs not only state-specific information but also
couplings, i.e., properties involving pairs of states. Accordingly, we investigate the performance
of different models for such coupling elements. Furthermore, we explore how combining all properties
in a single neural network affects the accuracy. As an ultimate test for our machine learning models,
we carry out excited-state dynamics simulations based on the predicted energies, forces and couplings
and, thus, show the scopes and possibilities of machine learning for the treatment of electronically
excited states.
