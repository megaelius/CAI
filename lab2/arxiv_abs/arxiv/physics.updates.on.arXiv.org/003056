Heart transplant patients are followed for up to a year with periodic right heart catheterizations
(RHCs) to identify post-transplant complications and guide treatment. Positive outcomes are
associated with a steady reduction of right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressure post-transplant
toward normal levels of right-side pressure (about 20mmHg) as measured by right heart catheterization.
However, standard RHC measures have the potential to identify much more about the progression of
the cardiovascular state during recovery if combined with mechanistic computational cardiovascular
system models. The purpose of this study is two-fold: to understand how cardiovascular system models
can be used to represent a patient's cardiovascular state and to use these models on a subset of patients
where we have longitudinal RHCs over the span of the first year to track post-transplant recovery
and outcome. The cardiovascular systems model used here and its underlying mechanistic parameters
are evaluated using sensitivity analysis, parameter subset selection and parameter identifiability
to understand what information about the cardiovascular state can be reliably extracted from RHC
data. Patient-specific models are then identified for ten patients from their first post-transplant
RHC. Parameters representing ventricular diastolic filling, systemic resistance, pulmonary
vein elastance, pulmonary resistance, pulmonary artery elastance, pulmonary valve resistance
and aortic elastance are identified for each patient using this approach. Multiple RHCs from five
of these patients are analyzed longitudinally to visualize progression of recovery using simulated
left and right ventricular pressure-volume loops exhibiting the potential for this method to understand
post-transplant remodeling and recovery of the entire cardiovascular system.
