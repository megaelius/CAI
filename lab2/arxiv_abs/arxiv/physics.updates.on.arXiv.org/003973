MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC) is important for accurate quantification of the uptake
of PET tracers in combined PET/MR scanners. However, current techniques for MRAC usually require
multiple acquisitions or complex post-processing to discriminate the different tissues. Inspired
by the ancient Greeks, who believed that matter was made of the combination of four elements (earth,
water, air and fire), we formulated a multi-component Magnetic Resonance (MR) Fingerprinting
framework, where every voxel was considered a weighted combination of four base elements: bone,
water, air and fat. We named our approach Aristotelian MR based attenuation correction (ARISTOMRAC).
We used a 3D radial acquisition scheme at 1.5T, acquiring a transient-state spoiled acquisition
with variable flip angles and echo times (TE), with the shortest TEs being ultra-short echo times
(UTE). We simulated a multi-tissue MR signal model using the Bloch equations and used dictionary
matching to extract tissue fraction maps for bone water and fat, while air fractions were obtained
by thresholding the UTE parts of our acquisitions at higher spatial resolution. Compared to previous
methods for MR-based Attenuation Correction (MRAC), our approach used a full multi-component
signal model, including multiple tissues per voxel. For this reason, rather than reconstructing
high resolutions images, MR data can be acquired more efficiently, directly at the resolution needed
for PET attenuation maps. The ARISTOMRAC method allows to accurately estimate the air, water, bone
and fat fractions (Concordance Correlation Coefficient = 0.81/0.91/0.98 for bone, water and fat
respectively). Attenuation maps could be obtained in the head and neck with a single 1-minute acquisition.
