U.S. Tsunami Warning Centers use real-time bottom pressure (BP) data transmitted from a network
of buoys deployed in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans to tune source coefficients of tsunami forecast
models. For accurate coefficients and therefore forecasts, tides at the buoys must be accounted
for. In this study, five methods for coefficient estimation are compared, each of which accounts
for tides differently. The first three subtract off a tidal prediction based on (1) a localized harmonic
analysis involving 29 days of data immediately preceding the tsunami event, (2) 68 pre-existing
harmonic constituents specific to each buoy, and (3) an empirical orthogonal function fit to the
previous 25 hrs of data. Method (4) is a Kalman smoother that uses method (1) as its input. These four
methods estimate source coefficients after detiding. Method (5) estimates the coefficients simultaneously
with a two-component harmonic model that accounts for the tides. The five methods are evaluated
using archived data from eleven DART buoys, to which selected artificial tsunami signals are superimposed.
These buoys represent a full range of observed tidal conditions and background BP noise in the Pacific
and Atlantic, and the artificial signals have a variety of patterns and induce varying signal-to-noise
ratios. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of least squares estimates of sources coefficients
using varying amounts of data are used to compare the five detiding methods. The RMSE varies over
two orders of magnitude between detiding methods, generally decreasing in the order listed, with
method (5) yielding the most accurate estimate of source coefficient. The RMSE is substantially
reduced by waiting for the first full wave of the tsunami signal to arrive. As a case study, the five
method are compared using data recorded from the devastating 2011 Japan tsunami.
