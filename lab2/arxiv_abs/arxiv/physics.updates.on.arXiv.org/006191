Background: Recent pandemic has brought a sudden surge in the requirement of mechanical ventilators
all over the world. In this backdrop, there is wide interest in looking for ways to support multiple
patients from a single ventilator. Various solutions, based upon simple mechanical division of
the ventilator tubings are described. However, recently warnings have been issued by multiple
international professional societies against these plumbing solutions as it can seriously harm
the patients. Methods: We have bifurcated the inspiratory and expiratory conduits from a single
ventilator with addition of one way valves, pressure and flow sensors along with volume and PEEP
control. A purpose-built software and a low-cost microcontroller based control system integrates
and displays the data in the familiar ventilatory graphic and numerical format onto a generic screen.
The system is calibrated with simulated lungs with varying compliance. In addition to the standard
microbial, heat and moisture exchanger filters we design to add UV-C lights at 254-260 nanometre
wavelength in the expiratory channel for its virucidal effect. Results: The dynamic ventilatory
divider system is capable of providing and controlling individual flow, tidal volume (TV) and Positive
End-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for individual patients. Furthermore, it would also display the
ventilatory parameters of both the patients, on a single split screen, in a familiar format. FiO2
and rate are still controlled by the mother ventilator. Conclusions: The prototype system has a
potential to provide safe ventilation to at least two individuals from a single ventilator, while
maintaining the unique requirements of each patient.
