The Bitcoin Lightning Network (BLN), a so-called "second layer" payment protocol, was launched
in 2018 to scale up the number of transactions between Bitcoin owners. In this paper, we analyse the
structure of the BLN over a period of 18 months, ranging from 14th January 2018 to 13th July 2019, at
the end of which the network has reached 8.216 users, 122.517 active channels and 2.732,5 transacted
bitcoins. Here, we consider three representations of the BLN: the daily snapshot one, the weekly
snapshot one and the daily-block snapshot one. By studying the topological properties of the binary
and weighted versions of the three representations above, we find that the total volume of transacted
bitcoins approximately grows as the square of the network size; however, despite the huge activity
characterising the BLN, the bitcoins distribution is very unequal: the average Gini coefficient
of the node strengths is approximately 0.88 causing 10% (50%) the of the nodes to hold the 80% (99%)
of the bitcoins at stake in the BLN (on average, across the entire period). Like for other economic
systems, we hypothesise that local properties of nodes, like the degree, ultimately determine
part of its characteristics. Therefore, we have tested the goodness of the Undirected Binary Configuration
Model (UBCM) in reproducing the structural features of the BLN: the UBCM recovers the disassortative
and the hierarchical character of the BLN but underestimates the centrality of nodes; this suggests
that the BLN is becoming an increasingly centralised network, more and more compatible with a core-periphery
structure. Further inspection of the resilience of the BLN shows that removing hubs leads to the
collapse of the network into many components, an evidence suggesting that this network may be a target
for the so-called split attacks.
