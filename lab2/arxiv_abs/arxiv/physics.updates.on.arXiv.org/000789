Circuity, the ratio of network distances to straight-line distances, is an important measure of
urban street network structure and transportation efficiency. Circuity results from a circulation
network's configuration, planning, and underlying terrain. In turn, it impacts how humans use
urban space for settlement and travel. Although past research has examined overall street network
circuity, researchers have not studied the relative circuity of walkable versus drivable circulation
networks. To address this gap, this study uses free, open-source software and OpenStreetMap data
to explore relative network circuity. We download walkable and drivable networks for 37 US cities
using the non-commercial OSMnx software, which we then use to simulate trips and analyze circuity
to characterize network structure. We find that walking networks tend to allow for more direct trips
than driving networks do in most cities: average driving circuity exceeds average walking circuity
in all but two of the cities that exhibit statistically significant differences between network
types. We discuss various reasons for this phenomenon, illustrated with case studies. Network
circuity also varies substantially between different types of places. These findings underscore
the value of using network-based distances rather than straight-line distances when studying
urban travel and access. They also suggest the importance of differentiating between walkable
and drivable circulation networks when modeling and characterizing urban street networks: although
different modes' networks overlap in any given city, their relative structure and performance
vary in most cities.
