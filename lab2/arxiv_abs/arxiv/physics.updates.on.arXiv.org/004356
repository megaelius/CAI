Recently, an increasing research effort has been dedicated to analyse the transmission and dispersion
properties of periodic acoustic metamaterials, characterized by the presence of local resonators.
Within this context, particular attention has been paid to the optimization of the amplitudes and
center frequencies of selected stop and pass bands inside the Floquet-Bloch spectra of the acoustic
metamaterials featured by a chiral or antichiral microstructure. Novel functional applications
of such research are expected in the optimal parametric design of smart tunable mechanical filters
and directional waveguides. The present paper deals with the maximization of the amplitude of low-frequency
band gaps, by proposing suitable numerical techniques to solve the associated optimization problems.
Specifically, the feasibility and effectiveness of Radial Basis Function networks and Quasi-Monte
Carlo methods for the interpolation of the objective functions of such optimization problems are
discussed, and their numerical application to a specific acoustic metamaterial with tetrachiral
microstructure is presented. The discussion is motivated theoretically by the high computational
effort often needed for an exact evaluation of the objective functions arising in band gap optimization
problems, when iterative algorithms are used for their approximate solution. By replacing such
functions with suitable surrogate objective functions constructed applying machine-learning
techniques, well performing suboptimal solutions can be obtained with a smaller computational
effort. Numerical results demonstrate the effective potential of the proposed approach. Current
directions of research involving the use of additional machine-learning techniques are also presented.
