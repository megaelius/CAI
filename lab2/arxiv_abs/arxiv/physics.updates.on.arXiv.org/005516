Alternate stacking of a highly conducting metallic layer with a magnetic triangular layer found
in delafossite PdCrO2 provides an excellent platform for discovering intriguing correlated quantum
phenomena. Thin film growth of the material may enable not only tuning the basic physical properties
beyond what bulk materials can exhibit, but also developing novel hybrid materials by interfacing
with dissimilar materials, yet this has proven to be extremely challenging. Here, we report the
epitaxial growth of metallic delafossite PdCrO2 films by pulsed laser epitaxy (PLE). The fundamental
role of the PLE growth conditions, epitaxial strain, and chemical and structural characteristics
of the substrate is investigated by growing under various growth conditions and on various types
of substrates. While strain plays a large role in improving the crystallinities, the direct growth
of epitaxial PdCrO2 films without impurity phases was not successful. We attribute this difficulty
to both the chemical and structural dissimilarities between the substrates and volatile nature
of PdO layer, which make nucleation of the right phase difficult. This difficulty was overcome by
growing CuCrO2 buffer layers before PdCrO2 were grown. Unlike PdCrO2, CuCrO2 films were rather
readily grown with a relatively wide growth window. Only monolayer thick buffer layer was sufficient
to grow the correct PdCrO2 phase. This result indicates that the epitaxy of Pd-based delafossites
is extremely sensitive to the chemistry and structure of the interface, necessitating near perfect
substrate materials. The resulting films are commensurately strained and show an antiferromagnetic
transition at 40 K that persists down to as thin as 3.6 nm in thickness.
