This chapter will explore the interplay between the renaissance of general relativity and the advent
of relativistic astrophysics following German involvement in gravitational-wave research through
the window of the Max Planck Society, from the very first interests of its scientists, to the point
when gravitational-wave detection became established by the appearance of full-scale detectors
and international collaborations. On the background of the spectacular astrophysical discoveries
of the 1960s and the growing role of relativistic astrophysics, Ludwig Biermann and his collaborators
at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich became deeply involved in research related
to such widening horizons, already unveiled by radio astronomy during the 1950s. At the end of the
1960s, Joseph Weber's announcements claiming detection of gravitational waves sparked the decisive
entry of this group into the field, in parallel with the appointment of the renowned relativist Juergen
Ehlers. The Munich area group of Max Planck institutes provided the fertile ground for acquiring
a leading position in the 1970s, facilitating the transition from resonant bars towards laser interferometry
and its innovation at increasingly large scales, eventually finding a dedicated site in Hannover
in the early 1990s. An early pan-European initiative broke up into two major projects: the British-German
GEO600, and the French-Italian Virgo. The German approach emphasized perfecting experimental
systems at pilot scales, and never developed into a fully-scaled interferometer, rather joining
the LIGO collaboration at the end of the century. In parallel, Ehlers founded an institute for gravitational
physics in Potsdam, and soon both branches were unified as the Albert Einstein Institute of the Max
Planck Society, one of the central contributors to the detection of gravitational waves in 2015.
