During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019/2020, authorities have used temporary \textit{ad-hoc} policy
measures, such as lockdowns and mass quarantines, to slow its transmission. However, the consequences
of widespread use of these unprecedented measures are poorly understood. To contribute to the understanding
of the economic and human consequences of such policy measures, we therefore construct a mathematical
model of an economy under the impact of a pandemic, select parameter values to represent the global
economy under the impact of COVID-19, and perform numerical experiments by simulating a large number
of possible policy responses. By varying the starting date of the policy intervention in the simulated
scenarios, we find that the most effective policy intervention occurs around the time when the number
of active infections is growing at its highest rate -- that is, the results suggest that the most dramatic
measures should only be implemented when the disease is sufficiently spread. The degree of the intervention,
above a certain threshold, does not appear to have a great impact on the outcomes in our simulations,
due to the strongly concave relationship we assume between production shortfall and reduction
in the infection rate. Our experiments further suggest that the intervention should last until
after the peak determined by the reduced infection rate. The model and its implementation, along
with the general insights from our policy experiments, may help policymakers design effective
emergency policy responses in the face a serious pandemic, and contribute to our understanding
of the relationship between the economic growth and the spread of infectious diseases.
