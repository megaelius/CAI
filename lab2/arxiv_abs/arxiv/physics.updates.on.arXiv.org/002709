We introduce a system of two component two-dimensional (2D) complex Ginzburg-Landau equations
(CGLEs) with spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) describing a wide-aperture microcavity laser with saturable
gain and absorption. We report families of two-component self-trapped dissipative laser solitons
in this system. The SOC terms are represented by the second-order differential operators, which
sets the difference, $|\Delta S|=2$, between the vorticities of the two components. We have found
stable solitons of two types: vortex-antivortex (VAV) and semi-vortex (SV) bound states, featuring
vorticities $\left( -1,+1\right) $ and $\left( 0,2\right) $, respectively. In previous works,
2D localized states of these types were found only in models including a trapping potential, while
we are dealing with the self-trapping effect in the latteraly unconfined (free-space) model. The
SV states are stable in a narrow interval of values of the gain coefficients. The stability interval
is broader for VAV states, and it may be expanded by making SOC stronger (although the system without
SOC features a stability interval too). We have found three branches of stationary solutions of
both VAV and SV types, two unstable and one stable. The latter one is an attractor, as the unstable
states spontaneously transform into the stable one, while retaining vorticities of their components.
Unlike previously known 2D localized states, maintained by the combination of the trapping potential
and SOC, in the present system the VAV and SV complexes are stable in the absence of diffusion. In contrast
with the bright solitons in conservative models, chemical potentials of the dissipative solitons
reported here are positive.
