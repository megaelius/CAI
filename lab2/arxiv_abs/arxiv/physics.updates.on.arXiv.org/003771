The identification of separate physical features contributing to the force resultants on a moving
body is useful for insight into the associated flow, and for conceptual modelling. A natural approach
is to seek a component due to viscosity and an `inviscid' remainder. It is also attractive to invoke
the well-known decomposition of the velocity field into irrotational and rotational parts, and
apportion the force resultants accordingly. Unfortunately, this leads to coupled contributions;
the resultants nominally associated with the rotational velocities depend also on the irrotational
velocity field. Here, an alternative is presented, in which the inviscid resultants are split into
independent `convective' and `accelerative' components. The former are associated with the pressure
field that would arise in an inviscid flow with (instantaneously) the same velocities as the real
one, and with the body's velocity parameters --- angular and translational --- unchanging. The
latter correspond to the pressure generated when the body accelerates from rest in quiescent fluid
with its given rates of change of angular and translational velocity. They are reminiscent of the
classical, `added-mass', force resultants associated with irrotational flow, but differ crucially
in applying without restriction. They are also simpler than the developed expressions for the added-mass
force and moment. Finally, the force resultants due to viscosity also include a contribution from
pressure. Its presence is necessary because the convective and accelerative components alone
are insufficient to satisfy the equations governing the pressure field, but its existence does
not seem to have been widely recognised.
