We propose a novel algorithm - Multifractal Cross-Correlation Analysis (MFCCA) - that constitutes
a consistent extension of the Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) and is able to properly
identify and quantify subtle characteristics of multifractal cross-correlations between two
time series. Our motivation for introducing this algorithm is that the already existing methods
like MF-DXA have at best serious limitations for most of the signals describing complex natural
processes and often indicate multifractal cross-correlations when there are none. The principal
component of the present extension is proper incorporation of the sign of fluctuations to their
generalized moments. Furthermore, we present a broad analysis of the model fractal stochastic
processes as well as of the real-world signals and show that MFCCA is a robust and selective tool at
the same time, and therefore allows for a reliable quantification of the cross-correlative structure
of analyzed processes. In particular, it allows one to identify the boundaries of the multifractal
scaling and to analyze a relation between the generalized Hurst exponent and the multifractal scaling
parameter $\lambda_q$. This relation provides information about character of potential multifractality
in cross-correlations and thus enables a deeper insight into dynamics of the analyzed processes
than allowed by any other related method available so far. By using examples of time series from stock
market, we show that financial fluctuations typically cross-correlate multifractally only for
relatively large fluctuations, whereas small fluctuations remain mutually independent even
at maximum of such cross-correlations. Finally, we indicate possible utility of MFCCA to study
effects of the time-lagged cross-correlations.
