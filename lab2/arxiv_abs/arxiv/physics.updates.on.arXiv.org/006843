Recently the first laser spectroscopy measurement of the radioactive RaF molecule has been reported
[Nature 581, 396 (2020)]. This and similar molecules are considered to search for the New Physics
effects. The radium nucleus is of interest as it is octupole-deformed and has close levels of opposite
parity. The preparation of such experiments can be simplified if there are reliable theoretical
predictions. It is shown that the accurate prediction of the hyperfine structure of the RaF molecule
requires to take into account the finite magnetization distribution inside the radium nucleus.
For atoms, this effect is known as the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect. Its magnitude depends on the model
of the nuclear magnetization distribution which is usually not well known. We show that it is possible
to express the nuclear magnetization distribution contribution to the hyperfine structure constant
in terms of one magnetization distribution dependent parameter: BW matrix element for $1s$-state
of the corresponding hydrogen-like ion. This parameter can be extracted from the accurate experimental
and theoretical electronic structure data for an ion, atom, or molecule without the explicit treatment
of any nuclear magnetization distribution model. This approach can be applied to predict the hyperfine
structure of atoms and \textit{molecules} and allows one to separate the nuclear and electronic
correlation problems. It is employed to calculate the finite nuclear magnetization distribution
contribution to the hyperfine structure of the $^{225}$Ra$^+$ cation and $^{225}$RaF molecule.
For the ground state of the $^{225}$RaF molecule, this contribution achieves 4\%.
