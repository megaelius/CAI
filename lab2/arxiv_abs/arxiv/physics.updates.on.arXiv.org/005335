Background: Elderly patients with MODS have high risk of death and poor prognosis. The performance
of current scoring systems assessing the severity of MODS and its mortality remains unsatisfactory.
This study aims to develop an interpretable and generalizable model for early mortality prediction
in elderly patients with MODS. Methods: The MIMIC-III, eICU-CRD and PLAGH-S databases were employed
for model generation and evaluation. We used the eXtreme Gradient Boosting model with the SHapley
Additive exPlanations method to conduct early and interpretable predictions of patients' hospital
outcome. Three types of data source combinations and five typical evaluation indexes were adopted
to develop a generalizable model. Findings: The interpretable model, with optimal performance
developed by using MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD datasets, was separately validated in MIMIC-III, eICU-CRD
and PLAGH-S datasets (no overlapping with training set). The performances of the model in predicting
hospital mortality as validated by the three datasets were: AUC of 0.858, sensitivity of 0.834 and
specificity of 0.705; AUC of 0.849, sensitivity of 0.763 and specificity of 0.784; and AUC of 0.838,
sensitivity of 0.882 and specificity of 0.691, respectively. Comparisons of AUC between this model
and baseline models with MIMIC-III dataset validation showed superior performances of this model;
In addition, comparisons in AUC between this model and commonly used clinical scores showed significantly
better performance of this model. Interpretation: The interpretable machine learning model developed
in this study using fused datasets with large sample sizes was robust and generalizable. This model
outperformed the baseline models and several clinical scores for early prediction of mortality
in elderly ICU patients. The interpretative nature of this model provided clinicians with the ranking
of mortality risk features.
