In recent years, coronary artery disease is escalating and is likely to assume an epidemic proportion
by 2030. Currently the reliable methods for detection of coronary arterial lesions are either conventional
coronary angiogram (CAG) or MDCT (Multiple Detector Computed Tomography) coronary angiogram.
Conventional CAG is an invasive procedure. Conventional CAG and CT (Computed Tomography) angiogram,
both require expert supervision of either an interventional cardiologist or a radiologist. In
this work, we have proposed a novel design and method for non-invasive detection and localization
of coronary arterial lesion using Impedance Cardiography (ICG). The ICG signal recorded by the
proposed device is used to extract feature points and compute augmentation index, amplitude and
other time related parameters. The extracted features are used as input to a trained artificial
neural network, for detection and prediction of coronary arterial lesions. The trained network
generates specialized models, to be used for diagnosis of arterial lesions. The proposed methodology
detects lesion in Left main coronary artery (LMCA), Left anterior descending artery (LAD), Diagonal
branch, Left circumflex artery (LCX), and Right coronary artery (RCA) with an accuracy of 92%, 82%,
76%, 76%, 84% respectively. The proposed device could be also used by a common individual for detection
of arterial lesion without any expert supervision, unassisted. The proposed algorithm eliminates
the need of CAG for diagnosis of coronary arterial lesions (stenosis), and provides an insight into
a new method for non-invasive monitoring of cardiovascular haemodynamics, detection and localization
of coronary arterial lesion.
