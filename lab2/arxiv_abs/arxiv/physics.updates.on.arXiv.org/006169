Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is the most widely used process for generating
entangled photon pairs. In SPDC, a pump photon interacts with a nonlinear optical crystal and splits
into two entangled photons called the signal and the idler photons. The SPDC process has been studied
extensively in the last few decades for various pump and crystal configurations, and the entangled
photon pairs produced by SPDC have been used in numerous experimental studies on quantum entanglement
and entanglement-based real-world quantum-information applications. In this tutorial article,
we present a thorough study of phase matching in $\beta$-barium borate (BBO) crystals for spontaneous
parametric down-conversion and thereby also investigate the generation of entangled photons
in such crystals. First, we present a theoretical derivation of two-photon wavefunction produced
by SPDC in the frequency and transverse momentum bases. We then discuss in detail the effects due
to various crystal and pump parameters including the length of the crystal, the angle between the
optic axis and the pump propagation direction, the pump incidence angle on the crystal surface,
the refraction at the crystal surfaces, and the pump propagation direction inside the crystal.
These effects are extremely relevant in experimental situations. We then present our numerical
and experimental results in order to illustrate how various experimental parameters affect the
phase matching and thus the generation of entangled photons. Finally, using the two-photon wavefunction
in the transverse wave-vector basis, we show how to derive the two-photon wavefunction in the OAM
basis and thereby calculate the two-photon angular Schmidt spectrum. We expect this article to
be useful for researchers working in various capacities with entangled photons generated by SPDC
in BBO crystals.
