The computing speeds in modern multi-core processors and big data servers are no longer limited
by the on-chip transistor density that doubles every two years following the Moores law, but are
limited by the on-chip data communication between memories and microprocessor cores. Realization
of integrated, low-cost, and efficient solutions for high speed, on-chip data communications
require terahertz (THz) interconnect waveguides with tremendous significance in future THz technology
including THz-wave integrated circuits and THz communication. However, conventional approaches
to THz waveguiding suffer from sensitivity to defects and considerable bending losses at sharp
bends. Here, building on the recently-discovered topological phase of light, we experimentally
demonstrate robust THz topological valley transport on low-loss, all-silicon chips. We show that
the valley polarized topological kink states exhibit unity transmission over a bulk band gap even
after propagating through ten sharp corners. Such states are excellent information carriers due
to their robustness, single-mode propagation, and linear dispersion-key properties for next
generation THz communications. By leveraging the unique properties of kink states, we demonstrate
error-free communication through a highly-twisted domain wall at an unprecedented data rate (10
Gbit/s) and uncompressed 4K high-definition video transmission. Our work provides the first experimental
demonstration of the topological phases of THz wave, which could certainly inspire a plethora of
research on different types of topological phases in two and three dimensions.
