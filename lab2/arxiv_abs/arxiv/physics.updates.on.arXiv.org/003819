Two-dimensional, meso-resolved numerical simulations are performed to investigate the complete
shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) process in a mixture of liquid nitromethane (NM) and air-filled,
circular cavities. The shock-induced initiation behaviors resulting from the cases with neat
NM, NM with an array of regularly spaced cavities, and NM with randomly distributed cavities are
examined. For the case with randomly distributed cavities, hundreds of cavities are explicitly
resolved in the simulations using a diffuse-interface approach to treat two immiscible fluids
and GPU-enabled parallel computing. Without invoking any empirically calibrated, phenomenological
models, the reaction rate in the simulations is governed by Arrhenius kinetics. For the cases with
neat NM, the resulting SDT process features a superdetonation that evolves from a thermal explosion
after a delay following the passage of the incident shock wave and eventually catches up with the
leading shock front. For the cases wherein mesoscale heterogeneities are explicitly considered,
a gradual SDT process is captured. These two distinct initiation behaviors for neat NM and heterogeneous
NM mixtures agree with experimental findings. Via examining the global reaction rate of the mixture,
a unique time scale characterizing the SDT process, i.e., the overtake time, is measured for each
simulation. For an input shock pressure less than approximately $9.4~\mathrm{GPa}$, the overtake
time resulting from a heterogeneous mixture is shorter than that for neat NM. This sensitizing effect
is more pronounced for lower input shock pressures. A random distribution of cavities is found to
be more effective in enhancing the SDT process than a regular array of cavities. Statistical analysis
on the meso-resolved simulation data provides more insights into the mechanism of energy release
underlying the SDT process.
