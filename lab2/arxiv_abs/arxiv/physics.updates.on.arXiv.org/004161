The magnetic presheath is a boundary layer occurring when magnetized plasma is in contact with a
wall and the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ makes an oblique angle $\alpha$ with the wall. Here, we consider
the fusion-relevant case of a shallow-angle, $\alpha \ll 1$, electron-repelling sheath, with
the electron density given by a Boltzmann distribution, valid for $\alpha / \sqrt{\tau+1} \gg \sqrt{m_{\text{e}}/m_{\text{i}}}$,
where $m_{\text{e}}$ is the electron mass, $m_{\text{i}}$ is the ion mass, $\tau = T_{\text{i}}/ZT_{\text{e}}$,
$T_{\text{e}}$ is the electron temperature, $T_{\text{i}}$ is the ion temperature, and $Z$ is
the ionic charge state. The thickness of the magnetic presheath is of the order of a few ion sound Larmor
radii $\rho_{\text{s}} = \sqrt{m_{\text{i}} \left(ZT_{\text{e}} + T_{\text{i}} \right) } /
ZeB$, where $e$ is the proton charge and $B = |\vec{B}|$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field. We
study the dependence on $\tau $ of the electrostatic potential and ion distribution function in
the magnetic presheath by using a set of prescribed ion distribution functions at the magnetic presheath
entrance, parameterized by $\tau$. The kinetic model is shown to be asymptotically equivalent
to Chodura's fluid model at small ion temperature, $\tau \ll 1$, for $|\ln \alpha| > 3|\ln \tau | \gg
1$. However, in this limit ion gyro-orbits acquire a spatial extent that occupies a large portion
of the magnetic presheath, which means that kinetic effects are not negligible. At large ion temperature,
$\tau \gg 1$, relevant because $T_{\text{i}}$ is measured to be a few times larger than $T_{\text{e}}$
near divertor targets of fusion devices, ions reach the Debye sheath entrance (and subsequently
the wall) at a shallow angle whose size is given by $\sqrt{\alpha}$ or $1/\sqrt{\tau}$, depending
on which is largest.
