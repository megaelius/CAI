The advent of high density 3D wide azimuth survey configurations has greatly increased the cost
of seismic acquisition. Simultaneous source acquisition presents an opportunity to decrease
costs by reducing the survey time. Source time delays are typically long enough for seismic reflection
energy to decay to negligible levels before firing another source. Simultaneous source acquisition
abandons this minimum time restriction and allows interference between seismic sources to compress
the survey time. Seismic data processing methods must address the interference introduced by simultaneous
overlapping sources. Simultaneous source data are characterized by high amplitude interference
artefacts that may be stronger than the primary signal. These large amplitudes are due to the time
delay between sources and the rapid decay of seismic energy with arrival time. Therefore, source
interference will appear as outliers in denoising algorithms that make use of a Radon transform.
This will reduce the accuracy of Radon transform de-noising especially for weak signals. Formulating
the Radon transform as an inverse problem with an L1 misfit makes it robust to outliers caused by source
interference. This provides the ability to attenuate strong source interference while preserving
weak underlying signal. In order to improve coherent signal focusing, an apex shifted hyperbolic
Radon transform (ASHRT) is used to remove source interferences. ASHRT transform basis functions
are tailored to match the travel time hyperbolas of reflections in common receiver gathers. However,
the ASHRT transform has a high computational cost due to the extension of the model dimensions by
scanning for apex locations. By reformulating the ASHRT operator using a Stolt migration/demigration
kernel that exploits the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the computational efficiency of the operator
is drastically improved.
