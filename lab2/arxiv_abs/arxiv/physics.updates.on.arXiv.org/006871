Accurate 3D imaging is essential for machines to map and interact with the physical world. While
numerous 3D imaging technologies exist, each addressing niche applications with varying degrees
of success, none have achieved the breadth of applicability and impact that digital image sensors
have achieved in the 2D imaging world. A large-scale two-dimensional array of coherent detector
pixels operating as a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system could serve as a universal 3D imaging
platform. Such a system would offer high depth accuracy and immunity to interference from sunlight,
as well as the ability to directly measure the velocity of moving objects. However, due to difficulties
in providing electrical and photonic connections to every pixel, previous systems have been restricted
to fewer than 20 pixels. Here, we demonstrate the first large-scale coherent detector array consisting
of 512 ($32 \times 16$) pixels, and its operation in a 3D imaging system. Leveraging recent advances
in the monolithic integration of photonic and electronic circuits, a dense array of optical heterodyne
detectors is combined with an integrated electronic readout architecture, enabling straightforward
scaling to arbitrarily large arrays. Meanwhile, two-axis solid-state beam steering eliminates
any tradeoff between field of view and range. Operating at the quantum noise limit, our system achieves
an accuracy of $3.1~\mathrm{mm}$ at a distance of 75 metres using only $4~\mathrm{mW}$ of light,
an order of magnitude more accurate than existing solid-state systems at such ranges. Future reductions
of pixel size using state-of-the-art components could yield resolutions in excess of 20 megapixels
for arrays the size of a consumer camera sensor. This result paves the way for the development of low
cost and high performance 3D imaging cameras, enabling new applications from robotics to autonomous
navigation.
