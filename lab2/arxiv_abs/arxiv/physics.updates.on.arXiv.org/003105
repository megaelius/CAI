Multi-azimuth walkaway vertical seismic profiling (VSP) is an established technique for the estimation
of in situ slowness surfaces and inferring anisotropy parameters. Normally, this the technique
requires the assumption of lateral homogeneity, which makes the horizontal slowness components
at depths of downhole receivers equal to those measured at the surface. Any violations of this assumption,
such as lateral heterogeneity or a nonzero dip of intermediate interfaces, lead to distortions
in reconstructed slowness surfaces and, consequently, to errors in estimated anisotropic parameters.
Here, we relax the assumption of lateral homogeneity and discuss how to correct VSP data for weak,
lateral heterogeneity (LH). We describe a procedure of downward continuation of recorded travel
times that accounts for the presence of both vertical inhomogeneity and weak lateral heterogeneity,
which produces correct slowness surfaces at depths of downhole receivers. Once the slowness surfaces
are found and the desired type of anisotropic model to be inverted is selected, the corresponding
anisotropic parameters, providing the best fit to the estimated slowness can be obtained. We invert
the slowness surfaces of $P$-waves for parameters of the simplest anisotropic model describing
dipping fractures -- transversely isotropic medium with a tilted symmetry axis. Five parameters
of this model -- the $P$-wave velocity $V_0$ in the direction of the symmetry axis, Thomsen's anisotropic
coefficients $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, the tilt $\nu$, and the azimuth $\beta$ of the symmetry axis
can be estimated in a stable manner when maximum source offset is greater than half of the receiver
depth.
