We study the optical properties of the solar gravitational lens (SGL) under the combined influence
of the static spherically symmetric gravitational field of the Sun--modeled within the first post-Newtonian
approximation of the general theory of relativity--and of the solar corona--modeled as a generic,
static, spherically symmetric free electron plasma. For this, we consider the propagation of monochromatic
electromagnetic (EM) waves near the Sun and develop a Mie theory that accounts for the refractive
properties of the gravitational field of the Sun and that of the free electron plasma in the extended
solar system. We establish a compact, closed-form solution to the boundary value problem, which
extends previously known results into the new regime where gravity and plasma are both present.
Relying on the wave-optical approach, we consider three different regions of practical importance
for the SGL, including the shadow region directly behind the Sun, the region of geometrical optics
and the interference region. We demonstrate that the presence of the solar plasma affects all characteristics
of an incident unpolarized light, including the direction of the EM wave propagation, its amplitude
and its phase. We show that the presence of the solar plasma leads to a reduction of the light amplification
of the SGL and to a broadening of its point spread function. We also show that the wavelength-dependent
plasma effect is critically important at radio frequencies, where it drastically reduces both
the amplification factor of the SGL and also its angular resolution. However, for optical and shorter
wavelengths, the plasma's contribution to the EM wave, leaving the plasma-free optical properties
of the SGL practically unaffected.
