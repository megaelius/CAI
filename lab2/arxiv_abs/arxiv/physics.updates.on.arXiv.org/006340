Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) can be produced in large foils and molded in different shapes. The
possibility to create cylindrical layers has opened the opportunity to use such detector as internal
tracker at collider experiments. One crucial item is to have low material budget in the active area,
so the supporting structure of anode and cathode must be light. KLOE2 collaboration has built the
first Cylindrical GEM detector with honeycomb material with carbon fiber skins produced at high
temperature. BESIII is developing an innovative CGEM detector with charge and time readout. Among
several innovative features, the mechanical structure was designed to be a sandwich of Rohacell
and Kapton, a PMI foam. After the transportation of a first production of the detectors from the construction
site in Italy to the Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing, some malfunctions have been observed
in some of them, compatible with GEMs deformation inside the detector. We have performed a detailed
study by means of an industrial CT scan available in IHEP laboratory and autopsy to the damaged detectors.
In this talk, we will review the construction process, the shipment, the findings of the investigation.
A new supporting structure of carbon fiber and honeycomb, assembled at room temperature, has been
designed and developed. The thickness of the carbon fiber is small enough to keep the material budget
of a single detector layer below 0.5$\%$ of a radiation length, while the mechanical robustness
results beyond the purpose of a detector for HEP. A first detector with such a mechanical structure
has been built and shipped to IHEP, preliminary results from operation (e.g. current stability,
discharges, temperature and humidity correlation) of the detectors will be also presented in this
talk.
