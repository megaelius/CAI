The increasing volume of seismic data from long-term continuous monitoring motivates the development
of algorithms based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for faster and more reliable phase detection
and picking. However, many less studied regions lack a significant amount of labeled events needed
for traditional CNN approaches. In this paper, we present a CNN-based Phase- Identification Classifier
(CPIC) designed for phase detection and picking on small to medium sized training datasets. When
trained on 30,146 labeled phases and applied to one-month of continuous recordings during the aftershock
sequences of the 2008 MW 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan, China, CPIC detects 97.5% of the manually
picked phases in the standard catalog and predicts their arrival times with a five-times improvement
over the ObsPy AR picker. In addition, unlike other CNN-based approaches that require millions
of training samples, when the off-line training set size of CPIC is reduced to only a few thousand
training samples the accuracy stays above 95%. The online implementation of CPIC takes less than
12 hours to pick arrivals in 31-day recordings on 14 stations. In addition to the catalog phases manually
picked by analysts, CPIC finds more phases for existing events and new events missed in the catalog.
Among those additional detections, some are confirmed by a matched filter method while others require
further investigation. Finally, when tested on a small dataset from a different region (Oklahoma,
US), CPIC achieves 97% accuracy after fine tuning only the fully connected layer of the model. This
result suggests that the CPIC developed in this study can be used to identify and pick P/S arrivals
in other regions with no or minimum labeled phases.
