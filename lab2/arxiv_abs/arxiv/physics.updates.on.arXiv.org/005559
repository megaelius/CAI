Microbial communities feature an immense diversity of species and the extent of this diversity
correlates with outcomes ranging from ecosystem stability to medical prognoses. Yet the mechanisms
underlying microbial diversity are not well understood; simple resource-competition models
do not allow for coexistence of a large number of species. However, it was recently shown that assuming
the existence of metabolic trade-offs - in allocating a limited enzyme production capacity - can
lead to unlimited diversity, when nutrients are steadily supplied. Do such trade-offs permit diversity
under more realistic, intermittent conditions of nutrient supply? Here, we demonstrate that in
serial dilution culture, metabolic trade-offs allow for high diversity. Unlike the constant environment
case, diversity depends on the concentration of nutrients supplied to the community. These changes
in diversity are driven by an "early-bird" effect in which species specialized for nutrients that
are initially more abundant gain a population advantage over other species. We explore the interplay
of this effect with different environmental factors and diversity-supporting mechanisms, such
as immigration and cross-feeding, and find a variety of ensuing relationships between nutrient
supply and diversity. The large variation seen in this simple model suggests that real ecosystems
may not obey a single universal relationship between nutrient supply and diversity. To connect
to real microbial communities, we validate our growth model against previously published Escherichia
coli batch and chemostat experiments and outline potential future experiments to test the model's
multispecies predictions.
