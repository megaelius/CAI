In this work we propose and investigate a new strategy of vaccination, which we call "dynamic vaccination".
In our model, susceptible people become aware that one or more of their contacts are infected, and
thereby get vaccinated with probability $\omega$, before having physical contact with any infected
patient. Then, the non-vaccinated individuals will be infected with probability $\beta$. We apply
the strategy to the SIR epidemic model in a multiplex network composed by two networks, where a fraction
$q$ of the nodes acts in both networks. We map this model of dynamic vaccination into bond percolation
model, and use the generating functions framework to predict theoretically the behavior of the
relevant magnitudes of the system at the steady state. We find a perfect agreement between the solutions
of the theoretical equations and the results of stochastic simulations. In addition, we find an
interesting phase diagram in the plane $\beta-\omega$, which is composed by an epidemic and a non-epidemic
phases, separated by a critical threshold line $\beta_c$, which depends on $q$. Wefind that, for
all values of $q$, a region in the diagram where the vaccination is so efficient that, regardless
of the virulence of the disease, it never becomes an epidemic. We compare our strategy with random
immunization and find that using the same amount of vaccines for both scenarios, we obtain that the
spread of the disease is much lower in the case of dynamic vaccination when compared to random immunization.
Furthermore, we also compare our strategy with targeted immunization and we find that, depending
on $\omega$, dynamic vaccination will perform significantly better, and in some cases will stop
the disease before it becomes an epidemic.
