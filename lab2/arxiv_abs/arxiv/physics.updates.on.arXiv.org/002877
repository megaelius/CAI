This study presents the first systematic comparison of the (thermo-)dynamics associated with
all major tropical wave types causing rainfall modulation over northern tropical Africa: Madden
Julian Oscillation (MJO), Equatorial Rossby waves (ERs), mixed Rossby-gravity waves (MRGs),
Kelvin waves, tropical disturbances (TDs, including African Easterly Waves), and eastward inertio-gravity
waves (EIGs). Reanalysis and radiosonde data were analyzed for the period 1981--2013 based on space-time
filtering of outgoing longwave radiation. The identified circulation patterns are largely consistent
with theory. The slow modes, MJO and ER, mainly impact precipitable water, whereas the faster Kelvin
waves, MRGs, and TDs primarily modulate moisture convergence. Monsoonal inflow intensifies during
wet phases of the MJO, ERs, and MRGs, associated with a northward shift of the intertropical discontinuity
for MJO and ERs. During passages of vertically tilted imbalanced wave modes, such as MJO, Kelvin
waves, and TDs, and partly MRGs, increased vertical wind shear and improved conditions for up- and
downdrafts facilitate the organization of convection. The balanced ERs are not tilted and rainfall
is triggered by large-scale moistening and stratiform lifting. The MJO and ERs interact with intraseasonal
variations of the Indian monsoon and extratropical Rossby wave trains. The latter causes a trough
over the Atlas Mountains associated with a tropical plume and rainfall over the Sahara. Positive
North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillation signals precede tropical plumes in case of the MJO. The results
unveil which dynamical processes need to be modeled realistically to represent the coupling between
tropical waves and rainfall in northern tropical Africa.
