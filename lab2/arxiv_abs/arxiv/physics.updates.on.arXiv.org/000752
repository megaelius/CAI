We investigate magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability
(MRI) in Keplerian disks with a nonzero net azimuthal magnetic field using shearing box simulations.
As distinct from most previous studies, we analyze turbulence dynamics in Fourier (${\bf k}$-)
space to understand its sustenance. The linear growth of MRI with azimuthal field has a transient
character and is anisotropic in Fourier space, leading to anisotropy of nonlinear processes in
Fourier space. As a result, the main nonlinear process appears to be a new type of angular redistribution
of modes in Fourier space -- the \emph{nonlinear transverse cascade} -- rather than usual direct/inverse
cascade. We demonstrate that the turbulence is sustained by interplay of the linear transient growth
of MRI (which is the only energy supply for the turbulence) and the transverse cascade. These two
processes operate at large length scales, comparable to box size and the corresponding small wavenumber
area, called \emph{vital area} in Fourier space is crucial for the sustenance, while outside the
vital area direct cascade dominates. The interplay of the linear and nonlinear processes in Fourier
space is generally too intertwined for a vivid schematization. Nevertheless, we reveal the \emph{basic
subcycle} of the sustenance that clearly shows synergy of these processes in the self-organization
of the magnetized flow system. This synergy is quite robust and persists for the considered different
aspect ratios of the simulation boxes. The spectral characteristics of the dynamical processes
in these boxes are qualitatively similar, indicating the universality of the sustenance mechanism
of the MRI-turbulence.
