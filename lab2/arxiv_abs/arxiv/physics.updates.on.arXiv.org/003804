With Wendelstein 7-X now up and running, and the construction of ITER proceeding, predicting fast-ion
losses to sensitive plasma-facing components and detectors is gaining significant interest.
A common recipe to perform such studies is to push a large population of marker particles along their
equations of motion, the trajectories randomized with Monte Carlo operators accounting for Coulomb
collisions, and to record possible intersections of the marker trajectories with synthetic detectors
or areas of interest in the first wall. While straightforward to implement and easy to parallelize,
this Forward Monte Carlo (FMC) approach tends to suffer from poor statistics and error estimation
as the detector domain is often small: it is difficult to guess how to set up the initial weights and
locations of the markers for them to remain representative of the source distribution, yet record
enough hits to the detector for good statistics. As an alternative, the FMC method can be replaced
with a so-called Backward Monte Carlo (BMC) algorithm. Instead of starting with a given initial
marker population, one starts from the end condition at the detector and records how the hit probability
evolves backwards in time. The scheme eliminates the statistics issue present in the FMC scheme
and may provide more accurate and efficient simulations of fast-ion loss signals. The purpose of
this paper is to explain the BMC recipe in the fast-ion setting and to discuss the associated nuances,
especially how to negate artificial diffusion. For illustration purposes, our numerical example
considers a 1-D stochastic harmonic oscillator as a mock-up of a charged particle.
