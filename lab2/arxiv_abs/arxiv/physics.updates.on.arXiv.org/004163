The long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS)
equation on the line with symmetric, nonzero boundary conditions at infinity is studied in the case
of initial conditions that allow for the presence of discrete spectrum. The results of the analysis
provide the first rigorous characterization of the nonlinear interactions between solitons and
the coherent oscillating structures produced by localized perturbations in a modulationally
unstable medium. The study makes crucial use of the inverse scattering transform for the focusing
NLS equation with nonzero boundary conditions, as well as of the nonlinear steepest descent method
of Deift and Zhou for oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert problems. Previously, it was shown that in the
absence of discrete spectrum the $xt$-plane decomposes asymptotically in time into two types of
regions: a left far-field region and a right far-field region, where to leading order the solution
equals the condition at infinity up to a phase shift, and a central region where the asymptotic behavior
is described by slowly modulated periodic oscillations. Here, it is shown that in the presence of
a conjugate pair of discrete eigenvalues in the spectrum a similar coherent oscillatory structure
emerges but, in addition, three different interaction outcomes can arise depending on the precise
location of the eigenvalues: (i) soliton transmission, (ii) soliton trapping, and (iii) a mixed
regime in which the soliton transmission or trapping is accompanied by the formation of an additional,
nondispersive localized structure akin to a soliton-generated wake. The soliton-induced position
and phase shifts of the oscillatory structure are computed, and the analytical results are validated
by a set of accurate numerical simulations.
