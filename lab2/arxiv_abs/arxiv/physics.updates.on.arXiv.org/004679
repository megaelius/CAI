Diamond is a promising candidate for enhancing the negative-ion surface production in the ion sources
for neutral injection in fusion reactors; hence evaluation of its reactivity towards hydrogen
plasma is of high importance. High quality PECVD single crystal and polycrystalline diamond samples
were exposed in Pilot-PSI with the D + flux of (4-7)$\times$10 24 m-2 s-1 and the impact energy of 7-9
eV per deuteron at different surface temperatures; under such conditions physical sputtering
is negligible, however chemical sputtering is important. Net chemical sputtering yield $Y = 9.7\times
10^{-3}$ at/ion at 800$^\circ$C was precisely measured ex-situ using a protective platinum mask
(5x10x2 $\mu$m) deposited beforehand on a single crystal followed by the post-mortem analysis
using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The structural properties of the exposed diamond
surface were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Gross
chemical sputtering yields were determined in-situ by means of optical emission spectroscopy
of the molecular CH AX band for several surface temperatures. We observed a bell shape dependence
of the erosion yield versus temperature between 400$^\circ$C and 1200$^\circ$C, with a maximum
yield of ~1.5$\times$10-2 at/ion attained at 900$^\circ$C. The yields obtained for diamond are
relatively high $(0.51.5)\times 10^{-2}$ at/ion, comparable with those of graphite. XPS analyses
show amorphization of diamond surface within 1 nm depth, in good agreement with molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation. MD was also applied to study the hydrogen impact energy threshold for erosion of
[100] diamond surface at different temperatures.
