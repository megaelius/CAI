There are currently intense efforts being directed towards extending the range and energy of long
distance nonlinear pulse propagation in the atmosphere by moving to longer infrared wavelengths,
with the purpose of mitigating the effects of turbulence. In addition, picosecond and longer pulse
durations are being used to increase the pulse energy. While both of these tacks promise improvements
in applications, such as remote sensing and directed energy, they open up fundamental issues regarding
the standard model used to calculate the nonlinear optical properties of dilute gases. Amongst
these issues is that for longer wavelengths and longer pulse durations, exponential growth of the
laser-generated electron density, the so-called avalanche ionization, can limit the propagation
range via nonlinear absorption and plasma defocusing. It is therefore important for the continued
development of the field to assess the theory and role of avalanche ionization in gases for longer
wavelengths. Here, after an overview of the standard model, we present a microscopically motivated
approach for the analysis of avalanche ionization in gases that extends beyond the standard model
and we contend is key for deepening our understanding of long distance propagation at long infrared
wavelengths. Our new approach involves the mean electron kinetic energy, the plasma temperature,
and the free electron density as dynamic variables. The rate of avalanche ionization is shown to
depend on the full time history of the pulsed excitation, as opposed to the standard model in which
the rate is proportional to the instantaneous intensity.
