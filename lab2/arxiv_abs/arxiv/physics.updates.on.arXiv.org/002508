The distribution of a pure condensible planetary atmosphere in equilibrium with a surface reservoir
is revisited employing the energy budget of the climate system, emphasizing the atmospheric horizontal
latent heat transport. This configuration is applicable to icy Solar System bodies such as Triton
as well as a range of possible exoplanet atmospheres, including water or $\mathrm{CO_2}$ iceballs
or ocean worlds, and lava planets with mineral vapor atmospheres. Climate regimes for slowly rotating
planets with the hot-spot near the substellar point, and for rapidly rotating planets with a warm
equatorial belt, are both treated. A non-dimensional parameter controlling the fractional variation
of the surface pressure is derived; it measures whether the pure condensible atmosphere is global
or localized. The global pure condensible atmosphere with the non-dimensional parameter much
less than order of unity is maintained by the strong horizontal latent heat transport associated
with an "evaporation/sublimation-driven flow" from warm to cold places that compensates for the
incoming differential radiative forcing. We show that the variation of surface temperature can
be estimated in terms of this non-dimensional parameter if it is not too large. In the case of a pure
water-vapor atmosphere with an ice or liquid surface, we show that the atmosphere is thick enough
to maintain nearly isothermal surface conditions even when the substellar surface temperature
is around the freezing point. Finally, it is proposed that the evaporation/sublimation-driven
flow regime for global atmospheres could be detected via its effect on the inhomogeneous distribution
of minor non-condensible components in the atmosphere.
