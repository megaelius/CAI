Inspired by concepts from ergodic theory, we give a new approach to coding sequence (CDS) density
estimation, focusing on the human genome. Our approach is based on the introduction and study of
topological pressure, which assigns a real number to any finite sequence based on an appropriate
notion of `weighted information content'. For human DNA sequences, each codon is assigned a suitable
weight and we can train these parameters so that the topological pressure and the observed CDS density
correlate arbitrarily well. We cross-validate our results to check that we are not overfitting,
and use the parameters obtained by training on the human genome for ab initio estimation of CDS density
on the genomes of Rhesus Macaque and Mus Musculus. We demonstrate that our predictions compare well
with those given by the standard single genome ab initio gene-finding programs. Our method is entirely
combinatorial, and extracts information from our training data without reference to any biological
model. As such, our method can be adapted for the analysis of any eukaryote. An anticipated application
is the identification of gene-rich regions, which is of particular importance to the study of plant
genomes. Inspired again by ergodic theory, we use the weightings on the codons to define a probability
distribution on finite sequences, which we show to be effective in distinguishing between coding
and non-coding human DNA sequences of lengths between 750bp and 5,000bp. At the end of the paper,
we explain the theoretical underpinning for our approach, which is the theory of Thermodynamic
Formalism from the dynamical systems literature. Mathematica and MATLAB implementations of our
method are available at this http URL
