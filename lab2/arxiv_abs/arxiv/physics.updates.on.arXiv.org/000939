The demand for high-performance chip-scale lasers has driven rapid growth in integrated photonics.
The creation of such low-noise laser sources is critical for emerging on-chip applications, ranging
from coherent optical communications, photonic microwave oscillators remote sensing and optical
rotational sensors. While Brillouin lasers are a promising solution to these challenges, new strategies
are needed to create robust, compact, low power and low cost Brillouin laser technologies through
wafer-scale integration. To date, chip-scale Brillouin lasers have remained elusive due to the
difficulties in realization of these lasers on a commercial integration platform. In this paper,
we demonstrate, for the first time, monolithically integrated Brillouin lasers using a wafer-scale
process based on an ultra-low loss Si3N4/SiO2 waveguide platform. Cascading of stimulated Brillouin
lasing to 10 Stokes orders was observed in an integrated bus-coupled resonator with a loaded Q factor
exceeding 28 million. We experimentally quantify the laser performance, including threshold,
slope efficiency and cascading dynamics, and compare the results with theory. The large mode volume
integrated resonator and gain medium supports a TE-only resonance and unique 2.72 GHz free spectral
range, essential for high performance integrated Brillouin lasing. The laser is based on a non-acoustic
guiding design that supplies a broad Brillouin gain bandwidth. Characteristics for high performance
lasing are demonstrated due to large intra-cavity optical power and low lasing threshold power.
Consistent laser performance is reported for multiple chips across multiple wafers. This design
lends itself to wafer-scale integration of practical high-yield, highly coherent Brillouin lasers
on a chip.
