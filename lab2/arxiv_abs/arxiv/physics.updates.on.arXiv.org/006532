A Hamiltonian six-field gyrofluid model is constructed, based on closure relations derived from
the so-called "quasi-static" gyrokinetic linear theory where the fields are assumed to propagate
with a parallel phase velocity much smaller than the parallel particle thermal velocities. The
main properties of this model, primarily aimed at exploring basic phenomena of interest for space
plasmas such as the solar wind, are its ability to provide a reasonable agreement with kinetic theory
for linear low-frequency modes, and at the same time to ensure a Hamiltonian structure in the absence
of explicit dissipation. The model accounts for equilibrium temperature anisotropy, ion and electron
finite Larmor radius corrections, electron inertia, magnetic fluctuations along the direction
of a strong guide field, and parallel Landau damping. Remarkably, the quasi-static closure leads
to exact expressions for the nonlinear terms involving gyroaveraged electromagnetic perturbations.
One of the consequences is that a rather natural identification of the Hamiltonian structure of
the model becomes possible when Landau damping is neglected. A slight variant of the model consists
of a four-field Hamiltonian reduction of the original six-field model, which we use for the subsequent
linear analysis. In the latter, the dispersion relations of kinetic Alfv\'en waves and the firehose
instability are shown to be correctly reproduced, relatively far in the sub-ion range (depending
on the plasma parameters), while the spectral range where the slow-wave dispersion relation and
the field-swelling instabilities are precisely described is less extended. This loss of accuracy
originates from the breaking of the condition of small phase velocity, relative to the parallel
thermal velocity of the electrons (for kinetic Alfv\'en waves and firehose instability) or of the
ions (in the case of the field-swelling instabilities).
