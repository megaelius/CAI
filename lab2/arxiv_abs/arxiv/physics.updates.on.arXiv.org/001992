Human beings have to make numerous decisions every day, and these decisions might be biased and influenced
by different personal, social and/or environmental variables. Pedestrians are ideal subjects
for the study of decision-making, due to the inter-individual variation in risk taking. Many studies
have attempted to understand which environmental factors (light colour, waiting times, etc.)
influence the number of times pedestrians broke the rules at road-crossings, very few focused on
the decision-making process of pedestrians according to the different conditions of these variables,
that is to say their perception and interpretation of the information they receive. This study used
survival analyses to highlight the decision-making process of pedestrians crossing the road at
signalized crossings in France and in Japan. For both light colours, we decided to carry out separate
analyses for the first pedestrian to step off the kerb and other individuals following him/her,
as the decisions underlying the departure of a first individual and those of the followers are different,
and the departure of the first pedestrians strongly influences the decisions of other individuals.
We showed that the probability to cross the road follows three different processes: one at the red
light, one just before the pedestrian light turns green, and one after the light has turned green.
Globally, the decision of the first pedestrian to cross, whether he or she does so at the green or at
the red light, is influenced by their country of residence. We observed a lower threshold for Japanese
pedestrians because they tend to follow their private or personal information. We identify the
use of cognitive processes such as risk sensitivity and temporal discounting, and propose new concepts
based on the results of this study to decrease the incidence of rule-breaking by pedestrians.
