We study the error scaling properties of implicitly-filtered large-eddy simulation (LES) in the
outer region of wall-bounded turbulence at moderately high Reynolds numbers and for different
subgrid-scale (SGS) models. In order to avoid the additional complexity of wall-modeling, we perform
LES of turbulent channel flows where the wall boundary condition is replaced by a Neumann condition
supplying the exact mean wall stress. The statistics under consideration are the mean velocity
profile, turbulence intensities, and kinetic energy spectra. The errors for these quantities
follow $(\Delta/L)^{\alpha}Re_\tau^{\gamma}$, where $\Delta$ is the characteristic grid resolution,
$Re_\tau$ is the friction Reynolds number, and $L$ is the relevant length-scale to refer $\Delta$.
It is shown that $\Delta$ can be expressed as the $L_2$-norm of the grid vector, and $L$ is well represented
by the ratio of the friction velocity and mean shear. The exponent $\alpha$ is estimated from theoretical
arguments for each statistical quantity of interest and is shown to roughly match the values computed
by numerical simulations. For the mean profile and kinetic energy spectra, $\alpha\approx1$,
whereas the turbulence intensities converge at a slower rate $\alpha<1$. The exponent $\gamma$
is approximately $0$, and the LES solution is independent of the Reynolds number. Further analysis
reveals that the turbulence intensities and spectra resemble their filtered counterparts computed
from direct numerical simulation (DNS) data, but the mechanism responsible for this similitude
is related to the balance of the input power and dissipation rather than to filtering. The expected
behavior of the turbulence intensities at high Reynolds numbers is also derived and shown to agree
with the classic log-layer profiles for grid resolutions lying within the inertial range.
