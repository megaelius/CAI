The present work reports behaviors regarding the formation and collapse of a ventilated supercavity
while varying the cavitator shapes, including triangle, disk, and cone. Three cavitators with
the same frontal area are fabricated with 3D printing and mounted on a forward facing model. The ventilation
requirements to generate (C_Qf) and sustain (C_Qc) a supercavity are tested over a wide range of
Froude number (Fr) for each cavitator. It is found that the ventilation hysteresis, i.e., the C_Qf
is substantially higher than C_Qc at the same Fr, occurs for all three cavitators as reported by previous
studies. Compared to the triangle and disk cavitators, the cone-shaped cavitator requires the
least amount of air to generate a supercavity in nearly all of the tested flow regime except very high
Fr. It is suggested that the reduction of C_Qf with the cone cavitator is due to a more stable flow separation
favoring the bubble coalescence process which drives the formation of the cavity. The C_Qc of disk
cavitator does not display a similar decreasing then constant trend as the free-standing supercavity
reported previously due to the presence of the ventilation pipe inside the cavity. The stable flow
separation associated with cone cavitator also leads to a lower C_Qc compared to the triangle and
disk cavitators. Additionally, the C_Qc is nearly independent of Fr for the cone cavitator. A comparison
of the cavity dimension shows that for all three cavitators, the maximum diameter is nearly independent
with Fr and half-length increases with increasing Fr. The cone-generated cavity yields a significantly
smaller maximum diameter and a shorter half-length as a result of the lower differential pressure
across the wake comparing to the other two cases. Our study sheds some light on the effect of cavitator
shapes on designing ventilation strategy for a supercavitating vehicle in practice.
