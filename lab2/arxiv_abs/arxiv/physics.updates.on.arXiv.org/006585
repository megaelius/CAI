Context. Evaporative (sublimation) cooling of icy interstellar grains occurs when the grains
have been suddenly heated by a cosmic-ray (CR) particle or other process. It results in thermal desorption
of icy species, affecting the chemical composition of interstellar clouds. Aims. We investigate
details on sublimation cooling, obtaining necessary knowledge before this process is considered
in astrochemical models. Methods. We employed a numerical code that describes the sublimation
of molecules from an icy grain, layer by layer, also considering a limited diffusion of bulk-ice
molecules toward the surface before they sublimate. We studied a grain, suddenly heated to peak
temperature T, which cools via sublimation and radiation. Results. A number of questions were answered.
The choice of grain heat capacity C has a limited effect on the number of sublimated molecules N, if
the grain temperature T > 40K. For grains with different sizes, CR-induced desorption is most efficient
for rather small grains with a core radius of a ~ 0.02 micron. CR-induced sublimation of CO2 ice can
occur only from small grains if their peak temperature is T > 80K and there is a lack of other volatiles.
The presence of H2 molecules on grain surface hastens their cooling and thus significantly reduces
N for other sublimated molecules for T < 30K. Finally, if there is no diffusion and subsequent sublimation
of bulk-ice molecules (i.e., sublimation occurs only from the surface layer), sublimation yields
do not exceed 1-2 monolayers and, if T > 50K, N does not increase with increasing T. Conclusions. Important
details regarding the sublimation cooling of icy interstellar grains were clarified, which will
enable a proper consideration of this process in astrochemical modeling.
