Density is one of the most important properties of seawater and is used in various marine research
and technology. Traditionally, in the practice of oceanographic research, it is customary to con-sider
density as a dependent parameter, which is a function of several other parameters taken as independent.
Usually the following three parameters are used as the independent parameters: temperature, hydrostatic
pressure and salinity. The issues of temperature and hydrostatic pressure measuring in situ are
technologically well developed, while in the salinity measuring there are still unsolved problems.
This is due to the fact that salinity is such a property that it is simply impossi-ble to determine
directly in situ. To eliminate the problems associated with measurements of sa-linity, the authors
developed the special new kind equation. That equation of the new kind ex-press the density of sea
water through independent and in situ measured parameters: temperature, hydrostatic pressure
and sound speed. The novelty of this approach is that using of the sound speed as the independent parameter
makes it possible to exclude measurements of salinity. The authors developed two such new equations
for the different cases of using. The first new equa-tion is intended for use in technical applications
and reproduces the sea water density in a wide range of the aquatic environment parameters with a
root mean square deviation of 0.062 kg/m3. The second more precise new equation is intended for scientific
applications and reproduces the sea water density in a narrower oceanographic range of parameters
with a root mean square devi-ation of 0.0018 kg/m3.
