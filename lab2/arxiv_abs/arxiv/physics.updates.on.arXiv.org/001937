This study uses a one dimensional fluid dynamics arterial network model to infer changes in hemodynamic
quantities associated with pulmonary hypertension in mice. Data for this study include blood flow
and pressure measurements from the main pulmonary artery for 7 control mice with normal pulmonary
function and 5 hypertensive mice with hypoxia induced pulmonary hypertension. Arterial dimensions
for a 21 vessel network are extracted from micro-CT images of lungs from a representative control
and hypertensive mouse. Each vessel is represented by its length and radius. Fluid dynamic computations
are done assuming that the flow is Newtonian, viscous, laminar, and has no swirl. The system of equations
is closed by a constitutive equation relating pressure and area, using a linear model derived from
stress-strain deformation in the circumferential direction assuming that the arterial walls
are thin, and also an empirical nonlinear model. For each dataset, an inflow waveform is extracted
from the data, and nominal parameters specifying the outflow boundary conditions are computed
from mean values and characteristic time scales extracted from the data. The model is calibrated
for each mouse by estimating parameters that minimize the least squares error between measured
and computed waveforms. Optimized parameters are compared across the control and the hypertensive
groups to characterize vascular remodeling with disease. Results show that pulmonary hypertension
is associated with stiffer and less compliant proximal and distal vasculature with augmented wave
reflections, and that elastic nonlinearities are insignificant in the hypertensive animal.
