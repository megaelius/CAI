This work shows how the early stages of perturbation growth in a viscosity-stratified flow are different
from those in a constant-viscosity flow, and how nonlinearity is a crucial ingredient. We derive
the viscosity-varying adjoint Navier-Stokes equations, where gradients in viscosity force both
the adjoint momentum and the adjoint scalar (here temperature). By the technique of direct-adjoint
looping, we obtain the nonlinear optimal perturbation which maximises the perturbation kinetic
energy of the nonlinear system. While we study three-dimensional plane Poiseuille (channel) flow
with the walls at different temperatures, and a temperature-dependent viscosity, our findings
are general for any flow with viscosity variations near walls. The Orr and modified lift-up mechanisms
are in operation at low and high perturbation amplitudes respectively at our subcritical Reynolds
number. The nonlinear optimal perturbation contains more energy on the hot (less-viscous) side,
with a stronger initial lift-up. However, as the flow evolves, the important dynamics shifts to
the cold (more-viscous) side, where wide high-speed streaks of low viscosity grow and persist,
and strengthen the inflectional quality of the velocity profile. We provide a physical description
of this process, and show that the evolution of the linear optimal perturbation misses most of the
physics. The Prandtl number does not qualitatively affect the findings at these times. The study
of nonlinear optimal perturbations is still in its infancy, and viscosity variations are ubiquitous.
We hope that this first work on nonlinear optimal perturbation with viscosity variations will lead
to wider studies on transition to turbulence in these flows.
