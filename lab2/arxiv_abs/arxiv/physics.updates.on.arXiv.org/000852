Vortex-split stratospheric sudden warmings (S-SSWs) are investigated by using the Japanese 55-year
Reanalysis (JRA-55), a spherical barotropic quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, and equilibrium statistical
mechanics. The QG model reproduces well the evolution of the composite potential vorticity (PV)
field obtained from JRA-55 by considering a time-dependent effective topography given by the composite
height field of the 550 K potential temperature surface. The zonal-wavenumber-2 component of the
effective topography is the most essential feature required to observe the vortex splitting. The
statistical-mechanics theory predicts a large-scale steady state as the most probable outcome
of turbulent stirring, and such a state can be computed without solving the QG dynamics. The theory
is applied to a disk domain, which is modeled on the north polar cap in the stratosphere. The equilibrium
state is obtained by computing the maximum of an entropy functional. In the range of parameters relevant
to the winter stratosphere, this state is anticyclonic. By contrast, cyclonic states are quasi-stationary
states corresponding to saddle points of the entropy functional. The theoretical calculations
are compared with the results of the quasi-static experiment in which the wavenumber-2 topographic
amplitude is increased linearly and slowly with time. The results suggest that S-SSWs can be qualitatively
interpreted as the transition from the cyclonic quasi-stationary state toward the anticyclonic
equilibrium state. The polar vortex splits during the transition toward the equilibrium state.
Without any forcing such as radiative cooling, the anticyclonic equilibrium state would be realized
sufficiently after an S-SSW.
