Excited states of molecules lie in the heart of photochemistry and chemical reactions. The recent
development in quantum computational chemistry leads to inventions of a variety of algorithms
which calculate the excited states of molecules on near-term quantum computers, but they require
more computational burdens than the algorithms for the ground states. In this study, we propose
a scheme of supervised quantum machine learning which predicts excited state properties of molecules
only from its ground state wavefunction and results in reducing the computational cost for calculating
the excited states. Our model is comprised of a quantum reservoir and a classical machine machine
learning unit which processes the results of measurements of single-qubit Pauli operators. The
quantum reservoir effectively transforms the single-qubit operators into complicated multi-qubit
ones which contain essential information of the system, so that the classical machine learning
unit may decode them appropriately. The number of runs for quantum computers is saved by training
only the classical machine learning unit and the whole model requires modest resources of quantum
hardwares which may be implemented in current experiments. We illustrate the predictive ability
of our model by numerical simulations for small molecules with and without including noise inevitable
in near-term quantum computers. The results show that our scheme well reproduces the first and second
excitation energies as well as the transition dipole moment between the ground states and excited
states only from the ground state as an input. Our contribution will enhance applications of quantum
computers in the study of quantum chemistry and quantum materials.
