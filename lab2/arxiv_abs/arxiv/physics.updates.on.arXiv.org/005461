The structure and dynamics of confined suspensions of particles of arbitrary shape is of interest
in multiple disciplines, from biology to engineering. Theoretical studies are often limited by
the complexity of long-range particle-particle and particle-wall forces, including many-body
fluctuating hydrodynamic interactions. Here, we report a computational study on the diffusion
of spherical and cylindrical particles confined in a spherical cavity. We rely on an Immersed-Boundary
General geometry Ewald-like method to capture lubrication and long-range hydrodynamics, and
include appropriate non-slip conditions at the confining walls. A Chebyshev polynomial approximation
is used to satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the Brownian suspension. We explore
how lubrication, long-range hydrodynamics, particle volume fraction and shape affect the equilibrium
structure and the diffusion of the particles. It is found that once the particle volume fraction
is greater than $10\%$, the particles start to form layered aggregates that greatly influence particle
dynamics. Hydrodynamic interactions strongly influence the particle diffusion by inducing spatially
dependent short-time diffusion coefficients, stronger wall effects on the particle diffusion
towards the walls, and a sub-diffusive regime --caused by crowding-- in the long-time particle
mobility. The level of asymmetry of the cylindrical particles considered here is enough to induce
an orientational order in the layered structure, decreasing the diffusion rate and facilitating
a transition to the crowded mobility regime at low particle concentrations. Our results offer fundamental
insights into the diffusion and distribution of globular and fibrillar proteins inside cells.
