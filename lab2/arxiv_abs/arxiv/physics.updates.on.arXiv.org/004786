The habitable zone is the circumstellar region in which a terrestrial-mass planet with an atmosphere
can sustain liquid water on its surface. However, despite the usefulness of this concept, it is being
found to be increasingly limiting in a number of ways. The following is known: (i) Liquid water can
exist on worlds for reasons unrelated to its specific distance from a star. (ii) Energy sources can
exist for reasons unrelated to the distance to a star. Furthermore, the habitable zone is based on
both astronomy: the distance and stellar energy, and chemistry: liquid water and the right temperature.
However, these factors are only part of the consideration. Thus, discussions of habitability and
the possibility for the emergence of life on a world must consider the evolutionary principles that
govern life as well as the laws that govern stellar and planetary science. This is important because
the following is also known: (iii) The time window for the emergence of life is within 600 million
years. (iv) The Earth was an extreme environment overall in the period when this window existed.
(v) The first life was necessarily fragile. Therefore, chemical evolution must have taken place
in a relatively protected and restricted environment. Thus, rather than as in the Goldilocks zone,
which focuses too narrowly on the world as a whole, this paper suggests that it is better to focus on
a particular region and time period on a world, in which fitting conditions for habitability exist.
Thus, the following is suggested: The Goldilocks Edge is a spatial and temporal window on an astronomical
body or planemo, where liquid solvents, SPONCH elements, and energy sources exist. Furthermore,
since the mere presence of these do not in themselves necessarily lead to the emergence of life, this
possibility only arises when these interact. Thus, the prebiotic spot will be suggested.
