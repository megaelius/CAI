The Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring (CESR) has been converted from a High Energy Physics
electron-positron collider to operate as a dedicated synchrotron light source for the Cornell
High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and to conduct accelerator physics research as a test accelerator,
capable of studying topics relevant to future damping rings, colliders and light sources. Some
of the specific topics that were targeted for the initial phase of operation of the storage ring in
this mode for CESR as a Test Accelerator (CesrTA) included 1) tuning techniques to produce low emittance
beams, 2) the study of electron cloud development in a storage ring and 3) intra-beam scattering
effects. The complete conversion of CESR to CesrTA occurred over a several year period, described
elsewhere. In addition to instrumentation for the storage ring, which was created for CesrTA, existing
instrumentation was modified to facilitate the entire range of investigations to support these
studies. Procedures were developed, often requiring coordinated measurements among different
instruments. This paper describes the instruments utilized for the study of beam dynamics during
the operation of CesrTA. The treatment of these instruments will remain fairly general in this paper
as it focusses on an overview of the instruments themselves. Their interaction and inter-relationships
during sequences of observations is found in a companion paper describing the associated measurement
techniques. More detailed descriptions and detailed operational performance for some of the instrumentation
may be found elsewhere and these will be referenced in the related sections of this paper.
