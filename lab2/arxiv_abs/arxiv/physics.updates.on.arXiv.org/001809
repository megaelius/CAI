Suprathermal electrons and inertial drifting electrons, so called electron beam, are crucial
to the nonlinear dynamics of electrostatic solitary waves observed in several astrophysical plasmas.
In this paper, the propagation of electron-acoustic solitary waves is investigated in a collisionless,
unmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial background electrons, hot suprathermal electrons
(modeled by a $\kappa$-type distribution), and stationary ions. The plasma is penetrated by a cool
electron beam component. A linear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-amplitude
wave structures that shows a weak dependence of the phase speed on the electron beam velocity and
density. A (Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach is employed to obtain the existence domain
of large-amplitude solitary waves, and investigate how their nonlinear structures depend on the
kinematic and physical properties of the electron beam and the suprathermality (described by $\kappa$)
of the hot electrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can largely alter the electron-acoustic
solitary waves, but can only produce negative polarity solitary waves in this model. While the electron
beam co-propagates with the solitary waves, the soliton existence domain (Mach number range) becomes
narrower (nearly down to nil) with increasing the beam speed and the beam-to-hot electron temperature
ratio, and decreasing the beam-to-cool electron density ratio in high suprathermality (low $\kappa$).
It is found that the electric potential amplitude largely declines with increasing the beam speed
and the beam-to-cool electron density ratio for co-propagating solitary waves, but is slightly
decreased by raising the beam-to-hot electron temperature ratio.
