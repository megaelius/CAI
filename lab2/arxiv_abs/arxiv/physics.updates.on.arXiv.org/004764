This work assesses the feasibility of the direct use of surface-wave dispersion curves from seismic
ambient noise to gain insight into the crustal structure of Bransfield Strait and detect seasonal
seismic velocity changes. We cross-correlated four years of vertical component ambient noise
data recorded by a seismic array in West Antarctica. To estimate fundamental mode Rayleigh wave
Green's functions, the correlations are computed in 4-hr segments, stacked over 1-year time windows
and moving windows of 3 months. Rayleigh wave group dispersion curves are then measured on two spectral
bands; primary (10-30 s) and secondary (5-10 s) microseisms, using frequency-time analysis. We
analyze the temporal evolution of seismic velocity by comparing dispersion curves for the successive
annual and 3-month correlation stacks. Our main assumption was that the Green's functions from
the cross-correlations, and thus the dispersion curves, remain invariant if the crustal structure
remains unchanged. Maximum amplitudes of secondary microseisms were observed during local winter
when the Southern Ocean experiences winter storms. The Rayleigh wave group velocity ranges between
2.1 and 3.7 km/s, considering our period range studied. Inter-annual velocity variations are not
much evident. We observe a slight velocity decrease in summer and increase in winter, which could
be attributed to the pressure melting of ice and an increase in ice mass, respectively. The velocity
anomalies observed within the crust and upper mantle structure correlate with the major crustal
and upper mantle features known from previous studies in the area. Our results demonstrate that
the direct comparison of surface wave dispersion curves extracted from ambient noise might be a
useful tool in monitoring crustal structure variations.
