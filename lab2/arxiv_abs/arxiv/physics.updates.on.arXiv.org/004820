The deformation of a soft substrate by a straight contact line is calculated, and the result applied
to a static rivulet between two parallel contact lines. The substrate is supposed to be incompressible
(Stokes like description of elasticity), and having a non-zero surface tension, that eventually
differs depending on whether its surface is dry or wet. For a single straight line separating two
domains with the same substrate surface tension, the ridge profile is shown to be be very close to
that of Shanahan and de Gennes, but shift from the contact line of a distance equal to the elastocapillary
length built upon substrate surface tension and shear modulus. As a result, the divergence near
contact line disappears and is replaced by a balance of surface tensions at the contact line (Neumann
equilibrium), though the profile remains nearly logarithmic. In the rivulet case, using the previous
solution as a Green function allows one to calculate analytically the geometry of the distorted
substrate, and in particular its slope on each side (wet and dry) of the contact lines. These two slopes
are shown to be nearly proportional to the inverse of substrate surface tensions, though the respective
weight of each side (wet and dry) in the final expressions is difficult to establish because of the
linear nature of standard elasticity. A simple argument combining Neumann and Young equations
is however provided to overcome this limitation. The result may have surprising implications for
the modelling of hysteresis on systems having both plastic and elastic properties, as initiated
long ago by Extrand and Kumagai.
