Centrality, which quantifies the "importance" of individual nodes, is among the most essential
concepts in modern network theory. Most prominent centrality measures can be expressed as an aggregation
of influence flows between pairs of nodes. As there are many ways in which influence can be defined,
many different centrality measures are in use. Parametrized centralities allow further flexibility
and utility by tuning the centrality calculation to the regime most appropriate for a given network.
Here, we identify two categories of centrality parameters. Reach parameters control the attenuation
of influence flows between distant nodes. Grasp parameters control the centrality's potential
to send influence flows along multiple, often nongeodesic paths. Combining these categories with
Borgatti's centrality types [S. P. Borgatti, Social Networks 27, 55-71 (2005)], we arrive at a novel
classification system for parametrized centralities. Using this classification, we identify
the notable absence of any centrality measures that are radial, reach parametrized, and based on
acyclic, conservative flows of influence. We therefore introduce the ground-current centrality,
which is a measure of precisely this type. Because of its unique position in the taxonomy, the ground-current
centrality has significant advantages over similar centralities. We demonstrate that, compared
to other conserved-flow centralities, it has a simpler mathematical description. Compared to
other reach centralities, it robustly preserves an intuitive rank ordering across a wide range
of network architectures. We also show that it produces a consistent distribution of centrality
values among the nodes, neither trivially equally spread (delocalization), nor overly focused
on a few nodes (localization). Other reach centralities exhibit both of these behaviors on regular
networks and hub networks, respectively.
