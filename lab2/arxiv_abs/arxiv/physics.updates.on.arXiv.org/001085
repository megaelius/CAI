The relativistic electron beam (REB) propagation in a plasma is fraught with beam plasma instabilities.
The prominent amongst them being the collisionless Weibel destabilization which spatially separates
the forward propagating REB and the return shielding currents. This results in the formation of
REB current filaments which are typically of the size of electron skin depth during the linear stage
of the instability. It has been observed that in the nonlinear stage the filaments size increases
as they merge with each other. With the help of 2D PIC simulations in the plane perpendicular to the
REB propagation, it is shown that these mergers occur in two distinct nonlinear phases. In the first
phase, the total magnetic energy increases. Subsequently, however, during the second phase, one
observes a reduction in magnetic energy. It is shown that the transition from one nonlinear regime
to another occurs when the typical current associated with individual filaments hits the Alfven
threshold. In the second nonlinear regime, therefore, the filaments can no longer permit any increase
in current. Magnetic reconnection events then dissipate the excess current (and its associated
magnetic energy) that would result from a merger process leading to the generation of energetic
electrons jets in the perpendicular plane. At later times when there are only few filaments left
the individual reconnection events can be clearly identified. It is observed that in between such
events the magnetic energy remains constant and shows a sudden drop as and when two filaments merge.
The electron jets released in these recon- nection events are thus responsible for the transverse
heating which has been mentioned in some previous studies [Honda et al. Phys. Plasmas 7, 1302 (2000)].
