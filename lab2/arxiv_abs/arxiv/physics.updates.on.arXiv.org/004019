The wave spectral properties in the centimeter to decameter (cmDm) wavelength range is of great
interest to ocean remote sensing and studies of ocean surface processes including the surface roughness,
air-sea energy and momentum exchanges, wave breaking, and whitecap coverage. For more than six
decades, the cmDm wave components are generally considered to be in the equilibrium range, and its
spectral function has a constant slope: -5 or -4 in the 1D frequency spectrum, and -3 or -2.5 in the
1D wavenumber spectrum. Some variations of the equilibrium spectrum models include varying the
frequency spectral slope from 4 to 5 at some multiple of the spectral peak frequency, or incorporating
a threshold velocity in the reference wind speed. Extensive efforts are then devoted to quantifying
the spectral coefficient of the equilibrium spectrum function. The observed wind wave spectral
slopes in the ocean environment, however, are rarely constant. The variable spectral slope is indicative
of the nonequilibrium nature of surface wind waves in the field. As a result the wave properties in
field observations are significantly different from those inferred from assuming a constant spectral
slope. From signal-to-noise consideration the surface slope measurements are much more sensitive
than the elevation data for the study of cmDm waves. Recently, several large datasets of low-pass-filtered
mean square slope (LPMSS) have been reported in support of the Global Navigation Satellite System
Reflectometry (GNSSR) tropical cyclone wind sensing effort. Combining the LPMSS observations
with a spectrum model that accommodates a variable spectral slope, this paper seeks to quantify
the connection between the variable spectral slope and the spectral properties of cmDm waves.
