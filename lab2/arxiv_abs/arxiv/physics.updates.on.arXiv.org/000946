Superhydrophobic surfaces demonstrate promising potential for skin friction reduction in naval
and hydrodynamic applications. Recent developments of superhydrophobic surfaces aiming for
scalable applications use random distribution of roughness, such as spray coating and etched process.
However, most of previous analyses of the interaction between flows and superhydrophobic surfaces
studied periodic geometries that are economically feasible only in lab-scale experiments. We
conduct direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows over randomly patterned interfaces considering
a range of texture widths $w^+\approx 4-26$, and solid fractions $\phi_s=11\%$ to $25\%$. Slip
and no-slip boundary conditions are implemented in a pattern, modeling the presence of gas-liquid
interfaces and solid elements. Our results indicate that slip of randomly distributed textures
under turbulent flows are about $30\%$ less than those of surfaces with aligned features of the same
size. In the small texture size limit $w^+\approx 4$, the slip length of the randomly distributed
textures in turbulent flows is well described by a previously introduced Stokes flow solution of
randomly distributed shear-free holes. By comparing DNS results for patterned slip and no-slip
boundary against the corresponding homogenized slip length boundary conditions, we show that
turbulent flows over randomly distributed posts can be represented by an isotropic slip length
in streamwise and spanwise direction. The average pressure fluctuation on gas pocket is similar
to that of the aligned features with the same texture size and gas fraction, but the maximum interface
deformation at the leading edge of the roughness element is about twice larger when the textures
are randomly distributed.
