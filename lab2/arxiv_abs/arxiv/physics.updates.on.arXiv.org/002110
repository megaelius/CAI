Previous numerical studies on homogeneous Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, which is Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection (RBC) without walls, and therefore without boundary layers, have revealed a scaling
regime that is consistent with theoretical predictions of bulk-dominated thermal convection.
In this so-called asymptotic regime, previous studies have predicted that the Nusselt number ($Nu$)
and the Reynolds number ($Re$) vary with the Rayleigh number ($Ra$) according to $Nu\sim Ra^{1/2}$
and $Re\sim Ra^{1/2}$ at small Prandtl number ($Pr$). In this study, we consider a flow that is similar
to RBC but with the direction of temperature gradient perpendicular to gravity instead of parallel;
we refer to this configuration as vertical natural convection (VC). Since the direction of the temperature
gradient is different in VC, there is no exact relation for the average kinetic dissipation rate,
which makes it necessary to explore alternative definitions for $Nu$, $Re$ and $Ra$ and to find physical
arguments for closure, rather than making use of the exact relation between $Nu$ and the dissipation
rates as in RBC. Once we remove the walls from VC to obtain the homogeneous setup, we find that the aforementioned
$1/2$-power-law scaling is present, similar to the case of homogeneous RBC. When focussing on the
bulk, we find that the Nusselt and Reynolds numbers in the bulk of VC too exhibit the $1/2$-power-law
scaling. These results suggest that the $1/2$-power-law scaling may even be found at lower Rayleigh
numbers if the appropriate quantities in the turbulent bulk flow are employed for the definitions
of $Ra$, $Re$ and $Nu$. From a stability perspective, at low- to moderate-$Ra$, we find that the time-evolution
of the Nusselt number for homogenous vertical natural convection is unsteady, which is consistent
with the nature of the elevator modes reported in previous studies on homogeneous RBC.
