Background --The objective of this study was to examine the association of routine blood test results
with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, to incorporate them into coronary prediction models and
to compare the discrimination properties of this approach with other prediction functions. Methods
and Results --This work was designed as a retrospective, single-center study of a hospital-based
cohort. The 5060 CHD patients (2365 men and 2695 women) were 1 to 97 years old at baseline with 8 years
(2009-2017) of medical records, 5051 health check-ups and 5075 cases of other diseases. We developed
a two-layer Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT) model based on routine blood data to predict
the risk of coronary heart disease, which could identify 86% of people with coronary heart disease.
We built a dataset with 15,000 routine blood tests results. Using this dataset, we trained the two-layer
GBDT model to classify healthy status, coronary heart disease and other diseases. As a result of
the classification after machine learning, we found that the sensitivity of detecting the health
data was approximately 93% for all data, and the sensitivity of detecting CHD was 93% for disease
data that included coronary heart disease. On this basis, we further visualized the correlation
between routine blood results and related data items, and there was an obvious pattern in health
and coronary heart disease in all data presentations, which can be used for clinical reference.
Finally, we briefly analyzed the results above from the perspective of pathophysiology. Conclusions
--Routine blood data provides more information about CHD than what we already know through the correlation
between test results and related data items. A simple coronary disease prediction model was developed
using a GBDT algorithm, which will allow physicians to predict CHD risk in patients without overt
CHD.
