Interface engineering of organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) plays a pivotal
role in achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Graphene and related two-dimensional
materials (GRMs) are promising candidates to tune on demand the interface properties of PSCs. In
this work, we fully exploit the potential of GRMs by controlling the optoelectronic properties
of hybrids between molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as hole transport
layer (HTL) and active buffer layer (ABL) in mesoscopic methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3)
perovskite (MAPbI3)-based PSC. We show that zero-dimensional MoS2 quantum dots (MoS2 QDs), derived
by liquid phase exfoliated MoS2 flakes, provide both hole-extraction and electron-blocking properties.
In fact, on the one hand, intrinsic n-type doping-induced intra-band gap states effectively extract
the holes through an electron injection mechanism. On the other hand, quantum confinement effects
increase the optical band gap of MoS2 (from 1.4 eV for the flakes to > 3.2 for QDs), raising the minimum
energy of its conduction band (from -4.3 eV for the flakes to -2.2 eV for QDs) above the one of conduction
band of MAPbI3 (between -3.7 and -4 eV) and hindering electron collection. The van der Waals hybridization
of MoS2 QDs with functionalized reduced graphene oxide (f-RGO), obtained by chemical silanization-induced
linkage between RGO and (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane, is effective to homogenize the
deposition of HTLs or ABLs onto the perovskite film, since the two-dimensional (2D) nature of RGO
effectively plug the pinholes of the MoS2 QDs films. Our graphene interface engineering (GIE) strategy
based on van der Waals MoS2 QD/graphene hybrids enable MAPbI3-based PSCs to achieve PCE up to 20.12%
(average PCE of 18.8%).
