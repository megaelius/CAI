The role of activity on the hydrodynamic dispersion of bacteria in a model porous medium is studied
by tracking thousands of bacteria in a microfluidic chip containing randomly placed pillars. We
first evaluate the spreading dynamics of two populations of motile and non-motile bacteria injected
at different flow rates. In both cases, we observe that the mean and the variance of the distances
covered by the bacteria vary linearly with time and flow velocity, a result qualitatively consistent
with the standard geometric dispersion picture. However, quantitatively, the motiles bacteria
display a systematic retardation effect when compared to the non-motile ones. Furthermore, the
shape of the traveled distance distribution in the flow direction differs significantly for both
the motile and the non-motile strain, hence probing a markedly different exploration process.
For the non-motile bacteria, the distribution is Gaussian whereas for the motile ones, the distribution
displays a positive skewness and spreads exponentially downstream akin to a Gamma distribution.
The detailed microscopic study of the trajectories reveals two salient effects characterizing
the exploration process of motile bacteria : (i) The emergence of an "active" retention effect due
to an extended exploration of the pore surfaces, (ii) an enhanced spreading at the forefront due
to the transport of bacteria along "fast-tracks" where they acquire a velocity larger than the local
flow velocity. We finally discuss the practical applications of these effects on the large-scale
macroscopic transfer and contamination processes caused by microbes in natural environments.
