Robustness and cascading failures in interdependent systems has been an active research field
in the past decade. However, most existing works use percolation-based models where only the largest
component of each network remains functional throughout the cascade. Although suitable for communication
networks, this assumption fails to capture the dependencies in systems carrying a flow (e.g., power
systems, road transportation networks), where cascading failures are often triggered by redistribution
of flows leading to overloading of lines. Here, we consider a model consisting of systems $A$ and
$B$ with initial line loads and capacities given by $\{L_{A,i},C_{A,i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$ and $\{L_{B,i},C_{B,i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$,
respectively. When a line fails in system $A$, $a$-fraction of its load is redistributed to alive
lines in $B$, while remaining $(1-a)$-fraction is redistributed equally among all functional
lines in $A$; a line failure in $B$ is treated similarly with $b$ giving the fraction to be redistributed
to $A$. We give a thorough analysis of cascading failures of this model initiated by a random attack
targeting $p_1$-fraction of lines in $A$ and $p_2$-fraction in $B$. We show that (i) the model captures
the real-world phenomenon of unexpected large scale cascades and exhibits interesting transition
behavior: the final collapse is always first-order, but it can be preceded by a sequence of first
and second-order transitions; (ii) network robustness tightly depends on the coupling coefficients
$a$ and $b$, and robustness is maximized at non-trivial $a,b$ values in general; (iii) unlike existing
models, interdependence has a multi-faceted impact on system robustness in that interdependency
can lead to an improved robustness for each individual network.
