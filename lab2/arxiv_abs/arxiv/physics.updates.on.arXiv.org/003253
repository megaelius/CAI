The prediction of heart surface potentials using measurements from the body's surface is known
as the inverse problem of electrocardiography. It is an ill-posed problem due to the multiple factors
that affect the heart signal as it propagates through the body. This report details research performed
into a machine learning solution to signal reconstruction as well as an analysis of optimal torso
electrode positioning for prediction involving different areas of the heart. The dataset contains
simultaneous measurements from a large number of body surface potential (BSP) and heart surface
potential (HSP) electrodes, as well as their geometric locations, recorded from an experiment
using a human model. Initially, Time Delayed Neural Nets were trained and tested across all BSP to
HSP relationships resulting in a slight trend of increased reconstruction correlation with decreased
separation of electrodes. However, the TDNNs had overfitted to the data and failed to predict alternate
heartbeat pacings. Feed Forward Neural Nets (FFNNs) were tested in a many BSP to many HSP prediction
method. Again overfitting occurred. To reduce overfitting, the number of training signals was
reduced by analysing the optimal training BSPs for each HSP when using basic perceptrons. This analysis
involved repeat sampling and ranking of different BSP combinations, initially, using a Monte Carlo
approximation, until being replaced with a meta-heuristic which increased the yield of successful
BSP combinations. Successful reconstructions across heartbeat pacings were produced using these
optimal BSP combinations for 80 of the 108 HSPs, and future work exists for the testing of this method
of prediction using real patient data.
