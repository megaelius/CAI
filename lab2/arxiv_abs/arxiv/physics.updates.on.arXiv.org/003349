The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a popular numerical framework to investigate single and multiphase
flow though porous media. For estimation of absolute permeability based on micro-tomographic
images of the porous medium, the single-relaxation time (SRT) collision model is the most widely-used,
although the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision model also has recently acquired wider
usage, especially for industrial applications. However, the SRT collision model and a sub-optimal
choice of the MRT collision parameters can both lead to permeability predictions that depend on
the relaxation time, \tau. This parametric dependence is nonphysical for Stokes flow in porous
media and also leads to much larger number of iterations required for convergence. In this paper,
we performed a systematic numerical evaluation of the different sets of relaxation parameters
in the D3Q19-MRT model for modeling Stokes flow in 3-D microtomographic pore-spaces using the bounceback
scheme. These sets of parameters are evaluated from the point of view of accuracy, convergence rate,
and an ability to generate parameter-independent permeability solutions. Instead of tuning all
six independent relaxation rates that are available in the MRT model, the sets that were analyzed
have relaxation rates that depend on one or two independent parameters, namely \tau and \Lambda.
We tested elementary porous media at different image resolutions and a random packing of spheres
at relatively high resolution. We observe that sets of certain specific relaxation parameters
(Sets B, D, or E as listed in Table 2), and \tau in the range \tau\in[1.0,1.3] can result in best overall
accuracy, convergence rate, and parameter-independent permeability predictions.
