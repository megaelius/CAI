The noise in daily infection counts of an epidemic should be super-Poissonian due to intrinsic epidemiological
and administrative clustering. Here, we use this clustering to classify the official national
SARS-CoV-2 daily infection counts and check for infection counts that are unusual by being anti-clustered.
We adopt a one-parameter model of $\phi_i'$ infections per cluster, dividing any daily count $n_i$
into $n_i/\phi_i'$ 'clusters', for 'country' $i$. We assume that $n_i/\phi_i'$ on a given day $j$
is drawn from a Poisson distribution whose mean is robustly estimated from the four neighbouring
days, and calculate the inferred Poisson probability $P_{ij}'$ of the observation. The $P_{ij}'$
values should be uniformly distributed. We find the value $\phi_i$ that minimises the Kolmogorov--Smirnov
distance from a uniform distribution. We investigate the $(\phi_i, N_i)$ distribution, for total
infection count $N_i$. We consider consecutive count sequences above a threshold of 50 daily infections.
We find that most of the daily infection count sequences are inconsistent with a Poissonian model.
All are consistent with the $\phi_i$ model. Clustering increases with total infection count for
the full sequences: $\phi_i \sim\sqrt{N_i}$. The 28-, 14- and 7-day least noisy sequences for several
countries are best modelled as sub-Poissonian, suggesting a distinct epidemiological family.
The 28-day sequences of DZ, BY, TR, AE have strongly sub-Poissonian preferred models, with $\phi_i^{28}
<0.5$; and FI, SA, RU, AL, IR have $\phi_i^{28} <3.0$. Independent verification may be warranted
for those countries with unusually low clustering.
