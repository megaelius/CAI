Understanding the movement of charge within organic semiconducting films is crucial for applications
in photo-voltaics and flexible electronics. We study the sensitivity of the electrical conductance
of a silicon nanowire to changes of charge states within an organic semiconductor physisorbed on
the surface of the nanowire. Elastic scattering caused by motion of charge carriers near the nanowire
modifies the mean-free path for backscattering of electrons propagating within it, which we have
mathematically expressed in terms of the causal Green's functions. The scattering potential has
been computed using a combination of the polarizable continuum model and density functional theory
with the range-separated exchange-correlation functional for organic molecules and the semi-empirical
tight-binding model for silicon. As an example, the sensitivity to charge state changes in tetracene
is computed as a function of operating temperature and geometrical parameters of a nanowire. For
a single molecule, ultra-thin silicon nanowires with characteristic sizes of the cross-section
below 2 nm produce a detectable conductance change at room temperature. For larger nanowires the
sensitivity is reduced, however the conductance change grows with the number of charged molecules:
with sub-4 nm nanowires being sensitive enough to detect several tens of charge carriers. We propose
using noise spectroscopy to access the temporal evolution of the charge states. Information regarding
the spatial distribution of charge carries in organic thin films can be obtained using a grid of nanowire
resistors and electric impedance tomography.
