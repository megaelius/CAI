Different types of concave plasmonic nanoresonators have been optimized to achieve superradiantly
enhanced emission of SiV color centers in diamond. Comparative study has been performed to consider
advantages of different N number of color centers treated as dipolar emitters, different diamond-silver
(bare) and diamond-silver-diamond (coated) core-shell nanoresonator types, as well as of spherical
and ellipsoidal geometry. The complete fluorescence enhancement (qualified by Px factor) monitoring
and the cQE corrected quantum efficiency weighted PxcQE objective function optimization promotes
to design bad-cavities to achieve plasmonic Dicke effect. The switching of randomly oscillating
emitters into Dicke state via optimized nanoresonators results in a radiated power proportional
to N^2, which manifest itself in an enhancement proportional to N both of the excitation and emission
rates. Accordingly, enhancement proportional to N^2 of the Px factor and PxcQE has been reached
both via four and six color centers arranged in symmetrical square and hexagonal patterns embedded
into either bare or coated type nanoresonators. Coated spherical and bare ellipsoidal nanoresonators
result in stronger non-cooperative fluorescence enhancement, while superradiance is better
achieved via bare nanoresonators independently of geometry. Bare ellipsoidal nanoresonators
simultaneously result in larger Px factor and PxcQE and more significantly override superradiance
thresholds due to their more pronounced bad-cavity characteristics. Superradiance accompanied
by indistinguishability and line-width narrowing is achieved via bare nanoresonators embedding
four dipoles, while bare nanoresonators embedding six dipoles balance more efficient fluorescence
and superradiance, finally both phenomena are simultaneously optimized in bare ellipsoidal nanoresonators
embedding six dipoles.
