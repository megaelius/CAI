This paper is the first in a series which develops the theory of emittance dynamics based on simple
statistical reasoning. Emittance is a central quantity used to characterize the quality of electron
microscopes, photon sources and particle beams. Emittance growth in high intensity charged particle
beams is a particularly challenging non-equilibrium statistical physics problem in which effects
such as disordered-induced heating and charge reorganization can lead to very rapid degradation
of emittance and beam quality. The concepts of free energy and entropy have been utilized to improve
conceptual understanding of emittance dynamics. Here we develop a theory based on the second order
cumulant of particle distributions and use this formulation to exactly solve several one dimensional
problems. These solutions are important extensions of the existing results for the free expansion
dynamics of pancake bunches used in ultrafast electron microscopy, which at short times are known
to expand quadratically with time[1-3]. Here we show that the squared emittance of a strictly planar
expanding bunch increases as a quadratic polynomial of time. We compare theories based on individual
particle trajectories with theories based on distributions and expand the foundations of theories
based on individual particle trajectories, which we call the "sample picture". Our later work uses
this formulation to derive generalized envelope equations which capture emittance growth effects
in two and three dimensional systems. 1. B. J. Siwick, J. R. Dwyer, R. E. Jordan, and R. J. Dwayne Miller,
