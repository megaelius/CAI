When a mechanical wavemaker at one end of a wave tank oscillates with a frequency, $\omega_0$, time
series of downstream waves typically include the dominant frequency (or first harmonic), $\omega_0$,
along with the second, $2\omega_0$; third, $3\omega_0$; and higher harmonics. Presented herein
are measurements of the amplitudes of the second harmonic band from four surface water wave laboratory
experiments. The measurements are compared to predictions from the Stokes expansion and from nonlinear-Schr\"odinger
(NLS) type equations. The Stokes expansion for water waves provides predictions for the amplitudes
of the second and higher harmonics given the amplitude of the first harmonic. In this expansion,
the harmonics are forced waves. The NLS equation and its generalizations are models for the evolution
of the amplitudes of weakly nonlinear, narrow-banded waves. Their derivations provide predictions,
which have corrections to those of the Stokes expansion, for the amplitudes of the forced harmonic
bands given the amplitudes of the waves in the dominant band. The measurements of the amplitude evolution
of the second harmonic mode are compared to predictions obtained from the Stokes expansion and from
the NLS equation and four of its generalizations, all of which assume that the second harmonic is
a forced wave. The measurements are also compared to predictions from numerical computations of
NLS and four of its generalizations when the second harmonic is assumed to be a free wave. Comparisons
show that although the Stokes prediction and generalized NLS formulas provide reasonably accurate
predictions for the amplitude evolution of the second harmonic band, the waves behave more as free
waves than as forced waves. Further, the dissipative generalizations of NLS consistently outperform
the conservative ones.
