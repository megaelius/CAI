Purpose: To enable fast and reliable assessment of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue compartments
derived from whole-body MRI. Methods: Quantification and localization of different adipose tissue
compartments from whole-body MR images is of high interest to examine metabolic conditions. For
correct identification and phenotyping of individuals at increased risk for metabolic diseases,
a reliable automatic segmentation of adipose tissue into subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue
is required. In this work we propose a 3D convolutional neural network (DCNet) to provide a robust
and objective segmentation. In this retrospective study, we collected 1000 cases (66$\pm$ 13 years;
523 women) from the Tuebingen Family Study and from the German Center for Diabetes research (TUEF/DZD),
as well as 300 cases (53$\pm$ 11 years; 152 women) from the German National Cohort (NAKO) database
for model training, validation, and testing with a transfer learning between the cohorts. These
datasets had variable imaging sequences, imaging contrasts, receiver coil arrangements, scanners
and imaging field strengths. The proposed DCNet was compared against a comparable 3D UNet segmentation
in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and Dice overlap. Results: Fast (5-7seconds)
and reliable adipose tissue segmentation can be obtained with high Dice overlap (0.94), sensitivity
(96.6%), specificity (95.1%), precision (92.1%) and accuracy (98.4%) from 3D whole-body MR datasets
(field of view coverage 450x450x2000mm${}^3$). Segmentation masks and adipose tissue profiles
are automatically reported back to the referring physician. Conclusion: Automatic adipose tissue
segmentation is feasible in 3D whole-body MR data sets and is generalizable to different epidemiological
cohort studies with the proposed DCNet.
