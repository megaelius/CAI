Water molecules adsorbed on inorganic substrates play an important role in several technological
applications. In the presence of light atoms in adsorbates, nuclear quantum effects (NQE) influence
properties of these systems. In this work, we explore the impact of NQE on the dissociation of water
wires on stepped Pt(221) surfaces. By performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with
van der Waals corrected density functional theory, we note that several competing minima for both
intact and dissociated structures are accessible at finite temperatures, making it important
to assess whether harmonic estimates of the quantum free energy are sufficient to determine the
relative stability of the different states. We perform ab initio path integral molecular dynamics
(PIMD) in order to calculate these contributions taking into account conformational entropy and
anharmonicities at finite temperatures. We propose that when when adsorption is weak and NQE on
the substrate are negligible, PIMD simulations can be performed through a simple partition of the
system, resulting in considerable computational savings. We calculate the contribution of NQE
to the free energies, including anharmonic terms. We find that they result in an increase of up to
20% of the quantum contribution to the dissociation free energy compared to harmonic estimates.
We also find that the dissociation has a negligible contribution from tunneling, but is dominated
by ZPE, which can enhance the rate by three orders of magnitude. Finally we highlight how both temperature
and NQE indirectly impact dipoles and the redistribution of electron density, causing work function
to changes of up to 0.4 eV with respect to static estimates. This quantitative determination of the
change in work function provides a possible approach to determine experimentally the most stable
configurations of water oligomers on the stepped surfaces.
