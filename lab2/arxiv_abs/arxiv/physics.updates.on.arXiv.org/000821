A variety of numerical methods exist for the study of deformable particles in dense suspensions.
None of the standard tools, however, currently include volume-changing objects such as oscillating
microbubbles in three-dimensional periodic domains. In the first part of this work, we develop
a novel method to include such entities based on the boundary integral method. We show that the well-known
boundary integral equation must be amended with two additional terms containing the volume flux
through the bubble surface. We rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our
proof contains as a subset the simpler boundary integral equation without volume-changing objects
(such as red blood cell or capsule suspensions) which is widely used but for which a formal proof in
periodic domains has not been published to date. In the second part, we apply our method to study microbubbles
for targeted drug delivery. The ideal drug delivery agent should stay away from the biochemically
active vessel walls during circulation. However, upon reaching its target it should attain a near-wall
position for efficient drug uptake. Though seemingly contradictory, we show that lipid-coated
microbubbles in conjunction with a localized ultrasound pulse possess precisely these two properties.
This ultrasound-triggered margination is due to hydrodynamic interactions between the red blood
cells and the oscillating lipid-coated microbubbles which alternate between a soft and a stiff
state. We find that the effect is very robust, existing even if the duration in the stiff state is more
than three times lower than the opposing time in the soft state.
