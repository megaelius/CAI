Dual-continuum (DC) models can be tractable alternatives to explicit approaches for the numerical
modelling of multiscale materials with multiphysics behaviours. This work concerns the conceptual
and numerical modelling of poroelastically coupled dual-scale materials such as naturally fractured
rock. Apart from a few exceptions, previous poroelastic DC models have assumed isotropy of the constituents
and the dual-material. Additionally, it is common to assume that only one continuum has intrinsic
stiffness properties. Finally, little has been done into validating whether the DC paradigm can
capture the global poroelastic behaviours of explicit numerical representations at the DC modelling
scale. We address the aforementioned knowledge gaps in two steps. First, we utilise a homogenisation
approach based on Levin's theorem to develop a previously derived anisotropic poroelastic constitutive
model. Our development incorporates anisotropic intrinsic stiffness properties of both continua.
This addition is in analogy to anisotropic fractured rock masses with stiff fractures. Second,
we perform numerical modelling to test the dual-continuum model against fine-scale explicit equivalents.
In doing, we present our hybrid numerical framework, as well as the conditions required for interpretation
of the numerical results. The tests themselves progress from materials with isotropic to anisotropic
mechanical and flow properties. The fine-scale simulations show anisotropy can have noticeable
effects on deformation and flow behaviour. However, our numerical experiments show the DC approach
can capture the global poroelastic behaviours of both isotropic and anisotropic fine-scale representations.
