The question of what animals understand about their social worlds is fundamental to studies of the
evolution of sociality, cognition, and animal culture. However, the presence and extent of social
knowledge in individuals is difficult to detect, and when detections have been made, differences
in methodology make cross-species comparisons difficult. We present a new method for detecting
social knowledge. This method infers individual-level strategic rules for aggression in dominance
hierarchies where rank differences between individuals may structure decision-making. We apply
this method to a data from 172 social groups across 85 species in 22 orders. By looking for heuristics
that depend upon knowledge of group-level facts, we can back-infer the types of knowledge individuals
possess. Summary measures then place groups within a taxonomy, providing a "social assay" of group-level
knowledge. This assay allows the identification of consensus strategies at the group level. The
majority of animal groups in our dataset (112 groups, 65%) follow a downward heuristic, spreading
aggression relatively equally across lower-ranked opponents. An additional 50 groups (29%) use
strategies that are indicative of more detailed rank knowledge. Different groups within the same
species can use different strategies, indicating that the choice of heuristics may be contextual
and that the structuring of aggression should not be considered a fixed characteristic of a species.
Instead, individuals may be able to plastically respond to changes in environmental or social conditions
by changing their strategies. Our approach to studying animal conflict provides new opportunities
to investigate the extent of rank knowledge across species, compare the evolution of social knowledge,
and better understand the effect of social knowledge on individual behaviour in within-group conflict.
