Purpose: A time-efficient strategy to acquire high-quality multi-contrast images is to reconstruct
undersampled data with joint regularization terms that leverage common information across contrasts.
However, these terms can cause leakage of uncommon features among contrasts, compromising diagnostic
utility. The goal of this study is to develop a compressive sensing method for multi-channel multi-contrast
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that optimally utilizes shared information while preventing
feature leakage. Theory: Joint regularization terms group sparsity and colour total variation
are used to exploit common features across images while individual sparsity and total variation
are also used to prevent leakage of distinct features across contrasts. The multi-channel multi-contrast
reconstruction problem is solved via a fast algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers. Methods: The proposed method is compared against using only individual and only joint
regularization terms in reconstruction. Comparisons were performed on single-channel simulated
and multi-channel in-vivo datasets in terms of reconstruction quality and neuroradiologist reader
scores. Results: The proposed method demonstrates rapid convergence and improved image quality
for both simulated and in-vivo datasets. Furthermore, while reconstructions that solely use joint
regularization terms are prone to leakage-of-features, the proposed method reliably avoids leakage
via simultaneous use of joint and individual terms. Conclusion: The proposed compressive sensing
method performs fast reconstruction of multi-channel multi-contrast MRI data with improved image
quality. It offers reliability against feature leakage in joint reconstructions, thereby holding
great promise for clinical use.
