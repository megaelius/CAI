Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) is a sensitive biomarker for microstructure in health and disease.
However, DKI is not specific to any microstructural property since it may emerge from several different
sources. Q-space trajectory encoding has been proposed for decoupling isotropic from anisotropic
kurtosis. Still, this method assume that the system is comprised of multiple Gaussian diffusion
components. Here, we develop a more general framework for resolving the underlying kurtosis sources.
We introduce Correlation Tensor MRI (CTI) - an approach harnessing the versatility of double diffusion
encoding (DDE) and capable of explicitly decoupling isotropic and anisotropic kurtosis components
from intra-compartmental kurtosis effects arising from restricted diffusion. Additionally,
CTI provides an index that is potentially sensitive to intra-compartmental kurtosis. The theoretical
foundations of CTI, as well as the first proof-of-concept CTI ex vivo experiments in mouse brains
at a field of 16.4T, are presented. We find that anisotropic and isotropic kurtosis can decouple
microscopic anisotropy from substantial partial volume effects between tissue and free water.
Our intra-compartmental kurtosis index exhibited positive values in both white and grey matter
tissues. Simulations in different microenvironments show, however, that our current CTI protocol
for estimating intra-compartmental kurtosis is limited by higher-order terms that were not considered
in this study. CTI measurements were then extended to in vivo settings and used to map healthy rat
brains at 9.4T. These in vivo CTI results were consistent with our ex vivo findings. Although future
studies are still required to mitigate the higher-order effects on the intra-compartmental kurtosis
index, results show that CTI's more general estimates of anisotropic and isotropic kurtosis contributions
are already ripe for future studies.
