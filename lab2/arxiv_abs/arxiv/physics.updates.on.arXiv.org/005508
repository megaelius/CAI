New line lists are presented for the two most abundant water isotopologues; H$_{2}$$^{16}$O and
H$_{2}$$^{18}$O. The H$_{2}$$^{16}$O line list extends to 25710 cm$^{-1}$ with intensity stabilities
provided via ratios of calculated intensities obtained from two different semi-empirical potential
energy surfaces. The line list for H$_{2}$$^{18}$O extends to 20000 cm$^{-1}$. The minimum intensity
considered for all is $10^{-30}$ cm molecule$^{-1}$ at 296~K, assuming 100\% abundance for each
isotopologue. Fluctuation of calculated intensities caused by changes in the underlying potential
energy are found to be significant, particularly for weak transitions. Direct comparisons are
made against eighteen different sources of line intensities, both experimental and theoretical,
many of which are used within the HITRAN2016 database. With some exceptions, there is excellent
agreement between our line lists and the experimental intensities in HITRAN2016. In the infrared
region, many H$_{2}$$^{16}$O bands which exhibit intensity differences of 5-10\% between to the
most recent 'POKAZATEL' line list (Polyansky \textit{et al.}, [Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc. \textbf{480},
2597 (2018)] and observation, are now generally predicted to within 1\%. For H$_{2}$$^{18}$O,
there are systematic differences in the strongest intensities calculated in this work versus those
obtained from semi-empirical calculations. In the visible, computed cross sections show smaller
residuals between our work and both HITRAN2016 and HITEMP2010 than POKAZATEL. While our line list
accurately reproduces HITEMP2010 cross sections in the observed region, residuals produced from
this comparison do however highlight the need to update line positions in the visible spectrum of
HITEMP2010. These line lists will be used to update many transition intensities and line positions
in the HITRAN2016 database.
