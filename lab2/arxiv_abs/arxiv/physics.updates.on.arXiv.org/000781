Natural wind-eroded soils generally contain a mixture of particle sizes. However, models for aeolian
saltation are typically derived for sediment bed surfaces containing only a single particle size.
To treat natural mixed beds, models for saltation and associated dust aerosol emission have typically
simplified aeolian transport either as a series of non-interacting single particle size beds or
as a bed containing only the median or mean particle size. Here, we test these common assumptions
underpinning aeolian transport models using measurements of size-resolved saltation fluxes
at three natural field sites. We find that a wide range of sand size classes experience "equal susceptibility"
to saltation at a single common threshold wind shear stress, contrary to the "selective susceptibility"
expected for treatment of a mixed bed as multiple single particle size beds. Furthermore, we observe
strong size-selectivity in the mobility of different particle sizes, which is not adequately accounted
for in current models. At all field sites, mobility is enhanced for particles that are 0.4-0.8 times
the median bed particle diameter, while mobility declines rapidly with increasing particle size
above this range. We further observe that the most mobile particles also experience the largest
saltation heights, which helps to explain variations in size-selective mobility. These observations
refute the common simplification of saltation as a series of non-interacting single particle sizes.
Sand transport and dust emission models that use this incorrect assumption can be both simplified
and improved by instead using a single particle size representative of the mixed bed.
