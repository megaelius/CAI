This work investigates the class of prime star multiplexes, in which each of its layers $i$, $i=1,2,
\ldots M$, consists of a regular cycle graph where any node has $2J_i$ neighbors. In a process that
does not affect the cyclic topology, it is assumed that, before the multiplex is assembled, the nodes
are labeled differently in each individual layer. As the setup requires that all representations
of the same node in the different $M$ layers must be linked by inter-layers connections, the resulting
multiplex pattern can be highly complex. This can be better visualized if one assumes that in one
layer the nodes are labeled in the sequentially ascending order and that the nodes with the same label
are drawn on the top of the other, so that all inter-layer connections are represented by vertical
lines. In such cases, the other $M-1$ layers are characterized by long distance shortcuts. As a consequence,
in spite of sharing the same internal topological structure, the multiplex ends up with very dissimilar
layers. For prime number of nodes, a regular star geometry arises by requiring that the neighbor
labels of the $M-1$ layers differ by a constant value $p_i>1$. For $M=2$, we use analytical and numerical
approaches to provide a thorough characterization of the multiplex topological properties, of
the inter layer dissimilarity, and of the diffusive dynamical processes taking place on them. For
the sake of definitiveness, it is considered that each node in the sequentially labeled layer is
characterized by $J_1\geq1$. In the other layer, we fix $J_2\equiv1$, while $p>1$ becomes a proxy
of layer dissimilarity.
