Portable low-cost MRI systems have the potential to enable point-of-care and timely MRI diagnosis,
and to make this imaging modality available to routine scans and to underdeveloped areas. With simplicity,
no maintenance, no power consumption, and low cost, permanent magnets or arrays are attractive
to use as a source of magnetic field to realize portability and low cost for a scanners. However, when
taking the Fourier imaging approach and using linear gradient fields, homogeneous fields are required,
thus either a bulky magnet is needed, or the imaging volume is too small to image an organ if the magnet
is scaled down. Recently, with the progress on image reconstruction based on non-linear gradient
field, field patterns without spatial-linearity can be used as spatial encoding magnetic fields
to encode MRI signals for imaging. As a result, the requirements for the homogeneity of the field
can be relaxed, which allows permanent magnets(arrays) with reduced sizes, reduced weight to image
bigger volumes covering organs such as a head. It offers chances to construct a truly portable low-cost
MRI scanner. For this exciting potential application, permanent magnets(arrays) have attracted
increased attention. A magnet(array) is strongly associated with the imaging volume, reconstruction
methods, and RF excitation and coils, etc. through field patterns and homogeneity. This paper offers
a review on permanent magnets(arrays) of different kinds, especially those can be used for spatial
encoding towards the development of portable and low-cost MRI systems. It is aimed to familiarize
the readers with relevant knowledge, literature, and the latest updates of the development on permanent
magnets for MRI. Perspectives on and challenges of using permanent magnets to supply a patterned
magnetic field, without spatial-linearity nor high homogeneity, for reconstruction in a portable
setup are discussed.
