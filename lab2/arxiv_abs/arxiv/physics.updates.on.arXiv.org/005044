Mesh-free methods have significant potential for simulations in complex geometries, as the time
consuming process of mesh-generation is avoided. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is the
most widely used mesh-free method, but suffers from a lack of consistency. High order, consistent,
and local (using compact computational stencils) mesh-free methods are particularly desirable.
Here we present a novel framework for generating local high order difference operators for arbitrary
node distributions, referred to as the Local Anisotropic Basis Function Method (LABFM). Weights
are constructed from linear sums of anisotropic basis functions (ABFs), chosen to eliminate all
errors below a given order. ABFs are based on a fundamental Radial Basis Function (RBF), and the choice
of fundamental RBF has small effect on accuracy, but influences stability. LABFM is able to generate
high order difference operators with compact computational stencils (4th order with 25 node stencils,
8th order with 60 node stencils). At domain boundaries LABFM automatically provides one-sided
differences of the same order as the internal scheme, up to 4th order. We use the method to solve elliptic,
parabolic and mixed hyperbolic-parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), showing up
to 8 th order convergence. The inclusion of hyperviscosity is straightforward, and can effectively
provide stability when solving hyperbolic problems. LABFM is a promising new mesh-free method
for the numerical solution of PDEs in complex geometries. The method is highly scalable, and for
Eulerian schemes, the computational efficiency is competitive with RBF-FD for a given accuracy.
A particularly attractive feature is that in the low order limit, LABFM collapses to Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH), and there is potential for Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian schemes with natural
adaptivity of resolution and accuracy.
