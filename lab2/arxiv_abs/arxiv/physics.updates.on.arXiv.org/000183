Magnetorotational dynamo action in Keplerian shear flow is a three-dimensional, nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic
process whose study is relevant to the understanding of accretion and magnetic field generation
in astrophysics. Transition to this form of dynamo is subcritical and shares many characteristics
of transition to turbulence in non-rotating hydrodynamic shear flows. This suggests that these
different fluid systems become active through similar generic bifurcation mechanisms, which
in both cases have eluded detailed understanding so far. In this paper, we investigate numerically
the bifurcation mechanisms at work in the incompressible Keplerian magnetorotational dynamo
problem in the shearing box framework. Using numerical techniques imported from dynamical systems
research, we show that the onset of chaotic dynamo action at magnetic Prandtl numbers larger than
unity is primarily associated with global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations of nonlinear
magnetorotational dynamo cycles. These global bifurcations are supplemented by local bifurcations
of cycles marking the beginning of period-doubling cascades. This suggests that nonlinear magnetorotational
dynamo cycles provide the pathway to turbulent injection of both kinetic and magnetic energy in
incompressible magnetohydrodynamic Keplerian shear flow in the absence of an externally imposed
magnetic field. Studying the nonlinear physics and bifurcations of these cycles in different regimes
and configurations may subsequently help to better understand the conditions of excitation of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and instability-driven dynamos in various astrophysical systems
and laboratory experiments. The detailed characterization of global bifurcations provided for
this three-dimensional subcritical fluid dynamics problem may also prove useful for the problem
of transition to turbulence in hydrodynamic shear flows.
