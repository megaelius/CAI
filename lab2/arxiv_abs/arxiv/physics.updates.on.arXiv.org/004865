This study considers that the collective route choices of travelers en route represent a resolution
of their competition on network routes. Well understanding this competition and coordinating
their route choices help mitigate urban traffic congestion. Even though existing studies have
developed such mechanisms (e.g., the CRM [1]), we still lack the quantitative method to evaluate
the coordination penitential and identify proper coordination groups (CG) to implement the CRM.
Thus, they hit prohibitive computing difficulty when implemented with many opt-in travelers.
Motived by this view, this study develops mathematical approaches to quantify the coordination
potential between two and among multiple travelers. Next, we develop the adaptive centroid-based
clustering algorithm (ACCA), which splits travelers en route in a local network into CGs, each with
proper size and strong coordination potential. Moreover, the ACCA is statistically secured to
stop at a local optimal clustering solution, which balances the inner-cluster and inter-cluster
coordination potential. It can be implemented by parallel computation to accelerate its computing
efficiency. Furthermore, we propose a clustering based coordinated routing mechanism (CB-CRM),
which implements a CRM on each individual CG. The numerical experiments built upon both Sioux Falls
and Hardee city networks show that the ACCA works efficiently to form proper coordination groups
so that as compared to the CRM, the CB-CRM significantly improves computation efficiency with minor
system performance loss in a large network. This merit becomes more apparent under high penetration
and congested traffic condition. Last, the experiments validate the good features of the ACCA as
well as the value of implementing parallel computation.
