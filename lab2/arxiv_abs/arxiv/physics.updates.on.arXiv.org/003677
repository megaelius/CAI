Movement in biology is often achieved with distributed control of coupled subcomponents, e.g.
muscles and limbs. Coupling could range from weak and local, i.e. decentralized, to strong and global,
i.e. centralized. We developed a model-free measure of centralization that compares information
shared between control signals and both global and local states. A second measure, called co-information,
quantifies the net redundant information the control signal shares with both states. We first validate
our measures through simulations of coupled oscillators and show that it successfully reconstructs
the shift from low to high coupling strengths. We then measure centralization in freely running
cockroaches. Surprisingly, extensor muscle activity in the middle leg is more informative of movements
of all legs combined than the movements of that particular leg. Cockroach centralization successfully
recapitulates a specific model of a strongly coupled oscillator network previously used to model
cockroach leg kinematics. When segregated by stride frequency, slower cockroach strides exhibit
more shared information per stride between control and output states than faster strides, indicative
of an information bandwidth limitation. However, centralization remains consistent between
the two groups. We then used a robotic model to show that centralization can be affected by mechanical
coupling independent of neural coupling. The mechanically coupled bounding gait is decentralized
and becomes more decentralized as mechanical coupling decreases while internal parameters of
control remain constant. The results of these systems span a design space of centralization and
co-information that can be used to test biological hypotheses and advise the design of robotic control.
