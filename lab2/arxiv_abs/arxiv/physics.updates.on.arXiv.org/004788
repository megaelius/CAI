Many proteins in cells are capable of sensing and responding to piconewton scale forces, a regime
in which conformational changes are small but significant for biological processes. In order to
efficiently and effectively sample the response of these proteins to small forces, enhanced sampling
techniques will be required. In this work, we derive, implement, and evaluate an efficient method
to simultaneously sample the result of applying any constant pulling force within a specified range
to a molecular system of interest. We start from Simulated Tempering in Force, whereby force is applied
as a linear bias on a collective variable to the system's Hamiltonian, and the coefficient is taken
as a continuous auxiliary degree of freedom. We derive a formula for an average collective-variable-dependent
force, which depends on a set of weights, learned on-the-fly throughout a simulation, that reflect
the limit where force varies infinitely quickly. These weights can then be used to retroactively
compute averages of any observable at any force within the specified range. This technique is based
on recent work deriving similar equations for Infinite Switch Simulated Tempering in Temperature,
that showed the infinite switch limit is the most efficient for sampling. Here, we demonstrate that
our method accurately and simultaneously samples molecular systems at all forces within a user
defined force range, and show how it can serve as an enhanced sampling tool for cases where the pulling
direction destabilizes states of low free-energy at zero-force. This method is implemented in,
and will be freely-distributed with, the PLUMED open-source sampling library, and hence can be
readily applied to problems using a wide range of molecular dynamics software packages.
