The magnitude and structure of the turbulence eddies in the atmosphere surface layer directly impacts
the operation of wind turbines through the temporal variabilities in shaft torque and in blade,
shaft bending moments that alter power production and reduce reliability due to premature component
failure. The scales, strengths and detailed structure of daytime atmospheric turbulence is strongly
dependent on the relative contribution of buoyancy-driven vertical motions from surface heating
to shear driven by a geostrophic wind at the mesoscale. In this study, we apply spectral LES at high
resolution and low dissipation to describe and quantify the turbulence structure over the range
of stability states that characterize the transition from the purely shear-driven neutral boundary
layer to the moderately convective atmospheric boundary layer, driven by both shear and buoyancy.
Whereas we anticipated a transition that is rapid but monotonic in the stability parameter $z_i/L$
($z_i$ is the boundary layer depth and $L$ the Monin-Obukhov length scale), our simulations indicate
a particular transitional state with extraordinarily strong streamwise coherence in streamwise
and vertical velocity when the stability state is characterized by a stability state parameter
of one. Visualizations indicate that this particular turbulence structure is quite different
from slightly less or more unstable boundary layers. The degree of streamwise coherence decreases
quantitatively more rapidly towards the neutral limit ($-z_i/L < 0.5$) than towards the more convective
($-z_i/L>1.5$) states. We scrutinize these observations and hypothesize that the special stability
state with abnormally strong coherence could create unusually strong variations in near-surface
winds.
