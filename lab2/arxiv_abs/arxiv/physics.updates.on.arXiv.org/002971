In this paper, we examine the applicability of the approximation, $\overline{f\,g}\approx \overline
f\,\overline g\,$, within Backus (1962) averaging. This approximation is a crucial step in the
method proposed by Backus (1962), which is widely used in studying wave propagation in layered Hookean
solids. According to this approximation, the average of the product of a rapidly varying function
and a slowly varying function is approximately equal to the product of the averages of those two functions.
Considering that the rapidly varying function represents the mechanical properties of layers,
we express it as a step function. The slowly varying function is continuous, since it represents
the components of the stress or strain tensors. In this paper, beyond the upper bound of the error
for that approximation, which is formulated by Bos et al. (2017), we provide a statistical analysis
of the approximation by allowing the function values to be sampled from general distributions.
Even though, according to the upper bound, Backus (1962) averaging might not appear as a viable approach,
we show that$-$for cases representative of physical scenarios modelled by such an averaging$-$the
approximation is typically quite good. We identify the cases for which there can be a deterioration
in its efficacy. In particular, we examine a special case for which the approximation results in
spurious values. However, such a case$-$though physically realizable$-$is not likely to appear
in seismology, where Backus (1962) averaging is commonly used. Yet, such values might occur in material
sciences, in general, for which Backus (1962) averaging is also considered.
