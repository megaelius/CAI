Modulation of metasurfaces in time enables several exotic scattering phenomena by breaking the
time-reversal symmetry and generation of frequency harmonics. We introduce a novel design paradigm
for time-modulated metasurfaces, offering electrically tunable engineering of the generated
frequency harmonics and their emerging wavefronts by controlling the phase delay in modulation.
It is demonstrated that the light acquires a dispersionless phase shift regardless of incident
angle and polarization, upon frequency transitions in a time-modulated metasurface which is determined
by the modulation phase delay and the order of generated harmonic. The conversion efficiency to
the frequency harmonics is independent of modulation phase delay and only depends on the modulation
depth and resonant characteristics of the metasurface element, with the highest efficiency occurring
in the vicinity of resonance, and decreases away from the resonance. The design approach allows
for creating tunable spatially varying phase discontinuties with 2{\pi} span in the generated
frequency harmonics for a wide range of frequencies and incident angles. Specifically, we apply
this approach to a time-modulated metasurface in the Teraherz regime consisted of graphene-wrapped
silicon microwires. For this purpose, we use an accurate and efficient semi-analytical framework
based on transition matrix. We demonstrate the utility of the design for tunable beam steering and
focusing of the generated harmonics. Furthermore, we rigorously verify the broadband and wideangle
performance of the metasurface in manipulation of the generated harmonics. The proposed design
approach enables a new class of high-efficiency tunable metasurfaces with wide angular and frequency
bandwidth, wavefront engineering capabilities and multi-functionality.
