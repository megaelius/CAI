In a number of geophysical or planetological settings (Earth's inner core, a silicate mantle crystallizing
from a magma ocean, or an ice shell surrounding a deep water ocean) a convecting crystalline layer
is in contact with a layer of its melt. Allowing for melting/freezing at one or both of the boundaries
of the solid layer is likely to affect the pattern of convection in the layer. We study here the onset
of thermal convection in a viscous spherical shell with dynamically induced melting/freezing
at either or both of its boundaries. It is shown that the behavior of each interface depends on the
value of a dimensional number P, which is the ratio of a melting/freezing timescale over a viscous
relaxation timescale. A small value of P corresponds to permeable boundary conditions, while a
large value of P corresponds to impermeable boundary conditions. The linear stability analysis
predicts a significant effect of semi-permeable boundaries when the number P characterizing either
of the boundary is small enough: allowing for melting/freezing at either of the boundary results
in the emergence of larger scale convective modes. The effect is particularly drastic when the outer
boundary is permeable, since the degree 1 mode remains the most unstable even in the case of thin spherical
shells. In the case of a spherical shell with permeable inner and outer boundaries, the most unstable
mode consists in a global translation of the solid shell, with no deformation. In the limit of a full
sphere with permeable outer boundary, this corresponds to the "convective translation" mode recently
proposed for Earth's inner core. As an example of possible application, we discuss the case of thermal
convection in Enceladus' ice shell assuming the presence of a global subsurface ocean, and found
that melting/freezing could have an important effect on the pattern of convection in the ice shell.
