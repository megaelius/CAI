Biological cells embedded in fibrous matrices have been observed to form inter-cellular bands
of dense and aligned fibers, through which they mechanically interact over long distances. Such
matrix-mediated cellular interactions have been shown to regulate a variety of biological processes.
The current study was aimed at exploring the effects of elastic nonlinearity of the fibers contained
in the extracellular matrix (ECM) on the transmission of mechanical loads between contracting
cells. Based on our biological experiments, we developed a finite-element model of two contracting
cells embedded within a fibrous network. The individual fibers were modeled as showing either linear
elasticity, compression-microbuckling, tension-stiffening or both of the latter. Compression-buckling
resulted in smaller loads occurring in the ECM, but these were more directed toward the neighboring
cell. The latter decreased with increasing cell-to-cell distance; when cells were >15 cell-diameters
apart, no such inter-cellular interaction was observed. Tension-stiffening further contributed
to directing the loads toward the neighboring cell, though to a smaller extent. The contraction
of two neighboring cells resulted in mutual attraction forces, which were considerably increased
by tension-stiffening, and decayed with increasing cell-to-cell distances. Nonlinear elasticity
contributed also to the onset of force polarity on the cell boundary. The density and alignment of
the fibers within the inter-cellular band were considerably greater when fibers buckled under
compression, with tension-stiffening further contributing to this structural remodeling. Our
model demonstrates the contribution of nonlinear elasticity of biological gels to directionality
and efficiency of mechanical-signal transfer between distant cells.
