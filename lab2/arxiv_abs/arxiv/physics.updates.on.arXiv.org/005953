The weak magneto-optical effects of materials can be greatly enhanced by hybridizing them with
plasmonic structures which not only enables nonreciprocal nano devices but also provides another
degree of freedom for control and manipulation of light in the nanometer length scale. Here, we unravel
the distinctly different physical origin of the giant enhancement of Faraday rotation and ellipticity
in a hybrid magneto-plasmonic system, namely, waveguided magneto-plasmonic crystal for excitation
with transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light. For excitation with
TE polarization, where the surface plasmons are not directly excited, the natural weak value amplification
of Faraday effect which appears due to the spectral domain interference of Fano resonance is the
dominant cause for the enhancement of Faraday rotation and ellipticity. In such scenario, optimal
weak value amplification takes place for certain geometrical parameters of the plasmonic crystals
for which there is a strong overlap of the resonance frequencies of TE and the TM waveguide modes.
For TM polarization excitation on the other hand, waveguide-plasmon strong coupling and its universal
manifestation of avoided crossing plays an intriguing role in the enhancement of the magneto-optical
effects. The enhancement is observed to be the strongest in the avoided crossing regime. These results
enrich the existing understanding of the observed giant enhancement of magneto-optical effects
and provide potentially useful information on optimizing plasmonic crystal structure for its
potential applications in nanoscale devices.
