Experiments that measure extremely small gravitational forces are often hampered by the presence
of non-gravitational forces that can neither be calculated nor separately measured. Among these
spurious forces is electrostatic attraction between a test mass and its surroundings due to the
presence of spatially varying surface potential known as the "patch effect." In order to make surfaces
with small surface potential variation, it is necessary to be able to measure it. A Kelvin probe (KP)
measures contact potential difference (CPD), using the time-varying capacitance between the
sample and a vibrating tip that is biased with a backing potential. Assuming that the tip remains
constant, this measures the sample's surface potential variation. We examine the operation of
the KP from the perspective of parameter estimation in the presence of noise. We show that, when the
CPD is estimated from measurements at two separate backing potentials, the standard deviation
of the optimal estimate depends on the total observing time. Further, the observing time may be unevenly
divided between the two backing potentials, provided the values of those potentials are correspondingly
set. We simulate a two-stage KP data analysis, including a sub-optimal estimator with advantages
for real-time operation. Based on the real-time version, we present a novel approach to stabilizing
the average distance of the tip from the sample. We also present the results of a series of covariance
analyses that validate and bound the applicability of the suboptimal estimator, make a comparison
with the results of an optimal estimator and guide the user. We discuss the application of the KP to
the LISA and to a test of the weak equivalence principle.
