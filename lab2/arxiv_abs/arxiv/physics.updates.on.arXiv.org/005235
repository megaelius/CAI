An overview concerning 3D printing (a.k.a. additive manufacturing) within the context of Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education at the college/university level is
provided. The vast majority of quoted papers report self-made models for which faculty members
and their students have created the necessary 3D print files themselves by various routes. The prediction
by the Gartner consulting company that it will take more than ten years from July 2014 onwards for
Classroom 3D Printing to reach its Plateau of Productivity in one of their hallmark Visibility versus
Time (Hype Cycle) graphs is critically assessed. The bibliography of this book chapter sums up the
state-of-the art in 3D printing for STEM (including nano-science and nano-engineering) education
at the college level approximately four years after Gartner's prediction. Current methodologies
and best practices of college-level Classroom 3D printing are described in the main section of this
review. Detailed information is given mainly for those papers in which the authors of this book chapter
are authors and co-authors. A straightforward route from crystallographic information framework
files (CIFs) at a very large open-access database to 3D print files for atomic-level crystal and
molecule structure models is described here in some detail. Because the development of methodologies
and best practices are typical activities of the penultimate stage of a Hype Cycle, we conclude that
(i) Gartner's prediction underestimates the creativity, resourcefulness, and commitment of
college educators to their students and that (ii) Classroom 3D Printing will be a widespread reality
significantly earlier than the middle of the next decade (at least in the USA as more than one half
of the relevant/quoted papers originated there). An appendix provides a brief technical review
of contemporary 3D printing techniques.
