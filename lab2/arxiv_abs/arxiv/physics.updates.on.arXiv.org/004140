In the context of nuclear fuel recycling and environmental issues, the understanding of the properties
of radio-elements with various approaches remains a challenge regarding their dangerousness.
Moreover, experimentally, it is imperative to work at sufficiently high concentrations to reach
the sensitivities of the analysis tools, which often leads to precipitation for some of them, and
stabilizing of specific oxidation states of some actinides remains a challenge, thus making it
difficult to extract general trends across the actinide series. Complementary to experiments,
modelling can be used to unbiasedly probe the actinide's properties in aquatic environment and
offers a predictive tool. We report the first molecular dynamics simulations based on homogeneously
built force fields for the whole series of the tetravalent actinides in aqueous phase from $\mathrm{Th^{IV}}$
to $\mathrm{Bk^{IV}}$ and including $\mathrm{Pu^{IV}}$. The force fields used to model the interactions
among the constituents include polarization and charge donation microscopic effects. They are
built from an automated iterative quantum \textit{ab initio} based engine, the core element of
a future machine learning procedure devoted to generate accurate force fields. The comparison
of our simulated hydrated actinide properties to available experimental data show the model robustness
and the relevance of our parameter assignment engine. Moreover our simulated structural, dynamical
and hydration free energy data show that, apart from $\mathrm{Am^{IV}}$ and $\mathrm{Cm^{IV}}$,
the actinides properties change progressively along the series.
