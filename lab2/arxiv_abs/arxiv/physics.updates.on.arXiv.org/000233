This paper presents an analysis of possible uses of climate policy instruments for the decarbonisation
of the global electricity sector in a non-equilibrium economic and technology innovation-diffusion
perspective. Emissions reductions occur through changes in technology and energy consumption;
in this context, investment decision-making opportunities occur periodically, which energy
policy can incentivise in order to transform energy systems and meet reductions targets. Energy
markets are driven by innovation, dynamic costs and technology diffusion; yet, the incumbent systems
optimisation methodology in energy modelling does not address these aspects nor the effectiveness
of policy onto decision-making since the dynamics modelled take their source from the top-down
`social-planner' assumption. This leads to an underestimation of strong technology lock-ins
in cost-optimal scenarios of technology. Our approach explores the global diffusion of low carbon
technology in connection to a highly disaggregated sectoral macroeconometric model of the global
economy, FTT:Power-E3MG. A set of ten independent projections to 2050 of the future global power
sector in 21 regions based on different combinations of electricity policy instruments are modelled
using this framework, with an analysis of their climate impacts. We show that in an environment emphasising
diffusion and learning-by-doing, the impact of combinations of policies does not correspond to
the sum of the impacts of individual instruments, but that strong synergies exist between policy
schemes. We show that worldwide carbon pricing on its own is incapable of breaking the current fossil
technology lock-in, but that under an elaborate set of policies, the global electricity sector
can be decarbonised affordably by 89% by 2050 without early scrapping of capital.
