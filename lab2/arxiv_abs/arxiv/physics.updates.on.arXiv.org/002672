Ultracold molecules have experienced increasing attention in recent years. Compared to ultracold
atoms, they possess several unique properties that make them perfect candidates for the implementation
of new quantum-technological applications in several fields, from quantum simulation to quantum
sensing and metrology. In particular, ultracold molecules of two-electron atoms (such as strontium
or ytterbium) also inherit the peculiar properties of these atomic species, above all the possibility
to access metastable electronic states via direct excitation on optical clock transitions with
ultimate sensitivity and accuracy. In this paper we report on the production and coherent manipulation
of molecular bound states of two fermionic $^{173}$Yb atoms in different electronic (orbital)
states $^1$S$_0$ and $^3$P$_0$ in proximity of a scattering resonance involving atoms in different
spin and electronic states, called orbital Feshbach resonance. We demonstrate that orbital molecules
can be coherently photoassociated starting from a gas of ground-state atoms in a three-dimensional
optical lattices by observing several photoassociation and photodissociation cycles. We also
show the possibility to coherently control the molecular internal state by using Raman-assisted
transfer to swap the nuclear spin of one of the atoms forming the molecule, thus demonstrating a powerful
manipulation and detection tool of these molecular bound states. Finally, by exploiting this peculiar
detection technique we provide first information on the lifetime of the molecular states in a many-body
setting, paving the way towards future investigations of strongly interacting Fermi gases in a
still unexplored regime.
