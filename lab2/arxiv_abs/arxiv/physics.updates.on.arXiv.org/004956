Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows non-invasive exploration of brain structural
information, crucial for understanding the human-brain; however, present-day diffusion-based
tractography approaches are still lacking in accuracy. Improvement efforts included comparison
with anatomical connectivity data, the usage of higher quality data, more sophisticated algorithms
and parameters assessment. Despite that, well-known problems such as low sensitivity, dominance
of false positives, the accurate reconstruction of long-range connections could not be avoided
or minimized. Current methods include several parameters, typically tuned in a heuristic way,
with settings to increase the sensitivity, without attenuating the overall problem. We propose
a new way to optimize fiber-tracking results by multi-objectives tailored to minimize the current
issues. Our approach uses comparison with marmoset fluorescent tracer injection data from the
Japan Brain/MINDS to validate and optimize ex-vivo diffusion weighted MRI (DWI)-based global
fiber tracking results of the same subject. The approach includes multiple comparisons at a higher-than-DWI
resolution standard brain space to evaluate objectives of coverage and passage constraint. The
coverage objectives maximize sensitivity while constraining the growth of false positives, promoting
the generation of long connections to the projection areas. The passage constraint minimizes the
number of fibers crossing hemispheres outside the commissures. We implemented a non-dominated
sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) strategy to explore the parameters space. Evolutionary optimization
runs for 10 brain samples in parallel while sharing champion settings over samples, encouraging
convergence of parameters in a similar locus. We evaluate the generalization capability of the
optimized parameters on unseen marmoset test data leading to promising results.
