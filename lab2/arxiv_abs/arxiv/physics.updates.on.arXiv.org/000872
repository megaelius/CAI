Purpose: To evaluate the latent variance (LV) of TrueBeam photon phase-space files (PSF) for open
10x10$cm^2$ and small fields. Methods: BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc was used to transport particles from
Varian phase-space files (PSFA) through the secondary collimators. Transported particles were
scored into another phase-space located under the jaws (PSFB), or transported further through
the cone collimators and scored straight below, forming PSFC. PFSB were scored for 6MV-FFF, 6MV,
10MV-FFF, 10MV and 15MV beams with 10x10$cm^2$ field size, and PSFC were scored for 6MV beam under
cones of 0.13, 0.25, 0.35, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5 and 4cm diameter. PSFB and PSFC were transported into a water
phantom with particle recycling number ranging from 10 to 1000. For 10x10$cm^2$ fields 0.5x0.5x0.5cm^3
voxels were used to score the dose, whereas the dose was scored in 0.1x0.1x0.5cm^3 voxels for beams
collimated with small cones. For small 0.25cm diameter cone-collimated 6MV beam, phantom voxel
size varied as 0.02x0.02x0.5cm^3, 0.05x0.05x0.5cm^3 and 0.1x0.1x0.5cm^3. Dose variances were
scored in all cases and LV evaluated as per Sempau et al. Results: For the 10x10cm^2 fields calculated
LVs were greatest at the phantom surface and decreased with depth until reached a plateau at 5cm depth.
LVs were 0.54%, 0.96%, 0.35%, 0.69% and 0.57% for the 6MV-FFF, 6MV, 10MV-FFF, 10MV and 15MV energies,
respectively at 10cm depth. For the 6 MV phase-space collimated with cones of 0.13, 0.25, 0.35, 1.0cm
diameter, the LVs calculated at 1.5cm depth were 75.6%, 25.4%, 17.6% and 8.0% respectively. Calculated
LV for the 0.25cm cone-collimated 6MV beam were 61.2%, 40.7%, 22.5% in 0.02x0.02x0.5cm^3, 0.05x0.05x0.5cm^3
and 0.1x0.1x0.5cm^3 voxels respectively. Conclusion: Single PSF can be used to achieve sub-percent
latent variance in open 10x10cm^2 field MC simulations, whereas more PSFs would have to be summed
for small SRS fields.
