A megascopic revalidation is offered providing responses and resolutions of current inconsistencies
and existing contradictions in present-day quantum theory. As the core of this study we present
an independent proof of the Goldstone theorem for a quantum field formulation of molecules and solids.
Along with phonons two types of new quasiparticles appear: rotons and translons. In full analogy
with Lorentz covariance, combining space and time coordinates, a new covariance is necessary,
binding together the internal and external degrees of freedom, without explicitly separating
the centre-of-mass, which normally applies in both classical and quantum formulations. The generally
accepted view regarding the lack of a simple correspondence between the Goldstone modes and broken
symmetries, has significant consequences: an ambiguous BCS theory as well as a subsequent Higgs
mechanism. The application of the archetype of the classical spontaneous symmetry breaking, i.e.
the Mexican hat, as compared to standard quantum relations, i.e. the Jahn-Teller effect, superconductivity
or the Higgs mechanism, becomes a disparity. In short, symmetry broken states have a microscopic
causal origin, but transitions between them have a teleological component. The different treatments
of the problem of the centre of gravity in quantum mechanics and in field theories imply a second type
of Bohr complementarity on the many-body level opening the door for megascopic representations
of all basic microscopic quantum axioms with further readings for teleonomic megascopic quantum
phenomena, which have no microscopic rationale: isomeric transitions, Jahn-Teller effect, chemical
reactions, Einstein-de Haas effect, superconductivity-superfluidity, and brittle fracture.
