The Mexican Migration Project (MMP) is a study that includes samples of undocumented Mexican immigrants
to the United States after their return to Mexico. Of particular interest are the departure and return
dates of a sampled migrant's most recent sojourn in the United States, and the total number of such
journeys undertaken by that migrant household, for these data enable the construction of data-driven
undocumented immigration models. However, such data are subject to an extreme physical bias, for
to be included in such a sample, a migrant must have returned to Mexico by the time of the survey, excluding
those undocumented immigrants still in the US. In our analysis, we account for this bias by jointly
modeling trip timing and duration to produce the likelihood of observing the data in such a "snapshot"
sample. Our analysis characterizes undocumented migration flows including single visit migrants,
repeat visitors, and "retirement" from circular migration. Starting with 1987, we apply our models
to 30 annual random snapshot surveys of returned undocumented Mexican migrants accounting for
undocumented Mexican migration from 1980-2016. Contrary to published estimates based on these
same data, our results imply migrants remain in the US much longer than previously estimated based
on analysis that ignored the physical snapshot bias. Scaling to population quantities, we produce
lower bounds on the total number of undocumented immigrants that are much larger than conventional
estimates based on US-based census-linked surveys, and broadly consistent with the estimates
reported by Fazel-Zarandi, Feinstein and Kaplan (2018).
