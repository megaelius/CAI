Under low-collisionality conditions the isotropic part of the electron velocity distribution
function in a plasma becomes non-local and the electrons can be described by a single global distribution
function . This is also the regime required for non-local collisonless (stochastic) heating in
oscillating and spatially inhomogeneous electric fields. Solution of the Boltzmann equation
under these conditions requires usually computationally involving multi-dimensional PIC/MC
simulations. The necessity of multi-dimensional simulation arises mainly from the complicated
time and space dependence of the collisionless electron heating process. Here it is shown that a
time, volume, und solid angle averaged Fokker-Planck operator for the interaction of electrons
with an external field can replace the local Ohmic heating operator resulting from a two-term approximation
of the Boltzmann equation. This allows consistent treatment of collisional as well as collisonless
heating. This operator combined with the dissipative operators for interaction with neutrals,
as resulting from the two-term approximation, plus an additional operator for surface losses provide
altogether a kinetic description for the determination of the global static and isotropic distribution
function of the system. The new operators are relatively easy to integrate in classical local Boltzmann
solvers and allow for a fast calculation of the distribution function. As an example, an operator
describing non-local collisionless as well as collisional heating in inductively coupled plasmas
(ICPs) is derived. The resulting distribution function can then be used to calculate rates and moments
in a fluid model of the plasma, similarly to the common practice in the local and highly collisional
case. A certain limitation of the above concept is the necessity of using pre-defined field structures.
