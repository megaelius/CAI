Purpose: To develop and test a new method for characterizing tear film surface quality with high
speed videokeratoscopy utilizing a fractal dimension approach. Methods: The regularity of the
reflected pattern in high speed videokeratoscopy (E300, Medmont) depends on tear film stability.
Thus determining tear film stability can be addressed by estimating the fractal dimension of the
reflected pattern. The method is tested on 39 normal subjects. The results of the fractal dimension
approach are compared with those obtained using previously proposed automated method, based on
a gray level co-occurrence matrix approach, and with subjective results obtained by two operators
which were assessing the video recordings in ideal conditions. Results: fractal dimension method
was less affected by eye movements and changes in the videokeratoscopic image background than gray
level co-occurrence matrix method. Median difference of the non-invasive break-up time between
manual and automated methods was 0.03 s (IQR = 4.47 s.) and 0.0 s (IQR = 2.22 s.) for gray level co-occurrence
matrix and fractal dimension approaches, respectively. Correlation coefficient with manual
non-invasive break-up time was r2 = 0.86 (p < 0.001) for gray level co-occurrence matrix approach,
and r2 = 0.82 (p < 0.001) for fractal dimension approach. Significant statistical difference was
found between non-invasive break-up measurements of manual and gray level co-occurrence matrix
method (p = 0.008). Conclusions: The proposed method has the potential to characterize tear film
dynamics in more detail compared to previous methods based on high speed videokeratoscopy. It showed
good correlation with manual assessment of tear film.
