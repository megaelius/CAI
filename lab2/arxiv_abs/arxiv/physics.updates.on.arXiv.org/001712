The need for affordable and appropriate medical technologies for developing countries continue
to rise as challenges such as inadequate energy supply, limited technical expertise and poor infrastructure
persists. Low-field MRI is a technology that can be tailored to meet specific imaging needs within
such countries. Its low power requirements and the possibility of operating in minimally shielded
or unshielded environments make it especially attractive. Although the technology has been widely
demonstrated over several decades, it is yet to be shown that it can be diagnostic and improve patient
outcomes in clinical applications. We here demonstrate the robustness of pre-polarizing MRI (PMRI)
technology for assembly and deployment in developing countries for the specific application to
infant hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus treatment planning and management requires modest spatial
resolution, and only that the brain can be distinguished from fluid - tissue contrast detail within
the brain parenchyma is not essential. We constructed an internally shielded PMRI system based
on the Lee-Whiting coil system with a 22 cm diameter of spherical volume. In an unshielded room, projection
phantom images were acquired at 113 kHz with in-plane resolution of 3 mm x 3 mm, by introducing gradient
fields of sufficient magnitude to dominate the 5000ppm inhomogeneity of the readout field. The
low cost, straightforward assembly, deployment potential, and maintenance requirements demonstrate
the suitability of our PMRI system for developing countries. Further improvement in the image spatial
resolution and contrast of low-field MRI will broaden its potential clinical utility beyond hydrocephalus.
