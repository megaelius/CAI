In order to extract hidden joint information from two possibly uncorrelated time-series, we explored
the measures of network science. Alongside common methods in time-series analysis of the economic
markets, mapping the joint structure of two time-series onto a network provides insight into hidden
aspects embedded in the couplings. We discretize the amplitude of two time-series and investigate
relative simultaneous locations of those amplitudes. Each segment of a discretized amplitude
is considered as a node. The simultaneity of the amplitudes of the two time-series is considered
as the edges in the network. The frequency of occurrences forms the weighted edges. In order to extract
information, we need to measure that to what extent the coupling deviates from the coupling of two
uncoupled series. Also, we need to measure that to what extent the couplings inherit their characteristics
from a Gaussian distribution or a non-Gaussian distribution. We mapped the network from two surrogate
time-series. The results show that the couplings of markets possess some features which diverge
from the same features of the network mapped from white noise, and from the network mapped from two
surrogate time-series. These deviations prove that there exist joint information and cross-correlation
therein. By applying the network's topological and statistical measures and the deformation ratio
in the joint probability distribution, we distinguished basic structures of cross-correlation
and coupling of cross-markets. It was discovered that even two possibly known uncorrelated markets
may possess some joint patterns with each other. Thereby, those markets should be examined as coupled
and \textit{weakly} coupled markets.
