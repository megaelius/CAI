The instability of flows via two-dimensional perturbations is analyzed theoretically and numerically
in a nonmodal framework. In particular, it is shown that the growth mechanism of nonmodal Tollmien-Schlichting
waves naturally reduces to the eigenvalue problem for the energy bound formulated by [Davis and
Von Kerczek (1973)]. This eigenvalue equation thus allows for a broader interpretation. It provides
the discrete growth rates for the base flow in question. In contrast to traditional Orr-Sommerfeld
modal analysis, the eigenvalue equation defines an orthogonal set of eigenfunctions allowing
to decompose the perturbations into base perturbations with discrete growth rates and frequencies.
As a result of this decomposition, it can be shown that the evolution of two-dimensional perturbations
is governed by two mechanisms: A first one, responsible for extracting and returning energy from
and to the base flow, in addition to viscous dissipation and, a second one, responsible for dispersing
energy among the different base perturbations constituting the perturbation. We investigate
the relation between base flow profile and growth and provide a mathematical proof concerning Rayleigh's
inflection point theorem, that if the base flow possesses inflection points, the modal eigenfunctions
of Rayleigh's stability equation display no growth in general. On the other hand, the present analysis
provides some insight why some base flow profiles are more susceptible to instability than others.
As a general result, we show that the stability of a flow is not only determined by the growth rates
of the base perturbations, but it is also closely related to its ability to disperse energy away from
the base perturbations with positive growth rates to the ones with negative growth rates.
