We discuss the level-crossing field configurations for which the quantum time-dependent two-state
problem is solvable in terms of the confluent Heun functions. We show that these configurations
belong to fifteen four-parametric families of models that generalize all the known 3- and 2-parametric
families for which the problem is solvable in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric and the Kummer confluent
hypergeometric functions. Analyzing the general case of variable Rabi frequency and frequency
detuning we mention that the most notable features of the models provided by the derived classes
are due to the extra constant term in the detuning modulation function. Due to this term the classes
suggest numerous symmetric or asymmetric chirped pulses and a variety of models with two crossings
of the frequency resonance. The latter models are generated by both real and complex transformations
of the independent variable. In general, the resulting detuning functions are asymmetric, the
asymmetry being controlled by the parameters of the detuning modulation function. In some cases,
however, the asymmetry may be additionally caused by the amplitude modulation function. We present
an example of the latter possibility and additionally mention a constant amplitude model with periodically
repeated resonance-crossings. Finally, we discuss the excitation of a two-level atom by a pulse
of Lorentzian shape with a detuning providing one or two crossings of the resonance. Using a series
expansion of the solution of the confluent Heun equation in terms of the Kummer hypergeometric functions
we derive particular closed form solutions of the two-state problem for this field configuration.
The particular sets of the involved parameters for which these solutions are obtained define curves
in the 3D space of the involved parameters belonging to the complete return spectrum of the considered
two-state quantum system.
