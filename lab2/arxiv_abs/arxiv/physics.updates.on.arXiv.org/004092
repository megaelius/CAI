As a candidate of dark matter, and related to many fundamental physics issues, the primordial black
hole (PBH) is a crucial topic. However, so far the existence of PBHs is still not confirmed, and currently
running GW detectors are still not able to distinguish them from the normal astrophysical BHs. In
this article, we propose that the GWs (of PBH binary mergers) could interact with the very widespread
background galactic magnetic fields in the Milky way, to produce the perturbed electromagnetic
waves (EMWs) with unique characteristics of frequencies, waveforms, spectra and polarizations.
In order to be distinguished from astrophysical black holes, only the PBHs with masses less than
the solarmass are considered here, and their binary mergers will radiate GWs in frequencies much
higher above the plasma frequency of interstellar medium (ISM), so corresponding perturbed EMWs
(in the same frequencies to such GWs) can propagate through the ISM until the Earth. Our estimations
show that, for the sub-solar mass PBH binary mergers within the Milky way (disk or halo), the strengths
of the perturbed EMWs turn into constant levels around 10^{-12} Tesla (for magnetic components)
and around 10^{-10}Watt m^{-2} (for energy flux densities) at the Earth, generally for all cases
of different PBH masses (and not dependent on the distance of sources), and the same mass ratio of
the PBH binary gives the same strength (at the Earth) of perturbed EMWs despite different PBH masses
(GW frequencies) or binary distances. Differently, for the PBH binary mergers outside the Milky
way, the perturbed EMWs at Earth have lower strengths (and depend on the distance of sources), but
for some part of distance range, they would also be detectable. If such EM signals and special EM counterpart
of GWs from PBHs could be detected by space- or land-based EMWs detectors, it may provide direct evidence
of the PBHs.
