There has been considerable interest in the active maneuvers made by a small number of vehicles to
improve macroscopic traffic flows. Jam-absorption driving (JAD) is a single vehicle's maneuvers
to remove a wide moving jam and consists of two actions. First, a vehicle upstream of the jam slows
down and maintains a low velocity. Because it cuts off the supply of vehicles to the jam, the jam shrinks
and finally disappears. Second, it returns to following the vehicle ahead of it. One of the critical
problems of JAD is the occurrence of secondary jams. The perturbations caused by JAD actions may
grow into secondary jams due to the instability of traffic flows. The occurrence of secondary jams
was investigated by numerical simulations in non-periodic systems where only human-driven vehicles
are placed upstream of the vehicle performing JAD. However, no theoretical condition has been proposed
to restrict secondary jams in these systems. This paper presents a theoretical condition restricting
secondary jams in a semi-infinite system composed of a vehicle performing JAD and the other human-driven
vehicles obeying a car-following model on a non-periodic and single-lane road. In constructing
this condition, we apply the linear string stability to a macroscopic spatiotemporal structure
of JAD. Numerical simulations show that a finite version of this condition restricts secondary
jams. Moreover, under this condition, we demonstrate that it is possible to restrict secondary
jams in the semi-infinite system under wide ranges of the parameters of the system. Furthermore,
we construct the conditions suppressing secondary jams in other semi-infinite systems with inflows
from other lanes or a bottleneck, and demonstrate that JAD can restrict secondary jams in these systems.
Thus, our method theoretically guarantees that a single vehicle can improve macroscopic traffic
flows.
