Although there have been extensive investigations characterizing cavitation phenomenon in fuel
injectors, much is still unknown about the mechanisms driving cavitation-induced erosion, and
how these complicated physics should be represented in a model. In lieu of computationally expensive
fluid-structure interaction modeling, the Eulerian mixture modeling approach has been accepted
as an efficient means of capturing cavitation phenomena. However, there remains a need to link the
erosive potential of cloud collapse events with the subsequent material deformation and damage
of neighboring surfaces. Even though several cavitation erosion indices have been proposed in
the literature, no single metric has been identified as universally applicable across all injector-relevant
conditions. The objective of this work is to identify parameters that characterize the erosive
potential of cavitation cloud collapse mechanisms that are likely to occur within injector orifices.
While a commonly employed cavitation erosion metric, namely the maximum local pressure, was found
to provide indications of potential sites for pitting and material rupture from single impact events,
no additional information could be determined regarding the material erosion process. To improve
representation of the incubation period within the cavitation erosion process, a new metric was
derived based on cumulative energy absorbed by the solid material from repeated hydrodynamic impacts.
Through evaluation of predicted cavitation cloud collapse events in a channel geometry against
available experimental data, the stored energy metric yielded insight into the erosive potential
of recorded impact events. The stored energy metric provided a means to accurately predict the influence
of flow conditions on the incubation period before material erosion. ...
