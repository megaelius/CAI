An empirical formula recently appeared in the literature to explain the observed anomalies of about
$\Delta\dot\rho\approx 1-10$ mm s$^{-1}$ in the geocentric range-rates $\dot\rho$ of the Galileo,
NEAR and Rosetta spacecraft at some of their past perigee passages along unbound, hyperbolic trajectories.
It predicts an anomaly of the order of $6$ mm s$^{-1}$ for the recent flyby of Juno, occurred on 9 October
2013. Data analyses to confirm or disproof it are currently ongoing. We numerically calculate the
impact on the geocentric Juno's range rate of some classical and general relativistic dynamical
effects which are either unmodelled or mismodelled to a certain level in the software used to process
the data. They are: a) The first even zonal harmonic coefficient $J_2$ of the multipolar expansion
of the terrestrial gravitational potential causing orbital perturbations both at the $\left.{\rm
a}^{'}\right)$ Newtonian ($J_2$) and at the $\left. {\rm a}^{''}\right)$ first post-Newtonian
level ($J_2 c^{-2}$) b) The post-Newtonian gravitoelectric (GE) Schwarschild-like component
of the Earth's gravitational field c) The post-Newtonian gravitomagnetic (GM) Lense-Thirring
effect. The magnitudes of their mismodeled and nominal range-rate signatures are: $\left. {\rm
a}^{'}\right)$ $\Delta\dot\rho_{\sigma_{J_2}} \approx 1$ $\mu$m s$^{-1}$ $\left. {\rm a}^{''}\right)$
$\Delta\dot\rho_{J_2 c^{-2}} \approx 0.015$ $\mu$m s$^{-1}$ b) $\Delta\dot\rho_{\rm GE} \approx
25$ $\mu$m s$^{-1}$ c) $\Delta\dot\rho_{\rm GM} \approx 0.05$ $\mu$m s$^{-1}$. If a flyby anomaly
as large as a few mm s$^{-1}$ will be finally found also for Juno, it will not be due to any of these standard
gravitational effects. (Abridged)
