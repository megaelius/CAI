Electric voltage applied in electrowetting can induce speading, sliding and even jumping of an
individual droplet by changing the intrinsic balance of three-phase interfacial tensions, which
has been widely used for droplet manipulating in microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip devices in over
decades. In the present paper, we present an analytical prediction of jumping velocity for droplets
electrowetting on textured hydrophobic surfaces with different wetting states. In particular,
we consider a liquid droplet wetting on a textured hydrophobic substrate with a voltage applied
between the droplet and the substrate. Once the voltage is turned off, the energy stored in the droplet
during the electrowetting releases and could even result in the detachment of the droplet. The effects
of the initial and electro-wetting states, i.e. Cassie-Baxter state and Wenzel state, on the jumping
velocity of droplets are systematically discussed. Based on energy conservation, the energy conversion
between the surface energy, internal viscous dissipation and the kinetic energy of droplets in
different wetting states are analysed. The close-form formulas to predict the jumping velocity
for different droplet wetting states are systematically derived. Finally, the unified form for
predicting the electrowetting-induced jumping velocity of droplets on both flat and textured
substrates with different wetting states is obtained, which can describe the jumping motion with
various wetting conditions. This work provide theoretical insights on accurate control of the
electrowetting-induced jumping motion of droplets on textured hydrophobic surfaces.
