In this paper, we propose a novel framework to extract features such as vortex cores and saddle points
in two-dimensional unsteady flows. This feature extraction strategy generalizes critical points
of snapshot topology in a Galilean-invariant manner, allows to prioritize features according
to their strength and longevity, enables to track the temporal evolution of features, is robust
against noise and has no subjective parameters. These characteristics are realized via several
constitutive elements. First, acceleration is employed as a feature identifier following Goto
and Vassilicos (2006), thus ensuring Galilean invariance. Second, the acceleration magnitude
is used as basis for a mathematically well-developed scalar field topology. The minima of this field
are called acceleration feature points, a superset of the acceleration zeros. These points are
discriminated into vortices and saddle points depending the spectral properties of the velocity
Jacobian. Third, all operations are based on discrete topology for the scalar field with combinatorial
algorithms. This parameter-free foundation allows (1) to use persistence as a physically meaningful
importance measure to prioritize feature points, (2) ensures robustness since no differentiation
and interpolation need to be performed with the data, and (3) enables a natural and robust tracking
algorithm for the temporal feature evolution. In particular, we can track vortex merging events
in an unsupervised manner. Data based analyses are presented for an incompressible periodic cylinder
wake, an incompressible planar mixing layer and a weakly compressible planar jet. They demonstrate
the power of the tracking approach, which provides a spatiotemporal hierarchy of the minima.
