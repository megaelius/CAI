Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyzer (MENCA) of Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) measures the
\emph{in-situ} neutral upper atmospheric constituents of Mars. Martian lower atmosphere predominated
by the presence of $CO_2$ which photo-dissociates into atomic oxygen ($O$) in higher altitudes
much near the exobase. Atomic $O$ plays a significant role in invoking stronger presence of $O_2^+$
in the Martian ionosphere. Primary photo-dissociative species $CO_{2}$, crossover its neutral
abundance with atomic $O$ in the collisonless hetergenous atmosphere with varying local solar
conditions. Initial measurements from Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) instrument
on Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) estimated these crossover/transition altitude
wavering between $\approx$225 km to 240 km during solar maximum conditions with peak solar illuminations.
MENCA sampled the neutral atmospheric species, below the exobase upto periareion of $\approx$160
km, under low solar active conditions during June 2018. Observations of partial pressures of $CO_2$
and $O$ in subsequent orbits reveals that solar inputs are crucial in quantifying these crossing
points, where $[O]/[CO_2]$ remain unity, alongside the influences from temperature. The multi-spacecraft
measurements of the direct influences of solar wind charged particle fluxes and velocity on the
daily variation of neutral thermospheric/exospheric compositions were observed on the local
evening hours of Mars and presented. It marks the first-ever direct \emph{in-situ} observation
of interaction between the energetic solar particle radiations on Martian exospheric compositions,
potentially contibuting for the steady escape and differing population of atomic $[O]$ in the exosphere.
