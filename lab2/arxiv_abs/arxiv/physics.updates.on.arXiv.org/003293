The Coulomb enhancement of low energy electrons in nuclear beta decay generates sharp cutoffs in
the accompanying antineutrino spectrum at the beta decay endpoint energies. It has been conjectured
that these features will interfere with measuring the effect of a neutrino mass hierarchy on an oscillated
nuclear reactor antineutrino spectrum. These sawtooth-like features will appear in detailed
reactor antineutrino spectra, with characteristic energy scales similar to the oscillation period
critical to neutrino mass hierarchy determination near a 53 km baseline. However, these sawtooth-like
distortions are found to contribute at a magnitude of only a few percent relative to the mass hierarchy-dependent
oscillation pattern in Fourier space. In the Fourier cosine and sine transforms, the features that
encode a neutrino mass hierarchy dominate by over sixteen (thirty-three) times in prominence to
the maximal contribution of the sawtooth-like distortions from the detailed energy spectrum,
given $3.2\%/\sqrt{E_\mathrm{vis.}/\mathrm{MeV}}$ (perfect) detector energy resolution.
The effect of these distortions is shown to be negligible even when the uncertainties in the reactor
spectrum, oscillation parameters, and counting statistics are considered. This result is shown
to hold even when the opposite hierarchy oscillation patterns are nearly degenerate in energy space,
if energy response nonlinearities are controlled to below 0.5\%. Therefore with accurate knowledge
of detector energy response, the sawtooth-like features in reactor antineutrino spectra will
not significantly impede neutrino mass hierarchy measurements using reactor antineutrinos.
