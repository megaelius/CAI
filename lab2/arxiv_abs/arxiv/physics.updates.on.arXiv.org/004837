In Part 2 of our guide to collisionless fluid models, we concentrate on Landau fluid closures. These
closures were pioneered by Hammett and Perkins and allow for the rigorous incorporation of collisionless
Landau damping into a fluid framework. It is Landau damping that sharply separates traditional
fluid models and collisionless kinetic theory, and is the main reason why the usual fluid models
do not converge to the kinetic description, even in the long-wavelength low-frequency limit. We
start with a brief introduction to kinetic theory, where we discuss in detail the plasma dispersion
function $Z(\zeta)$, and the associated plasma response function $R(\zeta)=1+\zeta Z(\zeta)=-Z'(\zeta)/2$.
We then consider a 1D (electrostatic) geometry and make a significant effort to map all possible
Landau fluid closures that can be constructed at the 4th-order moment level. These closures for
parallel moments have general validity from the largest astrophysical scales down to the Debye
length, and we verify their validity by considering examples of the (proton and electron) Landau
damping of the ion-acoustic mode, and the electron Landau damping of the Langmuir mode. We proceed
by considering 1D closures at higher-order moments than the 4th-order, and as was concluded in Part
1, this is not possible without Landau fluid closures. We show that it is possible to reproduce linear
Landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired precision, thus showing the convergence of
the fluid and collisionless kinetic descriptions. We then consider a 3D (electromagnetic) geometry
in the gyrotropic (long-wavelength low-frequency) limit and map all closures that are available
at the 4th-order moment level. In the Appendix A, we provide comprehensive tables with Pad\'e approximants
of $R(\zeta)$ up to the 8th-pole order, with many given in an analytic form.
