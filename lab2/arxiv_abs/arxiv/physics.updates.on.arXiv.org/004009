Quantitative estimate of observational uncertainty is an essential ingredient to correctly interpret
changes in climatic and environmental variables such as wildfires. In this work we compare four
state-of-the-art satellite fire products with the gridded, ground-based EFFIS dataset for Mediterranean
Europe and analyse their statistical differences. The data are compared for spatial and temporal
similarities at different aggregations to identify a spatial scale at which most of the observations
provide equivalent results. The results of the analysis indicate that the datasets show high temporal
correlation with each other (0.5/0.6) when aggregating the data at resolution of at least 1.0{\deg}
or at NUTS3 level. However, burned area estimates vary widely between datasets. Filtering out satellite
fires located on urban and crop land cover classes greatly improves the agreement with EFFIS data.
Finally, in spite of the differences found in the area estimates, the spatial pattern is similar
for all the datasets, with spatial correlation increasing as the resolution decreases. Also, the
general reasonable agreement between satellite products builds confidence in using these datasets
and in particular the most-recent developed dataset, FireCCI51, shows the best agreement with
EFFIS overall. As a result, the main conclusion of the study is that users should carefully consider
the limitations of the satellite fire estimates currently available, as their uncertainties cannot
be neglected in the overall uncertainty estimate/cascade that should accompany global or regional
change studies and that removing fires on human-dominated land areas is key to analyze forest fires
estimation from satellite products.
