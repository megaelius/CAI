Measuring the directional distribution of ocean waves is a difficult task in ocean wave research.
For many decades, wind-generated waves are assumed to propagate primarily in the wind direction.
The concept is applied either implicitly or explicitly in the formulation of the wind input function
and the design of the wave directional distribution function. Photographs of the ocean surface
wave fields under steady wind forcing, however, display very different directional properties.
In the near shore region, the surface undulations are dominantly crosswind. As the fetch increases,
the geometry of surface waves is crosshatched, indicating two dominant wave trains crossing each
other. This pattern of wave propagation in off-wind directions is repeatedly photographed in different
locations under different offshore (toward) wind events. The wavelengths of these airborne photographs
are in the deca-meter length scale. Shorter waves with wavelengths ranging from a few centimeters
to a few decimeters also show crosshatched patterns, based on pictures taken from land and ship.
In the crosshatched cases, most pictures show that the wind vector bisecting the diamond shape of
the surface wave geometry. The observed wave geometries and their fetch evolution expose a major
flaw in our fundamental assumption (implicitly or explicitly) that "wind-generated waves propagate
primarily in the wind direction." The assumption has been taken for granted for many decades in applications
including basic research of wave dynamics and the design of directional wave spectral model for
calculations of the ocean surface roughness and the force, energy, and momentum of a wave field.
