We perform direct numerical simulations of laminar separated flows over finite-aspect-ratio
swept wings at a chord-base Reynolds number of $Re = 400$ to reveal a variety of wake structures generated
for a range of aspect ratios ($sAR=0.5-4$), angles of attack ($\alpha=16^{\circ}-30^{\circ}$),
and sweep angles ($\Lambda=0^{\circ}-45^{\circ}$). Flows behind swept wings exhibit increased
complexity in their dynamical features compared to unswept-wing wakes. For unswept wings, the
wake dynamics are predominantly influenced by the tip effects. Steady wakes are mainly limited
to low-aspect-ratio wings. Unsteady vortex shedding takes place near the midspan of higher-$AR$
wings due to weakened downwash induced by the tip vortices. With increasing sweep angle, the source
of three dimensionality transitions from the tip to the midspan. A pair of symmetric vortical structures
forms along the two sides of the midspan, imposing downward velocity upon each other in a manner similar
to the downwash induced by tip vortices. Such stabilizing midspan effects not only expand the steady
wake region to higher aspect ratios, but also enhance lift. At higher aspect ratios, the midspan
effects of swept wings diminish at outboard region, allowing unsteady vortex shedding to develop
near the tip. In the wakes of highly swept wings, streamwise finger-like structures form repetitively
along the wing span, providing a stabilizing effect. The insights revealed from this study can aid
the design of high-lift devices and serve as a stepping stone for understanding the complex wake
dynamics at higher Reynolds numbers and those generated by unsteady wing maneuvers.
