Adherent cells exert traction forces on to their environment, which allows them to migrate, to maintain
tissue integrity, and to form complex multicellular structures. This traction can be measured
in a perturbation-free manner with traction force microscopy (TFM). In TFM, traction is usually
calculated via the solution of a linear system, which is complicated by undersampled input data,
acquisition noise, and large condition numbers for some methods. Therefore, standard TFM algorithms
either employ data filtering or regularization. However, these approaches require a manual selection
of filter- or regularization parameters and consequently exhibit a substantial degree of subjectiveness.
This shortcoming is particularly serious when cells in different conditions are to be compared
because optimal noise suppression needs to be adapted for every situation, which invariably results
in systematic errors. Here, we systematically test the performance of new methods from computer
vision and Bayesian inference for solving the inverse problem in TFM. We compare two classical schemes,
L1- and L2-regularization, with three previously untested schemes, namely Elastic Net regularization,
Proximal Gradient Lasso, and Proximal Gradient Elastic Net. Overall, we find that Elastic Net regularization,
which combines L1 and L2 regularization, outperforms all other methods with regard to accuracy
of traction reconstruction. Next, we develop two methods, Bayesian L2 regularization and Advanced
Bayesian L2 regularization, for automatic, optimal L2 regularization. Using artificial data
and experimental data, we show that these methods enable robust reconstruction of traction without
requiring a difficult selection of regularization parameters specifically for each data set.
Thus, Bayesian methods can mitigate the considerable uncertainty inherent in comparing cellular
traction forces.
