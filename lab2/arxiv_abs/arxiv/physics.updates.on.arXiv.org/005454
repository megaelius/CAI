Understanding the flow of deformable particles such as liquid drops, synthetic capsules and vesicles,
and biological cells confined in a small channel is essential to a wide range of potential chemical
and biomedical engineering applications. Computer simulations of this kind of fluid-structure
(membrane) interaction in low-Reynolds-number flows raise significant challenges faced by an
intricate interplay between flow stresses, complex particles' interfacial mechanical properties,
and fluidic confinement. Here, we present an isogeometric computational framework by combining
the finite-element method (FEM) and boundary-element method (BEM) for an accurate prediction
of the deformation and motion of a single soft particle transported in microfluidic channels. The
proposed numerical framework is constructed consistently with the isogeometric analysis paradigm;
Loop's subdivision elements are used not only for the representation of geometry but also for the
membrane mechanics solver (FEM) and the interfacial fluid dynamics solver (BEM). We validate our
approach by comparison of the simulation results with highly accurate benchmark solutions to two
well-known examples available in the literature, namely a liquid drop with constant surface tension
in a circular tube and a capsule with a very thin hyperelastic membrane in a square channel. We show
that the numerical method exhibits second-order convergence in both time and space. To further
demonstrate the accuracy and long-time numerically stable simulations of the algorithm, we perform
hydrodynamic computations of a lipid vesicle with bending stiffness and a red blood cell with a composite
membrane in capillaries. The present work offers some possibilities to study the deformation behavior
of confining soft particles, especially the particles' shape transition and dynamics and their
rheological signature in channel flows.
