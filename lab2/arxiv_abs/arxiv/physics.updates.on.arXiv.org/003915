The resolvent formulation of McKeon & Sharma (2010) is extended to the compressible Navier-Stokes
equations. Resolvent analysis is applied to the supersonic turbulent boundary layer in order to
study the validity of Morkovin's hypothesis, which postulates that high-speed turbulence structure
in zero pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers remains largely the same as its incompressible
counterpart. Supersonic turbulent boundary layers with adiabatic wall boundary conditions at
Mach numbers ranging from 2 to 4 are considered. Resolvent analysis highlights two distinct regions
of the supersonic turbulent boundary layer in the wave parameter space: the relatively supersonic
region and the relatively subsonic region. In the relatively supersonic region, where the flow
is supersonic relative to the freestream, resolvent modes display structures consistent with
Mach wave radiation that are absent in the incompressible regime. In the relatively subsonic region,
we show that the low-rank approximation of the resolvent operator is an effective approximation
of the full system and that the response modes predicted by the model exhibit universal and geometrically
self-similar behaviour via a transformation given by the semi-local scaling. Moreover, with semi-local
scaling, we show that the resolvent modes follow the same scaling law as their incompressible counterparts
in this region, which has implications for modelling and the prediction of turbulent high-speed
wall-bounded flows. We also show that the thermodynamic variables exhibit similar mode shapes
to the streamwise velocity modes, supporting the strong Reynolds analogy. Finally, we demonstrate
that the principal resolvent modes can be used to capture the energy distribution between momentum
and thermodynamic fluctuations.
