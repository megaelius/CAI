Exact budget equations for the second-order structure function tensor $\langle \delta u_i \delta
u_j \rangle$ are used to study the two-point statistics of velocity fluctuations in inhomogeneous
turbulence. The Anisotropic Generalized Kolmogorov Equations (AGKE) describe the production,
transport, redistribution and dissipation of every Reynolds stress component occurring simultaneously
among different scales and in space, i.e. along directions of statistical inhomogeneity. The AGKE
are effective to study the inter-component and multi-scale processes of turbulence. In contrast
to more classic approaches, such as those based on the spectral decomposition of the velocity field,
the AGKE provide a natural definition of scales in the inhomogeneous directions, and describe fluxes
across such scales too. Compared to the Generalized Kolmogorov Equation, which is recovered as
their half trace, the AGKE can describe inter-component energy transfers occurring via the pressure-strain
term and contain also budget equations for the off-diagonal components of $\langle \delta u_i \delta
u_j \rangle$. The non-trivial physical interpretation of the AGKE terms is demonstrated with three
examples. First, the near-wall cycle of a turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=200$ is considered.
The off-diagonal component $\langle -\delta u \delta v \rangle$, which can not be interpreted in
terms of scale energy, is discussed in detail. Wall-normal scales in the outer turbulence cycle
are then discussed by applying the AGKE to channel flows at $Re_\tau=500$ and $1000$. In a third example,
the AGKE are computed for a separating and reattaching flow. The process of spanwise-vortex formation
in the reverse boundary layer within the separation bubble is discussed for the first time.
