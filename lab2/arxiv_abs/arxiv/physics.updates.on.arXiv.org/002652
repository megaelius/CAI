A parabolic trough solar collector is a dominant technology for high-temperature industrial applications,
but efficient use of a conventional surface-based parabolic trough solar collector (SBPTSC) is
limited by its high radiation loss due to the high surface temperature. Recently, direct-absorption
parabolic trough solar collector (DAPTSC) using nanofluids has been proposed, and its thermal
efficiency has been reported to be 5-10$\%$ higher than the conventional SBPTSC for inlet temperature
up to 250$^\circ$C. However, the inner tubes of the receivers of the existing DAPTSCs are all transparent,
so the sun rays entering the inner tube can only travel once through the nanofluids. As a result, the
optical path length for the sun rays is limited by the inner tube size, which in turn requires high
value of the absorption coefficient of nanofluids. Due to the approximately linear relation between
the absorption coefficient and the particle concentration, higher absorption coefficient is
likely to cause particle agglomeration, leading to detrimental effects on maintaining stable
collector performance. In the current study, the transparent DAPTSC is improved by applying a reflective
coating on the upper half of the inner tube outer surface, such that the optical path length is doubled
compared to the transparent DAPTSC; thus, the absorption coefficient of the nanofluids can be reduced
accordingly. The coated DAPTSC is found to have obvious advantage compared to the transparent DAPTSC
at absorption coefficient below 0.5 cm$^{-1}$ for a receiver with inner tube diameter of 7 cm. In
addition, performance of the transparent DAPTSC, the coated DAPTSC and the SBPTSC with black chrome
coating have been compared to explore their advantageous operation conditions, such as inner tube
diameter, flow rate, and inlet temperature, with or without a glass envelope for vacuum evacuation.
