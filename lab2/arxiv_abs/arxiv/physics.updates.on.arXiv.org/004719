The diffusion MRI signal arising from neurons can be numerically simulated by solving the Bloch-Torrey
partial differential equation. In this paper, we present the Neuron Module that we implemented
within the Matlab-based diffusion MRI simulation toolbox SpinDoctor. SpinDoctor uses finite
element discretization and adaptive time integration to solve the Bloch-Torrey partial differential
equation for general diffusion-encoding sequences, at multiple b-values and in multiple diffusion
directions. In order to facilitate the diffusion MRI simulation of realistic neurons by the research
community, we constructed finite element meshes for a group of 36 pyramidal neurons and a group of
29 spindle neurons whose morphological descriptions were found in the publicly available neuron
repository NeuroMorpho.Org. These finite elements meshes range from having 15163 nodes to 622553
nodes. We also broke the neurons into the soma and dendrite branches and created finite element meshes
for these cell components. Through the Neuron Module, these neurons and components finite element
meshes can be seamlessly coupled with the functionalities of SpinDoctor to provide the diffusion
MRI signal attributable to spins inside neurons. We make these meshes and the source code of the Neuron
Module available to the public as an open-source package. To illustrate some potential uses of the
Neuron Module, we show numerical examples of the simulated dMRI signals in multiple diffusion directions
from whole neurons as well as from the soma and dendrite branches, include a comparison of the high
b-value behavior between dendrite branches and whole neurons.
