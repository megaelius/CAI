Turbulent mixing exerts a significant influence on many physical processes in the ocean. In a stably
stratified Boussinesq fluid, this irreversible mixing describes the conversion of available
potential energy (APE) to background potential energy (BPE). In some settings the APE framework
is difficult to apply and approximate measures are used to estimate irreversible mixing. For example,
numerical simulations of stratified turbulence often use triply periodic domains to increase
computational efficiency. In this setup however, BPE is not uniquely defined and the method of Winters
et al. (1995, J. Fluid Mech., 289) cannot be directly applied to calculate the APE. We propose a new
technique to calculate APE in periodic domains with a mean stratification. By defining a control
volume bounded by surfaces of constant buoyancy, we can construct an appropriate background buoyancy
profile $b_\ast(z,t)$ and accurately quantify diapycnal mixing in such systems. This new framework
is consistent with the definition of a local APE density, useful for identifying mixing mechanisms.
The evolution of APE is analysed in various turbulent stratified flow simulations. We show that
the mean dissipation rate of buoyancy variance $\chi$ provides a good approximation to the mean
diapycnal mixing rate, even in flows with significant variations in local stratification. When
quantifying measures of mixing efficiency in transient flows, we find significant variation depending
on whether laminar diffusion of a mean flow is included in the kinetic energy dissipation rate. We
discuss how best to interpret these results in the context of quantifying diapycnal diffusivity
in real oceanographic flows.
