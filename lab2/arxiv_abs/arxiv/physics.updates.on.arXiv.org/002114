We report on spectroscopic studies of hot and ultracold RbSr molecules, and combine the results
in an analysis that allows us to fit a potential energy curve (PEC) for the X(1)$^2\Sigma^+$ ground
state bridging the short-to-long-range domains. The ultracold RbSr molecules are created in a
$\mu$K sample of Rb and Sr atoms and probed by two-colour photoassociation spectroscopy. The data
yield the long-range dispersion coefficients $C_6$ and $C_8$, along with the total number of supported
bound levels. The hot RbSr molecules are created in a $1000 \,$K gas mixture of Rb and Sr in a heat-pipe
oven and probed by thermoluminescence and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. We compare
the hot molecule data with spectra we simulated using previously published PECs determined by three
different ab-initio theoretical methods. We identify several band heads corresponding to radiative
decay from the B(2)$^2\Sigma^+$ state to the deepest bound levels of X(1)$^2\Sigma^+$. We determine
a mass-scaled high-precision model for X(1)$^2\Sigma^+$ by fitting all data using a single fit
procedure. The corresponding PEC is consistent with all data, thus spanning short-to-long internuclear
distances and bridging an energy gap of about 75% of the potential well depth, still uncharted by
any experiment. We benchmark ab-initio PECs against our results, and give the PEC fit parameters
for both X(1)$^2\Sigma^+$ and B(2)$^2\Sigma^+$ states. As first outcomes of our analysis, we calculate
the $s$-wave scattering properties for all stable isotopic combinations and corroborate the locations
of Fano-Feshbach resonances between alkali Rb and closed-shell Sr atoms recently observed [Barb\'e
et al., Nat. Phys., 2018, DOI:10.1038/s41567-018-0169-x]. These results should greatly contribute
to the generation of ultracold alkali$-$alkaline-earth dimers, whose applications range from
quantum simulation to quantum chemistry.
