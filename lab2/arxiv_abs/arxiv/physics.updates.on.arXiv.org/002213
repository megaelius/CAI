Gridded data products, for example interpolated daily measurements of precipitation from weather
stations, are commonly used as a convenient substitute for direct observations because these products
provide a spatially and temporally continuous and complete source of data. However, when the goal
is to characterize climatological features of extreme precipitation over a spatial domain (e.g.,
a map of return values) at the native spatial scales of these phenomena, then gridded products may
lead to incorrect conclusions because daily precipitation is a fractal field and hence any smoothing
technique will dampen local extremes. To address this issue, we create a new "probabilistic" gridded
product specifically designed to characterize the climatological properties of extreme precipitation
by applying spatial statistical analyses to daily measurements of precipitation from the Global
Historical Climatology Network over the contiguous United States. The essence of our method is
to first estimate the climatology of extreme precipitation based on station data and then use a data-driven
statistical approach to interpolate these estimates to a fine grid. We argue that our method yields
an improved characterization of the climatology within a grid cell because the probabilistic behavior
of extreme precipitation is much better behaved (i.e., smoother) than daily weather. Furthermore,
the spatial smoothing innate to our approach significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio
in the estimated extreme statistics relative to an analysis without smoothing. We conclude the
paper by comparing our probabilistic gridded product with a standard extreme value analysis of
the Livneh gridded daily precipitation product. Our new data product will be made freely available
on a to-be-determined public repository.
