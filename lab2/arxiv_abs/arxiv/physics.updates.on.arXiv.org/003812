Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites or Ruddleson Popper (RP) perovskites have emerged as a class
of material inheriting the superior optoelectronic properties of two different materials: perovskites
and 2D materials. The large exciton binding energy and natural quantum well structure of 2D perovskite
not only make these materials ideal platforms to study light-matter interactions, but also render
them suitable for fabrication of various functional optoelectronic devices. Nanoscale structuring
and morphology control have led to semiconductors with enhanced functionalities. For example,
nanowires of semiconducting materials have been extensively used for important applications
like lasing and sensing. Catalyst-assisted Vapor Liquid Solid (VLS) techniques, and template
assisted growth, have conventionally been used for nanowire growth. However, catalyst and template-free
scalable growth with morphology control of 2D perovskites have remained elusive. In this manuscript,
we demonstrate a facile approach for morphology-controlled growth of high-quality nanowires
of 2D perovskite, (BA)2PbI4. We demonstrate that the photoluminescence (PL) from the nanowires
are highly polarized with a polarization ratio as large as ~ 0.73, which is one of the largest reported
for perovskites. We further show that the photocurrent from the device based on the nanowire/graphene
heterostructure is also sensitive to the polarization of the incident light with the photocurrent
anisotropy ratio of ~3.62 (much larger than the previously reported best value of 2.68 for perovskite
nanowires), thus demonstrating the potential of these nanowires as highly efficient photodetectors
of polarized light.
