Eruptive events of solar activity often trigger abrupt variations of the geomagnetic field. Through
the induction of electric currents, human infrastructures are also affected, namely the equipment
of electric power transmission networks. It was shown in past studies that the rate of power-grid
anomalies may increase after an exposure to strong geomagnetically induced currents. We search
for a rapid response of devices in the Czech electric distribution grid to disturbed days of high
geomagnetic activity. Such disturbed days are described either by the cumulative storm-time $Dst$
or $d(\textit{SYM-H})/dt$ low-latitude indices mainly influenced by ring current variations,
by the cumulative $AE$ high-latitude index measuring substorm-related auroral current variations,
or by the cumulative $ap$ mid-latitude index measuring both ring and auroral current variations.
We use superposed epoch analysis to identify possible increases of anomaly rates during and after
such disturbed days. We show that in the case of abundant series of anomalies on power lines, the anomaly
rate increases significantly immediately (within 1 day) after the onset of geomagnetic storms.
In the case of transformers, the increase of the anomaly rate is generally delayed by 2--3 days. We
also find that transformers and some electric substations seem to be sensitive to a prolonged exposure
to substorms, with a delayed increase of anomalies. Overall, we show that in the 5-day period following
the commencement of geomagnetic activity there is an approximately 5--10\% increase in the recorded
anomalies in the Czech power grid and thus this fraction of anomalies is probably related to an exposure
to GICs.
