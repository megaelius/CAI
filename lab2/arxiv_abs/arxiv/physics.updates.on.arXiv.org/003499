The extended boundary condition method can be formulated to study plane-wave scattering by an ellipsoid
composed of an orthorhombic dielectric-magnetic material whose relative permittivity dyadic
is a scalar multiple of its relative permeability dyadic, when the constitutive principal axes
are arbitrarily oriented with respect to the shape principal axes. Known vector spherical wavefunctions
are used to represent the fields in the surrounding matter-free space. After deriving closed-form
expressions for the vector spherical wavefunctions for the scattering material, the internal
fields are represented as superpositions of those vector spherical wavefunctions. The unknown
scattered-field coefficients are related to the known incident-field coefficients by a transition
matrix. The total scattering and absorption efficiencies are highly affected by the orientation
of the constitutive principal axes relative to the shape principal axes, and the effect of the orientational
mismatch between the two sets of principal axes is more pronounced as the electrical size increases.
The dependence of the total scattering efficiency, but not of the absorption efficiency, on the
angle of rotation about a shape principal axis can be predicted qualitatively from the variation
of a scalar function with respect to the angle of rotation. The total scattering and absorption efficiencies
do not depend on the polarization state of incident plane wave when the scattering material is impedance-matched
to free space. The polarization state of the incident plane wave has a more discernible effect on
the total scattering and absorption efficiencies for ellipsoids compared to spheres.
