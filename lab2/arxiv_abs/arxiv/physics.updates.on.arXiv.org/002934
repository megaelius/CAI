Previous work showed that total variation superiorization (TVS) improves reconstructed image
quality in proton computed tomography (pCT). The structure of the TVS algorithm has evolved since
then and this work investigated if this new algorithmic structure provides additional benefits
to pCT image quality. Structural and parametric changes introduced to the original TVS algorithm
included: (1) inclusion or exclusion of TV reduction requirement, (2) a variable number, $N$, of
TV perturbation steps per feasibility-seeking iteration, and (3) introduction of a perturbation
kernel $0<\alpha<1$. The structural change of excluding the TV reduction requirement check tended
to have a beneficial effect for $3\le N\le 6$ and allows full parallelization of the TVS algorithm.
Repeated perturbations per feasibility-seeking iterations reduced total variation (TV) and
material dependent standard deviations for $3\le N\le 6$. The perturbation kernel $\alpha$, equivalent
to $\alpha=0.5$ in the original TVS algorithm, reduced TV and standard deviations as $\alpha$ was
increased beyond $\alpha=0.5$, but negatively impacted reconstructed relative stopping power
(RSP) values for $\alpha>0.75$. The reductions in TV and standard deviations allowed feasibility-seeking
with a larger relaxation parameter $\lambda$ than previously used, without the corresponding
increases in standard deviations experienced with the original TVS algorithm. This work demonstrates
that the modifications related to the evolution of the original TVS algorithm provide benefits
in terms of both pCT image quality and computational efficiency for appropriately chosen parameter
values.
