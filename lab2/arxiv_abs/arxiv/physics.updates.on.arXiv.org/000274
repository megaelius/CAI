As shown by M\"uller et al. (2003), the 1D energy spectra deduced from structure functions in simulations
of MHD turbulence with mean field $B_0$ show varying scalings, passing from $k_\bot^{-5/3}$ to
$k_\bot^{-3/2}$ when $B_0$ increases, while the parallel scaling remains $k_\|^{-2}$. To explain
this, Boldyrev (2005, 2006) proposed, as an alternative to the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (IK) scenario
which predicts an isotropic $k^{-3/2}$ scaling, a scenario with a strong perpendicular $k_\bot^{-3/2}$
cascade constrained by small-scale dynamic alignment, and critical balance controlling the parallel
extent of the spectrum (Goldreich and Sridhar, 1995). Since then however, a more complete analysis
of the 3D energy spectra by Grappin and M\"uller (2010) showed that the spectral anisotropy is in
fact in between the two predictions, with a scaling as $k^{-3/2}$ independent of the direction with
respect to the mean field. We reanalyze the data and show that the isotropic scaling is not a consequence
of measuring the energy spectrum in a frame of reference defined by the global mean field $B_0$. The
structure function scalings actually yield the same results, whether measured in the local or global
frame, as soon as $B_0/b_{rms} \gtrsim 5$. We then show that the 1D parallel scaling $k_\|^{-2}$
is generated by the scales outside the inertial range, and thus should disappear at larger Reynolds
number. To explain the scaling isotropy of the 3D spectrum, as well as the large oblique extent of
the spectrum well outside the critical balance domain, we propose here a new theory, involving the
ricochet process that generates oblique cascades coupled to a 2D IK perpendicular cascade. We thus
conclude that the turbulent regime studied is a 3D extension of the 2D IK regime.
