In this work we examine the dispersion of conservative tracers (bromide and fluorescein) in an experimentally-constructed
three-dimensional dual-porosity porous medium. The medium is highly heterogeneous ($\sigma_Y^2=5.7$),
and consists of spherical, low-hydraulic-conductivity inclusions embedded in a high-hydraulic-conductivity
matrix. The bi-modal medium was saturated with tracers, and then flushed with tracer-free fluid
while the effluent breakthrough curves were measured. The focus for this work is to examine a hierarchy
of four models (in the absence of adjustable parameters) with decreasing complexity to assess their
ability to accurately represent the measured breakthrough curves. The most information-rich
model was (1) a direct numerical simulation of the system in which the geometry, boundary and initial
conditions, and medium properties were fully independently characterized experimentally with
high fidelity. The reduced models included; (2) a simplified numerical model identical to the fully-resolved
direct numerical simulation (DNS) model, but using a domain that was one-tenth the size; (3) an upscaled
mobile-immobile model that allowed for a time-dependent mass-transfer coefficient; and, (4)
an upscaled mobile-immobile model that assumed a space-time constant mass-transfer coefficient.
The results illustrated that all four models provided accurate representations of the experimental
breakthrough curves as measured by global RMS error. The primary component of error induced in the
upscaled models appeared to arise from the neglect of convection within the inclusions. Interestingly,
these results suggested that the conventional convection-dispersion equation, when applied
in a way that resolves the heterogeneities, yields models with high fidelity without requiring
the imposition of a more complex non-Fickian model.
