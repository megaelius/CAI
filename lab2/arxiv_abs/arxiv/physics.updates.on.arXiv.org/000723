The improvement of Li-ion battery performance requires development of models that capture the
essential physics and chemistry in Li-ion battery electrode materials. In this paper a novel electrochemical
phase-field model is presented that captures the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of lithium-insertion
in TiO$_2$-anatase, a well-known and intensively studied Li-ion battery electrode material.
Previous experimental work on lithiated anatase TiO$_2$ provided all parameters necessary for
the phase-field simulations, giving the opportunity to gain fundamental insight in the lithiation
of anatase and validate this phase-field model. The phase-field model captures the essential experimentally
observed phenomena, rationalising the impact of C-rate, particle size, surface area, and the memory
effect on the performance of anatase as a Li-ion battery electrode. Thereby a comprehensive physical
picture of the lithiation of anatase TiO$_2$ is provided. The results of the simulations demonstrate
that the performance of anatase is limited by the formation of the poor Li-ion diffusion in the Li$_1$TiO$_2$
phase at the surface of the particles. Unlike other electrode materials, the kinetic limitations
of individual anatase particles limit the performance of full electrodes. Hence, rather than improving
the ionic and electronic network in electrodes, improving the performance of anatase TiO$_2$ electrodes
requires preventing the formation of a blocking Li$_1$TiO$_2$ phase at the surface of particles.
Additionally, the qualitative agreement of the phase-field model, containing only parameters
from literature, with a broad spectrum of experiments demonstrates the capabilities of phase-field
models for understanding Li-ion electrode materials, and its promise for guiding the design of
electrodes through a thorough understanding of material properties and their interactions.
