A conceptual model relating the whitecap coverage to the bubble plume buoyancy is developed following
the observation that the entrained bubble plume buoyancy constitutes a large portion of the breaking
wave energy dissipation. The formulation leads to estimations of an effective or equivalent-buoyancy
depth of bubble entrainment as well as the volume and surface area of bubbles entrained by surface
wave breaking. The results show that the air-water interface area per unit sea surface area is enhanced
dramatically by the entrained bubbles: on the order of 10 m^2 at about 15 m/s wind speed. The effective
entrainment depth represents the vertical reach of the bubble plume as if all the bubbles were collected
into this depth. Based on empirical observations of whitecaps and breaking wave energy dissipation,
it is about 0.11 m and relatively independent on wind speed. The void fraction of the top meter ocean
layer is related linearly to the whitecap coverage with a proportionality factor of 0.11. The nearly-constant
effective entrainment depth essentially renders the bubble entrainment process during the active
wave breaking stage into a lateral 2D problem. Published high speed video recordings of bubble plume
evolution appear to support this conclusion. Consistent with the nearly-constant effective entrainment
depth, relevant breaking wave speeds are within a narrow range between about 2 and 3.5 m/s and depend
on wind speed only weakly. Whitecap observations can also be used to quantify some elusive breaking
properties such as the breaking strength parameter b relating the breaking energy dissipation
rate and length of breaking front.
