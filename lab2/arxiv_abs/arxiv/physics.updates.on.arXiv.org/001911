The energy pathways from propagating internal waves to the scales of irreversible mixing in the
ocean are not fully described. In the ocean interior, the triadic resonant instability is an intrinsic
destabilization process that may enhance the energy cascade away from topographies. The present
study focuses on the integrated impact of mixing processes induced by a propagative normal mode-1
over long term experiments in an idealised setup. The internal wave dynamics and the evolution of
the density profile are followed using the light attenuation technique. Diagnostics of the turbulent
diffusivity $K_{T}$ and background potential energy $BPE$ are provided. Mixing effects result
in a partially mixed layer colocated with the region of maximum shear induced by the forcing normal
mode. The maximum measured turbulent diffusivity is 250 times larger than the molecular value,
showing that diapycnal mixing is largely enhanced by small scale turbulent processes. Intermittency
and reversible energy transfers are discussed to bridge the gap between the present diagnostic
and the larger values measured in Dossmann et al, Experiments in Fluids, 57(8), 132 (2016). The mixing
efficiency $\eta$ is assessed by relating the $BPE$ growth to the linearized $KE$ input. One finds
a value of $\Gamma=12-19\%$ larger than the mixing efficiency in the case of breaking interfacial
wave. After several hours of forcing, the development of staircases in the density profile is observed.
This mechanism has been previously observed in experiments with weak homogeneous turbulence and
explained by argument. The present experiments suggest that internal wave forcing could also induce
the formation of density interfaces in the ocean.
