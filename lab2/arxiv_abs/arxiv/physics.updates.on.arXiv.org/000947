Numerical simulations based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations are widely
used in engineering design and analysis involving turbulent flows. However, RANS simulations
are known to be unreliable in many flows of engineering relevance, which is largely caused by model-form
uncertainties associated with the Reynolds stresses. Recently, a machine-learning approach
has been proposed to assist RANS modeling by building a functional mapping from mean flow features
to discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses as compared to high-fidelity data. However,
it remains a challenge to represent discrepancies in the Reynolds stress eigenvectors in machine
learning due to the requirements of spatial smoothness, frame-independence, and realizability.
In this work, we propose three schemes for representing perturbations to the eigenvectors of RANS
modeled Reynolds stresses: (1) discrepancy-based Euler angles, (2) direct-rotation-based Euler
angles, and (3) unit quaternions. We compare these metrics by performing a priori and a posteriori
tests on two canonical flows: fully developed turbulent flows in a square duct and massively separated
flows over periodic hills. The results demonstrate that the direct-rotation-based Euler angles
representation lacks spatial smoothness while the discrepancy-based Euler angles representation
lacks frame-independence, making them unsuitable for being used in machine-learning-assisted
turbulence modeling. In contrast, the representation based on unit quaternion satisfies all the
requirements stated above, and thus it is an ideal choice in representing the perturbations associated
with the eigenvectors of Reynolds stress tensors. This finding has clear importance for uncertainty
quantification and machine learning in turbulence modeling and for data-driven computational
mechanics in general.
