Fast cortical rhythms with stochastic and intermittent neural discharges have been observed in
electric recordings of brain activity. We study the effect of network architecture on these fast
sparsely synchronized rhythms in an inhibitory population of suprathreshold fast spiking (FS)
Izhikevich interneurons (which fire spontaneously without noise). We first employ the conventional
Erd\"{o}s-Renyi random graph of suprathreshold FS Izhikevich interneurons for modeling the complex
connectivity in neural systems, and study emergence of the population synchronized states by varying
both the synaptic inhibition strength J and the noise intensity D. Fast sparsely synchronized states
of relatively high degree are found to appear for large values of J and D. However, in a real cortical
circuit, synaptic connections are known to have complex topology which is neither regular nor random.
Hence, for fixed values of J and D we consider the Watts-Strogatz small-world network of suprathreshold
FS Izhikevich interneurons which interpolates between regular lattice and random graph via rewiring,
and investigate the effect of small-world synaptic connectivity on emergence of fast sparsely
synchronized rhythms by varying the rewiring probability p from short-range to long-range connection.
When passing a small critical value $p^*_c$, fast sparsely synchronized population rhythms are
found to emerge in small-world networks with predominantly local connections and rare long-range
connections. With further increase in p, the degree of population synchrony becomes higher, while
the axon "wire length" of the network also increases. At a dynamical-efficiency optimal value $p_{\cal{E}}^*$,
there is a trade-off between the population synchronization and the wiring economy, and hence an
optimal fast sparsely-synchronized rhythm is found to occur at a minimal wiring cost in an economic
small-world network.
