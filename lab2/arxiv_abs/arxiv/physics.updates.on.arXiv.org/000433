1.5D Particle-In-Cell simulations of a hot, low density electron beam injected into magnetized,
maxwellian plasma were used to further explore the alternative non-gyrotropic beam driven electromagnetic
emission mechanism, first studied in Tsiklauri (2011). Variation of beam injection angle and background
density gradient showed that the emission process is caused by the perpendicular component of the
beam injection current, whereas the parallel component only produces Langmuir waves, which play
no role in the generation of EM waves in our mechanism. Particular emphasis was put on the case, where
the beam is injected perpendicularly to the background magnetic field, as this turned off any electrostatic
wave generation along the field and left a purely electromagnetic signal in the perpendicular components.
The simulations establish the following key findings: i) Initially waves at a few w_ce/gamma are
excited, mode converted and emitted at w_pe ii) The emission intensity along the beam axis is proportional
to the respective component of the kinetic energy of the beam; iii) The frequency of the escaping
EM emission is independent of the injection angle; iv) A stronger background density gradient causes
earlier emission; v) The beam electron distribution function in phase space shows harmonic oscillation
in the perpendicular components at the relativistic gyrofrequency; vi) The requirement for cyclotron
maser emission, df/dv_perp > 0, is fulfilled; vii) The degree of linear polarization of the emission
is strongly dependent on the beam injection angle; viii) The generated electromagnetic emission
is left-hand elliptically polarized as the pitch angle tends to 90 deg; ix) The generated electromagnetic
energy is of the order of 0.1% of the initial beam kinetic energy.
