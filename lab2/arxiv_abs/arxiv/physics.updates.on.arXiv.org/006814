Several places across the world are experiencing a steep surge in COVID-19 infections. Face masks
have become increasingly accepted as one of the most effective means for combating the spread of
the disease, when used in combination with social-distancing and frequent hand-washing. However,
there is an increasing trend of people substituting regular cloth or surgical masks with clear plastic
face shields, and with masks equipped with exhalation valves. One of the factors driving this increased
adoption is improved comfort compared to regular masks. However, there is a possibility that widespread
public use of these alternatives to regular masks could have an adverse effect on mitigation efforts.
To help increase public awareness regarding the effectiveness of these alternative options, we
use qualitative visualizations to examine the performance of face shields and exhalation valves
in impeding the spread of aerosol-sized droplets. The visualizations indicate that although face
shields block the initial forward motion of the jet, the expelled droplets can move around the visor
with relative ease and spread out over a large area depending on light ambient disturbances. Visualizations
for a mask equipped with an exhalation port indicate that a large number of droplets pass through
the exhale valve unfiltered, which significantly reduces its effectiveness as a means of source
control. Our observations suggest that to minimize the community spread of COVID-19, it may be preferable
to use high quality cloth or surgical masks that are of a plain design, instead of face shields and
masks equipped with exhale valves.
