In the present paper, directivity patterns of laser-generated sound in solids are investigated
theoretically. Two main approaches to the calculation of directivity patterns of laser-generated
sound are discussed for the most important case of thermo-optical regime of generation. The first
approach, which is widely used in practice, is based on the simple modelling of the equivalent thermo-optical
source as a mechanical dipole comprising two horizontal forces applied to the surface in opposite
directions. The second approach is based on the rigorous theory that takes into account all acoustical,
optical and thermal parameters of a solid material and all geometrical and physical parameters
of a laser beam. Directivity patterns of laser-generated bulk longitudinal and shear elastic waves,
as well as the amplitudes of generated Rayleigh surface waves, are calculated for different values
of physical and geometrical parameters and compared with the directivity patterns calculated
in case of dipole-source representation. It is demonstrated that the simple approach using a dipole-source
representation of laser-generated sound is rather limited, especially for description of generated
longitudinal acoustic waves. A practical criterion is established to define the conditions under
which the dipole-source representation gives predictions with acceptable errors. It is shown
that, for radiation in the normal direction to the surface, the amplitudes of longitudinal waves
are especially sensitive to the values of thermal parameters and of the acoustic reflection coefficient
from a free solid surface. A discussion is given on the possibility of using such a high sensitivity
to the values of the reflection coefficient for investigation of surface properties of real solids.
