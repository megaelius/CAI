The aim of the present paper is to provide a comparison between several finite-volume methods of
different numerical accuracy: second-order Godunov method with PPM interpolation and high-order
finite-volume WENO method. The results show that while on a smooth problem the high-order method
perform better than the second-order one, when the solution contains a shock all the methods collapse
to first-order accuracy. In the context of the decay of compressible homogeneous isotropic turbulence
with shocklets, the actual overall order of accuracy of the methods reduces to second-order, despite
the use of fifth-order reconstruction schemes at cell interfaces. Most important, results in terms
of turbulent spectra are similar regardless of the numerical methods employed, except that the
PPM method fails to provide an accurate representation in the high-frequency range of the spectra.
It is found that this specific issue comes from the slope-limiting procedure and a novel hybrid PPM/WENO
method is developed that has the ability to capture the turbulent spectra with the accuracy of a high-order
method, but at the cost of the second-order Godunov method. Overall, it is shown that virtually the
same physical solution can be obtained much faster by refining a simulation with the second-order
method and carefully chosen numerical procedures, rather than running a coarse high-order simulation.
Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating the accuracy of a numerical method in terms
of its actual spectral dissipation and dispersion properties on mixed smooth/shock cases, rather
than by the theoretical formal order of convergence rate.
