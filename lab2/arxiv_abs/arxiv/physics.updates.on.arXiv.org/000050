Ever since Flinders Petrie undertook a theodolite survey on the Giza plateau in 1881 and drew attention
to the extraordinary degree of precision with which the three colossal pyramids are oriented upon
the four cardinal directions, there have been a great many suggestions as to how this was achieved
and why it was of importance. Surprisingly, given the many astronomical hypotheses and speculations
that have been offered in the intervening 130 years, there have been remarkably few attempts to reaffirm
or improve on the basic survey data concerning the primary orientations. This paper presents the
results of a week-long Total Station survey undertaken by the authors during December 2006 whose
principal aim was to clarify the basic data concerning the orientation of each side of the three large
pyramids and to determine, as accurately as possible, the orientations of as many as possible of
the associated structures. The principal difference between this and all previous surveys is that
it focuses upon measurements of sequences of points along multiple straight and relatively well
preserved structural segments, with best-fit techniques being used to provide the best estimate
of their orientation, as opposed to simple triangulation between directly identified or extrapolated
corners. Our results suggest that there is only a very slight difference in orientation (c. 0.5 arc
minutes) between the north-south axes of Khufu's and Khafre's pyramids, that the sides of Khafre's
are more perfectly perpendicular than those of Khufu's, and that the east-west axis is closer to
true cardinality in both cases. The broader context of associated structures suggests that the
east-west orientation in relation to sunrise or (in one case) sunset may have been a, or even the,
key factor in many cases.
