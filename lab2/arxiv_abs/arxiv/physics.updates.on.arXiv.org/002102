A new fitting method is explored for momentum reconstruction of tracks in a constant magnetic field
for a silicon-strip tracker. Substantial increases of momentum resolution respect to standard
fit is obtained. The key point is the use of a realistic probability distribution for each hit (heteroscedasticity).
Two different methods are used for the fits, the first method introduces an effective variance for
each hit, the second method implements the maximum likelihood search. The tracker model is similar
to the PAMELA tracker. Each side, of the two sided of the PAMELA detectors, is simulated as momentum
reconstruction device. One of the two is similar to silicon micro-strip detectors of large use in
running experiments. Two different position reconstructions are used for the standard fits, the
$\eta$-algorithm (the best one) and the two-strip center of gravity. The gain obtained in momentum
resolution is measured as the virtual magnetic field and the virtual signal-to-noise ratio required
by the two standard fits to reach an overlap with the best of two new methods. For the best side, the
virtual magnetic field must be increased 1.5 times respect to the real field to reach the overlap
and 1.8 for the other. For the high noise side, the increases must be 1.8 and 2.0. The signal-to-noise
ratio has similar increases but only for the $\eta$-algorithm. The signal-to-noise ratio has no
effect on the fits with the center of gravity. Very important results are obtained if the number N
of detecting layers is increased, our methods provide a momentum resolution growing linearly with
N, much higher than standard fits that grow as the $\sqrt{N}$.
