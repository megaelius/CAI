eduLab (MOE, 2012b) is a key programme under the third MasterPlan for ICT in Education (mp3) where
teachers with good ideas for an ICT-enhanced lesson or curriculum (learning with computer models
through inquiry, example PhET (PhET, 2011) can come together to collaborate. eduLab aims to support
teachers to develop, prototype and test-bed their lesson ideas (journey in 2012-2014) while ensuring
that the results, in the form of complete lesson packages (see this http URL third project), are scalable
across schools to benefit the wider teaching community. Our models and lessons are downloadable

Hwang and Wolfgang Christian and created Open Source Computer Models on the topic of 1 Dimensional
Collision (Loo Kang Wee, 2012b), Falling Magnet in Coil, Ripple Tank (Duffy, 2010; G. H. Goh et al.,
2012; Ong, Ng, Goh, & Wee, 2012; Ong, Ng, Teo, et al., 2012; Loo Kang Wee, Duffy, Aguirregabiria,
& Hwang, 2012), Superposition Waves, 2 Mass Gravity, Earth-Moon Gravity, Kepler's Solar System
and Geostationary Orbit (J. Goh & Wee, 2011; Loo Kang Wee, 2012a; Loo Kang Wee & Esquembre,
2010; Loo Kang Wee & Goh, 2013) for enriching interactive engagement (Christian & Belloni,
2000; Hake, 1998) previously lacking in our teaching practices, but we argue is essential for deepening
learning (L.K. Wee & Lye, 2012) by doing. We hope to share some of the scaling-up learning points
from ideas (researchers Francisco Fu-Kwun and Wolfgang) to practice (teachers in RVHS, YJC, IJC,
AJC and SRJC) supported by specialist (ETD), contextualized and made possible through this edulab
funding initiative by National Research Fund, managed by National Institute of Education (NIE)
and Ministry of Education, Singapore.
