Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used tools to solve the many-body Schrodinger
equation. The core uncertainty inside DFT theory is the exchange-correlation (XC) functional,
the exact form of which is still unknown. Therefore, the essential part of DFT success is based on
the progress in the development of XC approximations. Traditionally, they are built upon analytic
solutions in low- and high-density limits and result from quantum Monte Carlo numerical calculations.
However, there is no consistent and general scheme of XC interpolation and functional representation.
Many different developed parametrizations mainly utilize a number of phenomenological rules
to construct a specific XC functional. In contrast, the neural network (NN) approach can provide
a general way to parametrize an XC functional without any \textit{a priori} knowledge of its functional
form. In this work, we develop NN XC functionals and prove their applicability to 3-dimensional
physical systems. We show that both the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) are well reproduced by the NN approach. It is demonstrated that the local environment
can be easily considered by changing only the number of neurons in the first layer of the NN. The developed
NN XC functionals show good results when applied to systems that are not presented in the training/test
data. The generalizability of the formulated NN XC framework leads us to believe that it could give
superior results in comparison with traditional XC schemes provided training data from high-level
theories such as the quantum Monte Carlo and post-Hartree-Fock methods.
