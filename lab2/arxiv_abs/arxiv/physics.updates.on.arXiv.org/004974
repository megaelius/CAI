Wave scattering from a cylinder with a tensor impedance surface is investigated based on the Lorentz-Mie
theory. A practical example of such a cylinder is a subwavelength metallic rod with helical dielectric-filled
corrugations. The investigation is performed with the aim to maximize scattering cross-section
by tailoring the surface impedance of cylindrical scatterers. For the normally incident TEz and
TMz waves the required surface impedance of a subwavelength cylinder can be produced by longitudinal
(axial) and transverse (circumferential) corrugations, respectively. It is shown that such corrugations
induce superscattering at multiple frequencies, which can be widely tuned with either or both the
size and permittivity of dielectric-filled corrugations. In the microwave band, this effect is
demonstrated to be robust to material losses and is validated against the full-wave simulations
and experiment. For the TEz waves the enhanced scattering from the cylinder is found to have a broad
frequency bandwidth, provided that the relative permittivity of corrugations is low or equal unity.
In the latter case, the corrugated cylinder acts as an all-metal superscatterer. For such cylinders
the near-field measurements are implemented and provide the first experimental evidence of the
superscattering phenomenon for all-metal objects. In addition to multifrequency superscattering,
the dielectric-filled corrugations are shown to provide multifrequency cloaking of the cylinder
under the incidence of the TMz waves. Simultaneous superscattering and cloaking at multiple frequencies
distinguishes corrugated cylinders from other known practicable scatterers for potential applications
in antenna designing, sensing, and energy harvesting.
