Multilayer networks or MLNs (also called multiplexes or network of networks) are being used extensively
for modeling and analysis of data sets with multiple entity and feature types as well as their relationships.
As the concept of communities and hubs are used for these analysis, a structure-preserving definition
for them on MLNs (that retains the original MLN structure and node/edge labels and types) and its
efficient detection are critical. There is no structure-preserving definition of a community
for a MLN as most of the current analyses aggregate a MLN to a single graph. Although there is consensus
on community definition for single graphs (and detection packages) and to a lesser extent for homogeneous
MLNs, it is lacking for heterogeneous MLNs. In this paper, we not only provide a structure-preserving
definition for the first time, but also its efficient computation using a decoupling approach,
and discuss its characteristics & significance for analysis. The proposed decoupling approach
for efficiency combines communities from individual layers to form a serial k-community for connected
k layers in a MLN. We propose several weight metrics for composing layer-wise communities using
the bipartite graph match approach based on the analysis semantics. Our proposed approach has a
number of advantages. It: i) leverages extant single graph community detection algorithms, ii)
is based on the widely-used maximal flow bipartite graph matching for composing k layers, iii) introduces
several weight metrics that are customized for the community concept, and iv) experimentally validates
the definition, mapping, and efficiency from a flexible analysis perspective on widely-used IMDb
data set. Keywords: Heterogeneous Multilayer Networks; Bipartite Graphs; Community Definition
