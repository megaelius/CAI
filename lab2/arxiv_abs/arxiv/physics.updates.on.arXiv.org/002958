The formation and stability of social hierarchies is a question of general relevance. Here, we propose
a simple generalized theoretical model for establishing social hierarchy via pair-wise interactions
between individuals and investigate its stability. In each interaction or fight, the probability
of "winning" depends solely on the relative societal status of the participants, and the winner
has a gain of status whereas there is an equal loss to the loser. The interactions are characterized
by two parameters. The first parameter represents how much can be lost, and the second parameter
represents the degree to which even a small difference of status can guarantee a win for the higher-status
individual. Depending on the parameters, the resulting status distributions reach either a continuous
unimodal form or lead to a totalitarian end state with one high-status individual and all other individuals
having status approaching zero. However, we find that in the latter case long-lived intermediary
distributions often exist, which can give the illusion of a stable society. As we show, our model
allows us to make predictions consistent with animal interaction data and their evolution over
a number of years. Moreover, by implementing a simple, but realistic rule that restricts interactions
to sufficiently similar-status individuals, the stable or long-lived distributions acquire
high-status structure corresponding to a distinct high-status class. Using household income
as a proxy for societal status in human societies, we find agreement over their entire range from
the low-to-middle-status parts to the characteristic high-status "tail". We discuss how the model
provides a conceptual framework for understanding the origin of social hierarchy and the factors
which lead to the preservation or deterioration of the societal structure.
