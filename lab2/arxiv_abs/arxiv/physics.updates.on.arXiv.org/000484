Analysis of the strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) generated in graphene nanobulges
under three different substrate scenarios shows that, in addition to the shape, the graphene-substrate
interaction can crucially determine the overall distribution and magnitude of strain and PMFs,
in and outside the bulge region. We utilize a combination of classical molecular dynamics, continuum
mechanics, and tight-binding electronic structure calculations as an unbiased means of studying
pressure-induced deformations and the resulting PMF distribution in graphene nanobubbles of
various geometries. The geometry is defined by inflating graphene against a rigid aperture of a
specified shape in the substrate. The interplay among substrate aperture geometry, lattice orientation,
internal gas pressure, and substrate type is analyzed in view of the prospect of using strain-engineered
graphene nanostructures capable of confining and/or guiding electrons at low energies. Except
in highly anisotropic geometries, the magnitude of the PMF is generally significant only near the
boundaries of the aperture and rapidly decays towards the center of the bubble because under gas
pressure at the scales considered here there is considerable bending at the edges and the central
region displays nearly isotropic strain. The strong and localized nature of the PMF at the boundaries
and its polarity-changing profile can be exploited as a means of trapping electrons inside the bubble
region or of guiding them in channel-like geometries defined by nano-blister edges. Finally, we
examine the size-dependent importance of \emph{curvature} on the PMFs in circular graphene nanobubbles.
We find that, for bubbles with diameters smaller than about 2nm, the PMF contribution arising from
the curvature becomes comparable to that obtained from the traditional in-plane component of the
gauge field and thus cannot be neglected.
