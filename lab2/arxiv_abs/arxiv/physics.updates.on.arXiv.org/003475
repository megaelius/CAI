The geometric dimensionality of a physical system significantly impacts its fundamental characteristics.
While experiments are fundamentally limited to the maximum of three spatial dimensions, there
is a growing interest in harnessing additional synthetic dimensions. In our work, we introduce
a new paradigm for the experimental realization of excitation dynamics associated with many-dimensional
systems. Crucially, it relies solely on static one-dimensional equivalent structures with judiciously
tailored parameters to faithfully reproduce the same optical spectrum and density of states of
the high-dimensional system to be represented. In order to showcase the capabilities of our approach,
we fabricate 1D photonic lattices that exhibit the characteristic non-monotonic excitation decays
associated with quantum walks in up to 7D square lattices. Furthermore, we find that a new type of
bound state at the edge of the continuum emerges in higher-than-three dimensions and gives rise
to a sharp localisation transition at defect sites. In a series of experiments, we implement the
mapped equivalent lattices of up to 5D systems and observe an extreme increase of sensitivity with
respect to the detuning of the respective anchor sites. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility
and applicative potential of harnessing high-dimensional effects in planar photonics for ultra-sensitive
switching or sensing. Notably, our general approach is by no means limited to optics, and can readily
be adapted to a variety of other physical contexts, including cold atoms and superconducting qubits
with exclusively nearest-neighbour interactions, promising to drive significant advances in
different fields including quantum simulations and information processing.
