Devices based on two-dimensional photonic-crystal (2D-PC) nanocavities, which are defined by
their air hole patterns, usually require a high quality (Q) factor to achieve high performance.
We demonstrate that hole patterns with very high Q factors can be efficiently found by the iteration
procedure consisting of: machine learning of the relation between the hole pattern and the corresponding
Q factor, and new dataset generation based on the regression function obtained by machine learning.
First a dataset comprising randomly generated cavity structures and their first principles Q factors
is prepared. Then a deep neural network is trained using the initial dataset to obtain a regression
function that approximately predicts the Q factors from the structural parameters. Several candidates
for higher Q factors are chosen by searching the parameter space using the regression function.
After adding these new structures and their first principles Q factors to the training dataset,
the above process is repeated. As an example, a standard silicon-based L3 cavity is optimized by
this method. A cavity design with a high Q factor exceeding 11 million is found within 101 iteration
steps and a total of 8070 cavity structures. This theoretical Q factor is more than twice of the previously
reported record values of the cavity designs detected by the evolutionary algorithm and the leaky
mode visualization method. It is found that structures with higher Q factors can be detected within
less iteration steps by exploring not only the parameter space near the present highest-Q structure
but also that distant from the present dataset.
