This work deals with the closed-loop control of streaky structures induced by free-stream turbulence
in a zero-pressure gradient, transitional boundary layer, by means of localized sensors and actuators.
A linear quadratic gaussian regulator is considered along with a system identification technique
to build reduced-order models for control. Three actuators are developed with different spatial
supports, corresponding to a baseline shape with only vertical forcing, and to two other shapes
obtained by different optimization procedures. A computationally efficient method is derived
to obtain an actuator which aims to induce the exact structures which are inside the boundary layer,
given in terms of their first spectral proper orthogonal decomposition mode, and an actuator that
maximizes the energy of induced downstream structures. Two free-stream turbulence levels were
evaluated, corresponding to 3.0% and 3.5%, and closed-loop control is applied in large-eddy simulations
of transitional boundary layers. All three actuators lead to significant delays in the transition
to turbulence and were shown to be robust to mild variations in the free-stream turbulence levels.
Differences are understood in terms of the SPOD of actuation and FST-induced fields along with the
causality of the control scheme. The actuator optimized to generate the leading downstream SPOD
mode, representing the streaks in the open-loop flow, leads to the highest transition delay, which
can be understood due to its capability of closely cancelling structures in the boundary layer.
However, it is shown that even with the actuator located downstream of the input measurement it may
become impossible to cancel incoming disturbances in a causal way, depending on the wall-normal
position of the output and on the actuator considered, which limits sensor and actuator placement
capable of good closed-loop performance.
