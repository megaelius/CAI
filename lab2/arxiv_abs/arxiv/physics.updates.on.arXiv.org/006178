The non-equilibrium transport of inhomogeneous and dense gases highly confined by surface is encountered
in many engineering applications. For example, in the shale gas production process, methane is
extracted from ultra-tight pores under high pressure so the gas is inhomogeneous and dense. Currently,
the complex non-equilibrium transport of inhomogeneous and dense gases where gas surface interactions
play a key role is commonly investigated by molecular dynamics or on a continuum-assumption basis.
Here, a tractable kinetic model based on the generalized Enskog equation and the mean-field theory
is employed to couple the effects of the volume exclusion and the long-range intermolecular attraction
forces. The interactions between gas molecules and confined surface are modelled by a 10-4-3 Lennard-Jones
potential, which can capture gas surface adsorption. The cross-sectional density profiles of
methane under different confinements are in good agreement with the molecular dynamics results
reported in the literature, and the transport behaviors are validated by the non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics. The velocity of methane flow in shale matrix is plug-like due to its dense characteristics
in nanopores. The influence of pressure, temperature, pore size and shale composition on density
and velocity profiles is analyzed quantitatively. Our results show that the Klinkenberg correction
is not applicable to model shale gas flow in the production process; the Navier-Stokes model using
the second-order slip boundary condition cannot produce the proper velocity profiles, and consequently
fails to predict the accurate flow rate in nanopores. This study sheds new light on understanding
the physics of non-equilibrium dense gas flows in shale strata.
