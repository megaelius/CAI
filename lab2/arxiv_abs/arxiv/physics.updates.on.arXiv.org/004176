The emergence of large-scale connectivity and synchronization are crucial to the structure, function
and failure of many complex socio-technical networks. Thus, there is great interest in analyzing
phase transitions to large-scale connectivity and to global synchronization, including how to
enhance or delay the onset. These phenomena are traditionally studied as second-order phase transitions
where, at the critical threshold, the order parameter increases rapidly but continuously. In 2009,
an extremely abrupt transition was found for a network growth process where links compete for addition
in attempt to delay percolation. This observation of "explosive percolation" was ultimately revealed
to be a continuous transition in the thermodynamic limit, yet with very atypical finite-size scaling,
and it started a surge of work on explosive phenomena and their consequences. Many related models
are now shown to yield discontinuous percolation transitions and even hybrid transitions. Explosive
percolation enables many other features such as multiple giant components, modular structures,
discrete scale invariance and non-self-averaging, relating to properties found in many real phenomena
such as explosive epidemics, electric breakdowns and the emergence of molecular life. Models of
explosive synchronization provide an analytic framework for the dynamics of abrupt transitions
and reveal the interplay between the distribution in natural frequencies and the network structure,
with applications ranging from epileptic seizures to waking from anesthesia. Here we review the
vast literature on explosive phenomena and synthesize the fundamental connections between models
and survey the application areas. We attempt to classify explosive phenomena based on underlying
mechanisms and to provide a coherent overview and perspective for future research to address the
many vital questions that remained unanswered.
