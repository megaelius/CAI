Metal-semiconductor interface is a bottleneck for efficient transport of charge carriers through
Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) based field-effect transistors (FETs). Injection of charge
carriers across such interfaces is mostly limited by Schottky barrier at the contacts which must
be reduced to achieve highly efficient contacts for carrier injection into the channel. Here we
introduce a universal approach involving dry chemistry to enhance atomic orbital interaction
between various TMDs (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2 and WSe2) & metal contacts has been experimentally demonstrated.
Quantum chemistry between TMDs, Chalcogens and metals has been explored using detailed atomistic
(DFT & NEGF) simulations, which is then verified using Raman, PL and XPS investigations. Atomistic
investigations revealed lower contact resistance due to enhanced orbital interaction and unique
physics of charge sharing between constituent atoms in TMDs with introduced Chalcogen atoms which
is subsequently validated through experiments. Besides contact engineering, which lowered contact
resistance by 72, 86, 1.8, 13 times in MoS2, WS2, MoSe2 and WSe2 respectively, a novel approach to
cure / passivate dangling bonds present at the 2D TMD channel surface has been demonstrated. While
the contact engineering improved the ON-state performance (ION, gm, mobility and RON) of 2D TMD
FETs by orders of magnitude, Chalcogen based channel passivation was found to improve gate control
(IOFF, SS, & VTH) significantly. This resulted in an overall performance boost. The engineered
TMD FETs were shown to have performance on par with best reported till date.
