It has been reported that isotope fractionation can occur on gas chromatography (GC), yet little
is known about concurrent dual-elements isotope fractionations on GC. Revelation of concurrent
two-dimensional carbon and chlorine/bromine isotope fractionations of halogenated organic
compounds (HOCs) on GC may be of important significance for compound-specific isotope analysis
(CSIA). This study presents an in-depth investigation of the two-dimensional C and Cl/Br isotope
fractionations of HOCs on GC using GC-double focus magnetic-sector high resolution mass spectrometry
(GC-DFS-HRMS). The two-dimensional C and Cl/Br isotope fractionations of four organochlorines
and four bromobenzenes on GC were simultaneously measured by GC-DFS-HRMS. The isotope fractionations
were evaluated with isotope ratios, relative variations of isotope ratios and isotope fractionation
extents. All the HOCs exhibited significant inverse C and Cl/Br isotope fractionations. The isotope
fractionations were significant in both ends of chromatographic peaks, while the isotope ratios
in center retention-time segments were the closest to comprehensive isotope ratios in the whole
peaks. Significant correlations between C isotope fractionation and Cl/Br isotope fractionation
were observed, indicating that the isotope fractionations might have strong relationships and/or
be dominated by similar factors. Relevant mechanisms for the two-dimensional C and Cl/Br isotope
fractionations were tentatively proposed on basis of a modified two-film model and the theories
related to zero point energy. The results of this study gains new insights into concurrent two-dimensional
isotope fractionation behaviors of HOCs during physical processes, and are conducive to CSIA studies
involving C, Cl and Br for obtaining high-quality data, particularly to dual-elements CSIA of C
and Cl/Br.
