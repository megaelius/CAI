The SoLid experiment has been designed to search for an oscillation pattern induced by a light sterile
neutrino state, utilising the BR2 reactor of SCK$\bullet$CEN, in Belgium. The detector leverages
a new hybrid technology, utilising two distinct scintillators in a cubic array, creating a highly
segmented detector volume. A combination of 5 cm cubic polyvinyltoluene cells, with $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag)
sheets on two faces of each cube, facilitate reconstruction of the neutrino signals. % The polyvinyltoluene
scintillator is used as an $\overline{\nu}_e$ target for the inverse beta decay of ($\overline{\nu}_e
+ p \rightarrow e^{+}+n$), with the $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) sheets used for associated neutron detection.
Scintillation signals are read out by a network of wavelength shifting fibres connected to multipixel
photon counters. Whilst the high granularity provides a powerful toolset to discriminate backgrounds;
by itself the segmentation also represents a challenge in terms of homogeneity and calibration,
for a consistent detector response. The search for this light sterile neutrino implies a sensitivity
to distortions of around $\mathcal{O}$(10)\% in the energy spectrum of reactor $\overline{\nu}_e$.
Hence, a very good neutron detection efficiency, light yield and homogeneous detector response
are critical for data validation. The minimal requirements for the SoLid physics program are a light
yield and a neutron detection efficiency larger than 40 PA/MeV/cube and 50 \% respectively. In order
to guarantee these minimal requirements, the collaboration developed a rigorous quality assurance
process for all 12800 cubic cells of the detector. To carry out the quality assurance process, an
automated calibration system called CALIPSO was designed and constructed.
