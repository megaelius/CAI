The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has necessitated mitigation efforts around the world. We use only reported
deaths in the two weeks after the first death to determine infection parameters, in order to make
predictions of hidden variables such as the time dependence of the number of infections. Early deaths
are sporadic and discrete so the use of network models of epidemic spread is imperative, with the
network itself a crucial random variable. Location-specific population age distributions and
population densities must be taken into account when attempting to fit these events with parametrized
models. These characteristics render naive Bayesian model comparison impractical as the networks
have to be large enough to avoid finite-size effects. We reformulated this problem as the statistical
physics of independent location-specific `balls' attached to every model in a six-dimensional
lattice of 56448 parametrized models by elastic springs, with model-specific `spring constants'
determined by the stochasticity of network epidemic simulations for that model. The distribution
of balls then determines all Bayes posterior expectations. Important characteristics of the contagion
are determinable: the fraction of infected patients that die ($0.017\pm 0.009$), the expected
period an infected person is contagious ($22 \pm 6$ days) and the expected time between the first
infection and the first death ($25 \pm 8$ days) in the US. The rate of exponential increase in the number
of infected individuals is $0.18\pm 0.03$ per day, corresponding to 65 million infected individuals
in one hundred days from a single initial infection, which fell to 166000 with even imperfect social
distancing effectuated two weeks after the first recorded death. The fraction of compliant socially-distancing
individuals matters less than their fraction of social contact reduction for altering the cumulative
number of infections.
