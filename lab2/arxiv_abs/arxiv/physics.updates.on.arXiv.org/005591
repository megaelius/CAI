Two types of approaches to modeling molecular systems have demonstrated high practical efficiency.
Density functional theory (DFT), the most widely used quantum chemical method, is a physical approach
predicting energies and electron densities of molecules. Recently, numerous papers on machine
learning (ML) of molecular properties have also been published. ML models greatly outperform DFT
in terms of computational costs, and may even reach comparable accuracy, but they are missing physicality
- a direct link to Quantum Physics - which limits their applicability. Here, we propose an approach
that combines the strong sides of DFT and ML, namely, physicality and low computational cost. By
generalizing the famous Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, we derive general equations for exact electron
densities and energies that can naturally guide applications of ML in Quantum Chemistry. Based
on these equations, we build a deep neural network that can compute electron densities and energies
of a wide range of organic molecules not only much faster, but also closer to exact physical values
than current versions of DFT. In particular, we reached a mean absolute error in energies of molecules
with up to eight non-hydrogen atoms as low as 0.9 kcal/mol relative to CCSD(T) values, noticeably
lower than those of DFT (down to ~3 kcal/mol on the same set of molecules) and ML (down to ~1.5 kcal/mol)
methods. A simultaneous improvement in the accuracy of predictions of electron densities and energies
suggests that the proposed approach describes the physics of molecules better than DFT functionals
developed by "human learning" earlier. Thus, physics-based ML offers exciting opportunities
for modeling, with high-theory-level quantum chemical accuracy, of much larger molecular systems
than currently possible.
