This article is part of a series of articles trying to establish the concept Molecular Field. The
theory that induced us to introduce this novel concept is based on the Born-Huang expansion as applied
to the Schroedinger equation that describes the interaction of a molecular system with an external
electric field. Assuming the molecular system is made up of two coupled adiabatic states the theory
leads from a single spatial Curl Equation, two space-time Curl equations and one single space-time
Divergent equation to a pair of decoupled Wave Equations usually encountered within the theory
of fields. In the present study the Wave Equations are derived for an external field having two features:
(a) its intensity is high enough; (b) its duration is short enough. For this situation the study reveals
that the just described interaction creates two fields that coexist within a molecule: one is a novel
vectorial field formed via the interaction of the external field with the Born-Huang non-adiabatic
coupling terms (NACT) and the other is an ordinary, scalar, electric field essentially identical
to the original external field. Part of the present study is devoted to the visualization of the outcomes
via two intersecting Jahn-Teller cones which contain NACTs that become singular at their intersection
point, also known as the point of Conical Intersection. This description is reminiscent of a metaphoric
cosmic Black-Hole which swallows one type of an electric field and creates a new type. Finally, the
fact that eventually we are facing a kind of a cosmic situation may bring us to speculate that singular
NACTs are a result of cosmic phenomena. Thus, if indeed this singularity is somehow connected to
reality then, like other singularities in physics, it is formed at (or immediately after) the Big
Bang (and because of that, eventually the ability to form molecules).
