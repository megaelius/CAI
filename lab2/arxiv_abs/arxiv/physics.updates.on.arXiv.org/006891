The exotic physics emerging in non-Hermitian systems with balanced distributions of gain and loss
has drawn a great deal of attention in recent years. These systems exhibit phase transitions and
exceptional point singularities in their spectra, at which eigen-values and eigen-modes coalesce
and the overall dimensionality is reduced. Among several peculiar phenomena observed at exceptional
points, an especially intriguing property, with relevant practical potential, consists in the
inherently enhanced sensitivity to small-scale perturbations. So far, however, these principles
have been implemented at the expenses of precise fabrication and tuning requirements, involving
tailored nano-structured devices with controlled distributions of optical gain and loss. In this
work, anti-parity-time symmetric phase transitions and exceptional point singularities are
demonstrated in a single strand of standard single-mode telecommunication fibre, using a setup
consisting of entirely of off-the-shelf components. Two propagating signals are amplified and
coupled through stimulated Brillouin scattering, which makes the process non-Hermitian and enables
exquisite control over gain and loss. Singular response to small variations around the exceptional
point and topological features arising around this singularity are experimentally demonstrated
with large precision, enabling robustly enhanced spectral response to small-scale changes in
the Brillouin frequency shift. Our findings open exciting opportunities for the exploration of
non-Hermitian phenomena over a table-top setup, with straightforward extensions to higher-order
Hamiltonians and applications in quantum optics, nanophotonics and sensing.
