Quasiparticle energies and fundamental band gaps in particular are critical properties of molecules
and materials. It was rigorously established that the generalized Kohn-Sham HOMO and LUMO orbital
energies are the chemical potentials of electron removal and addition and thus good approximations
to band edges and fundamental gaps from a density functional approximation (DFA) with minimal delocalization
error. For other quasiparticle energies, their connection to the generalized Kohn-Sham orbital
energies has not been established but remains highly interesting. We provide the comparison of
experimental quasiparticle energies for many finite systems with calculations from the GW Green's
function and localized orbitals scaling correction (LOSC), a recently developed correction to
semilocal DFAs, which has minimal delocalization error. Extensive results with over forty systems
clearly show that LOSC orbital energies achieve slightly better accuracy than the GW calculations
with little dependence on the semilocal DFA, supporting the use of LOSC DFA orbital energies to predict
quasiparticle energies. This also leads to the calculations of excitation energies of the $N$-electron
systems from the ground state DFA calculations of the $\left(N-1\right)$-electron systems. Results
show good performance with accuracy similar to TDDFT and the delta SCF approach for valence excitations
with commonly used DFAs with or without LOSC. For Rydberg states, good accuracy was obtained only
with the use of LOSC DFA. This work highlights the pathway to quasiparticle and excitation energies
from ground density functional calculations.
