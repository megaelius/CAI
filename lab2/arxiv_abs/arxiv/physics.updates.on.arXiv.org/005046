If the parameters defining the physics of our universe departed from their present values, the observed
rich structure and complexity would not be supported. This article considers whether similar fine-tuning
of parameters applies to technology. The anthropic principle is one means of explaining the observed
values of the parameters. This principle constrains physical theories to allow for our existence,
yet the principle does not apply to the existence of technology. Cosmological natural selection
has been proposed as an alternative to anthropic reasoning. Within this framework, fine-tuning
results from selection of universes capable of prolific reproduction. It was originally proposed
that reproduction occurs through singularities resulting from supernovae, and subsequently
argued that life may facilitate the production of the singularities that become offspring universes.
Here I argue technology is necessary for production of singularities by living beings, and ask whether
the physics of our universe has been selected to simultaneously enable stars, intelligent life,
and technology capable of creating progeny. Specific technologies appear implausibly equipped
to perform tasks necessary for production of singularities, potentially indicating fine-tuning
through cosmological natural selection. These technologies include silicon electronics, superconductors,
and the cryogenic infrastructure enabled by the thermodynamic properties of liquid helium. Numerical
studies are proposed to determine regions of physical parameter space in which the constraints
of stars, life, and technology are simultaneously satisfied. If this overlapping parameter range
is small, we should be surprised that physics allows technology to exist alongside us. The tests
do not call for new astrophysical or cosmological observations. Only computer simulations of well-understood
condensed matter systems are required.
