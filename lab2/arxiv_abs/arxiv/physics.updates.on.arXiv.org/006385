Motivated by the desire to understand complex transient behaviour in fluid flows, we study the dynamics
of an air bubble driven by the steady motion of a suspending viscous fluid within a Hele-Shaw channel
with a centred depth perturbation. Using both experiments and numerical simulations of a depth-averaged
model, we investigate the evolution of an initially centred bubble of prescribed volume as a function
of flow rate and initial shape. The experiments exhibit a rich variety of organised transient dynamics,
involving bubble break up as well as aggregation and coalescence of interacting neighbouring bubbles.
The long-term outcome is either a single bubble or multiple separating bubbles, positioned along
the channel in order of increasing velocity. Up to moderate flow rates, the life and fate of the bubble
are reproducible and can be categorised by a small number of characteristic behaviours that occur
in simply-connected regions of the parameter plane. Increasing the flow rate leads to less reproducible
time evolutions with increasing sensitivity to initial conditions and perturbations in the channel.
Time-dependent numerical simulations that allow for break up and coalescence are found to reproduce
most of the dynamical behaviour observed experimentally including enhanced sensitivity at high
flow rate. An unusual feature of this system is that the set of steady and periodic solutions can change
during temporal evolution because both the number of bubbles and their size distribution evolve
due to break up and coalescence events. Calculation of stable and unstable solutions in the single-
and two-bubble cases reveals that the transient dynamics are orchestrated by weakly-unstable
solutions of the system termed edge states that can appear and disappear as the number of bubbles
changes.
