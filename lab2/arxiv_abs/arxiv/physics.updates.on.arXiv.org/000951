Producing advanced quantum states of light is a priority in quantum information technologies.
While remarkable progress has been made on single photons and photon pairs, multipartite correlated
photon states are usually produced in purely optical systems by post-selection or cascading, with
extremely low efficiency and exponentially poor scaling. Multipartite states enable improved
tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics as well as implementations of complex quantum optical
networks and protocols. It would be favorable to directly generate these states using solid state
systems, for better scaling, simpler handling, and the promise of reversible transfer of quantum
information between stationary and flying qubits. Here we use the ground states of two optically
active coupled quantum dots to directly produce photon triplets. The wavefunctions of photogenerated
excitons localized in these ground states are correlated via molecular hybridization and Coulomb
interactions. The formation of a triexciton leads to a triple cascade recombination and sequential
emission of three photons with strong correlations. The quantum dot molecule is embedded in an epitaxially
grown nanowire engineered for single-mode waveguiding and improved extraction efficiency at
the emission wavelength. We record 65.62 photon triplets per minute, surpassing rates of all earlier
reported sources, in spite of the moderate efficiency of our detectors. Our structure and data represent
a breakthrough towards implementing multipartite photon entanglement and multi-qubit readout
schemes in solid state devices, suitable for integrated quantum information processing.
