We compare the predictions of stochastic closure theory (SCT) with experimental measurements
of homogeneous turbulence made in the Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel (VDTT) at the Max Planck
Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in Gottingen. While the general form of SCT contains
infinitely many free parameters, the data permit us to reduce the number to seven, only three of which
are active over the entire inertial range. Of these three, one parameter characterizes the variance
of the mean field noise in SCT and another characterizes the rate in the large deviations of the mean.
The third parameter is the decay exponent of the Fourier variables in the Fourier expansion of the
noise, which characterizes the smoothness of the turbulent velocity. SCT compares favorably with
velocity structure functions measured in the experiment. We considered even-order structure
functions ranging in order from two to eight as well as the third-order structure functions at five
Taylor-Reynolds numbers (Rl) between 110 and 1450. The comparisons highlight several advantages
of the SCT, which include explicit predictions for the structure functions at any scale and for any
Reynolds number. We observed that finite-Rl corrections, for instance, are important even at the
highest Reynolds numbers produced in the experiments. SCT gives us the correct basis function to
express all the moments of the velocity differences in turbulence in Fourier space. The SCT produces
the coefficients of the series and so determines the statistical quantities that characterize
the small scales in turbulence. It also characterizes the random force acting on the fluid in the
stochastic Navier-Stokes equation, as described in the paper.
