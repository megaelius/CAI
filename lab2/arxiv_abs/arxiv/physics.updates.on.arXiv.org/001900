A fundamental question in the field of social studies of science is how research fields emerge, grow
and decline over time and space. This study confronts this question here by developing an inductive
analysis of emerging research fields represented by human microbiome, evolutionary robotics
and astrobiology. In particular, number of papers from starting years to 2017 of each emerging research
field is analyzed considering the subject areas (i.e., disciplines) of authors. Findings suggest
some empirical laws of the evolution of research fields: the first law states that the evolution
of a specific research field is driven by few scientific disciplines (3- 5) that generate more than
80% of documents (concentration of the scientific production); the second law states that the evolution
of research fields is path-dependent of a critical discipline (it can be a native discipline that
has originated the research field or a new discipline emerged during the social dynamics of science);
the third law states that a research field can be driven during its evolution by a new discipline originated
by a process of specialization within science. The findings here can explain and generalize, whenever
possible some properties of the evolution of scientific fields that are due to interaction between
disciplines, convergence between basic and applied research fields and interdisciplinary in
scientific research. Overall, then, this study begins the process of clarifying and generalizing,
as far as possible, the properties of the social construction and evolution of science to lay a foundation
for the development of sophisticated theories.
