Radio-frequency communication systems have long used bulk- and surface-acoustic-wave devices
supporting ultrasonic mechanical waves to manipulate and sense signals. These devices have greatly
improved our ability to process microwaves by interfacing them to orders-of-magnitude slower
and lower loss mechanical fields. In parallel, long-distance communications have been dominated
by low-loss infrared optical photons. As electrical signal processing and transmission approaches
physical limits imposed by energy dissipation, optical links are now being actively considered
for mobile and cloud technologies. Thus there is a strong driver for wavelength-scale mechanical
wave or "phononic" circuitry fabricated by scalable semiconductor processes. With the advent
of these circuits, new micro- and nanostructures that combine electrical, optical and mechanical
elements have emerged. In these devices, such as optomechanical waveguides and resonators, optical
photons and gigahertz phonons are ideally matched to one another as both have wavelengths on the
order of micrometers. The development of phononic circuits has thus emerged as a vibrant field of
research pursued for optical signal processing and sensing applications as well as emerging quantum
technologies. In this review, we discuss the key physics and figures of merit underpinning this
field. We also summarize the state of the art in nanoscale electro- and optomechanical systems with
a focus on scalable platforms such as silicon. Finally, we give perspectives on what these new systems
may bring and what challenges they face in the coming years. In particular, we believe hybrid electro-
and optomechanical devices incorporating highly coherent and compact mechanical elements on
a chip have significant untapped potential for electro-optic modulation, quantum microwave-to-optical
photon conversion, sensing and microwave signal processing.
