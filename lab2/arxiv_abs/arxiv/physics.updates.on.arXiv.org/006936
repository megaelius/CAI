We develop a stochastic model for Lagrangian velocity as it is observed in experimental and numerical
fully developed turbulent flows. We define it as the unique statistically stationary solution
of a causal dynamics, given by a stochastic differential equation. In comparison to previously
proposed stochastic models, the obtained process is infinitely differentiable at a given finite
Reynolds number, and its second-order statistical properties converge to those of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process in the infinite Reynolds number limit. In this limit, it exhibits furthermore intermittent
scaling properties, as they can be quantified using higher-order statistics. To achieve this,
we begin with generalizing the two-layered embedded stochastic process of Sawford (1991) by considering
an infinite number of layers. We then study, both theoretically and numerically, the convergence
towards a smooth (i.e. infinitely differentiable) Gaussian process. To include intermittent
corrections, we follow similar considerations as for the multifractal random walk of Bacry et al.
(2001). We derive in an exact manner the statistical properties of this process, and compare them
to those estimated from Lagrangian trajectories extracted from numerically simulated turbulent
flows. Key predictions of the multifractal formalism regarding acceleration correlation function
and high-order structure functions are also derived. Through these predictions, we understand
phenomenologically peculiar behaviours of the fluctuations in the dissipative range, that are
not reproduced by our stochastic process. The proposed theoretical method regarding the modelling
of infinitely differentiability opens the route to the full stochastic modelling of velocity,
including the peculiar action of viscosity on the very fine scales.
