Resonant interaction between two (or more) progressive interfacial waves produces exponentially
growing instabilities in idealized, homogeneous or density stratified, inviscid shear layers
(Holmboe 1962). Resonance occurs when the two waves attain a "phase-locked" configuration. In
this paper we have generalized the mechanistic picture of shear instabilities described in Holmboe
(1962). Unlike Holmboe, we do not initially assume the wave type (e.g. vorticity wave or gravity
wave), nor do we impose the normal-mode waveform (which only accounts for exponential growth).
Starting from first principles, we demonstrate that two oppositely propagating interfacial waves,
having "arbitrary" initial amplitudes (which are small enough to satisfy linearity) and phases,
eventually phase-lock, provided they satisfy a certain condition. We show it to be the "necessary
and sufficient condition" for exponentially growing instabilities in idealized shear layers.
We investigate three types of shear instabilities - Kelvin Helmholtz, Holmboe and Taylor. It is
shown that the above-mentioned condition provides a range of unstable wavenumbers for each instability
type, and this range matches the predictions of the canonical normal-mode based linear stability
theory. The wave interaction problem is interpreted using dynamical systems approach. It is shown
that the dynamical system is of "source-sink" type, and its equilibrium points represent the growing
and decaying normal-modes of the discrete spectrum. Once arbitrarily initialized, the two waves
adjust each other's amplitudes and phases until they reach the resonant configuration, which corresponds
to the growing normal-mode of the spectrum. The pre-resonance stage characterizes the non-modal
instability of the shear layer, favoring rapid transient growth processes. Optimal growth is found
to occur when the the two waves are in quadrature.
