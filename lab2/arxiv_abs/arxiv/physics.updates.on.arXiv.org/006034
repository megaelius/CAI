In this paper we compare the heave, surge, and pitch dynamics of a submerged cylindrical point absorber,
simulated using potential flow and fully-resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models.
The potential flow model is based on the time-domain Cummins equation, whereas the CFD model uses
the fictitious domain Brinkman penalization (FD/BP) technique. The submerged cylinder is tethered
to the seabed using a power take off unit which restrains the heave, surge, and pitch motions of the
converter, and absorbs energy from all three modes. It is demonstrated that the potential theory
over-predicts the amplitudes of heave and surge motions, whereas it results in an insignificant
pitch for a fully-submerged axisymmetric converter. It also under-estimates the slow drift of
the buoy, which the CFD model is able to capture reliably. We also present experimental wave-structure
interaction (WSI) data of a submerged axisymmetric sphere, which further corroborates the finding
that the CFD model is closer to reality than the potential flow model. Further, we use fully-resolved
CFD simulations to study the performance of a 3-DOF cylindrical buoy under varying PTO coefficients,
mass density of the buoy, and incoming wave heights. It is demonstrated that the PTO coefficients
predicted by the linear potential theory are sub-optimal for waves of moderate and high steepness.
The wave absorption efficiency improves significantly when higher than the predicted value of
the PTO damping is selected. Moreover, the mass density also influences the range of resonance periods
of the device. Finally, simulations with different wave heights show that at higher heights, the
wave absorption efficiency of the converter decreases and a large portion of available wave power
remains unabsorbed.
