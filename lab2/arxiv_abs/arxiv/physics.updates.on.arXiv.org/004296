We present an investigation of the root-mean-square (rms) temperature $\sigma_T$ and the rms velocity
$\sigma_w$ in the bulk of Rayleigh-B\'enard turbulence, using new experimental data from the current
study and experimental and numerical data from previous studies. We find that, once scaled by the
convective temperature $\theta_*$, the value of $\sigma_T$ at the cell centre is a constant, i.e.
$\sigma_{T,c}/\theta_* \approx 0.85$, over a wide range of the Rayleigh number ($10^{8}\leq Ra\leq
10^{15}$) and the Prandtl number ($0.7\leq Pr \leq 23.34$), and is independent of the surface topographies
of the top and bottom plates of the convection cell. A constant close to unity suggests that $\theta_*$
is a proper measure of the temperature fluctuation in the core region. On the other hand, $\sigma_{w,c}/w_*$,
the vertical rms velocity at the cell centre scaled by the convective velocity $w_*$, shows a weak
$Ra$-dependence ($\sim Ra^{0.07\pm0.02}$) over $10^8\leq Ra\leq 10^{10}$ at $Pr\sim4.3$ and
is independent of plate topography. Similar to a previous finding by He \& Xia ({\it Phys. Rev. Lett.,}
vol. 122, 2019, 014503), we find that the rms temperature profile $\sigma_T(z)/\theta_*$ in the
region of the mixing zone with a mean horizontal shear exhibits a power-law dependence on the distance
$z$ from the plate, but now the universal profile applies to both smooth and rough surface topographies
and over a wider range of $Ra$. The vertical rms velocity profile $\sigma_w(z)/w_*$ obey a logarithmic
dependence on $z$. The study thus demonstrates that the typical scales for the temperature and the
velocity are the convective temperature $\theta_*$ and the the convective velocity $w_*$, respectively.
Finally, we note that $\theta_*$ may be utilised to study the flow regime transitions in the ultra-high-$Ra$-number
turbulent convection.
