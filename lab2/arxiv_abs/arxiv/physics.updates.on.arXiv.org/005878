The fMRI community has made great strides in decoupling neuronal activity from other physiologically
induced T2* changes, using sensors that provide a ground-truth with respect to cardiac, respiratory,
and head movement dynamics. However, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) time-series dynamics
are confounded by scanner artifacts, in complex ways that can vary not only between scanners but
even, for the same scanner, between sessions. The lack of equivalent ground truth has thus far stymied
the development of reliable methods for identification and removal of scanner-induced noise.
To address this problem, we first designed and built a phantom capable of providing dynamic signals
equivalent to that of the resting-state brain. Using the dynamic phantom, we quantified voxel-wise
noise by comparing the ground-truth time-series with its measured fMRI data. We derived the following
data-quality metrics: Standardized Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ST-SNR) and dynamic fidelity that
can be directly compared across scanners. Dynamic phantom data acquired from four scanners showed
scanner-instability multiplicative noise contributions of about 8-20\% of the total noise. We
further measured strong non-linearity in the fMRI response for all scanners, ranging between 12-22\%
of total voxels. To correct scanner distortion of fMRI time-series dynamics at a single-subject
level, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on paired sets of measured vs. ground-truth
data. Tests on dynamic phantom time-series showed a 3- to 4-fold increase in ST-SNR and about 40-70\%
increase in dynamic fidelity after denoising. Critically, we observed that the CNN temporal denoising
pushes ST-SNR ST-SNR > 1. Denoising human-data with ground-truth-trained CNN, in turn, showed
markedly increased detection sensitivity of resting-state networks.
