Machine learning is increasingly recognized as a promising technology in the biological, biomedical,
and behavioral sciences. There can be no argument that this technique is incredibly successful
in image recognition with immediate applications in diagnostics including electrophysiology,
radiology, or pathology, where we have access to massive amounts of annotated data. However, machine
learning often performs poorly in prognosis, especially when dealing with sparse data. This is
a field where classical physics-based simulation seems to remain irreplaceable. In this review,
we identify areas in the biomedical sciences where machine learning and multiscale modeling can
mutually benefit from one another: Machine learning can integrate physics-based knowledge in
the form of governing equations, boundary conditions, or constraints to manage ill-posted problems
and robustly handle sparse and noisy data; multiscale modeling can integrate machine learning
to create surrogate models, identify system dynamics and parameters, analyze sensitivities,
and quantify uncertainty to bridge the scales and understand the emergence of function. With a view
towards applications in the life sciences, we discuss the state of the art of combining machine learning
and multiscale modeling, identify applications and opportunities, raise open questions, and
address potential challenges and limitations. We anticipate that it will stimulate discussion
within the community of computational mechanics and reach out to other disciplines including mathematics,
statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, biomedicine, systems biology, and precision
medicine to join forces towards creating robust and efficient models for biological systems.
