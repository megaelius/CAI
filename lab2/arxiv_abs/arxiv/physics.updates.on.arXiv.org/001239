We derive the expressions for configurational forces in Kohn-Sham density functional theory,
which correspond to the generalized variational force computed as the derivative of the Kohn-Sham
energy functional with respect to the position of a material point $\textbf{x}$. These configurational
forces that result from the inner variations of the Kohn-Sham energy functional provide a unified
framework to compute atomic forces as well as stress tensor for geometry optimization. Importantly,
owing to the variational nature of the formulation, these configurational forces inherently account
for the Pulay corrections. The formulation presented in this work treats both pseudopotential
and all-electron calculations in single framework, and employs a local variational real-space
formulation of Kohn-Sham DFT expressed in terms of the non-orthogonal wavefunctions that is amenable
to reduced-order scaling techniques. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed
configurational force approach on benchmark all-electron and pseudopotential calculations
conducted using higher-order finite-element discretization. To this end, we examine the rates
of convergence of the finite-element discretization in the computed forces and stresses for various
materials systems, and, further, verify the accuracy from finite-differencing the energy. Wherever
applicable, we also compare the forces and stresses with those obtained from Kohn-Sham DFT calculations
employing plane-wave basis (pseudopotential calculations) and Gaussian basis (all-electron
calculations). Finally, we verify the accuracy of the forces on large materials systems involving
a metallic aluminum nanocluster containing 666 atoms and an alkane chain containing 902 atoms,
where the Kohn-Sham electronic ground state is computed using a reduced-order scaling subspace
projection technique (P. Motamarri and V. Gavini, Phys. Rev. B 90, 115127).
