GipsyX/RTGx is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) next generation software package for positioning,
navigation, timing, and Earth science using measurements from three geodetic techniques: Global
Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), and Doppler Orbitography
and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS); with Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) under development. The software facilitates combined estimation of geodetic and geophysical
parameters using a Kalman filter approach on real or simulated data in both post-processing and
in real-time. The estimated parameters include station coordinates and velocities, satellite
orbits and clocks, Earth orientation, ionospheric and tropospheric delays. The software is also
capable of full realization of a dynamic terrestrial reference through analysis and combination
of time series of ground station coordinates. We present some key aspects of its new architecture,
and describe some of its major applications, including Real-time orbit determination and ephemeris
predictions in the U.S. Air Force Next Generation GPS Operational Control Segment (OCX), as well
as in JPL's Global Differential GPS (GDGPS) System, supporting User Range Error (URE) of $<$ 5 cm
RMS; precision post-processing GNSS orbit determination, including JPL's contributions to the
International GNSS Service (IGS) with URE in the 2 cm RMS range; Precise point positioning (PPP)
with ambiguity resolution, both statically and kinematically, for geodetic applications with
2 mm horizontal, and 6.5 mm vertical repeatability for static positioning; Operational orbit and
clock determination for Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites, such as NASA's Gravity Recovery and
Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission with GRACE relative clock alignment at the 20 ps level.
