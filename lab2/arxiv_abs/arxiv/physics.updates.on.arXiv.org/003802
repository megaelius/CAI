The random phase approximation (RPA) is exact for the exchange energy of a many-electron ground
state, but RPA makes the correlation energy too negative by about 0.5 eV/electron. That large short-range
error, which tends to cancel out of iso-electronic energy differences, is largely corrected by
an exchange-correlation kernel, or (as in RPA+) by an additive local or semilocal correction. RPA+
is by construction exact for the homogeneous electron gas, and it is also accurate for the jellium
surface. RPA+ often gives realistic total energies for atoms or solids in which spin-polarization
corrections are absent or small. RPA and RPA+ also yield realistic singlet binding energy curves
for H2 and N2, and thus RPA+ yields correct total energies even for spin-unpolarized atoms with fractional
spins and strong correlation, as in stretched H2 or N2. However, RPA and RPA+ can be very wrong for
spin-polarized one-electron systems (especially for stretched H2+), and also for the spin-polarization
energies of atoms. The spin-polarization energy is often a small part of the total energy of an atom,
but important for ionization energies, electron affinities, and the atomization energies of molecules.
Here we propose a computationally efficient generalized RPA+ (gRPA+) that changes RPA+ only for
spin-polarized systems by making gRPA+ exact for all one-electron densities, in the same simple
semilocal way that the correlation energy densities of many meta-generalized gradent approximations
are made self-correlation free. By construction, gRPA+ does not degrade the exact RPA+ description
of jellium. gRPA+ is found to greatly improve upon RPA and RPA+ for the ionization energies and electron
affinities of light atoms. Many versions of RPA with an approximate exchange-correlation kernel
fail to be exact for all one-electron densities, and they can also be self-interaction corrected
in this way.
