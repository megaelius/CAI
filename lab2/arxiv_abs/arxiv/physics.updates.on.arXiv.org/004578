Silicon quantum photonics provides a promising pathway to realize large-scale quantum photonic
integrated circuits (QPICs) by exploiting the power of complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor
(CMOS) technology. Toward scalable operation of such silicon-based QPICs, a straightforward
approach is to integrate deterministic single-photon sources (SPSs). To this end, hybrid integration
of deterministic solid-state SPSs, such as those based on InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs), is highly
promising. However, the spectral and spatial randomness inherent in the QDs pose a serious challenge
for scalable implementation of multiple identical SPSs on a silicon CMOS chip. To overcome this
challenge, we have been investigating a new hybrid integration technique called transfer printing,
which is based on a pick-and-place operation and allows for the integration of desired QD SPSs on
any locations on the silicon CMOS chips at will. Nevertheless, even in this scenario, in-situ fine
tuning for perfect wavelength matching among the integrated QD SPSs will be required for interfering
photons from the dissimilar sources. Here, we demonstrate in-situ wavelength tuning of QD SPSs
integrated on a CMOS silicon chip. To thermally tune the emission wavelengths of the integrated
QDs, we augmented the QD SPSs with optically driven heating pads. The integration of all the necessary
elements was performed using transfer printing, which largely simplified the fabrication of the
three-dimensional stack of micro/nanophotonic structures. We further demonstrate in-situ wavelength
matching between two dissimilar QD sources integrated on the same silicon chip. Our transfer-printing-based
approach will open the possibility for realizing large-scale QPICs that leverage CMOS technology.
