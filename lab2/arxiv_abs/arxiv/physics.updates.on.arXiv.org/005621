In recent years, multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a key enabler for handling the massive expansion
of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services. However, energy consumption of a MEC network
depends on volatile tasks that induces risk for energy demand estimations. As an energy supplier,
a microgrid can facilitate seamless energy supply. However, the risk associated with energy supply
is also increased due to unpredictable energy generation from renewable and non-renewable sources.
Especially, the risk of energy shortfall is involved with uncertainties in both energy consumption
and generation. In this paper, we study a risk-aware energy scheduling problem for a microgrid-powered
MEC network. First, we formulate an optimization problem considering the conditional value-at-risk
(CVaR) measurement for both energy consumption and generation, where the objective is to minimize
the loss of energy shortfall of the MEC networks and we show this problem is an NP-hard problem. Second,
we analyze our formulated problem using a multi-agent stochastic game that ensures the joint policy
Nash equilibrium, and show the convergence of the proposed model. Third, we derive the solution
by applying a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based asynchronous advantage
actor-critic (A3C) algorithm with shared neural networks. This method mitigates the curse of dimensionality
of the state space and chooses the best policy among the agents for the proposed problem. Finally,
the experimental results establish a significant performance gain by considering CVaR for high
accuracy energy scheduling of the proposed model than both the single and random agent models.
