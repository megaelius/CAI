The three dimensional structure, dynamics and dispersion characteristics of a simulated upwelling
filament in the Iberian upwelling system are analyzed using Lagrangian tools. We used a realistic
regional simulation of the western Iberian shelf which is concomitant with an in-situ oceanographic
campaign that surveyed the area. We compute 3d fields of finite--size Lyapunov exponents (FSLE)
from 3d velocity fields and extract the field's ridges to study the spatial distribution and temporal
evolution of the Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) evolving around the filament. We find that
the most intense curtain-like LCSs delimit the boundaries of the whole filamentary structure whose
general properties match well the observations. The filament interior is characterized by small
dispersion of fluid elements. Furthermore, we identify a weak LCS separating the filament into
a warmer vein and a colder filament associated with the interaction of a mesoscale eddy with the upwelling
front. The cold upwelled water parcels move along the filament conserving their density. The filament
itself is characterized by small dispersion of fluid elements in its interior. The comparison of
LCSs with potential temperature and salinity gradient fields shows that the outer limits of the
filament coincide with regions of large hydrographic gradients, similar to those observed, explaining
the isolation of the interior of the filament with the surrounding waters. We conclude that the Lagrangian
analysis used in this work is useful in explaining the dynamics of cross-shore exchanges of materials
between coastal regions and the open ocean due to mesoscale processes.
