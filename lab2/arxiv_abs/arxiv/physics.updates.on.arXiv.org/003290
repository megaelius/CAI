We simulate the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluids separated by an interface in a homogeneous
turbulent shear flow at a shear Reynolds number equal to 15200. The viscosity and density of the two
fluids are equal, and various surface tensions and initial droplet diameters are considered in
the present study. We show that the two-phase flow reaches a statistically stationary turbulent
state sustained by a non-zero mean turbulent production rate due to the presence of the mean shear.
Compared to single-phase flow, we find that the resulting steady state conditions exhibit reduced
Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers owing to the presence of the dispersed phase, which acts as a
sink of turbulent kinetic energy for the carrier fluid. At steady state, the mean power of surface
tension is zero and the turbulent production rate is in balance with the turbulent dissipation rate,
with their values being larger than in the reference single-phase case. The interface modifies
the energy spectrum by introducing energy at small-scales, with the difference from the single-phase
case reducing as the Weber number increases. This is caused by both the number of droplets in the domain
and the total surface area increasing monotonically with the Weber number. This reflects also in
the droplets size distribution which changes with the Weber number, with the peak of the distribution
moving to smaller sizes as the Weber number increases. We show that the Hinze estimate for the maximum
droplet size, obtained considering breakup in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, provides an
excellent estimate notwithstanding the action of significant coalescence and the presence of
a mean shear.
