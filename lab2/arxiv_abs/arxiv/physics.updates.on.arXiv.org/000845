There are investigated the generalized methods of cognition of the Existing, i.e. everything that
is able to influence to the cognizer, and everything differed from the Existing is postulated as
indistinguishable from the non-existing and incognizable. The traditional methods of cognition,
based on the identification of the objects of the surrounding world, take into account not all influences,
because are limited by the nature, understood as the ontology of the subject of cognition. The ontology
is determined on the level of basic notions and definitions, so even if objects from the representation
systems different by ontology are identified, they look undetermined, uncertain and paradoxical,
exactly as, for example, the quantum mechanical objects or cosmological dark matter and energy.
The representation systems with different ontology are incompatible with each other on the level
of basic notions and cannot be unified on frames of one consistent system or theory. The concept of
incompatible representations unifies on the level exceeded the ontological frames the different
by ontology representation systems and incompatible approaches, such as relativistic and quantum
ones. The concept gives a possibility to eliminate the principal contradictions of the system approach
in scientific cognition, so solves the problem of understanding in science. The generalized methods
of cognition are by definition on the foundations of different representation systems: scientific,
philosophical, religious and social ones, what gives a possibility of general analysis and revision
of their foundations. The interconnections of some physical theories, the philosophical, religious
and social systems are briefly analyzed from this point of view. There are briefly considered the
multi-polar picture of the world, which the concept of incompatible representations leads to.
