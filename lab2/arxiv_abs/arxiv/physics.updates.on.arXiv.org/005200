Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) and time tagging of individual photon detections
are powerful tools in many quantum optical experiments and other areas of applied physics. Using
TCSPC, e.g., for the purpose of fluorescence lifetime measurements, is often limited in speed due
to dead-time losses and pile-up. We show that this limitation can be lifted by reducing the dead-time
of the timing electronics to the absolute minimum imposed by the speed of the detector signals while
maintaining high temporal resolution. A complementing approach to speedy data acquisition is
parallelization by means of simultaneous readout of many detector channels. This puts high demands
on the data throughput of the TCSPC system, especially in time tagging of individual photon arrivals.
Here, we present a new design approach, supporting up to 16 input channels, an extremely short dead-time
of 650 ps, very high time tagging throughput, and a timing resolution of 80 ps. In order to facilitate
remote synchronization of multiple such instruments with highest precision, the new TCSPC electronics
provide an interface for White Rabbit fiber optic networks. Beside fundamental research in the
field of astronomy, such remote synchronization tasks arise routinely in quantum communication
networks with node to node distances on the order of tens of kilometers. In addition to showing design
features and benchmark results of new TCSPC electronics, we present application results from spectrally
resolved and high-speed fluorescence lifetime imaging in medical research. We furthermore show
how pulse-pile-up occurring in the detector signals at high photon flux can be corrected for and
how this data acquisition scheme performs in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
