Concepts and their mental associations influence how language is processed and used. Networks
represent powerful models for exploring such cognitive system, known as mental lexicon. This study
investigates lexicon robustness to progressive word failure with multiplex network attacks.
The average lexicon of an adult English speaker is built by considering 16000 words connected through
semantic free associations and phonological sound similarities. Progressive structural degradation
is modelled as random and targeted attacks. Words with higher psycholinguistic features (e.g.
frequency, length, age of acquisition, polysemy) or network centrality (e.g. closeness, PageRank,
betweenness and degree) are targeted first. Aphasia-inspired attacks are introduced here and
target first words named correctly, more or less frequently, by patients with anomic aphasia, a
pathology disrupting word finding. Robustness is measured as connectedness, fundamental for
activation spreading and lexical retrieval, and viability, a multi-layer connectivity identifying
language kernels. The lexicon is resilient to random, aphasia-inspired and psycholinguistic
attacks. Catastrophic phase transitions happen when phonological and semantic degrees are combined,
making the lexicon fragile to multidegree attacks. The viable kernel is fragile to multi-PageRank
and to aphasia-inspired attacks. Consequently, connectedness in the lexicon is mediated by hubs,
whereas viability enables a lexical semantic/phonological interplay and corresponds to a facilitative
naming effect in aphasia. These effects persist also through ageing, in different network representations
of younger and older lexicons. This study indicates the need to prevent failure of high multidegree
and viable words in the mental lexicon when pursuing the design of effective language restoration
strategies against cognitive impairing.
