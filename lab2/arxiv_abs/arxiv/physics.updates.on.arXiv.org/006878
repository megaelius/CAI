Tidal interactions between Planet and its satellites are known to be the main phenomena, which are
determining the orbital evolution of the satellites. We suggest in the current research to take
into consideration the additional well-known effect of differential rotation which obviously
takes place in the gaseous or fluid convection zone of primary giant Planet (indeed, the aforementioned
effect exists even not depending on the orbital evolution of satellites around host Planet). Nevertheless,
estimations for the contribution of the aforementioned effect of differential rotation in the
Uranus system (including all its most massive satellites) let us exclude using such effect from
calculations of mutual evolution of the eccentricity e along with the semi-major axis a for all satellites
of Uranus (Planet of ice-type). It means that the Uranus can be considered in the analytic exploration
of governing equations as to be the appropriate candidate for applying the modern ansatz [Efroimsky,
2015] (tidal dissipation effect depending on the tidal-flexure frequency) in regard to estimations
of eccentricity e along with semi-major axis a for satellites of Uranus. We can see from the results
of calculations in Section 3 that the combined system of governing equations (in the sense of combined
contributions to the tidal dissipation from Uranus + from satellite) yields the really observed
magnitudes of decelerations for semi-major axises of all the satellites of Uranus. Meanwhile,
internal heat generation effects in the satellites (due to tidal dissipation effect) are much more
than those which definitely take place in the Uranus, excepting the case of Ariel.
