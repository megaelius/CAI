An effective set of the Hartree-Fock (HF) equations are derived for electrons of the muonic systems,
i.e., molecules containing a positively charged muon, conceiving the muon as a quantum oscillator,
which are completely equivalent to the usual two-component HF equations used to derive stationary
states of the muonic molecules. In these effective equations, a non-Coulombic potential is added
to the orthodox coulomb and exchange potential energy terms, which describes the interaction of
the muon and the electrons effectively and is optimized during the self-consistent field cycles.
While in the two-component HF equations muon is treated as a quantum wave, in the effective HF equations
it is absorbed into the effective potential and practically transformed into an effective potential
field experienced by electrons. The explicit form of the effective potential depends on the nature
of muon vibrations and is derivable from the basis set used to expand the muonic spatial orbital.
The resulting effective Hartree-Fock equations are implemented computationally and used successfully,
as a proof of concept, in a series of the muonic molecules containing all atoms from the second and
third rows of the Periodic Table. To solve the algebraic version of the equations muon-specific
gaussian basis sets are designed for both muon and surrounding electrons and it is demonstrated
that the optimized exponents are quite distinct from those derived for the hydrogen isotopes. The
developed effective HF theory is quite general and in principle can be used for any muonic system
while it is the starting point for a general effective electronic structure theory that incorporates
various types of quantum correlations into the muonic systems beyond the HF equations.
