We present an approach to extend plasma transport theory into the Warm Dense Matter (WDM) regime
characterized by moderate Coulomb coupling and electron degeneracy. It is based on a recently proposed
closure of the BBGKY hierarchy that expands in terms of the departure of correlations from their
equilibrium value, rather than in terms of the strength of correlations. This kinetic equation
contains modifications to the collision term in addition to a second term that models the non-ideal
contributions to the equation of state. An explicit collision operator is derived in the semiclassical
limit that is similar to that of the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation, but where scattering is mediated
by the potential of mean force (PMF). As a demonstration, we use this collision integral to evaluate
temperature and momentum relaxation rates in dense plasmas. We obtain degeneracy- and coupling-dependent
'Coulomb integrals' that take the place of $\ln\Lambda$ in the scattering rates. We additionally
find a novel difference in the way in which degeneracy influences momentum relaxation in comparison
to temperature relaxation. Finally, we evaluate electron-ion relaxation rates for the case of
warm dense deuterium over a range of density and temperature spanning the classical to quantum and
weak to strong coupling transitions. Results are compared with the Landau-Spitzer rate and rates
obtained from the quantum Landau-Fokker-Planck equation and Lee-More model. We find that the models
diverge significantly in the degenerate and moderately coupled regime and attribute this difference
to how the various models treat the physics of Pauli blocking, correlations, large-angle scattering,
and diffraction.
