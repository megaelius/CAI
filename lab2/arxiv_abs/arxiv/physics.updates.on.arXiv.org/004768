Cyclopentadiene (CPD) is an important intermediate in the combustion of fuel and the formation
of aromatics. In the present study, the kinetics and thermodynamic properties for hydrogen abstraction
and addition with CPD, and the related reactions including the isomerization and decomposition
on the C5H7 potential energy surface were systematically investigated by theoretical calculations.
High-level ab initio calculations were adopted to obtain the stationary points on the potential
energy surfaces of CPD + H. Phenomenological rate coefficients for temperature- and pressure-dependent
reactions in the full potential energy surface were calculated by solving the time-dependent multiple-well
RRKM/master equation, and the hydrogen abstraction reactions were based on the conventional transition
state theory. In terms of the hydrogen abstraction reactions, the hydrogen abstraction from the
saturated carbon atom in CPD is found to be the dominant channel. For the hydrogen addition and the
associated reactions on the C5H7 PES, the allylic and vinylic cyclopentenyl radicals and C2H2 +
C3H5 were found to be the most important channels and reactivity-promoting products, respectively.
The previously neglected role of open-chain intermediates in the evaluation of the reaction kinetics
has been suggested and the corresponding rate constants have been recommended for inclusion in
the modeling of the H+ c-C5H6 reaction. Results indicate that the transformation from to straight-chain
C5H7 is kinetically unfavorable due to the high strain energy of the 3-membered ring structure of
the isomerization transition state. Moreover, the thermodynamic data and the calculated rate
coefficients for both H atom abstraction and addition were incorporated into the kinetics model
to examine the impact of the computed pressure-dependent kinetics of C5H6 + H reactions on model
predictions.
