Classical intermolecular potentials typically require an extensive parametrization procedure
for any new compound considered. To do away with prior parametrization, we propose a combination
of physics-based potentials with machine learning (ML), coined IPML, which is transferable across
small neutral organic and biologically-relevant molecules. ML models provide on-the-fly predictions
for environment-dependent local atomic properties: electrostatic multipole coefficients (significant
error reduction compared to previously reported), the population and decay rate of valence atomic
densities, and polarizabilities across conformations and chemical compositions of H, C, N, and
O atoms. These parameters enable accurate calculations of intermolecular contributions---electrostatics,
charge penetration, repulsion, induction/polarization, and many-body dispersion. Unlike other
potentials, this model is transferable in its ability to handle new molecules and conformations
without explicit prior parametrization: All local atomic properties are predicted from ML, leaving
only eight global parameters---optimized once and for all across compounds. We validate IPML on
various gas-phase dimers at and away from equilibrium separation, where we obtain mean absolute
errors between 0.4 and 0.7 kcal/mol for several chemically and conformationally diverse datasets
representative of non-covalent interactions in biologically-relevant molecules. We further
focus on hydrogen-bonded complexes---essential but challenging due to their directional nature---where
datasets of DNA base pairs and amino acids yield an extremely encouraging 1.4 kcal/mol error. Finally,
and as a first look, we consider IPML in denser systems: water clusters, supramolecular host-guest
complexes, and the benzene crystal.
