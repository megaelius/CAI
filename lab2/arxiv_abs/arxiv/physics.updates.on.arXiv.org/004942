For years, solution processing has provided a versatile platform to extend the applications of
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) beyond those achievable with traditional preparation
methods. However, existing solution-based synthesis and exfoliation approaches are not compatible
with complex geometries, particularly when interfacial control is desired. As a result, promising
TMD structures, including MoS2/WS2 heterostructures, are barred from the rich assembly and modification
opportunities possible with solution preparation. Here, we introduce a strategy that combines
traditional vapor phase deposition and solution chemistry to build TMD core-shell heterostructures
housed in aqueous media. We report the first synthesized TMD core-shell heterostructure, Au@MoS2@WS2,
with an Au nanoparticle core and MoS2 and WS2 shells, and provide a means of suspending the structure
in solution to allow for higher order patterning and ligand-based functionalization. High-resolution
electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy provide detailed analysis of the structure and interfaces
of the core-shell heterostructures. UV-vis, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential measurements
exhibit the outstanding natural stability and monodispersity of Au@MoS2@WS2 in solution. As a
proof of concept, the aqueous environment is utilized to both functionalize the core-shell heterostructures
with electrostatic ligands and pattern them into desired configurations on a target substrate.
This work harnesses the advantages of vapor phase preparation of nanomaterials and the functionality
possible with aqueous suspension to expand future engineering and application opportunities
of TMD heterostructures.
