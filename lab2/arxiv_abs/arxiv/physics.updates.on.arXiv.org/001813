As the first decentralized digital currency introduced in 2009 together with the blockchain, Bitcoin
offers new opportunities both for developed and developing countries. Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions
are independent of the banking system, thus facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction
fees such as remittances, with a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities together with other
key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and made its price skyrocket during 2017.
However, while the Bitcoin blockchain attracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate
where this attention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and consequently to
appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to characterize the adoption of the bitcoin
blockchain by country. In the first part of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin
software client downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and the Internet
searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the system evolution in different
countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for user adoption, we identified several socio-economic
indexes such as the GDP per capita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables
correlated with the degree of user adoption. In the second part of the work, we build a network of Bitcoin
transactions between countries using the IP addresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop
an augmented version of the gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked
to the flow of bitcoins between countries. In a nutshell our study provides a new insight on the bitcoin
adoption by country and on the potential socio-economic drivers of the international bitcoin flow.
