A gyrokinetic model is presented that can properly describe strong flows, large and small amplitude
electromagnetic fluctuations occurring on scale lengths ranging from the electron Larmor radius
to the equilibrium perpendicular pressure gradient scale length, and large deviations from thermal
equilibrium. The formulation of the gyrokinetic model is based on a second order description of
the single charged particle dynamics, derived from Lie perturbation theory, where the fast particle
gyromotion is decoupled from the slow drifts, assuming that the ratio of the ion sound Larmor radius
to the perpendicular equilibrium pressure scale length is small. The collective behavior of the
plasma is obtained by a gyrokinetic Boltzmann equation that describes the evolution of the gyroaveraged
distribution function and includes a non-linear gyrokinetic Dougherty collision operator. The
gyrokinetic model is then developed into a set of coupled fluid equations referred to as the gyrokinetic
moment hierarchy. To obtain this hierarchy, the gyroaveraged distribution function is expanded
onto a velocity-space Hermite-Laguerre polynomial basis and the gyrokinetic equation is projected
onto the same basis, obtaining the spatial and temporal evolution of the Hermite-Laguerre expansion
coefficients. The Hermite-Laguerre projection is performed accurately at arbitrary perpendicular
wavenumber values. Finally, the self-consistent evolution of the electromagnetic fields is described
by a set of gyrokinetic Maxwell's equations derived from a variational principle, with the velocity
integrals of the gyroaveraged distribution function explicitly evaluated.
