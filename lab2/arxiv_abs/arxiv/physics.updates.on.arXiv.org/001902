The problem of astrometry is revisited from the perspective of analyzing the attainability of well-known
performance limits (the Cramer-Rao bound) for the estimation of the relative position of light-emitting
(usually point-like) sources on a CCD-like detector using commonly adopted estimators such as
the weighted least squares and the maximum likelihood. Novel technical results are presented to
determine the performance of an estimator that corresponds to the solution of an optimization problem
in the context of astrometry. Using these results we are able to place stringent bounds on the bias
and the variance of the estimators in close form as a function of the data. We confirm these results
through comparisons to numerical simulations under a broad range of realistic observing conditions.
The maximum likelihood and the weighted least square estimators are analyzed. We confirm the sub-optimality
of the weighted least squares scheme from medium to high signal-to-noise found in an earlier study
for the (unweighted) least squares method. We find that the maximum likelihood estimator achieves
optimal performance limits across a wide range of relevant observational conditions. Furthermore,
from our results, we provide concrete insights for adopting an adaptive weighted least square estimator
that can be regarded as a computationally efficient alternative to the optimal maximum likelihood
solution. We provide, for the first time, close-form analytical expressions that bound the bias
and the variance of the weighted least square and maximum likelihood implicit estimators for astrometry
using a Poisson-driven detector. These expressions can be used to formally assess the precision
attainable by these estimators in comparison with the minimum variance bound.
