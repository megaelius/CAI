Ammonia (NH3) is mainly produced through the traditional Haber-Bosch process under harsh conditions
with huge energy consumption and massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. The nitrogen electroreduction
reaction (NERR), as an energy-efficient and environment-friendly process of converting nitrogen
(N2) to NH3 under ambient conditions, has been regarded as a promising alternative to the Haber-Bosch
process and has received enormous interest in recent years. Although some exciting progress has
been made, considerable scientific and technical challenges still exist in improving the NH3 yield
rate and Faradic efficiency, understanding the mechanism of the reaction and promoting the wide
commercialization of NERR. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as promising catalysts
because of its atomically dispersed activity sites and maximized atom efficiency, unsaturated
coordination environment, and its unique electronic structure, which could significantly improve
the rate of reaction and yield rate of NH3. In this review we briefly introduce the unique structural
and electronic features of SACs, which contributes to comprehensively understand the reaction
mechanism owing to their structural simplicity and diversity, and in turn expedite the rational
design of fantastic catalysts at the atomic scale. Then, we summarize the most recent experimental
and computational efforts on developing novel SACs with excellent NERR performance, including
precious metal-, nonprecious metal- and nonmetal-based SACs. Finally, we present challenges
and perspectives of SACs on NERR, as well as some potential means for advanced NERR catalyst.
