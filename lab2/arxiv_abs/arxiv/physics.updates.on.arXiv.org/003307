The use of Thin-foil proton recoil (TPR) spectrometers to measure neutrons from Deuterium-Tritium
(DT) fusion plasma has been studied previously and is a well established technique for neutron spectrometry.
The study presented here focuses on the optimisation of the TPR spectrometer configurations consisting
of dE and E silicon detectors. In addition an investigation of the spectrometer's ability to determine
fuel ion temperature and fuel ion density ratio in ITER like DT plasmas has been performed. A Python
code was developed for the purpose of calculating detection efficiency and energy resolution as
a function of several spectrometer geometrical parameters. An optimisation of detection efficiency
for selected values of resolution was performed regarding the geometrical spectrometer parameters
foil thickness, distance from a foil to the first detector and distance between the two detectors
using a multi-objective optimisation, a.k.a Pareto plot analysis. Moreover, the influence of
detector segmentation on spectrometer energy resolution and efficiency was investigated. The
code also produced response functions for the two selected spectrometer configurations. The SPEC
code was used to simulate the spectrometer's performance in determining the fuel ion temperature
and fuel ion density ratio n_t/n_d. The results presented include the selected spectrometer configuration
with calculated energy resolution and efficiency. For a selected spectrometer resolution of 5%
a maximum efficiency of around 0.003% was achieved. Moreover, the detector segmentation allows
for a 20% increase in spectrometer efficiency for an energy resolution of 4.3%. The ITER requirements
for a 20% accuracy on the n_t/n_d ratio determination and 10% on the temperature determination within
a 100ms sampling window can be achieved using a combination of several TPR's of same type, in order
to boost efficiency.
