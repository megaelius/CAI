X-ray calorimeters routinely achieve very high spectral resolution, typically a few eV full width
at half maximum (FWHM). Measurements of calorimeter line shapes are usually dominated by the natural
linewidth of most laboratory calibration sources. This compounds the data acquisition time necessary
to statistically sample the instrumental line broadening, and can add systematic uncertainty
if the intrinsic line shape of the source is not well known. To address these issues, we have built
a simple, compact monochromatic x-ray source using channel cut crystals. A commercial x-ray tube
illuminates a pair of channel cut crystals which are aligned in a dispersive configuration to select
the \kaone line of the x-ray tube anode material. The entire device, including x-ray tube, can be
easily hand carried by one person and may be positioned manually or using a mechanical translation
stage. The output monochromatic beam provides a collimated image of the anode spot with magnification
of unity in the dispersion direction (typically 100-200 $\mu$m for the x-ray tubes used here), and
is unfocused in the cross-dispersion direction, so that the source image in the detector plane appears
as a line. We measured output count rates as high as 10 count/s/pixel for the Hitomi Soft X-ray Spectrometer,
which had 819 $\mu$m square pixels. We implemented different monochromator designs for energies
of 5.4 keV (one design) and 8.0 keV (two designs) which have effective theoretical FWHM energy resolution
of 0.125, 0.197, and 0.086 eV, respectively; these are well-suited for optimal calibration measurements
of state-of-the art x-ray calorimeters. We measured an upper limit for the energy resolution of
our \crkaone monochromator of 0.7 eV FWHM at 5.4 keV, consistent with the theoretical prediction
of 0.125 eV.
