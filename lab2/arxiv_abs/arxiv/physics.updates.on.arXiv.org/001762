The spectrum of oscillation modes of a star provides information not only about its material properties
(e.g. mean density), but also its symmetries. Spherical symmetry can be broken by rotation and/or
magnetic fields. It has been postulated that strong magnetic fields in the cores of some red giants
are responsible for their anomalously weak dipole mode amplitudes (the "dipole dichotomy" problem),
but a detailed understanding of how gravity waves interact with strong fields is thus far lacking.
In this work, we attack the problem through a variety of analytical and numerical techniques, applied
to a localised region centred on a null line of a confined axisymmetric magnetic field which is approximated
as being cylindrically symmetric. We uncover a rich variety of phenomena that manifest when the
field strength exceeds a critical value, beyond which the symmetry is drastically broken by the
Lorentz force. When this threshold is reached, the spatial structure of the g-modes becomes heavily
altered. The dynamics of wave packet propagation transitions from regular to chaotic, which is
expected to fundamentally change the organisation of the mode spectrum. In addition, depending
on their frequency and the orientation of field lines with respect to the stratification, waves
impinging on different parts of the magnetised region are found to undergo either reflection or
trapping. Trapping regions provide an avenue for energy loss through Alfven wave phase mixing.
Our results may find application in various astrophysical contexts, including the dipole dichotomy
problem, the solar interior, and compact star oscillations.
