Non-standard representation for so-called "cold curve" of matter (i.e. isotherm $T = 0$) is proposed
as Global Cold Curve (GCC). The main point is that chemical potential of substance, $\mu$, plays
role of ruling parameter in basic GCC-dependence of internal energy under compression, $U = U(\mu)$,
in contrast to the standard form $U = U(\rho)$. This substitution changes radically low-density
("gaseous") part of GCC. Namely: ($i$) - physically meaningless part of standard cold curve $(U(\rho)$
at $T \rightarrow 0)$ disappears totally from new version of GCC. This deleted part corresponded
to absolutely thermodynamically unstable states in standard representation $U(\rho)$; ($ii$)
- new gaseous branch of cold curve, $U = U(\mu)$, comes in GCC. It describes in simple, schematic way
thermodynamics of whole gas-like plasma in low-temperature limit (Iosilevskiy: arXiv:0902.3708
) as combination of all ionization and dissociation processes available for equilibrium plasma
at finite temperature. This gaseous branch corresponds to thermodynamically stable and metastable
states only. The only quantities that display themselves as meaningful details of new gaseous zero-temperature
isotherm are combination of binding energies for all complexes (atomic, molecular and ionic) in
their ground states, together with sublimation energy of gas-crystal phase transition ("energy
scale" of material). Gaseous branch of GCC conjugate naturally with corresponding branch (cold
curve) of condensed phase. New GCC form, $U = U(\mu)$, no more contains meaningless part of traditional
form $U(\rho)$ between gaseous and crystalline spinodals. The simple schematic structure ("ionization
stairs"), which is typical for new form of cold curve in ultra-low densities, appears again as "composition
stairs" in ultra-high densities in typical conditions of interiors in compact stars (P.Haensel
et al.)
