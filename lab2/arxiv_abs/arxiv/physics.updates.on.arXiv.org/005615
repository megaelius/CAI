The theory of lithopanspermia proposes the natural exchange of organisms inside meteorites between
solar system bodies. Its focus has been on 3 distinct stages: planetary ejection, interplanetary
transit and planetary entry. It is debated whether organisms transported within the ejecta can
survive all 3 stages. If the conjecture is granted however, that life can indeed be safely transmitted
from one world to another, then it is not only a planetary science question, but a biological question
as well. Hence, these stages are only the first 3 factors in the equation. The other factors for a successful
lithopanspermia are the quality, quantity and evolutionary strategy of the transmitted organisms
in question. Here, the main focus will be on the last factor, the evolutionary strategy. When expanding
into new environments, invading organisms often do not survive in the first attempt. It usually
takes several attempts through propagule pressure before they obtains a foothold. There is a crucial
difference between this terrestrial situation and the one brought about by lithopanspermia. While
in the case of invasive species on Earth, species member after member arrives into the new habitat,
a species pragmatically only arrives once onto another solar system body. Thus, an all or nothing
response will be in effect, the species must survive in the first attempt, which restricts the probability
of survival.Furthermore, evolution sets a boundary through the existence of an inverse proportionality
between the exchanges of life between two worlds. Thus, there are many different types of habitable
environments on a donator world from which an impactor can eject a sample of life. There is, however,
only one type of habitable environment on an acceptor world to which this sample of life can be deposited
upon entry, thus restricting the probability of survival.
