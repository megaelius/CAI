The goal of the present study is to develop polymeric matrix films loaded with a combination of free
diclofenac sodium (DFSfree) and DFS:Ion exchange resin complexes (DFS:IR) for immediate and sustained
release profiles, respectively. Effect of ratio of DFS and IR on the DFS:IR complexation efficiency
was studied using batch processing. DFS:IR complex, DFSfree, or a combination of DFSfree+DFS:IR
loaded matrix films were prepared by melt-cast technology. DFS content was 20% w/w in these matrix
films. In vitro transcorneal permeability from the film formulations were compared against DFS
solution, using a side-by-side diffusion apparatus, over a 6 h period. Ocular disposition of DFS
from the solution, films and corresponding suspensions were evaluated in conscious New Zealand
albino rabbits, 4 h and 8 h post-topical administration. All in vivo studies were carried out as per
the University of Mississippi IACUC approved protocol. Complexation efficiency of DFS:IR was
found to be 99% with a 1:1 ratio of DFS:IR. DFS release from DFS:IR suspension and the film were best-fit
to a Higuchi model. In vitro transcorneal flux with the DFSfree+DFS:IR(1:1)(1 + 1) was twice that
of only DFS:IR(1:1) film. In vivo, DFS solution and DFS:IR(1:1) suspension formulations were not
able to maintain therapeutic DFS levels in the aqueous humor (AH). Both DFSfree and DFSfree+DFS:IR(1:1)(3
+ 1) loaded matrix films were able to achieve and maintain high DFS concentrations in the AH, but elimination
of DFS from the ocular tissues was much faster with the DFSfree formulation. DFSfree+DFS:IR combination
loaded matrix films were able to deliver and maintain therapeutic DFS concentrations in the anterior
ocular chamber for up to 8 h. Thus, free drug/IR complex loaded matrix films could be a potential topical
ocular delivery platform for achieving immediate and sustained release characteristics.
