Scope of the present work is to frame into a rigorous, quantitative scaffold - stemmed from stochastic
process theory - two sets of experiments designed to infer the spontaneous organization of leukocytes
against cancer cells, namely mice splenocytes vs. B16 mouse tumor cells, and embedded in an "ad hoc"
microfluidic environment developed on a LabOnChip technology. In the former, splenocytes from
knocked out (KO) mice engineered to silence the transcription factor IRF-8, crucial for the development
and function of several immune populations, were used. In this case lymphocytes and cancer cells
exhibited a poor reciprocal exchange, resulting in the inability of coordinating or mounting an
effective immune response against melanoma. In the second class of tests, wild type (WT) splenocytes
were able to interact with and to coordinate a response against the tumor cells through physical
interaction. The environment where cells moved was built of by two different chambers, containing
respectively melanoma cells and splenocytes, connected by capillary migration channels allowing
leucocytes to migrate from their chamber toward the melanoma one. We collected and analyzed data
on the motility of the cells and found that the first ensemble of IRF-8 KO cells performed pure uncorrelated
random walks, while WT splenocytes were able to make singular drifted random walks, that, averaged
over the ensemble of cells, collapsed on a straight ballistic motion for the system as a whole. At
a finer level of investigation, we found that IRF-8 KO splenocytes moved rather uniformly since
their step lengths were exponentially distributed, while WT counterpart displayed a qualitatively
broader motion as their step lengths along the direction of the melanoma were log-normally distributed.
