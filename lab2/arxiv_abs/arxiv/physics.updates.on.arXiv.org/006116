In order to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on people's lives, activities and the natural environment,
this paper investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of Night Time Light (NTL) radiance
and Air Quality Index (AQI) before and during the pandemic in mainland China. Our results show that
the monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than before. This
study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area, transportation and public facilities
and commercial centers, with NTL radiance ranges of 5-20, 20-40 and greater than 40 nW/(cm*cm*sr),
respectively. We found that the Number Of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential
area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after the shutdown, while
transportation and public facilities generally stayed the same. More specifically, we examined
these factors in Wuhan, where the first confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine
measures were taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers were
observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior, while residential area
pixels recorded increased levels of brightness, after the beginning of the lockdown. The study
also discovered a significant decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for the whole country, with
cleaner air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020. In conclusion,
the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has had a crucial impact on people's daily lives and activity
ranges through the increased implementation of lockdown and quarantine policies. On the other
hand, the air quality of China has improved with the reduction of non-essential industries and motor
vehicle usage.
