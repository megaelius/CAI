Cable subsystems characterized by one or more extremely long, slender and flexible structural
elements are featured in numerous engineering systems including parachutes, suspension bridges,
marine drilling risers, and aerial refueling equipment. In each one of these systems, interaction
between the cable and its surrounding fluid is inevitable. However, the nature and consequences
of such Fluid-Structure Interactions (FSI) have received relatively little attention in the computational
mechanics open literature. This work proposes an embedded boundary approach for simulating the
FSI of cable subsystems, in which the dynamics of the solid cable is captured by a discretization
of the cable centerline using conventional beam elements which are typically available in commercial
and open source finite element structural codes, while the geometry of the cable is represented
within the fluid domain using a discrete -- for instance, triangulated -- embedded surface. The
proposed approach is built on: master/slave kinematics between beam elements~(master) and the
embedded surface~(slave); a highly accurate algorithm for computing the embedded surface displacement
based on the beam displacement; and an energy-conserving method for transferring distributed
forces and moments acting on the nodes of the discrete surface to the beam elements. Hence, both the
flow-induced forces on the cable and the effect of the structural dynamic response of the cable on
the nearby flow are taken into account. Moreover, the proposed model can be readily incorporated
into the Eulerian computational framework, which enables handling of the large deformations of
the cable subsystem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a model aerial
refueling system and a challenging supersonic parachute inflation problem.
