1D climate models are less sophisticated than 3D global circulation models (GCMs), however their
computational time is much less expensive, allowing a large number of runs in a short period of time
to explore a wide parameter space. Exploring parameter space is particularly important for predicting
the observable properties of exoplanets, for which few parameters are known with certainty. Therefore,
1D climate models are still very useful tools for planetary studies. In most of these 1D models, clouds
are not physically represented in the atmosphere, despite having a well-known, significant impact
on a planetary radiative budget. This impact is simulated by artificially raising surface albedo,
in order to reproduce the observed-averaged surface temperature (i.e. 288 K for modern Earth) and
a radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere. This non-physical representation of clouds, causes
atmospheric longwave and shortwaves fluxes to not match observational data. Additionally, this
technique represents a parameter that is highly-tuned to modern Earth's climate, and may not be
appropriate for planets that deviate from modern Earth's climate conditions. In this paper, we
present an update to the climate model within the Atmos 1D atmospheric modeling package with a physical
representation of clouds. We show that this physical representation of clouds in the atmosphere
allows both longwave and shortwave fluxes to match observational data. This improvement will allow
us to study the energy fluxes for a variety of cloudy rocky planets, and increase our confidence in
future simulations of temperature profile and net energy balance.
