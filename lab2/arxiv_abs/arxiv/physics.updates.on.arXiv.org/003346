The stability of a thin liquid film bounded by two free surfaces is examined in the presence of insoluble
surface active agents. The surface active agents not only cause gradients in surface tension, but
could also render surface viscosity to be significant, and variable, as a function of their concentration.
A set of three coupled nonlinear evolution equations are derived for the film height, concentration
of surface active agents, and the horizontal liquid velocity which governs the dynamics of the free
film. Suitable phenomenological models for variation of surface tension and surface viscosity
with the concentration of surface active agents are incorporated in the interfacial stress boundary
condition. Linear stability analysis reveals the effect of various non-dimensional parameters,
specifically the retarding nature of surface viscosity and Marangoni effects on film rupture.
An analysis of the `jamming' limit of surfactant concentration reveals that $\Gamma_0^{(nl)}<3
\mathbb{D}/M$ is a sufficient criteria for instability of the system, where $\Gamma_0^{(nl)}$
is a normalized initial surface particle concentration, $\mathbb{D}$ is the disjoining pressure
number and $\textit{M}$ is the Marangoni number. Nonlinear simulations suggest film profiles
at rupture are also qualitatively different from those reported in earlier studies, revealing
that free films in the jamming limit are remarkably stable and their free surfaces behave like immobile
interfaces. Furthermore, self-similar exponents extracted from our nonlinear simulations are
used to explain topological differences between zero and constant surface viscosity in the vicinity
of rupture.
