We present a three-dimensional (3D) partitioned aeroelastic formulation for a flexible multibody
system interacting with incompressible turbulent fluid flow. While the incompressible Navier-Stokes
system is discretized using a stabilized Petrov-Galerkin procedure, the multibody structural
system consists of a generic interaction of multiple components such as rigid body, beams and flexible
thin shells along with various types of joints and connections among them. A co-rotational framework
is utilized for the category of small strain problems where the displacement of the body is decomposed
into a rigid body rotation and a small strain component. This assumption simplifies the structural
equations and allows for the incorporation of multiple bodies (rigid as well as flexible) in the
system. The displacement and rotation constraints at the joints are imposed by a Lagrange multiplier
method. The equilibrium conditions at the fluid-structure interface are satisfied by the transfer
of tractions and structural displacements via the radial basis function approach, which is globally
conservative. For the coupled stability in low structure-to-fluid mass ratio regimes, a nonlinear
iterative force correction scheme is employed in the partitioned staggered predictor-corrector
scheme. The convergence and generality of the radial basis function mapping are analyzed by carrying
out systematic error analysis of the transfer of fluid traction across the non-matching fluid-structure
interface where a third-order of convergence is observed. The proposed aeroelastic framework
is then validated by considering a flow across a flexible pitching plate configuration with serration
at the trailing edge. Finally, we demonstrate the flow across a flexible flapping wing of a bat modeling
the bone fingers as beams and the flexible membrane as thin shells in the multibody system along with
the joints.
