Numerical modeling of fluid flows based on kinetic equations provides an alternative approach
for the description of complex flows simulations, and a number of kinetic methods have been developed
from different points of view. A particular challenge for kinetic methods is whether they can capture
the correct hydrodynamic behavior of the system in the continuum limit without enforcing kinetic
scale resolution. At the current stage, asymptotic preserving (AP) kinetic methods, which keep
the same algorithm in different flow regimes, have been constructed. However, the detailed asymptotic
properties of these kinetic schemes are indistinguishable under the AP framework. In order to distinguish
different characteristics of AP schemes, in this paper we will introduce the concept of unified
preserving (UP) which can be used to assess the real governing equations solved in the asymptotic
process. Unlike the general analysis of AP property in the hydrodynamic scale, the current UP analysis
is able to find the asymptotic degree of the scheme employing the modified equation approach. Generally,
the UP properties of a kinetic scheme depend on the spatial/temporal accuracy and closely on the
inter-connections among the three scales (kinetic scale, numerical scale, and hydrodynamic scale),
and the concept of UP attempts to distinguish those scales with clear orders. Specifically, the
numerical resolution and specific discretization determine the numerical flow behaviors of the
scheme in different regimes, especially in the near continuum limit with a large variation of the
above three scales. The UP analysis will be used in the Discrete Unified Gas-kinetic Scheme (DUGKS)
to evaluate its underlying governing equations in the continuum limit in terms of the kinetic, numerical,
and hydrodynamic scales.
