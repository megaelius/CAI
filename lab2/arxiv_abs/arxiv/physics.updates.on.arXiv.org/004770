Background: Identifying seizure activities in non-stationary electroencephalography (EEG)
is a challenging task, since it is time-consuming, burdensome, and dependent on expensive human
resources and subject to error and bias. A computerized seizure identification scheme can eradicate
the above problems, assist clinicians and benefit epilepsy research. So far, several attempts
were made to develop automatic systems to help neurophysiologists accurately identify epileptic
seizures. New Method: In this research, a fully automated system is presented to automatically
detect the various states of the epileptic seizure. The proposed method is based on sparse representation-based
classification (SRC) theory and dictionary learning using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.
Furthermore, the proposed method does not require additional preprocessing and extraction of
features which is common in the existing methods. Results: The proposed method reached the sensitivity,
specificity and accuracy of 100% in 8 out of 9 scenarios. It is also robust to the measurement noise
of level as much as 0 dB. Comparison with Existing Methods: Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms,
the proposed method outperformed them in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Moreover,
it includes the most comprehensive scenarios for epileptic seizure detection, including different
combinations of 2 to 5 class scenarios. Conclusion: The proposed automatic identification of epileptic
seizures method can reduce the burden on medical professionals in analyzing large data through
visual inspection as well as in deprived societies suffering from a shortage of functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) equipment and specialized physician.
