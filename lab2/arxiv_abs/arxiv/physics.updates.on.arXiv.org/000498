Yeast cells grown in culture can spontaneously synchronize their respiration, metabolism, gene
expression and cell division. Such metabolic oscillations in synchronized cultures reflect single-cell
oscillations, but the relationship between the oscillations in single cells and synchronized
cultures is poorly understood. To understand this relationship and the coordination between metabolism
and cell division, we collected and analyzed DNA-content, gene-expression and physiological
data, at hundreds of time-points, from cultures metabolically-synchronized at different growth
rates, carbon sources and biomass densities. The data enabled us to extend and generalize an ensemble-average-over-phases
(EAP) model that connects the population-average gene-expression of asynchronous cultures to
the gene-expression dynamics in the single-cells comprising the cultures. The extended model
explains the carbon-source specific growth-rate responses of hundreds of genes. Our data demonstrate
that for a given growth rate, the frequency of metabolic cycling in synchronized cultures increases
with the biomass density. This observation underscores the difference between metabolic cycling
in synchronized cultures and in single cells and suggests entraining of the single-cell cycle by
a quorum-sensing mechanism. Constant levels of residual glucose during the metabolic cycling
of synchronized cultures indicate that storage carbohydrates are required to fuel not only the
G1/S transition of the division cycle but also the metabolic cycle. Despite the large variation
in profiled conditions and in the time-scale of their dynamics, most genes preserve invariant dynamics
of coordination with each other and with the rate of oxygen consumption. Similarly, the G1/S transition
always occurs at the beginning, middle or end of the high oxygen consumption phases, analogous to
observations in human and drosophila cells.
