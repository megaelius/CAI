Hybrid perovskites have received tremendous attention due to their exceptional photovoltaic
and optoelectronic properties. Among the two widely used perovskite solar cell device architectures
of n-ip and p-i-n, the latter is interesting in terms of its simplicity of fabrication and lower energy
input. However this structure mostly uses PEDOT:PSS as a hole transporting layer which can accelerate
the perovskite solar cell degradation. Hence the development of stable, inorganic hole extraction
layers (HEL), without compromising the simplicity of device fabrication is crucial in this fast-growing
photovoltaic field. Here we demonstrate a low temperature (~100 oC) solution - processed and ultrathin
(~ 6 nm) NiO nanoparticle thin films as an efficient HEL for CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells.
We measure a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3 % on rigid glass substrates and 8.5 % on flexible
substrates. A comparison with PEDOT:PSS based MAPbI3 solar cells (PCE ~ 7.9 %) shows that NiO based
solar cells have higher short circuit current density and improved open circuit voltage (1.03V).
Apart from the photovoltaic performance under 1 Sun, the efficient hole extraction property of
NiO is demonstrated for indoor lighting as well with a PCE of 23.0 % for NiO based CH3NH3PbI2.9Cl0.1
p-i-n solar cells under compact fluorescent lighting. Compared to the perovskite solar cells fabricated
on PEDOT:PSS HEL, better shelf-life stability is observed for perovskite solar cells fabricated
on NiO HEL. Detailed microstructural and photophysical investigations imply uniform morphology,
lower recombination losses, and improved charge transfer properties for CH3NH3PbI3 grown on NiO
HEL.
