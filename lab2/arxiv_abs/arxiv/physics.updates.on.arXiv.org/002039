We study theoretically and numerically the coupling and rotational hydrodynamic interactions
between spherical particles near a planar elastic membrane that exhibits resistance towards shear
and bending. Using a combination of the multipole expansion and Faxen's theorems, we express the
frequency-dependent hydrodynamic mobility functions as a power series of the ratio of the particle
radius to the distance from the membrane for the self mobilities, and as a power series of the ratio
of the radius to the interparticle distance for the pair mobilities. In the quasi-steady limit of
zero frequency, we find that the shear- and bending-related contributions to the particle mobilities
may have additive or suppressive effects depending on the membrane properties in addition to the
geometric configuration of the interacting particles relative to the confining membrane. To elucidate
the effect and role of the change of sign observed in the particle self and pair mobilities, we consider
an example involving a torque-free doublet of counterrotating particles near an elastic membrane.
We find that the induced rotation rate of the doublet around its center of mass may differ in magnitude
and direction depending on the membrane shear and bending properties. Near a membrane of only energetic
resistance toward shear deformation, such as that of a certain type of elastic capsules, the doublet
undergoes rotation of the same sense as observed near a no-slip wall. Near a membrane of only energetic
resistance toward bending, such as that of a fluid vesicle, we find a reversed sense of rotation.
Our analytical predictions are supplemented and compared with fully resolved boundary integral
simulations where a very good agreement is obtained over the whole range of applied frequencies.
