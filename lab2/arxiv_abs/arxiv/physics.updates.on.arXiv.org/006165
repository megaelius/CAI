As lockdowns and stay-at-home orders start to be lifted across the globe, governments are struggling
to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies. In dense urban environments
with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity, enforcing strict
social distancing measures will be extremely challenging, if not practically impossible. Governments
are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease
spreading. Indeed, certain places, like some people, can be "super-spreaders." Is a bustling train
station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming
bus interchanges in the suburbs? Here, we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify
spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept of super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places
most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it. Our proposed data-analytic
framework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport in Singapore. By
constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity
with two neighborhood diversity metrics, we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible
locations. Our results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that
counterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central
train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore, but can be readily adapted and extended
for any other major urban center. It therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted
and cost-effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness.
