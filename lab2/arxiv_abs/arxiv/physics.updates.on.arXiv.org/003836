We consider plasmonic metasurfaces constituted by an arbitrary periodic arrangement of spherical
metallic nanoparticles. Each nanoparticle supports three degenerate dipolar localized surface
plasmon (LSP) resonances. In the regime where the interparticle distance is much smaller than the
optical or near-infrared wavelength associated with the LSPs, the latter couple through the dipole-dipole
interaction and form collective plasmonic modes which extend over the whole metasurface. Within
a Hamiltonian model which we solve exactly, we derive general expressions which enable us to extract
analytically the quasistatic plasmonic dispersion for collective modes polarized within the
plane and perpendicular to the plane of the metasurface. Importantly, our approach allows us not
only to consider arbitrary Bravais lattices, but also non-Bravais two-dimensional metacrystals
featuring nontrivial topological properties, such as, e.g., the honeycomb, Lieb, or kagome lattices.
Additionally, using an open quantum system approach, we consider perturbatively the coupling
of the collective plasmons to both photonic and particle-hole environments, which lead, respectively,
to radiative and nonradiative frequency shifts and damping rates, for which we provide analytical
expressions. While it is tempting to make a direct analogy between the various systems which we consider
and their electronic tight-binding equivalents, we critically examine how the long-range retarded
and anisotropic nature of the dipole-dipole interaction may quantitatively and qualitatively
modify the underlying band structures and discuss their experimental observability.
