By this we extend our work of the year 1992 devoted to calculating the intrashell excitations in the
d-shells of coordination compounds of the first transition metal row, which resulted in the Effective
Hamiltonian Crystal Field (EHCF) method, to their polinuclear analogs in order to assure the description
of several open d-shells and of magnetic interactions of the effective spins residing in these shells.
This is a challenging task since it requires improving the precision of ca. 1000 cm$^{-1}$ (that
of describing the excitation energies of the single d-shells by the already well successful EHCF
method) to the that of ca. 10 $\div$ 100 cm$^{-1}$ characteristic for the energies required to reorient
the spins i.e. eventually by two orders of magnitude. This is performed within the same paradigm
as used for the EHCF method: the concerted usage of the McWeeny's group-function approximation
and the L\"owdin partition technique. These are applied to develop the effective description of
the d-system of the polynuclear complexes, composed of several d-shells, including the working
formulae for the exchange parameters between the d-shells belonging to different transition metal
ions. These formulae are implemented in the package kramers and tested against a series of binuclear
complexes of trivalent Cr and Fe cations featuring $\mu$-oxygen superexchange paths in order to
confirm the reproducibility of the trends in the series of values of exchange parameters for the
compounds differing by the chemical substitutions and other details of composition and structure.
The results of calculations are in a reasonable agreement with available experimental data and
other theoretical methods.
