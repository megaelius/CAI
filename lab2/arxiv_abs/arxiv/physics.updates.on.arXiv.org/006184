Composites are ideally suited to achieve desirable multifunctional effective properties since
the best properties of different materials can be judiciously combined with designed microstructures.
Here we establish cross-property relations for two-phase composite media that link effective
elastic and electromagnetic wave characteristics to one another, including the respective effective
wave speeds and attenuation coefficients, which facilitate multifunctional material design.
This is achieved by deriving accurate formulas for the effective electromagnetic and elastodynamic
properties that depend on the wavelengths of the incident waves and the microstructure via the spectral
density. Our formulas enable us to explore the wave characteristics of a broad class of disordered
microstructures because they apply, unlike conventional formulas, for a wide range of incident
wavelengths, i.e., well beyond the long-wavelength regime. This capability enables us to study
the dynamic properties of exotic disordered ``hyperuniform'' composites that can have advantages
over crystalline ones, such as nearly optimal, direction-independent properties and robustness
against defects. We specifically show that disordered ``stealthy'' hyperuniform microstructures
exhibit novel wave characteristics, e.g., low-pass filters that transmit waves ``isotropically''
up to a finite wavenumber. Our cross-property relations for the effective wave characteristics
can be applied to design multifunctional composites via inverse techniques. Design examples include
structural components that require high stiffness and electromagnetic absorption, heat-sinks
for CPUs, and sound-absorbing housings for motors that have to efficiently emit thermal radiation
and suppress mechanical vibrations, and nondestructive evaluation of the elastic moduli of materials
from the effective dielectric response.
