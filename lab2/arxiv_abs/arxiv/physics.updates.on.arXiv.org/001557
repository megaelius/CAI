In the Leidenfrost effect, a thin layer of evaporated vapor forms between a liquid and a hot solid.
The complex interactions between the solid, liquid, and vapor phases can lead to rich dynamics even
in a single Leidenfrost drop. Here we investigate the self-organized oscillations of Leidenfrost
drops that are excited by a constant flow of evaporated vapor beneath the drop. We show that for small
Leidenfrost drops, the frequency of a recently reported "breathing mode" can be explained by a simple
balance of gravitational and surface tension forces. For large Leidenfrost drops, azimuthal star-shaped
oscillations are observed. Our previous work showed how the coupling between the rapid evaporated
vapor flow and the vapor-liquid interface excites the star oscillations (Ma \textit{et al., Phys.
Rev. Fluids}, 2, 2017, 031602). In our experiments, star-shaped oscillation modes of $n=2$ to 13
are observed in different liquids, the number of observed modes depends sensitively on the liquid
viscosity. Here we expand on this work by directly comparing the oscillations with theoretical
predictions, and show how the oscillations are initiated by a parametric forcing mechanism through
pressure oscillations in the vapor layer. The pressure oscillations are driven by the capillary
waves of a characteristic wavelength beneath the drop. These capillary waves can be generated by
a large shear stress at the liquid-vapor interface due to the rapid flow of evaporated vapor. We also
explore potential effects of thermal convection in the liquid. Although the measured Rayleigh
number is significantly larger than the critical value, the frequency (wavelength) of the oscillations
depends only on the capillary length of the liquid, and is independent of the drop radius and substrate
temperature. Thus convection seems to play a minor role in Leidenfrost drop oscillations, which
are mostly hydrodynamic in origin.
