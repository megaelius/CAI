Adjoint-based optimization methods are attractive for aerodynamic shape design primarily due
to their computational costs being independent of the dimensionality of the input space and their
ability to generate high-fidelity gradients that can then be used in a gradient-based optimizer.
This makes them very well suited for high-fidelity simulation based aerodynamic shape optimization
of highly parametrized geometries such as aircraft wings. However, the development of adjoint-based
solvers involve careful mathematical treatment and their implementation require detailed software
development. Furthermore, they can become prohibitively expensive when multiple optimization
problems are being solved, each requiring multiple restarts to circumvent local optima. In this
work, we propose a machine learning enabled, surrogate-based framework that replaces the expensive
adjoint solver, without compromising on predicting predictive accuracy. Specifically, we first
train a deep neural network (DNN) from training data generated from evaluating the high-fidelity
simulation model on a model-agnostic, design of experiments on the geometry shape parameters.
The optimum shape may then be computed by using a gradient-based optimizer coupled with the trained
DNN. Subsequently, we also perform a gradient-free Bayesian optimization, where the trained DNN
is used as the prior mean. We observe that the latter framework (DNN-BO) improves upon the DNN-only
based optimization strategy for the same computational cost. Overall, this framework predicts
the true optimum with very high accuracy, while requiring far fewer high-fidelity function calls
compared to the adjoint-based method. Furthermore, we show that multiple optimization problems
can be solved with the same machine learning model with high accuracy, to amortize the offline costs
associated with constructing our models.
