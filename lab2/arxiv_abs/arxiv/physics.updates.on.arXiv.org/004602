We report a complete implementation of the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and triple
excitations (CCSDT) where tensor decompositions are used to reduce its scaling and overall computational
costs. For the decomposition of the electron repulsion integrals the standard density fitting
(or Cholesky decomposition) format is used. The coupled-cluster single and double amplitudes
are treated conventionally, and for the triple amplitudes tensor we employ the Tucker-3 compression
formula, $t_{ijk}^{abc} \approx t_{XYZ} \,U^X_{ai}\,U^Y_{bj} \,U^Z_{ck}$. The auxiliary quantities
$U^X_{ai}$ come from singular value decomposition (SVD) of an approximate triple amplitudes tensor
based on perturbation theory. The efficiency of the proposed method relies on an observation that
the dimension of the "compressed" tensor $t_{XYZ}$ sufficient to deliver a constant relative accuracy
of the correlation energy grows only linearly with the size of the system, $N$. This fact, combined
with proper factorization of the coupled-cluster equations, leads to practically $N^6$ scaling
of the computational costs of the proposed method, as illustrated numerically for linear alkanes
with increasing chain length. This constitutes a considerable improvement over the $N^8$ scaling
of the conventional (uncompressed) CCSDT theory. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified
by benchmark calculations of total and relative energies for several small molecular systems and
comparison with the exact CCSDT method. The accuracy levels of 1 kJ/mol are easily achievable with
reasonable SVD subspace size, and even more demanding levels of accuracy can be reached with a considerable
reduction of the computational costs. Extensions of the proposed method to include higher excitations
are briefly discussed, along with possible strategies of reducing other residual errors.
