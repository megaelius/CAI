Super-resolution imaging techniques have largely improved our capabilities to visualize nanometric
structures in biological systems. Their application further enables one to potentially quantitate
relevant parameters to determine the molecular organization and stoichiometry in cells. However,
the inherently stochastic nature of the fluorescence emission and labeling strategies imposes
the use of dedicated methods to accurately measure these parameters. Here, we describe a Bayesian
approach to precisely quantitate the relative abundance of molecular oligomers from segmented
images. The distribution of proxies for the number of molecules in a cluster -- such as the number
of localizations or the fluorescence intensity -- is fitted via a nested sampling algorithm to compare
mixture models of increasing complexity and determine the optimal number of mixture components
and their weights. We test the performance of the algorithm on {\it in silico} data as a function of
the number of data points, threshold, and distribution shape. We compare these results to those
obtained with other statistical methods, showing the improved performance of our approach. Our
method provides a robust tool for model selection in fitting data extracted from fluorescence imaging,
thus improving the precision of parameter determination. Importantly, the largest benefit of
this method occurs for small-statistics or incomplete datasets, enabling accurate analysis at
the single image level. We further present the results of its application to experimental data obtained
from the super-resolution imaging of dynein in HeLa cells, confirming the presence of a mixed population
of cytoplasmatic single motors and higher-order structures.
