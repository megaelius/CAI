The present article reports the hitherto unreported phenomenon of arrested evaporation dynamics
in pendent droplets in an electric field ambience. The evaporation kinetics of pendant droplets
of electrically conducting saline solutions in the presence of a transverse, alternating electric
field is investigated experimentally. It has been observed that while increase of field strength
arrests the evaporation, increment in field frequency has the opposite effect. The same has been
explained on the solvation kinetics of the ions in the polar water. Theoretical analysis reveals
that change in surface tension and diffusion driven evaporation model cannot predict the arrested
or decelerated evaporation. With the aid of Particle Image Velocimetry, suppression of internal
circulation velocity within the droplet is observed under electric field stimulus, and this affects
the evaporation rate directly. A mathematical scaling model is proposed to quantify the effects
of electrohydrodynamic circulation, electrothermal and electro-solutal advection on the evaporation
kinetics of the droplet. The analysis encompasses major governing parameters, viz. the thermal
and solutal Marangoni numbers, the Electrohydrodynamic number, the electro Prandtl and electro
Schmidt numbers and their respective contributions. It has been shown that the electrothermal
Marangoni effect is supressed by the electric field, leading to deteriorated evaporation rates.
Additionally, the electrosolutal Marangoni effect further supresses the internal advection,
which again arrests the evaporation rate by a larger proportion. Stability analysis reveals that
the electric body force retards the stable internal circulation within such droplets and arrests
advection.
