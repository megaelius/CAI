Adjoint-based sensitivity analysis is routinely used today to assess efficiently the effect of
open-loop control on the linear stability properties of unstable flows. Sensitivity maps identify
regions where small-amplitude control is the most effective, i.e. yields the largest first-order
(linear) eigenvalue variation. In this study an adjoint method is proposed for computing a second-order
(quadratic) sensitivity operator, and applied to the flow past a circular cylinder, controlled
with a steady body force or a passive device model. Maps of second-order eigenvalue variations are
obtained, without computing controlled base flows and eigenmodes. For finite control amplitudes,
the second-order analysis improves the accuracy of the first-order prediction, informs about
its range of validity, and whether it underestimates or overestimates the actual eigenvalue variation.
Regions are identified where control has little or no first-order effect but a second-order effect.
In the cylinder wake, the effect of a control cylinder tends to be underestimated by the first-order
sensitivity, and including second-order effects yields larger regions of flow restabilisation.
Second-order effects can be decomposed into two mechanisms: second-order base flow modification,
and interaction between first-order modifications of the base flow and eigenmode; both contribute
equally in general in sensitive regions of the cylinder wake. Exploiting the second-order sensitivity
operator, the optimal control maximising the total second-order stabilisation is computed via
a quadratic eigenvalue problem. The approach is applicable to other types of control (e.g. wall
blowing/suction and shape deformation) and other eigenvalue problems (e.g. amplification of
time-harmonic perturbations, or resolvent gain, in stable flows).
