Photoswitchable organic molecules can undergo reversible structural changes with an external
light stimulus. These optically controlled molecules have been used in the development of smart
polymers, optical writing of grating films, and even controllable in-vivo drug release. Being
the simplest class of photoswitches in terms of structure, azobenzenes have become the most ubiquitous,
well-characterized, and implemented organic molecular switch. Given their predictable response,
they are ideally suited to create an all-optically controlled switch. However, fabricating a monolithic
optical device comprised solely from azobenzene while maintaining the photoswitching functionality
is challenging. In this work, we combine integrated photonics with optically switchable organic
molecules to create an optically controlled integrated device. A silica toroidal resonant cavity
is functionalized with a monolayer of an azobenzene derivative. After functionalization, the
loaded cavity Q is above 100,000. When 450 nm light is coupled into cavity resonance, the azobenzene
isomerizes from trans-isomer to cis-isomer, inducing a refractive index change. Because the resonant
wavelength of the cavity is governed by the index, the resonant wavelength changes in parallel.
At the probe wavelength of 1300 nm, the wavelength shift is determined by the duration and intensity
of the 450 nm light and the density of azobenzene functional groups on the device surface, providing
multiple control mechanisms. Using this photoswitchable device, resonance frequency tuning
as far as sixty percent of the cavity free spectral range in the near-IR is demonstrated. The kinetics
of the tuning are in agreement with spectroscopic and ellipsometry measurements coupled with finite
element method calculations.
