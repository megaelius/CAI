Different terrestrial terahertz applications would benefit from large-format arrays, operating
in compact and inexpensive cryocoolers at liquid helium temperature with sensitivity, limited
by the 300-K background radiation only. A voltage-biased Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) as a THz
detector can have sufficient sensitivity and has a number of advantages important for real applications
as linearity of response, high dynamic range and a simple calibration, however it requires a low-noise
current readout. Usually, a current amplifier based on Superconducting Quantum-Interference
Device (SQUID) is used for readout, but the scalability of this approach is limited due to complexity
of the operation and fabrication. Recently, it has been shown that instead of SQUID it is possible
to use a current sensor, which is based on the nonlinearity of the kinetic inductance of a current-carrying
superconducting stripe. Embedding the stripe into a microwave high-Q superconducting resonator
allows for reaching sufficient current sensitivity. More important, it is possible with the resonator
approach to scale up to large arrays using Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) in GHz range.
Here, we demonstrate the operation of a voltage-biased TES with a microwave kinetic-inductance
current amplifier at 4.2 K. We measured the expected intrinsic Noise-Equivalent Power NEP ~$5\times
10^{-14} \; \rm W/Hz^{1/2}$ and confirmed that a sufficient sensitivity of the readout can be reached
in conjunction with a real TES operation. The construction of an array with the improved sensitivity
~ $10^{-15}\; \rm W/Hz^{1/2}$ at 4.2 K could be realized using a combination of the new current amplifier
and already existing TES detectors with improved thermal isolation.
