Carbonates are highly heterogeneous formations with large variations in pore size distribution
and pore space topology, which results in complex multiphase flow behavior. Here we investigate
the spontaneous imbibition behavior of fluids in vuggy carbonates. Glass beads of 1.0 mm diameter,
with dissolvable inclusions, are sintered to form multiple configurations of heterogeneous vuggy
core with variations in matrix porosity, vug size, vug spatial location, and number of vugs. The
core fabrication process is repeatable and allows the impact of vug textural properties to be investigated
in a controlled manner. Capillary rise experiments are conducted in these proxy vuggy carbonate
core and compared with the homogeneous non-vuggy core as reference. Continuous optical imaging
is performed to track the position of the air-water interface in the cores. To understand the change
in capillary height in the presence of a vug, a volume-of-fluid two-phase numerical simulation
is performed in a parallel set of connected and disconnected tubes. Finally x-ray tomography scans
are performed to identify the shape of the air-water interface in a select few cores. The results
can be summarized as follows: disconnected vugs result in higher capillary rise compared to non-vuggy
porous media. The vugs act as capillary barriers, diverting fluid flow to the adjacent connected
channels, which ultimately results in a higher overall capillary rise. The results of this work
highlight that radius of spontaneous invasion of aqueous phases, such as fracture fluid and hazardous
wastes, are affected by vug porosity but not their distribution.
