The need for improved engine efficiencies has motivated the development of high-pressure combustion
systems, in which operating conditions achieve and exceed critical conditions. Associated with
these conditions are strong variations in thermo-transport properties as the fluid undergoes
phase transition, and two-stage ignition with low-temperature combustion. Accurately simulating
these physical phenomena at real-fluid environments remains a challenge. By addressing this issue,
a high-fidelity LES-modeling framework is developed to conduct simulations of transcritical
fuel spray mixing and auto-ignition at high-pressure conditions. The simulation is based on a recently
developed diffused interface method that solves the compressible multi-species conservation
equations along with a Peng-Robinson state equation and real-fluid transport properties. LES
analysis is performed for non-reacting and reacting spray conditions targeting the ECN Spray A
configuration at chamber conditions with a pressure of 60 bar and temperatures between 900 K and
1200 K to investigate effects of the real-fluid environment and low-temperature chemistry. Comparisons
with measurements in terms of global spray parameters (i.e., liquid and vapor penetration lengths)
are shown to be in good agreement. Analysis of the mixture fraction distributions in the dispersed
spray region demonstrates the accuracy in modelling the turbulent mixing behavior. Good agreement
of the ignition delay time and the lift-off length is obtained from simulation results at different
ambient temperature conditions and the formation of intermediate species is captured by the simulations,
indicating that the presented numerical framework adequately reproduces the corresponding low-
and high-temperature ignition processes under high-pressure conditions, which are relevant
to realistic diesel-fuel injection systems.
