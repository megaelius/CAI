Elementary-reaction models for $\text{H}_2$/$\text{O}_2$ combustion were evaluated and optimized
through a collaborative workflow, establishing accuracy and characterizing uncertainties.
Quantitative findings were the optimized model, the importance of $\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2(1\Delta)
= \text{H} + \text{HO}_2$ in high-pressure flames, and the inconsistency of certain low-temperature
shock-tube data. The workflow described here is proposed to be even more important because the approach
and publicly available cyberinfrastructure allows future community development of evolving
improvements. The workflow steps applied here were to develop an initial reaction set using Burke
et al. [2012], Burke et al. [2013], Sellevag et al. [2009], and Konnov [2015]; test it for thermodynamic
and kinetics consistency and plausibility against other sets in the literature; assign estimated
uncertainties where not stated in the sources; select key data targets ("Quantities of Interest"
or QOIs) from shock-tube and flame experimental data; perform conventional sensitivity analyses
of QOIs with respect to Arrhenius pre-exponential factors; develop surrogate models for the model-predicted
QOI values; evaluate model-vs.-data consistency using Bound-to-Bound Data Collaboration; and
optimize model parameters within their estimated uncertainty bounds (feasible set). Necessary
data and software for such analyses were developed and are publicly available through the PrIMe
cyberinfrastructure. This community workflow proved to be a means to reveal inconsistencies,
improvements, and uncertainty bounds. Even more significantly, it is a means of revealing which
parameters and experimental findings are inconsistent with the larger body of work from the community
and, thus, of designing new experiments and parameter calculations.
