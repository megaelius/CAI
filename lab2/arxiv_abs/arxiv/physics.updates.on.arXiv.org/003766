Scaling up the number of trapped ions and the effective cooling of ions in surface ion traps is a central
challenge in the research of trapped-ion systems. In this computational study, we propose a novel
surface ion trap design that enables innate principle-axes rotation of trapped ions. In the manipulation
zone of our chip, a symmetric seven-wire geometry enables the rotation of principal axes of two parallel
linear ion chains. This can be used to ensure the cooling of ions along all principle trap axes, which
is effective cooling trapped ions. Furthermore, to alleviate neutral atom flux contaminating
the manipulation zone during ion loading and deterministic loading of a particular number, we design
a standard five-wire geometry for the loading zone and a Y-junction connecting the loading and manipulation
zones, thus enabling the shuttling and reordering of ions. A multi-objective optimization procedure
suitable for arbitrary junctions is described in detail, and the corresponding optimization results
for all ingredients of our chip are presented. With this multi-functional ion trap design and innate
principle axes rotation, the proposed design can be used in the construction of large-scale ion
chip quantum processors and as an efficient ion beam splitter, like an electron beam splitter, for
quantum matter-wave optics experiments and a multi-ion-mixer for quantum computing and quantum
simulations. The ability of the trap to split a single chain of ions into two ion strings might lead
to potential applications not only in quantum simulation and quantum computing but also on studies
of 2D dimensional ion crystals.
