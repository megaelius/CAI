Ephemeral aggregations of bacteria are ubiquitous in the environment, where they serve as hotbeds
of metabolic activity, nutrient cycling, and horizontal gene transfer. In many cases, these regions
of high bacterial concentration are thought to form when motile cells use chemotaxis to navigate
to chemical hotspots. However, what governs the dynamics of bacterial aggregations is unclear.
Here, we use a novel experimental platform to create realistic sub-millimeter scale nutrient pulses
with controlled nutrient concentrations. By combining experiments, mathematical theory and
agent-based simulations, we show that individual \textit{Vibrio ordalii} bacteria begin chemotaxis
toward hotspots of dissolved organic matter (DOM) when the magnitude of the chemical gradient rises
sufficiently far above the sensory noise that is generated by stochastic encounters with chemoattractant
molecules. Each DOM hotspot is surrounded by a dynamic ring of chemotaxing cells, which congregate
in regions of high DOM concentration before dispersing as DOM diffuses and gradients become too
noisy for cells to respond to. We demonstrate that \textit{V. ordalii} operates close to the theoretical
limits on chemotactic precision. Numerical simulations of chemotactic bacteria, in which molecule
counting noise is explicitly taken into account, point at a tradeoff between nutrient acquisition
and the cost of chemotactic precision. More generally, our results illustrate how limits on sensory
precision can be used to understand the location, spatial extent, and lifespan of bacterial behavioral
responses in ecologically relevant environments.
