Rotating turbulent flows form a challenging test case for large-eddy simulation (LES). We, therefore,
propose and validate a new subgrid-scale (SGS) model for such flows. The proposed SGS model consists
of a dissipative eddy viscosity term as well as a nondissipative term that is nonlinear in the rate-of-strain
and rate-of-rotation tensors. The two corresponding model coefficients are a function of the vortex
stretching magnitude. Therefore, the model is consistent with many physical and mathematical
properties of the Navier-Stokes equations and turbulent stresses, and is easy to implement. We
determine the two model constants using a nondynamic procedure that takes into account the interaction
between the model terms. Using detailed direct numerical simulations (DNSs) and LESs of rotating
decaying turbulence and spanwise-rotating plane-channel flow, we reveal that the two model terms
respectively account for dissipation and backscatter of energy, and that the nonlinear term improves
predictions of the Reynolds stress anisotropy near solid walls. We also show that the new SGS model
provides good predictions of rotating decaying turbulence and leads to outstanding predictions
of spanwise-rotating plane-channel flow over a large range of rotation rates for both fine and coarse
grid resolutions. Moreover, the new nonlinear model performs as well as the dynamic Smagorinsky
and scaled anisotropic minimum-dissipation models in LESs of rotating decaying turbulence and
outperforms these models in LESs of spanwise-rotating plane-channel flow, without requiring
(dynamic) adaptation or near-wall damping of the model constants.
