In this study, and through an understanding of neuronal system communication, A light was shed upon
a novel model serves as an assistive technology for locked-in people suffering from Motor neuronal
disease. MND patients, who have an intact minds, are able -till now- to make a mean of on-screen communication.
Work was done upon the potential of brain wave activity patterns to be detected as electrical signals,
classified and translated into commands following BCI constructing paradigm. However, The interface
constructed was for the first time a device which can reconstruct this command physically. The intervention
is in a software is used to classify imagined right and left limb movement into binary results, and
then make use of the magnetic field produced by the amplified pulses to reconstruct the activity
into ferrofluid droplets movement- these moved due rotation of a desk according to the data received.
Objectives of the project is to address the challenges of the inaccurate performance and cost of
user-training which are yet the main issues preventing BCI from being upgraded into more immersive
and effective technology. The design requirements addressed were the communication speed of the
droplet movement and the accuracy of hitting fixed targets . Tests were performed based on software
programs accelerated changing motor imagery movement of left and right limbs. The tests achieved
an average speed of 0.469 cm/s and average accuracy of 81.6% for the best volume from many were tried.
A conclusion to be drawn was that the promise of this other point of view on BCI systems to be more Brain-Real
World Systems.
