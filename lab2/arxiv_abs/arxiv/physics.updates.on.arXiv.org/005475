A novel phase transition behavior is observed in the Kolkata Paise Restaurant (KPR) problem where
large number ($N$) of agents or customers collectively (and iteratively) learn to choose among
the $N$ restaurants where she would expect to be alone that evening and would get the only dish available
there (or may get randomly picked up if more than one agent arrive there that evening). The players
are expected to evolve their strategy such that the publicly available information about past crowd
in different restaurants can be utilized and each of them is able to make the best minority choice.
For equally ranked restaurants we follow two crowd-avoiding strategies: Strategy I, where each
of the $n_i(t)$ number of agents arriving at the $i$-th restaurant on the $t$-th evening goes back
to the same restaurant on the next evening with probability $[n_i(t)]^{-\alpha}$, while in Strategy
II, with probability $p$, when $n_i(t) > 1$. We study the steady state ($t$-independent) utilization
fraction $f:(1-f)$ giving the steady state (wastage) fraction of restaurants going without any
customer in any particular evening. With both the strategies we find, near $\alpha_c=0_+$ (in strategy
I) or $p=1_-$ (in strategy II), the steady state wastage fraction $(1-f)\propto(\alpha - \alpha_c)^{\beta}$
or $(p_c - p)^\beta$ with $\beta \simeq 0.8, 0.87, 1.0$ and the convergence time $\tau$ (for $f(t)$
becoming independent of $t$) varies as $\tau\propto{(\alpha-\alpha_c)}^{-\gamma}$ or ${(p_c-p)}^{-\gamma}$,
with $\gamma \simeq 1.18, 1.11, 1.05$ in infinite-dimension (rest of the $N-1$ neighboring restaurants),
three-dimension ($6$ neighbors) and two-dimension ($4$ neighbors) respectively.
