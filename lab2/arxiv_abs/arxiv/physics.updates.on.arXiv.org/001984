The projected performance and detector configuration of nEXO are described in this pre-Conceptual
Design Report (pCDR). nEXO is a tonne-scale neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay
search in $^{136}$Xe, based on the ultra-low background liquid xenon technology validated by EXO-200.
With $\simeq$ 5000 kg of xenon enriched to 90% in the isotope 136, nEXO has a projected half-life sensitivity
of approximately $10^{28}$ years. This represents an improvement in sensitivity of about two orders
of magnitude with respect to current results. Based on the experience gained from EXO-200 and the
effectiveness of xenon purification techniques, we expect the background to be dominated by external
sources of radiation. The sensitivity increase is, therefore, entirely derived from the increase
of active mass in a monolithic and homogeneous detector, along with some technical advances perfected
in the course of a dedicated R&D program. Hence the risk which is inherent to the construction of a
large, ultra-low background detector is reduced, as the intrinsic radioactive contamination
requirements are generally not beyond those demonstrated with the present generation $0\nu\beta\beta$
decay experiments. Indeed, most of the required materials have been already assayed or reasonable
estimates of their properties are at hand. The details described herein represent the base design
of the detector configuration as of early 2018. Where potential design improvements are possible,
alternatives are discussed. This design for nEXO presents a compelling path towards a next generation
search for $0\nu\beta\beta$, with a substantial possibility to discover physics beyond the Standard
Model.
