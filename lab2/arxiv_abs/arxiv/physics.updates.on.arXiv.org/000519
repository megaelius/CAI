This paper accompanies first release of libmpdata++, a C++ library implementing the Multidimensional
Positive-Definite Advection Transport Algorithm (MPDATA). The library offers basic numerical
solvers for systems of generalised transport equations. The solvers are forward-in-time, conservative
and non-linearly stable. The libmpdata++ library covers the basic second-order-accurate formulation
of MPDATA, its third-order variant, the infinite-gauge option for variable-sign fields and a flux-corrected
transport extension to guarantee non-oscillatory solutions. The library is equipped with a non-symmetric
variational elliptic solver for implicit evaluation of pressure gradient terms. All solvers offer
parallelisation through domain decomposition using shared-memory parallelisation. The paper
describes the library programming interface, and serves as a user guide. Supported options are
illustrated with benchmarks discussed in the MPDATA literature. Benchmark descriptions include
code snippets as well as quantitative representations of simulation results. Examples of applications
include: homogeneous transport in one, two and three dimensions in Cartesian and spherical domains;
shallow-water system compared with analytical solution; and a buoyant convection problem in an
incompressible Boussinesq fluid with interfacial instability. All the examples are implemented
out of the library tree. Regardless of the differences in the problem dimensionality, right-hand-side
terms, boundary conditions and parallelisation approach, all the examples use the same unmodified
library, which is a key goal of libmpdata++ design. The libmpdata++ library is implemented in C++,
making use of the Blitz++ multi-dimensioanl array containers, and is released as free/libre and
open-source software.
