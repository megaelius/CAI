Local gauge theories are in a complicated relationship with boundaries. Whereas fixing the gauge
can often shave off unwanted redundancies, the coupling of different bounded regions requires
the use of gauge-variant elements. Therefore, coupling is inimical to gauge-fixing, as usually
understood. This sort of reasoning has led some to declare the coupling of subsystems to be the raison
d'\^etre of gauge. Indeed, while gauge-fixing is entirely unproblematic for a single region without
boundary, it introduces arbitrary boundary conditions on the gauge degrees of freedom themselves
-- these conditions lack a physical interpretation when they are not functionals of the original
fields. Such arbitrary boundary choices creep into the calculation of charges through Noether's
second theorem, muddling the assignment of physical charges to local gauge symmetries. The confusion
brewn by gauge at boundaries is well-known, and must be contended with both conceptually and technically.
Here I explicate the problems mentioned above and illustrate a possible resolution: in a recent
series of papers the notion of a connection-form was put forward and implemented in the field-space
of gauge theories. Using this tool, a modified version of symplectic geometry -- called `horizontal'
-- is possible. Independently of boundary conditions, this formalism bestows to each region a physically
salient, relational notion of charge: the horizontal Noether charge. Meanwhile, as required,
the connection-form mediates a peaceful composition of regions, one compatible with the attribution
of horizontal Noether charges to each region.
