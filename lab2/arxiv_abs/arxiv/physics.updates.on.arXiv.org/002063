Neutron howitzers are the irradiation instruments, generally used for the chemical analysis in
the research laboratories, where the neutron sources are encapsulated within a moderating medium
and the target materials are irradiated at the channels inserted through the corresponding neutron
sources. In this study, we employ Monte Carlo simulations by using the MCNP5 code in order to perform
the neutronic analysis of a Nuclear-Chicago NH3 neutron howitzer with a 5-Ci 239Pu-Be neutron source.
This neutron howitzer is a cylindrical drum that is covered by aluminum at the level of outermost
layer, and the cylindrical body is installed with paraffin for the neutron moderation. The drum
consists of two vertical and two horizontal irradiation channels and a vertical source channel
in which the 5-Ci 239Pu-Be neutron source is located and moved upward or downward by the aid of a plexiglass
rod. We focus our study on the two horizontal irradiation channels, separated by an angle of 120o,
which are installed with a cylindrical plexiglass bar. We construct our geometry by respecting
the dimensional properties of the NH3 howitzer components and we define a biased cylindrical source
of 1.02 in.x 4.425 in. by taking into account the neutron energy spectrum and source strength of the
5-Ci 239Pu-Be neutron source. We determine the neutron flux within the plexiglass bar for various
energy bins in the energy range between 0 and 10.5 MeV, and also, we investigate the axial variation
of the neutron flux along the plexiglass region in the horizontal irradiation channels. Our simulation
results show that a significant number of thermal neutrons as well as a non-negligible population
of fast neutrons propagate through the plexiglass bar, thereby demonstrating the opportunity
to product from a wide range of energy spectrum for the neutron activation analysis.
