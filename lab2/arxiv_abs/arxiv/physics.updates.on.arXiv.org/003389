This paper compares the gyrokinetic instabilities and transport in two representative JET pedestals,
one (pulse 78697) from the JET configuration with a carbon wall (C) and another (pulse 92432) from
after the installation of JET's ITER-like Wall (ILW). The discharges were selected for a comparison
of JET-ILW and JET-C discharges with good confinement at high current (3 MA, corresponding also
to low $\rho_*$) and retain the distinguishing features of JET-C and JET-ILW, notably, decreased
pedestal top temperature for JET-ILW. A comparison of the profiles and heating power reveals a stark
qualitative difference between the discharges: the JET-ILW pulse (92432) requires twice the heating
power, at a gas rate of $1.9 \times 10^{22}e/s$, to sustain roughly half the temperature gradient
of the JET-C pulse (78697), operated at zero gas rate. This points to heat transport as a central component
of the dynamics limiting the JET-ILW pedestal and reinforces the following emerging JET-ILW pedestal
transport paradigm, which is proposed for further examination by both theory and experiment. ILW
conditions modify the density pedestal in ways that decrease the normalized pedestal density gradient
$a/L_n$, often via an outward shift of the density pedestal. This is attributable to some combination
of direct metal wall effects and the need for increased fueling to mitigate tungsten contamination.
The modification to the density profile increases $\eta = L_n/L_T$ , thereby producing more robust
ion temperature gradient (ITG) and electron temperature gradient driven instability. The decreased
pedestal gradients for JET-ILW (92432) also result in a strongly reduced $E \times B$ shear rate,
further enhancing the ion scale turbulence. Collectively, these effects limit the pedestal temperature
and demand more heating power to achieve good pedestal performance.
