The aim of this study is to perform a theoretical analysis of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability
and energetic particle effects on a LHD equilibria, calculated during a discharge where energetic-ion-driven
resistive interchange mode (EIC) events were triggered. We use the reduced MHD equations to describe
the linear evolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal component of the vorticity in a full 3D
system, coupled with equations of density and parallel velocity moments for the energetic particles
species. We add the Landau damping and resonant destabilization effects using a closure relation.
The simulations suggest that the helically trapped EP driven by the perpendicular neutral beam
injector (NBI) further destabilizes the 1/1 MHD-like mode located at the plasma periphery (r/a
= 0.88). If the beta of the EP driven by the perpendicular NBI is larger than 0.0025 a 1/1 EIC with a frequency
around 3 kHz is destabilized. If the effect of the passing EP driven by the tangential NBI is included
on the model, any enhancement of the injection intensity of the tangential NBI below beta=0.025
leads to a decrease of the instability growth rate. The simulations indicate that the perpendicular
NBI EP is the main driver of the EIC events, as it was observed in the experiment. If the effect of the
helical couplings are added in the model, an 11/13 EIC is destabilized with a frequency around 9 kHz,
inward shifted (r/a = 0.81) compared to the 1/1 EIC. Thus, one possible explanation for the EIC frequency
chirping down from 9 to 3 kHz is a transition between the 11/13 to the 1/1 EIC due to a weakening of the
destabilizing effect of the high n modes, caused by a decrease of the EP drive due to a loss of helically
trapped EP or a change in the EP distribution function after the EIC burst.
