Magnetars are highly magnetized neutron stars whose magnetic dipole ranges from $10^{14}$ to $10^{15}$
G. The MRI is considered to be a promising mechanism to amplify the magnetic field in fast-rotating
protoneutron stars and form magnetars. This scenario is supported by many local studies showing
that magnetic fields could be amplified by the MRI on small scales. However, the efficiency of the
MRI at generating a dipole field is still unknown. To answer this question, we study the MRI dynamo
in an idealized global model of a fast rotating protoneutron star with differential rotation. We
perform 3D incompressible MHD simulations in spherical geometry with explicit diffusivities
where the differential rotation is forced at the outer boundary. We vary the initial magnetic field
and investigated different magnetic boundary conditions. These simulations were compared to
local shearing box simulations. We obtain a self-sustained turbulent MRI-driven dynamo, whose
saturated state is independent of the initial magnetic field. The MRI generates a strong turbulent
magnetic field of $B \geq 2\times 10^{15}$ G and a non-dominant magnetic dipole, which represents
systematically about $5\%$ of the averaged magnetic field strength. Interestingly, this dipole
is tilted towards the equatorial plane. We find that local shearing box models can reproduce fairly
well several characteristics of global MRI turbulence such as the kinetic and magnetic spectra.
The turbulence is nonetheless more vigorous in the local models than in the global ones. Overall,
our results support the ability of the MRI to form magnetar-like large-scale magnetic fields. They
furthermore predict the presence of a stronger small-scale magnetic field. The resulting magnetic
field could be important to power outstanding stellar explosions, such as superluminous supernovae
and GRBs.
