A dual-continuum model can offer a practical approach to understanding first order behaviours
of poromechanically coupled multiscale systems. To close the governing equations, constitutive
equations with models to calculate effective constitutive coefficients are required. Several
coefficient models have been proposed within the literature. However, an assessment of how these
models relate to one another, and the underlying assumptions used in their construction, is still
missing. To address this we first compare and contrast the dominant models existing within the literature.
In terms of the constitutive relations themselves, early relations were indirectly postulated
that implicitly neglected the effect of the mechanical interaction arising between continuum
pressures. Further, recent users of complete constitutive systems that include inter-continuum
pressure coupling have explicitly neglected these couplings as a means of providing direct relations
between composite and constituent properties, and to simplify coefficient models. We analyse
the impact of implicit and explicit decoupling assumptions using both theoretical and qualitative
means. The former can be equated to the removal of a pressure source term in the governing equations.
Analysis of the latter is conducted within the framework of micromechanics. Depending on the formulation,
explicit decoupling assumptions are equivalent to conditions of isostress or isostrain. These
conditions represent end-member states that correspond to the Reuss and Voigt bounds for composite
moduli respectively. Use of these bounds goes on to directly affect coefficient models themselves.
We conclude by offering recommendations for when to use different coefficient models, in addition
to upscaling recommendations for when composite moduli are unavailable.
