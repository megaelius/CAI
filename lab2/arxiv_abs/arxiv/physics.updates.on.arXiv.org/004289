While equilibrium phase transitions are well described by a free-energy landscape, there are few
tools to describe general features of their non-equilibrium counterparts. On the other hand, near-equilibrium
free-energies are easily accessible but their full geometry is only explored in non-equilibrium,
e.g. after a quench. In the particular case of a non-stationary system, however, the concepts of
an order parameter and free energy become ill-defined, and a comprehensive understanding of non-stationary
(transient) phase transitions is still lacking. Here, we probe transient non-equilibrium dynamics
of an optically pumped, dye-filled microcavity which exhibits near-equilibrium Bose-Einstein
condensation under steady-state conditions. By rapidly exciting a large number of dye molecules,
we quench the system to a far-from-equilibrium state and, close to a critical excitation energy,
find delayed condensation, interpreted as a transient equivalent of critical slowing down. We
introduce the two-time, non-stationary, second-order correlation function as a powerful experimental
tool for probing the statistical properties of the transient relaxation dynamics. In addition
to number fluctuations near the critical excitation energy, we show that transient phase transitions
exhibit a different form of diverging fluctuations, namely timing jitter in the growth of the order
parameter. This jitter is seeded by the randomness associated with spontaneous emission, with
its effect being amplified near the critical point. The general character of our results are then
discussed based on the geometry of effective free-energy landscapes. We thus identify universal
features, such as the formation timing jitter, for a larger set of systems undergoing transient
phase transitions. Our results carry immediate implications to diverse systems, including micro-
and nano-lasers and growth of colloidal nanoparticles.
