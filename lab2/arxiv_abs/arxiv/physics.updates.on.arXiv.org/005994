The amount of heat transport from the core, which constrains the dynamics and thermal evolution
of the region, depends on the transport properties of iron. Ohta et al.(2016) and Konopkova et al.(2016)
measured electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of iron, respectively, in laser-heated
diamond anvil cells (DACs) at relevant Earth's core pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions, and
obtained dramatically contradictory results. Here we measure the electrical resistivity of hcp-iron
up to ~170 GPa and ~3,000 K using a four-probe van der Pauw method coupled with homogeneous flat-top
laser-heating in a DAC. We also compute its electrical and thermal conductivity by first-principles
methods including electron-phonon and electron-electron scattering. We find that the measured
resistivity of hcp-iron increases almost linearly with increasing temperature, and is consistent
with current first-principles computations. The proportionality coefficient between resistivity
and thermal conductivity (the Lorenz number) in hcp-iron differs from the ideal value (2.44*10^-8
W Omega K^-2), so a non-ideal Lorenz number of ~(2.0-2.1)*10^-8 W Omega K^-2 is used to convert the
experimental resistivity to the thermal conductivity of hcp-Fe at high P-T. The results constrain
the resistivity and thermal conductivity of hcp-iron to ~80(5) u Omega cm and ~100(10) W/mK, respectively,
at conditions near core-mantle boundary. Our results indicate an adiabatic heat flow of ~10(1)
TW through the core-mantle boundary for a liquid Fe alloy outer core, supporting a present-day geodynamo
driven by thermal convection through the core's secular cooling and by compositional convection
through the latent heat and gravitational energy during the inner core's solidification.
