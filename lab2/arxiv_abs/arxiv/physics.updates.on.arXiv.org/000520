The Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel (VDTT) at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization
in G\"ottingen, Germany produces very high turbulence levels at moderate flow velocities, low
power consumption and adjustable kinematic viscosity between $10^{-4} m^2/s$ and $10^{-7} m^2/s$.
The Reynolds number can be varied by changing the pressure or flow rate of the gas or by using different
non-flammable gases including air. The highest kinematic viscosities, and hence lowest Reynolds
numbers, are reached with air or nitrogen at 0.1 bar. To reach the highest Reynolds numbers the tunnel
is pressurized to 15 bar with the dense gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_6$). Turbulence is generated
at the upstream ends of two measurement sections with grids, and the evolution of this turbulence
is observed as it moves down the length of the sections. We describe the instrumentation presently
in operation, which consists of the tunnel itself, classical grid turbulence generators, and state-of-the-art
nano-fabricated hot-wire anemometers provided by Princeton University [Vallikivi et al. (2011)
Exp. Fluids 51, 1521]. We report measurements of the characteristic scales of the flow and of turbulent
spectra up to Taylor Reynolds number $R_\lambda \approx 1600$, higher than any other grid-turbulence
experiment. We also describe instrumentation under development, which includes an active grid
and a Lagrangian particle tracking system that moves down the length of the tunnel with the mean flow.
In this configuration, the properties of the turbulence are adjustable and its structure is resolvable
up to $R_\lambda \approx 8000$.
