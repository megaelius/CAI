The protein chemical shifts holds a large amount of information about the 3-dimensional structure
of the protein. A number of chemical shift predictors based on the relationship between structures
resolved with X-ray crystallography and the corresponding experimental chemical shifts have
been developed. These empirical predictors are very accurate on X-ray structures but tends to be
insensitive to small structural changes. To overcome this limitation it has been suggested to make
chemical shift predictors based on quantum mechanical(QM) calculations. In this thesis the development
of the QM derived chemical shift predictor Procs14 is presented. Procs14 is based on 2.35 million
density functional theory(DFT) calculations on tripeptides and contains corrections for hydrogen
bonding, ring current and the effect of the previous and following residue. Procs14 is capable at
performing predictions for the 13CA, 13CB, 13CO, 15NH, 1HN and 1HA backbone atoms. In order to benchmark
Procs14, a number of QM NMR calculations are performed on full protein structures. Of the tested
empirical and QM derived predictors, Procs14 reproduced the QM chemical shifts with the highest
accuracy. A comparison with the QM derived predictor CheShift-2 on X-ray structures and NMR ensembles
with experimental chemical shift data, showed that Procs14 predicted the chemical shifts with
the best accuracy. The predictions on the NMR ensembles exhibited the best performance. This suggests
that future work might benefit from using ensemble sampling when performing simulations of protein
folding with chemical shifts. Procs14 is implemented in the markov chain monte carlo protein folding
framework PHAISTOS. The computational efficient implementation of Procs14 allows for rapid predictions
and therefore potential use in refinement and folding of protein structures.
