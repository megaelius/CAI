This history of the concept of fact reveals that the fact-oriented practices of German physicists
and historians derived from common origins. The concept of fact became part of the German language
remarkably late. It gained momentum only toward the end of the eighteenth century. I show that the
concept of fact emerged as part of a historical knowledge tradition, which comprised both human
and natural empirical study. Around 1800, parts of this tradition, including the concept of fact,
were integrated into the epistemological basis of several emerging disciplines, including physics
and historiography. During this process of discipline formation, the concept of fact remained
fluid. I reveal this fluidity by unearthing different interpretations and roles of facts in different
German contexts around 1800. I demonstrate how a fact-based epistemology emerged at the University
of G\"ottingen in the late eighteenth century, by focusing on universal historian August Ludwig
Schl\"ozer and the experimentalist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. In a time of scientific and political
revolutions, they regarded facts as eternal knowledge, contrasting them with short-lived theories
and speculations. Remarkably, Schl\"ozer and Lichtenberg construed facts as the basis of Wissenschaft,
but not as Wissenschaft itself. Only after 1800, empirically minded German physicists and historians
granted facts self-contained value. As physics and historiography became institutionalized
at German universities, the concept of fact acquired different interpretations in different disciplinary
settings. These related to fact-oriented research practices, such as precision measurement in
physics and source criticism in historiography.
