Opposition-control of the energetic cycle of near wall streaks in wall-bounded turbulence, using
numerical approaches, has shown promise for drag reduction. For practical implementation, opposition
control is only realizable if there is a degree of coherence between the sensor--actuator pairs
of the control system (these sensors and actuators should typically be wall-based to avoid parasitic
drag). As such, we here inspect the feasibility of real-time control of the near-wall cycle, by considering
the coherence between a measurable wall-quantity, being the wall-shear stress fluctuations,
and the streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations in a turbulent boundary layer. Synchronized
spatial and temporal velocity data from numerical simulations at $Re_\tau \approx 590$ and $ 2000$
are employed. It is shown that the spectral energy of the streamwise velocity fluctuations that
is stochastically incoherent with wall signals is independent of Reynolds number in the near wall
region. Consequently, the streamwise energy-fraction that is stochastically wall-coherent
grows with Reynolds number due to the increasing range of energetic large scales. This thus implies
that a wall-based control system has the ability to manipulate a larger portion of the total turbulence
energy at off-wall locations, at higher Reynolds numbers. Coherence values of 0.55 and 0.4, which
are considerably lower than the maximum possible coherence 1, were found between the streamwise
and wall-normal velocity fluctuations at the near wall peak in the energy spectrogram, respectively,
and the streamwise fluctuating friction velocity. This suggests that a closed-loop drag reduction
scheme targeting near wall cycle of streaks alone will be of limited success in practice as the Reynolds
number grows.
