Purpose: To develop a general framework for Parallel Imaging (PI) with the use of Maxwell regularization
for the estimation of the sensitivity maps (SMs) and constrained optimization for the parameter-free
image reconstruction. Theory and Methods: Certain characteristics of both the SMs and the images
are routinely used to regularize the otherwise ill-posed optimization-based joint reconstruction
from highly accelerated PI data. In this paper we rely on a fundamental property of SMs--they are
solutions of Maxwell equations-- we construct the subspace of all possible SM distributions supported
in a given field-of-view, and we promote solutions of SMs that belong in this subspace. In addition,
we propose a constrained optimization scheme for the image reconstruction, as a second step, once
an accurate estimation of the SMs is available. The resulting method, dubbed Maxwell Parallel Imaging
(MPI), works seamlessly for arbitrary sequences (both 2D and 3D) with any trajectory and minimal
calibration signals. Results: The effectiveness of MPI is illustrated for a wide range of datasets
with various undersampling schemes, including radial, variable-density Poisson-disc, and Cartesian,
and is compared against the state-of-the-art PI methods. Finally, we include some numerical experiments
that demonstrate the memory footprint reduction of the constructed Maxwell basis with the help
of tensor decomposition, thus allowing the use of MPI for full 3D image reconstructions. Conclusions:
The MPI framework provides a physics-inspired optimization method for the accurate and efficient
image reconstruction from arbitrary accelerated scans.
