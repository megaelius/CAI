Laser blow-off injections of aluminum and tungsten have been performed on the DIII-D tokamak to
investigate the variation of impurity transport in a set of dedicated ion and electron heating scans
with a fixed value of the external torque. The particle transport is quantified via the Bayesian
inference method, which, constrained by a combination of a charge exchange recombination spectroscopy,
soft X-ray measurements, and VUV spectroscopy provides a detailed uncertainty quantification
of the transport coefficients. Contrasting discharge phases with a dominant electron and ion heating
reveal a factor of 30 increase in midradius impurity diffusion and a 3-fold drop in the impurity confinement
time when additional electron heating is applied. Further, the calculated stationary aluminum
density profiles reverse from peaked in electron heated to hollow in the ion heated case, following
a similar trend as electron and carbon density profiles. Comparable values of a core diffusion have
been observed for W and Al ions, while differences in the propagation dynamics of these impurities
are attributed to pedestal and edge transport. Modeling of the core transport with non-linear gyrokinetics
code CGYRO [J. Candy and E. Belly J. Comput. Phys. 324,73 (2016)], significantly underpredicts
the magnitude of the variation in Al transport. The experiment demonstrates a 3-times steeper increase
of impurity diffusion with additional electron heat flux and 10-times lower diffusion in ion heated
case than predicted by the modeling. However, the CGYRO model correctly predicts that the Al diffusion
dramatically increases below the linear threshold for the transition from the ion temperature
gradient (ITG) to trapped electron mode (TEM).
