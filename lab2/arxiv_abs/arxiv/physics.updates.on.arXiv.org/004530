Though the Boltzmann-Gibbs framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics has been successful
in many arenas, it is clearly inadequate for describing many interesting natural phenomena driven
far from equilibrium. The simplest step towards that goal is a better understanding of nonequilibrium
steady-states (NESS). Here we focus on one of the distinctive features of NESS, persistent probability
currents, and their manifestations in our climate system. We consider the natural variability
of the steady-state climate system, which can be approximated as a NESS. These currents must form
closed loops, which are odd under time reversal, providing the crucial difference between systems
in thermal equilibrium and NESS. Seeking manifestations of such current loops leads us naturally
to the notion of probability angular momentum and oscillations in the space of observables. Specifically,
we will relate this concept to the asymmetric part of certain time-dependent correlation functions.
Applying this approach, we propose that these current loops give rise to preferred spatio-temporal
patterns of natural climate variability that take the form of climate oscillations such as the El-Ni\~{n}o
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Madden-Julien Oscillation (MJO). In the space of climate indices,
we observe persistent currents and define a new diagnostic for these currents: the probability
angular momentum. Using the observed climatic time series of ENSO and MJO, we compute both the averages
and the distributions of the probability angular momentum. These results are in good agreement
with the analysis from a linear Gaussian model. We propose that, in addition to being a new quantification
of climate oscillations across models and observations, the probability angular momentum provides
a meaningful characterization for all statistical systems in NESS.
