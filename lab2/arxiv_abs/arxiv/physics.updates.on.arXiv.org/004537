Path-integral-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used for the calculation
of numerically exact quantum Boltzmann properties and approximate dynamical quantities. A nearly
universal feature of MD numerical integration schemes for equations of motion based on imaginary-time
path integrals is the use of harmonic normal modes for the exact evolution of the free ring-polymer
positions and momenta. In this work, we demonstrate that this standard practice creates numerical
artifacts. In the context of conservative (i.e., microcanonical) equations of motion, it leads
to numerical instability. In the context of thermostatted (i.e., canonical) equations of motion,
it leads to non-ergodicity of the sampling. These pathologies are generally proven to arise at integration
timesteps that depend only on the system temperature and the number of ring-polymer beads, and they
are numerically demonstrated for the cases of conventional ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD)
and thermostatted RPMD (TRPMD). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that these numerical artifacts
are removed via replacement of the exact free ring-polymer evolution with a second-order approximation
based on the Cayley transform. The Cayley modification introduced here can immediately be employed
with almost every existing integration scheme for path-integral-based molecular dynamics - including
path-integral MD (PIMD), RPMD, TRPMD, and centroid MD - providing strong symplectic stability
and ergodicity to the numerical integration, at no penalty in terms of computational cost, algorithmic
complexity, or accuracy of the overall MD timestep. Furthermore, it is shown that the improved numerical
stability of the Cayley modification allows for the use of larger MD timesteps. We suspect that the
Cayley modification will therefore find useful application in many future path-integral-based
MD simulations.
