Atomically thin semiconductors made from transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are model systems
for investigations of strong light-matter interactions and applications in nanophotonics, opto-electronics
and valley-tronics. However, the typical photoluminescence spectra of TMD monolayers display
a large number of intrinsic and extrinsic features that are particularly challenging to decipher.
On a practical level, monochromatic TMD-based emitters would be beneficial for low-dimensional
devices but no solution has yet been found to meet this challenge. Here, using a counter-intuitive
strategy that consists in interfacing TMD monolayers with graphene, a system known as an efficient
luminescence quencher, we demonstrate bright, single and narrow-line photoluminescence arising
solely from TMD neutral excitons. This observation stems from two effects: (i) complete neutralization
of the TMD by the adjacent graphene leading to the absence of optical features from charged excitons
(ii) selective non-radiative transfer of TMD excitons to graphene, that is sufficiently rapid
to quench radiative recombination of long-lived excitonic species without significantly affecting
bright excitons, which display much shorter, picosecond radiative lifetimes at low temperatures.
Our approach is systematically applied to four tungsten and molybdenum-based TMDs and establishes
TMD/graphene heterostructures as a unique set of opto-electronic building blocks. Graphene not
only endows TMDs monolayers with superior optical performance and enhanced photostability but
also provides an excellent electrical contact, suitable for TMD-based electroluminescent systems
emitting visible and near-infrared photons at near THz rate with linewidths approaching the lifetime
limit.
