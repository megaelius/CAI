PURPOSE: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) with spiral readout enables rapid quantification
of tissue relaxation times. However, it is prone to blurring due to off-resonance effects. Hence,
fat blurring into adjacent regions might prevent identification of small tumors by their quantitative
T1 and T2 values. This study aims to correct for the blurring artifacts, thereby enabling fast quantitative
mapping in the female breast. METHODS: The impact of fat blurring on spiral MRF results was first
assessed by simulations. Then, MRF was combined with 3-point Dixon water-fat separation and spiral
blurring correction based on conjugate phase reconstruction. The approach was assessed in phantom
experiments and compared to Cartesian reference measurements, namely inversion recovery (IR),
multi-echo spin echo (MESE) and Cartesian MRF, by normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and
standard deviation (STD) calculations. Feasibility is further demonstrated in-vivo for quantitative
breast measurements of 6 healthy female volunteers, age range 24-31 years. RESULTS: In the phantom
experiment, the blurring correction reduced the NRMSE per phantom vial on average from 16% to 8%
for T1 and from 18% to 11% for T2 when comparing spiral MRF to IR/MESE sequences. When comparing to
Cartesian MRF, the NRMSE reduced from 15% to 8% for T1 and from 12% to 7% for T2. Furthermore, STDs decreased.
In-vivo, the blurring correction removed fat bias on T1/T2 from a rim of about 7-8 mm width adjacent
to fatty structures. CONCLUSION: The blurring correction for spiral MRF yields improved quantitative
maps in the presence of water and fat.
