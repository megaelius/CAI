Nonsuspended sediment transport (NST) refers to the sediment transport regime in which the flow
turbulence is unable to support the weight of transported grains. It occurs in fluvial environments
(i.e., driven by a stream of liquid) and in aeolian environments (i.e., wind-blown) and plays a key
role in shaping sedimentary landscapes on Earth and other planetary bodies. NST is a highly fluctuating
physical process because of turbulence, surface inhomogeneities, and variations of grain size
and shape and packing geometry. Furthermore, the energy of transported grains varies strongly
due to variations of their flow exposure duration since their entrainment from the bed. In spite
of such variability, we here propose a deterministic model that represents the entire grain motion,
including grains that roll and/or slide along the bed, by a periodic saltation motion with rebound
laws that describe an average rebound of a grain after colliding with the bed. The model simultaneously
captures measurements and discrete element method-based numerical simulations of the threshold
and rate of equilibrium NST within a factor of about 2, unifying conditions in oil, water, and air
(oil only for threshold). Existing numerical data from the literature suggest that an average rebound
is nearly unaffected by the strength of cohesive bonds between bed grains. Consistently, the model
captures cohesive aeolian conditions, including aeolian NST of snow, despite not explicitly accounting
for cohesion. The high predictive capability of the model suggests that crucial mean-field properties
of NST are relatively insensitive to its internal variability.
