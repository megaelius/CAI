The effect of grid resolution on large eddy simulation (LES) of wall-bounded turbulent flow is investigated.
A channel flow simulation campaign involving systematic variation of the streamwise ($\Delta
x$) and spanwise ($\Delta z$) grid resolution is used for this purpose. The main friction-velocity
based Reynolds number investigated is 300. Near the walls, the grid cell size is determined by the
frictional scaling, $\Delta x^+$ and $\Delta z^+$, and strongly anisotropic cells, with first
$\Delta y^+ \sim 1$, thus aiming for wall-resolving LES. Results are compared to direct numerical
simulations (DNS) and several quality measures are investigated, including the error in the predicted
mean friction velocity and the error in cross-channel profiles of flow statistics. To reduce the
total number of channel flow simulations, techniques from the framework of uncertainty quantification
(UQ) are employed. In particular, generalized polynomial chaos expansion (gPCE) is used to create
meta models for the errors over the allowed parameter ranges. The differing behavior of the different
quality measures is demonstrated and analyzed. It is shown that friction velocity, and profiles
of velocity and the Reynolds stress tensor, are most sensitive to $\Delta z^+$, while the error in
the turbulent kinetic energy is mostly influenced by $\Delta x^+$. Recommendations for grid resolution
requirements are given, together with quantification of the resulting predictive accuracy. The
sensitivity of the results to subgrid-scale (SGS) model and varying Reynolds number is also investigated.
All simulations are carried out with second-order accurate finite-volume based solver. The choice
of numerical methods and SGS model is expected to influence the conclusions, but it is emphasized
that the proposed methodology, involving gPCE, can be applied to other modeling approaches as well.
