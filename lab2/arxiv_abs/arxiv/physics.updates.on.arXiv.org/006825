We generalize the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model for epidemics to take into account generic
effects of heterogeneity in the degree of susceptibility to infection in the population. We introduce
a single new parameter corresponding to a power-law exponent of the susceptibility distribution
that characterizes the population heterogeneity. We show that our generalized model is as simple
as the original model which is contained as a limiting case. Because of this simplicity, numerical
solutions can be generated easily and key properties of the epidemic wave can still be obtained exactly.
In particular, we present exact expressions for the herd immunity level, the final size of the epidemic,
as well as for the shape of the wave and for observables that can be quantified during an epidemic.
We find that in strongly heterogeneous populations the epidemic reaches only a small fraction of
the population. This implies that the herd immunity level can be much lower than in commonly used
models with homogeneous populations. Using our model to analyze data for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic
in Germany shows that the reported time course is consistent with several scenarios characterized
by different levels of immunity. These scenarios differ in population heterogeneity and in the
time course of the infection rate, for example due to mitigation efforts or seasonality. Our analysis
reveals that quantifying the effects of mitigation requires knowledge on the degree of heterogeneity
in the population. Our work shows that key effects of population heterogeneity can be captured without
increasing the complexity of the model. We show that information about population heterogeneity
will be key to understand how far an epidemic has progressed and what can be expected for its future
course.
