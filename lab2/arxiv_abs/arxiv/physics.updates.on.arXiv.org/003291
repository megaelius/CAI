Many biological and neural system can be seen as networks of interacting periodic processes. Importantly,
the function of these networks depends on the collective dynamics: Synchrony of oscillations is
probably amongst the most prominent examples of collective behavior and has been associated both
with function and dysfunction. Understanding how network structure and interactions, as well
as the microscopic properties of individual units, shape the emergent collective dynamics is critical
to find factors that lead to malfunction. However, many biological systems such as the brain consist
of a large number of dynamical units. Hence, their analysis has either primarily relied on simplified
heuristic models on a coarse scale, or the analysis comes at a huge computational cost. Here we review
recently introduced approaches - commonly known as the Ott-Antonsen and Watanabe-Strogatz reductions
- that allow to simplify the analysis by bridging small and large scales: To obtain reduced model
equations, a subpopulation in an oscillator network is replaced by a single variable that describes
its collective state exactly. The resulting equations are next-generation models: Rather than
being heuristic, they capture microscopic properties of the underlying system. At the same time,
they are sufficiently simple to analyze without great computational effort. In the last decade,
these reduction methods have become instrumental to understand how network structure and interaction
shapes the collective dynamics and the emergence of synchrony. We review this progress based on
concrete examples and outline possible limitations. Finally, we discuss how linking the reduced
models with experimental data can guide the way towards the development of new treatment approaches,
for example, for neural disease.
