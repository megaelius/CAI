Monolithic active pixel sensors produced in High Voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) technology are being considered
for High Energy Physics applications due to the ease of production and the reduced costs. Such technology
is especially appealing when large areas to be covered and material budget are concerned. This is
the case of the outermost pixel layers of the future ATLAS tracking detector for the HL-LHC. For experiments
at hadron colliders, radiation hardness is a key requirement which is not fulfilled by standard
CMOS sensor designs that collect charge by diffusion. This issue has been addressed by depleted
active pixel sensors in which electronics are embedded into a large deep implantation ensuring
uniform charge collection by drift. Very first small prototypes of hybrid depleted active pixel
sensors have already shown a radiation hardness compatible with the ATLAS requirements. Nevertheless,
to compete with the present hybrid solutions a further reduction in costs achievable by a fully monolithic
design is desirable. The H35DEMO is a large electrode full reticle demonstrator chip produced in
AMS 350 nm HV-CMOS technology by the collaboration of Karlsruher Institut f\"ur Technologie (KIT),
Institut de F\'isica d'Altes Energies (IFAE), University of Liverpool and University of Geneva.
It includes two large monolithic pixel matrices which can be operated standalone. One of these two
matrices has been characterised at beam test before and after irradiation with protons and neutrons.
Results demonstrated the feasibility of producing radiation hard large area fully monolithic
pixel sensors in HV-CMOS technology. H35DEMO chips with a substrate resistivity of 200$\Omega$
cm irradiated with neutrons showed a radiation hardness up to a fluence of $10^{15}$n$_{eq}$cm$^{-2}$
with a hit efficiency of about 99% and a noise occupancy lower than $10^{-6}$ hits in a LHC bunch crossing
of 25ns at 150V.
