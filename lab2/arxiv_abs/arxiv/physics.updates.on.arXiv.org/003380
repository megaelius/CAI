Objective: Arterial stiffness is an important marker to predict cardio vascular events. Common
measurement techniques to determine the condition of the aorta are limited to the acquisition of
the arterial pulse wave at the extremities. The goal of this work is to enable non-invasive measurements
of the aortic pulse wave velocity, instead. An additional aim is to extract further information,
related to the conditions of the aorta, from the pulse wave signal instead of only its velocity. Methods:
After discussing the problems of common pulse wave analysis procedures, an approach to determine
the frequency response of the aorta is presented. Therefore, the aorta is modelled as an electrical
equivalent circuit. To determine the specific numeric values of this system, a measurement approach
is presented, which is based on non-invasive bioimpedance plethysmography measurements above
the aortic arch and at the inguinal region. The conversion of the measurement results to the system
parameters is realized by a digital algorithm, which is proposed in this work as well. To evaluate
the approach, a study on three subjects is performed. Results: The measurement results demonstrate
that the proposed approach yields realistic frequency responses. For better approximation of
the aortic system function, more complex models are recommended to investigate in the future. Since
this study is limited to three subjects without a ground truth, further measurements will be necessary.
Significance: The proposed approach could solve problems of current methods to determine the condition
of the aorta. Its application is non-invasive, harmless and easy to execute.
