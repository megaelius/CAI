We study effective two- and three-body interactions between non-active colloidal inclusions
in an active bath of chiral or non-chiral particles, using Brownian Dynamics simulations within
a standard, two-dimensional model of disk-shaped inclusions and active particles. In a non-chiral
active bath, we first corroborate previous findings on effective two-body repulsion mediated
between the inclusions by elucidating the detailed non-monotonic features of the two-body force
profiles, including a primary maximum, and a secondary hump at larger separations that was not previously
reported. We then show that these features arise directly from the formation, and sequential overlaps,
of circular layers (or 'rings') of active particles around the inclusions, as the latter are brought
to small surface separations. These rings extend to radial distances of a few active-particle radii
from the surface of inclusions, giving the hard-core inclusions relatively thick, soft, repulsive
'shoulders', whose multiple overlaps then enable significant (non-pairwise) three-body forces
in both non-chiral and chiral active baths. The resulting three-body forces can even exceed the
two-body forces in magnitude and display distinct repulsive and attractive regimes at intermediate
to large self-propulsion strengths. In a chiral active bath, we show that, while active particles
still tend to accumulate at the immediate vicinity of the inclusions, they exhibit strong depletion
from the intervening region between the inclusions, and partial depletion from relatively thick,
circular, zones further away from the inclusions. In this case, the effective, predominantly repulsive,
interactions between the inclusions turn to active, chirality-induced, depletion-type attractions,
acting over an extended range of separations.
