We present the results of numerical simulations and experimental studies about the effects of resonant
and random excitations on proton losses, emittances, and beam distributions in the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). In addition to shedding light on complex nonlinear effects, these studies are applied
to the design of hollow electron lenses (HEL) for active beam halo control. In the High-Luminosity
Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), a considerable amount of energy will be stored in the beam tails.
To control and clean the beam halo, the installation of two hollow electron lenses, one per beam,
is being considered. In standard electron-lens operation, a proton bunch sees the same electron
current at every revolution. Pulsed electron beam operation (i.e., different currents for different
turns) is also considered, because it can widen the range of achievable halo removal rates. For an
axially symmetric electron beam, only protons in the halo are excited. If a residual field is present
at the location of the beam core, these particles are exposed to time-dependent transverse kicks
and to noise. We discuss the numerical simulations and the experiments conducted in 2016 and 2017
at injection energy in the LHC. The excitation patterns were generated by the transverse feedback
and damping system, which acted as a flexible source of dipole kicks. Proton beam losses, emittances,
and transverse distributions were recorded as a function of excitation patterns and strengths.
The resonant excitations induced rich dynamical effects and nontrivial changes of the beam distributions,
which, to our knowledge, have not previously been observed and studied in this detail. We conclude
with a discussion of the tolerable and achievable residual fields and proposals for further studies.
