We present a positivity preserving variational scheme for the phase-field modeling of incompressible
two-phase flows with high density ratio and using meshes of arbitrary topology. The variational
finite element technique relies on the Allen-Cahn phase-field equation for capturing the phase
interface on a fixed mesh with a mass conservative and energy-stable discretization. Mass is conserved
by enforcing a Lagrange multiplier which has both temporal and spatial dependence on the solution
of the phase-field equation. The spatial part of the Lagrange multiplier is written as a mid-point
approximation to make the scheme energy-stable. This enables us to form a conservative, energy-stable
and positivity preserving scheme. The proposed variational technique reduces spurious and unphysical
oscillations in the solution while maintaining second-order spatial accuracy. To model a generic
two-phase free-surface flow, we couple the Allen-Cahn phase-field equation with the Navier-Stokes
equations. Comparison of results between standard linear stabilized finite element method and
the present variational formulation shows a remarkable reduction of oscillations in the solution
while retaining the boundedness of the phase-indicator field. We perform a standalone test to verify
the accuracy and stability of the Allen-Cahn two-phase solver. Standard two-phase flow benchmarks
such as Laplace-Young law and sloshing tank problem are carried out to assess the convergence and
accuracy of the coupled Navier-Stokes and Allen-Cahn solver. Two- and three-dimensional dam break
problem are then solved to assess the scheme for the problem with topological changes of the air-water
interface on unstructured meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the phase-field solver for a practical
problem of wave-structure interaction in offshore engineering using general three-dimensional
unstructured meshes.
