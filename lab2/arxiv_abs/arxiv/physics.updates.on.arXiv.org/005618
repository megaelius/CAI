Data-driven turbulence modelling approaches are gaining increasing interest from the CFD community.
Such approaches generally aim to improve the modelled Reynolds stresses by leveraging data from
high fidelity turbulence resolving simulations. However, the introduction of a machine learning
(ML) model introduces a new source of uncertainty, the ML model itself. Quantification of this uncertainty
is essential since the predictive capability of data-driven models diminishes when predicting
physics not seen during training. In this work, we explore the suitability of Mondrian forests (MF's)
for data-driven turbulence modelling. MF's are claimed to possess many of the advantages of the
commonly used random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, whilst offering principled uncertainty
estimates. On a manufactured test case these claims are substantiated, providing feature selection
is first performed to remove irrelevant features from the training data. A data-driven turbulence
modelling test case is then constructed, with a turbulence anisotropy constant derived from high
fidelity data the quantity to predict. A number of flows at several Reynolds numbers are used for
training and testing. Irrelevant features are not found to be a problem here. MF predictions are
found to be superior to those obtained from a commonly used linear eddy viscosity model. Shapley
values, borrowed from game theory, are used to interpret the MF predictions. Predictive uncertainty
is found to be large in regions where the training data is not representative. Additionally, the
MF predictive uncertainty is compared to the uncertainty estimated from applying jackknifing
to random forest predictions, and to an a priori statistical distance measure. In both cases the
MF uncertainty is found to exhibit stronger correlation with predictive errors, which indicates
it is a better measure of prediction confidence.
