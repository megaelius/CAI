Understanding the dynamics of reciprocation is of great interest in sociology and computational
social science. The recent growth of Massively Multi-player Online Games (MMOGs) has provided
unprecedented access to large-scale data which enables us to study such complex human behavior
in a more systematic manner. In this paper, we consider three different networks in the EverQuest2
game: chat, trade, and trust. The chat network has the highest level of reciprocation (33%) because
there are essentially no barriers to it. The trade network has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%)
because it has the obvious barrier of requiring more goods or money for exchange; morever, there
is no clear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections. The trust network
has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates to sharing certain within-game assets
such as weapons, and so there is a high barrier for such connections because they require faith in
the players that are granted such high access. In general, we observe that reciprocation rate is
inversely related to the barrier level in these networks. We also note that reciprocation has connections
across the heterogeneous networks. Our experiments indicate that players make use of the medium-barrier
reciprocations to strengthen a relationship. We hypothesize that lower-barrier interactions
are an important component to predicting higher-barrier ones. We verify our hypothesis using predictive
models for trust reciprocations using features from trade interactions. Using the number of trades
(both before and after the initial trust link) boosts our ability to predict if the trust will be reciprocated
up to 11% with respect to the AUC.
