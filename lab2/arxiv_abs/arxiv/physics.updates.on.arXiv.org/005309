Temporary changes in precipitation may lead to sustained and severe drought or massive floods in
different parts of the world. Knowing variation in precipitation can effectively help the water
resources decision-makers in water resources management. Large-scale circulation drivers have
a considerable impact on precipitation in different parts of the world. In this research, the impact
of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) on seasonal precipitation over Iran was investigated. For this purpose, 103
synoptic stations with at least 30 years of data were utilized. The Spearman correlation coefficient
between the indices in the previous 12 months with seasonal precipitation was calculated, and the
meaningful correlations were extracted. Then the month in which each of these indices has the highest
correlation with seasonal precipitation was determined. Finally, the overall amount of increase
or decrease in seasonal precipitation due to each of these indices was calculated. Results indicate
the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), NAO, and PDO have the most impact on seasonal precipitation,
respectively. Also, these indices have the highest impact on the precipitation in winter, autumn,
spring, and summer, respectively. SOI has a diverse impact on winter precipitation compared to
the PDO and NAO, while in the other seasons, each index has its special impact on seasonal precipitation.
Generally, all indices in different phases may decrease the seasonal precipitation up to 100%.
However, the seasonal precipitation may increase more than 100% in different seasons due to the
impact of these indices. The results of this study can be used effectively in water resources management
and especially in dam operation.
