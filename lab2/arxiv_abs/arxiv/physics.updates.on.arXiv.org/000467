We present a comparative study of the spatial distribution of the spin density (SD) of the ground
state of CuCl2 using Density Functional Theory (DFT), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), and post-Hartree-Fock
wavefunction theory (WFT). A number of studies have shown that an accurate description of the electronic
structure of the lowest-lying states of this molecule is particularly challenging due to the interplay
between the strong dynamical correlation effects in the 3d shell of the copper atom and the delocalization
of the 3d hole over the chlorine atoms. It is shown here that qualitatively different results for
SD are obtained from these various quantum-chemical approaches. At the DFT level, the spin density
distribution is directly related to the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange introduced in hybrid functionals.
At the QMC level, Fixed-node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) results for SD are strongly dependent
on the nodal structure of the trial wavefunction employed (here, Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham with
a particular amount of HF exchange) : in the case of this open-shell system, the 3N -dimensional nodes
are mainly determined by the 3-dimensional nodes of the singly occupied molecular orbital. Regarding
wavefunction approaches, HF and CASSCF lead to strongly localized spin density on the copper atom,
in sharp contrast with DFT. To get a more reliable description and shed some light on the connections
between the various theoretical descriptions, Full CI-type (FCI) calculations are performed.
To make them feasible for this case a perturbatively selected CI approach generating multi-determinantal
expansions of reasonable size and a small tractable basis set are employed. Although semi-quantitative,
these near-FCI calculations allow to clarify how the spin density distribution evolves upon inclusion
of dynamic correlation effects. A plausible scenario about the nature of the SD is proposed.
