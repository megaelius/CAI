In a seminal article, \citet[J. Fluid Mech., 174:441-465]{maxey87} presented a theoretical analysis
showing that enhanced particle settling speeds in turbulence occur through the preferential sweeping
mechanism, which depends on the preferential sampling of the fluid velocity gradient field by the
inertial particles. However, recent Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) results in \citet[J. Fluid
Mech., 796:659--711]{ireland16b} show that even in a portion of the parameter space where this
preferential sampling is absent, the particles nevertheless exhibit enhanced settling velocities.
Further, there are several outstanding questions concerning the role of different turbulent flow
scales on the enhanced settling, and the role of the Taylor Reynolds number $R_\lambda$. The analysis
of Maxey does not explain these issues, partly since it was restricted to particle Stokes numbers
$St\ll1$. To address these issues, we have developed a new theoretical result, valid for arbitrary
$St$, that reveals the multiscale nature of the mechanism generating the enhanced settling speeds.
In particular, it shows how the range of scales at which the preferential sweeping mechanism operates
depends on $St$. This analysis is complemented by results from DNS where we examine the role of different
flow scales on the particle settling speeds by coarse-graining the underlying flow. The results
show how the flow scales that contribute to the enhanced settling depend on $St$, and that contrary
to previous claims, there can be no single turbulent velocity scale that characterizes the enhanced
settling speed. The results explain the dependence of the particle settling speeds on $R_\lambda$,
and show how the saturation of this dependence at sufficiently large $R_\lambda$ depends upon $St$.
