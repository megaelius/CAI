The Sagdeev pseudo-potential approach has been employed extensively in theoretical studies to
determine large-amplitude (fully) nonlinear solutions in a variety of multi-species plasmas.
Although these solutions are repeatedly considered as solitary waves (and even solitons), their
temporal stability has never been proven. In this paper, a numerical study of the Vlasov-Poisson
system is made to follow their temporal evolution in the presence of numerical noise and thereby
test their long-time propagation stability. Considering the ion-acoustic regime, both constituents
of the plasma, i.e. electrons and ions are treated following their distribution functions in these
set of fully kinetic simulations. The findings reveal that the stability of Sagdeev solution depends
on a combination of two parameters, i.e. velocity and trapping parameter. It is shown that there
exists a critical value of trapping parameter for both fast and slow solutions which separates the
stable from unstable solutions. In case of stable solutions, it is shown that these nonlinear structures
can propagate for long periods, which confirms their status as solitary waves. Stable solutions
are reported for both Maxwellian and Kappa distribution functions. For unstable solutions, it
is demonstrated that the instability causes the Sagdeev solution to decay by emitting ion-acoustic
wave-packets on its propagation trail. The instability is shown to take place in a large range of
velocity and even for Sagdeev solutions with velocity much higher than ion sound speed. Besides,
in order to validate our simulation code two precautionary measures are taken. Firstly, the well-known
effect of the ion dynamics on a stationary electron hole solution is presented as a benchmarking
test of the approach. Secondly, In order to verify the numerical accuracy of the simulations, the
conservation of energy and entropy are presented.
