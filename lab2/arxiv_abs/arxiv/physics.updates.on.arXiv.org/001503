We study measures of the amount of time required for transient flow in heterogeneous porous media
to effectively reach steady state, also known as the response time. Here, we develop a new approach
that extends the concept of mean action time. Previous applications of the theory of mean action
time to estimate the response time use the first two central moments of the probability density function
associated with the transition from the initial condition, at $t=0$, to the steady state condition
that arises in the long time limit, as $t \to \infty$. This previous approach leads to a computationally
convenient estimation of the response time, but the accuracy can be poor. Here, we outline a powerful
extension using the first $k$ raw moments, showing how to produce an extremely accurate estimate
by making use of asymptotic properties of the cumulative distribution function. Results are validated
using an existing laboratory-scale data set describing flow in a homogeneous porous medium. In
addition, we demonstrate how the results also apply to flow in heterogeneous porous media. Overall,
the new method is: (i) extremely accurate; and (ii) computationally inexpensive. In fact, the computational
cost of the new method is orders of magnitude less than the computational effort required to study
the response time by solving the transient flow equation. Furthermore, the approach provides a
rigorous mathematical connection with the heuristic argument that the response time for flow in
a homogeneous porous medium is proportional to $L^2/D$, where $L$ is a relevant length scale, and
$D$ is the aquifer diffusivity. Here, we extend such heuristic arguments by providing a clear mathematical
definition of the proportionality constant.
