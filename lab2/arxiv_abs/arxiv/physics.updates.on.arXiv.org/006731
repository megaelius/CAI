Visualization of three-dimensional morphological changes in the subcellular structures of a
biological specimen is one of the greatest challenges in life science. Despite conspicuous refinements
in optical nanoscopy, determination of quantitative changes in subcellular structure, i.e.,
size and thickness, remains elusive. We present an integrated chip-based optical nanoscopy set-up
that provides a lateral optical resolution of 61 nm combined with a highly sensitive quantitative
phase microscopy (QPM) system with a spatial phase sensitivity of $\pm$20 mrad. We use the system
to obtain the 3D morphology of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) combined with super-resolved
spatial information. LSECs have a unique morphology with nanopores that are present in the plasma
membrane, called fenestration. The fenestrations are grouped in clusters called sieve plates,
which are around 100 nm thick. Thus, imaging and quantification of fenestration and sieve plate
thickness requires resolution and sensitivity of sub-100 nm along both lateral and axial directions.
In the chip-based nanoscope, the optical waveguides are used both for hosting and illuminating
the sample. A strong evanescent field is generated on top of the waveguide surface for single molecule
fluorescence excitation. The fluorescence signal is captured by an upright microscope, which
is converted into a Linnik-type interferometer to sequentially acquire both super-resolved images
and quantitative phase information of the sample. The multi-modal microscope provided an estimate
of the fenestration diameter of 124$\pm$41 nm and revealed the average estimated thickness of the
sieve plates in the range of 91.2$\pm$43.5 nm for two different cells. The combination of these techniques
offers visualization of both the lateral size (using nanoscopy) and the thickness map of sieve plates,
i.e. discrete clusters fenestrations in QPM mode.
