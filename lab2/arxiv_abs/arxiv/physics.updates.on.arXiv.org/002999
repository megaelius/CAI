The study of elastic structures embedded with fluid-filled cavities received considerable attention
in fields such as smart materials, sensors, actuators and soft-robotics. This work studies an elastic
beam embedded with a set of fluid-filled bladders, similar to a honeycomb structure, which are interconnected
via an array of slender tubes. The configuration of the connecting tubes is arbitrary, and each tube
may connect any two bladders. Beam deformation both creates, and is induced by, the internal viscous
flow- and pressure-fields which deform the bladders and thus the surrounding solid. Applying concepts
from poroelasticity, and leveraging Cosserat beam large-deformation models, we obtain a set of
three coupled equations relating the fluidic pressure within the bladders to the large transverse
and longitudinal displacements of the beam. We show that by changing the viscous resistance of the
connecting tubes we are able to modify the amplitude of oscillatory deformation modes created due
to external excitations on the structure. In addition, rearranging tube configuration in a given
bladder system is shown to add an additional degree of control, and generate varying mode shapes
for the same external excitation. The presented modified Cosserat model is applied to analyze a
previously suggested energy harvester configuration and estimate the efficiency of such a device.
The results of this work are validated by a transient three-dimensional numerical study of the full
fluid-structure-interaction problem. The presented model allows for the analysis and design
of soft smart-metamaterials with unique mechanical properties.
