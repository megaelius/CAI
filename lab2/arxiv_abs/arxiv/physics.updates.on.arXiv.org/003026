The initiation and development of fractures in rocks is the key part of many problems from academic
to industrial, such as faulting, folding, rock mass engineering, reservoir characterization,
etc. Conventional ways of evaluating the fracture historical deformations depend on the geologists'
visual interpretation of indicating structures such as fault striations, fault steps, plumose
structures, etc. on the fracture surface produced by previous deformations, and hence suffer from
problems like subjectivity and the absence of obvious indicating structures. In this study, we
propose a quantitative method to derive historical shear deformations of rock fractures from digital
outcrop models (DOMs) based on the analysis of effects of fault striations and fault steps on the
shear strength parameter of the fracture surface. A theoretical model that combines effects of
fault striations, fault steps and isotropic base shear strength is fitted to the shear strength
parameter. The amount of fault striations and fault steps and their occurrences are estimated,
and the historical shear deformations can be inferred. The validity and the effectiveness of the
proposed method was proved by testing it on a constructed fracture surface with idealized striations
and a fracture surface with clear fault steps. The application of this method on an example outcrop
shows an intuitive idea of how the rock mass was deformed and that the distribution, occurrence and
mode of new fractures are strictly controlled by preexisting fractures, and hence emphasizes the
importance of preexisting fractures in modeling the development of fracture systems.
