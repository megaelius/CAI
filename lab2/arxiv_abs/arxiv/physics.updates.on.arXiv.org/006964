Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging functional and molecular imaging technology that has
attracted much attention in the past decade. Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics
research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the
motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization
using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study
the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation
and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the
system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity
and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing
of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols.
A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented.
Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement
to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application
in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems,
the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing.
With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described
most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for
PAI tests.
