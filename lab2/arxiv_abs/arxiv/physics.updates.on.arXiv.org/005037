Accurate description of the ionization process in DNA is crucial to the understanding of the DNA
damage under exposure to ionizing radiation, and the exploration of the potential application
of DNA strands in nano-electronics. In this work, by employing our recently developed Green's function
coupled-cluster (GFCC) library on supercomputing facilities, we have studied the spectral functions
of several guanine$-$cytosine (G$-$C) base pair structures ([G$-$C]$_n$, $n=1-3$) for the first
time in a relatively broad near-valence regime ([-25.0,-5.0] eV) in the coupled-cluster with singles
and doubles (CCSD) level. Our focus is to give a preliminary many-body coupled-cluster understanding
and guideline of the vertical ionization energy (VIE), spectral profile, and ionization feature
changes of these systems as the system size expands in this near-valence regime. The results show
that, as the system size expands, even though the lowest VIEs keep decreasing, the changes of spectral
function profile and the relative peak positions get unexpectedly smaller. Further analysis of
the ionized states associated with the most intensive peak in the spectral functions reveals non-negligible
$|2h,1p\rangle$'s in the ionized wave functions of the considered G$-$C base pair systems. The
leading $|2h,1p\rangle$'s associated with the main ionizations from the cytosine part of the G$-$C
base pairs feature a transition from the intra-base-pair cytosine $\pi\rightarrow\pi^\ast$
excitation to the inter-base-pair electron excitation as the size of G$-$C base pairs expands,
which also indicates the minimum quantum region in the many-body calculations of DNA systems.
