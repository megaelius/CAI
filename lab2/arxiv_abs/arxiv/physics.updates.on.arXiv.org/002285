Quantifying the mechanisms of tracer dispersion in the ocean remains a central question in oceanography,
for problems ranging from nutrient delivery to phytoplankton, to the early detection of contaminants.
Most previous analyses have been based on Lagrangian concepts of transport, often focusing on the
identification of features minimizing fluid exchange among regions, or more recently, on network
tools focussing on connectivity and transport pathways. Neither of these approaches, however,
allows the ranking of geographical sites with major water passage, and at the same time, to select
them so that they monitor waters coming from separate parts of the ocean. These are key criteria when
deploying an observing network. Here we address this issue by estimating the extent of the ocean
surface which transits through any point during a time window. With such information we rank the
sites with major fluxes that intercept waters originating from different regions. We show how this
allows optimizing an observing network, where a set of sampling sites can be chosen for monitoring
the largest flux of water dispersing out of a given region. When the analysis is performed backward
in time, this method allows us to identify the major sources which feed a target region. The method
is first applied to a minimalistic model of a mesoscale eddy field, and then to realistic satellite-derived
ocean currents in the Kerguelen area. In this region we identify the optimal location of fixed stations
intercepting the trajectories of 43 surface drifters, along with statistics on their temporal
persistence. We then identify possible hotspots of micro-nutrient enrichment for the recurrent
spring phytoplanktonic bloom occurring here. Promising applications to other fields, such as
larval connectivity, marine spatial planning or contaminant detection, are then discussed.
