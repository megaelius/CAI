High-resolution patterning of periodic structures over large areas has several applications
in science and technology. One such method, based on the long-known Talbot effect observed with
diffraction gratings, is achromatic Talbot lithography (ATL). This method offers many advantages
over other techniques, such as high resolution, large depth of focus, high throughput, etc. Although
the technique has been studied in the past, its limits have not yet been explored. Increasing the
efficiency and the resolution of the method is essential and might enable many applications in science
and technology. In this work, we combine this technique with spatially coherent and quasi-monochromatic
light at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths and explore new mask design schemes in order to enhance
its throughput and resolution. We report on simulations of various mask designs in order to explore
their efficiency. Advanced and optimized nanofabrication techniques have to be utilized to achieve
high quality and efficient masks for ATL. Exposures using coherent EUV radiation from the Swiss
light source (SLS) have been performed, pushing the resolution limits of the technique for dense
hole or dot patterning down to 40 nm pitch. In addition, through extensive simulations, alternative
mask designs with rings instead of holes are explored for the efficient patterning of hole/dot arrays.
We show that these rings exhibit similar aerial images to hole arrays, while enabling higher efficiency
and thereby increased throughput for ATL exposures. The mask designs with rings show that they are
less prone to problems associated with pattern collapse during the nanofabrication process and
therefore are promising for achieving higher resolution.
