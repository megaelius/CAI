In steady sediment transport, sediment deposition is balanced by entrainment of bed particles
by fluid forces or particle-bed impacts. Here we propose a proxy to determine the role of impact entrainment
relative to entrainment by the mean turbulent flow: the "bed velocity" $V_b$, which is an effective
near-bed-surface value of the average horizontal particle velocity that generalizes the classical
slip velocity, used in studies of aeolian saltation transport, to sediment transport in an arbitrary
Newtonian fluid. We study $V_b$ for a wide range of the particle-fluid-density ratio $s$, Galileo
number $\mathrm{Ga}$, and Shields number $\Theta$ using direct sediment transport simulations.
We find that transport is fully sustained through impact entrainment (i.e., $V_b$ is constant in
natural units) when the "impact number" $\mathrm{Im}=\mathrm{Ga}\sqrt{s+0.5}\gtrsim20$ or
$\Theta\gtrsim5/\mathrm{Im}$. These conditions are obeyed for the vast majority of transport
regimes, including steady turbulent bedload, which has long been thought to be sustained solely
through fluid entrainment. In fact, we find that transport is fully sustained through fluid entrainment
(i.e., $V_b$ scales with the near-bed horizontal fluid velocity) only for sufficiently viscous
bedload transport at grain scale (i.e., for $\mathrm{Im}\lesssim20$ and $\Theta\lesssim1/\mathrm{Im}$).
Finally, we do not find a strong correlation between, $V_b$, or the classical slip velocity, and
the transport-layer-averaged horizontal particle velocity $\overline{v_x}$, which challenges
the long-standing consensus that predominant impact entrainment is responsible for a linear scaling
of the transport rate with $\Theta$. For turbulent bedload in particular, $\overline{v_x}$ increases
with $\Theta$ despite $V_b$ remaining constant, which we propose is linked to the formation of a
liquid-like bed on top of the static-bed surface.
