Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive imaging technique which can indirectly
infer the microstructure of tissues and provide metrics which are subject to normal variability
across subjects. Potentially abnormal values or features may yield essential information to support
analysis of controls and patients cohorts, but subtle confounds affecting diffusion MRI, such
as those due to difference in scanning protocols or hardware, can lead to systematic errors which
could be mistaken for purely biologically driven variations amongst subjects. In this work, we
propose a new harmonization algorithm based on adaptive dictionary learning to mitigate the unwanted
variability caused by different scanner hardware while preserving the natural biological variability
present in the data. Overcomplete dictionaries, which are learned automatically from the data
and do not require paired samples, are then used to reconstruct the data from a different scanner,
removing variability present in the source scanner in the process. We use the publicly available
database from an international challenge to evaluate the method, which was acquired on three different
scanners and with two different protocols, and propose a new mapping towards a scanner-agnostic
space. Results show that the effect size of the four studied diffusion metrics is preserved while
removing variability attributable to the scanner. Experiments with alterations using a free water
compartment, which is not simulated in the training data, shows that the effect size induced by the
alterations is also preserved after harmonization. The algorithm is freely available and could
help multicenter studies in pooling their data, while removing scanner specific confounds, and
increase statistical power in the process.
