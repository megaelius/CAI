Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are ubiquitous in engineering and computational
sciences. The stochasticity arises as a consequence of uncertainty in input parameters, constitutive
relations, initial/boundary conditions, etc. Because of these functional uncertainties, the
stochastic parameter space is often high-dimensional, requiring hundreds, or even thousands,
of parameters to describe it. This poses an insurmountable challenge to response surface modeling
since the number of forward model evaluations needed to construct an accurate surrogate grows exponentially
with the dimension of the uncertain parameter space; a phenomenon referred to as the \textit{curse
of dimensionality}. State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional uncertainty propagation
seek to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by performing dimensionality reduction in the uncertain
parameter space. However, one still needs to perform forward model evaluations that potentially
carry a very high computational burden. We propose a novel methodology for high-dimensional uncertainty
propagation of elliptic SPDEs which lifts the requirement for a deterministic forward solver.
Our approach is as follows. We parameterize the solution of the elliptic SPDE using a deep residual
network (ResNet). In a departure from traditional mean squared error (MSE) loss function for training
the ResNet, we introduce a novel physics-informed loss function derived from variational principles.
Specifically, our loss function is the expectation of the energy functional of the PDE over the stochastic
variables. We demonstrate our solver-free approach on the steady state heat equation with high
dimensional random thermal conductivity in the order of 50 and 100 for one dimensional and two-dimensional
problem respectively.
