The paper provides a new understanding of light propagation and light-matter interactions by examining
the physical implications of group velocity and energy conservation equation. The classical definition
of group velocity has two flaws: (a) the group velocity can be greater than the phase velocity and
break Fermat's principle in a non-dispersive, lossless, non-conducting, anisotropic uniform
medium; (b) the definition is not consistent with the principle of relativity for a plane wave in
a moving isotropic uniform medium. To remove the flaws, a modified definition is proposed. A criterion
is set up to identify the justification of group velocity definition. A "superluminal power flow"
is constructed to show that the electromagnetic energy conservation equation (Poynting theorem)
cannot uniquely define the power flow if the principle of Fermat is not taken into account. It is indicated
that the group velocity is not a strict observable quantity in general cases because the physical
implication of the definition itself is ambiguous. As an application, associated basic concepts
in textbooks and experimental observations reported in recent research works are also reviewed,
including: why the traditional formulation of Fermat's principle has a limited application; how
the Fermat's principle is formulated for a plane wave; why the Fermat's principle is consistent
with Maxwell electromagnetic theory; what the significant difference is between energy conservation
equation and energy conservation law; why the physical explanations for "spatially structured"
photons in Giovannini-coworkers experiments are not consistent with the principle of relativity;
why the traditionally-argued invariance of information velocity contradicts Maxwell equations;
and why the superluminal light pulse propagation claimed in Wang-Kuzmich-Dogariu experiments
voilates Einstein causality.
