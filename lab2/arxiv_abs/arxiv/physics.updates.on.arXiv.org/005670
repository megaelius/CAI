The self-potential (SP) method is a passive geophysical technique, which may offer insights about
water and ionic fluxes in the vadose zone. The main obstacles presently prohibiting its routine
use in quantitative vadose zone hydrology are the superposition of signals arising from various
source mechanisms, difficult-to-predict electrode polarization effects that depend on electrode
design and age, as well as water saturation, pore water chemistry, clay content, and temperature
in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. We present a unique long-term SP monitoring experiment
focusing on the first four years of data acquired at different depths in the vadose zone within the
HOBE hydrological observatory in Denmark. Using state-of-the-art SP theory combined with flow
and transport simulations, we attempt to replicate the observed data and suggest reasons for observed
discrepancies. The predictions are overall satisfactory during the first six months of monitoring
after which both the patterns and magnitudes of the observed data change drastically. Our main observations
are (1) that predicted SP magnitudes are strongly sensitive to how the effective excess charge scales
with water saturation implying that continued research is needed to build more accurate models
of electrokinetic phenomena in unsaturated conditions, (2) that significant changes in electrode
polarization occur in the shallowest electrodes at time scales of a year, suggesting that electrode
effects cannot be ignored and that explicit electrode modeling should be considered in future monitoring
studies, and (3) that multi-rate mass transfer and reactive transport modeling are needed to better
predict salinity and pore water conductivity. We hope to stimulate other researchers to test new
SP modeling approaches and interpretation strategies against these data by making the SP and complimentary
data time-series available.
