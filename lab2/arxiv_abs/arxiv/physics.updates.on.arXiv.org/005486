We investigate the energy loss characteristics of warm dense matter (WDM) and dense plasmas concentrating
on the influence of electronic correlations. The basis for our analysis is a recently developed
ab initio Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) based machine-learning representation of the static local
field correction (LFC) [Dornheim et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 194104 (2019)], which provides an accurate
description of the dynamical density response function of the electron gas at the considered parameters.
We focus on the polarization-induced stopping power due to free electrons, the friction function,
and the straggling rate. In addition, we compute the friction coefficient which constitutes a key
quantity for the adequate Langevin dynamics simulation of ions. Considering typical experimental
WDM parameters with partially degenerate electrons, we find that the friction coefficient is of
the order of $\gamma/\omega_{pi}=0.01$, where $\omega_{pi}$ is the ionic plasma frequency. This
analysis is performed by comparing QMC based data to results from the random phase approximation
(RPA), the Mermin dielectric function, and the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj\"olander (STLS) approximation.
It is revealed that the widely used relaxation time approximation (Mermin dielectric function)
has severe limitations regarding the description of the energy loss properties of correlated partially
degenerate electrons. Moreover, by comparing QMC based data with the results obtained using STLS,
we find that energy loss properties are not sensitive to the inaccuracy of the static LFC at large
wave numbers $k/k_{F}>2$ (with $k_F$ being the usual Fermi wave number), but that a correct description
of the static LFC at $k/k_{F}\lesssim 1.5$ is important.
