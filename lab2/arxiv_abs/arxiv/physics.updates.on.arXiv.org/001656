The Alcator C-Mod mirror Langmuir probe system has been used to sample data time series of fluctuating
plasma parameters in the outboard mid-plane far scrape-off layer. We present a statistical analysis
of one second long time series of electron density, temperature, radial electric drift velocity
and the corresponding particle and electron heat fluxes. These are sampled during stationary plasma
conditions in an ohmically heated, lower single null diverted discharge. The electron density
and temperature are strongly correlated and feature fluctuation statistics similar to the ion
saturation current. Both electron density and temperature time series are dominated by intermittent,
large-amplitude burst with an exponential distribution of both burst amplitudes and waiting times
between them. The characteristic time scale of the large-amplitude bursts is approximately 15{\mu}s.
Large-amplitude velocity fluctuations feature a slightly faster characteristic time scale and
appear at a faster rate than electron density and temperature fluctuations. Describing these time
series as a superposition of uncorrelated exponential pulses, we find that probability distribution
functions, power spectral densities as well as auto-correlation functions of the data time series
agree well with predictions from the stochastic model. The electron particle and heat fluxes present
large-amplitude fluctuations. For this low-density plasma, the radial electron heat flux is dominated
by convection, that is, correlations of fluctuations in the electron density and radial velocity.
Hot and dense blobs contribute approximately 6% of the total fluctuation driven heat flux.
