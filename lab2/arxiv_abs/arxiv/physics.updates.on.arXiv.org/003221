Despite its ability to draw precise inferences from large and complex datasets, the use of data analytics
in the field of condensed matter and materials sciences -- where vast quantities of complex metrology
data are regularly generated -- has remained surprisingly limited. Specifically, such approaches
could dramatically reduce the engineering complexities of devices that directly exploit the physical
properties of materials. Here, we present a cyber-physical system for accurately estimating the
wavelength of any monochromatic light in the range of 325-1100nm, by applying Bayesian inference
on the optical transmittance data from a few low-cost, easy-to-fabricate thin film "filters" of
layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS2 and WS2. Wavelengths of tested monochromatic
light could be estimated with only 1% estimation error over 99% of the stated spectral range, with
lowest error values reaching as low as a few ten parts per million (ppm) in a system with only eleven
filters. By step-wise elimination of filters with the least contribution toward accuracy, mean
estimation accuracy of 99% could be obtained even in a two-filter system. Furthermore, we provide
a statistical approach for selecting the best "filter" material for any intended spectral range
based on the spectral variation of transmittance within the desired range of wavelengths. And finally,
we demonstrate that calibrating the data-driven models for the filters from time to time overcomes
the minor drifts in their transmittance values, which allows using the same filters indefinitely.
This work not only enables the development of simple cyber-physical photodetectors with high accuracy
color-estimation, but also provides a framework for developing similar cyber-physical systems
with drastically reduced complexity.
