Mercury's magnetosphere is known to be affected by enhanced ram pressures and magnetic fields inside
interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Here we report detailed observations of an ICME
compressing Mercury's dayside magnetosphere to the surface. A fast CME launched from the Sun on
November 29 2013 impacted first MESSENGER, which was orbiting Mercury, on November 30 and later
STEREO-A near 1 AU on December 1. Following the ICME impact, MESSENGER remained in the solar wind
as the spacecraft traveled inwards and northwards towards Mercury's surface until it reached and
passed its closest approach to the planet (at 371 km altitude) without crossing into the magnetosphere.
The magnetospheric crossing finally occurred 1 minute before reaching the planet's nightside
at 400 km altitude and 84$^\circ$N latitude, indicating the lack of dayside magnetosphere on this
orbit. In addition, the peak magnetic field measured by MESSENGER at this time was 40% above the values
measured in the orbits just prior to and after the ICME, a consequence of the magnetospheric compression.
Using both a proxy method at Mercury and measurements at STEREO-A, we show that the extremely high
ram pressure associated with this ICME was more than high enough to collapse Mercury's weak magnetosphere.
As a consequence, the ICME plasma likely interacted with Mercury's surface, evidenced by enhanced
sodium ions in the exosphere. The collapse of Mercury's dayside magnetosphere has important implications
for the habitability of close-in exoplanets around M dwarf stars, as such events may significantly
contribute to planetary atmospheric loss in these systems.
