Context. The observation of >100 MeV {\gamma}-rays in the minutes to hours following solar flares
suggests that high-energy particles interacting in the solar atmosphere can be stored and/or accelerated
for long time periods. The occasions when {\gamma}-rays are detected even when the solar eruptions
occurred beyond the solar limb as viewed from Earth provide favorable viewing conditions for studying
the role of coronal shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the acceleration of these particles.
Aims: In this paper, we investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of the coronal shocks inferred
from stereoscopic observations of behind-the-limb flares to determine if they could be the source
of the particles producing the {\gamma}-rays. Methods: We analyzed the CMEs and early formation
of coronal shocks associated with {\gamma}-ray events measured by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope
(LAT) from three eruptions behind the solar limb as viewed from Earth on 2013 Oct. 11, 2014 Jan. 06
and Sep. 01. We used a 3D triangulation technique, based on remote-sensing observations to model
the expansion of the CME shocks from above the solar surface to the upper corona. Coupling the expansion
model to various models of the coronal magnetic field allowed us to derive the time-dependent distribution
of shock Mach numbers and the magnetic connection of particles produced by the shock to the solar
surface visible from Earth. Results: The reconstructed shock fronts for the three events became
magnetically connected to the visible solar surface after the start of the flare and just before
the onset of the >100 MeV {\gamma}-ray emission. The shock surface at these connections also exhibited
supercritical Mach numbers required for significant particle energization. [...] (Abridged)
