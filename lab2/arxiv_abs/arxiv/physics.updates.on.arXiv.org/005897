Research in Theoretical Quantum Gravity has continued expansively even as it has become detached
from classic arbiters of research such as direct empirical falsification. This makes it an interesting
test case for social-scientific theories of what motivates and mediates contemporary scientific
research and the nature of scientific objectivity. For our empirical investigation, we conducted
50 semi-structured interviews with researchers in the rival camps of String Theory and Loop Quantum
Gravity, coded a subset for reoccurring themes, and subjected the resulting data to statistical
analysis. Theoretically, we mobilize aspects of Daston and Galison's depiction of the scientific
self and its relation to epistemic virtues, Pierre Bourdieu's field-centered account of social
space, and Kantian notions of aesthetics in order to delineate the subjective tastes and the related
process of collective consensus-making in contemporary quantum gravity research. We make two
key contributions. First, our analysis sheds light on the inner workings of the field by connecting
its internal epistemic struggles with relevant social-scientific theories. For example, we are
able to suggest an explanation for how one approach, String Theory, has become so dominant. Second,
our application of theories of social reproduction to the substance of scientific inquiry merits
some substantive generalizations to Daston and Galison's framework. Most significantly, we propose
as an addendum to their progression the notion of objectivity through intersubjectivity: objectivity
obtained not through the suppression of the self but by its (regulated) pluralistic expression
and performance.
