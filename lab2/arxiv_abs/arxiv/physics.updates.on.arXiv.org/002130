Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), are a convenient tool to study membrane-bound processes using
optical microscopy. An increasing number of studies highlights the potential of these model membranes
when addressing questions in membrane biophysics and cell biology. Among them, phase transitions
and domain formation, dynamics and stability in raft-like mixtures are probably some of the most
intensively investigated. In doing so, many research teams rely on standard protocols for GUV preparation
and handling involving the use of sugar solutions. Here, we demonstrate that following such a standard
approach can lead to abnormal formation of micron-sized domains in GUVs grown from only a single
phospholipid. The membrane heterogeneity is visualized by means of a small fraction (0.1 mol%)
of a fluorescent lipid dye. For dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine GUVs, different types of membrane
heterogeneities were detected. First, an unexpected formation of micron-sized dye-depleted
domains was observed upon cooling. These domains nucleated about 10 K above the lipid main phase
transition temperature, TM. In addition, upon further cooling of the GUVs down to the immediate
vicinity of TM, stripe-like dye-enriched structures around the domains are detected. The micron-sized
domains in quasi single-component GUVs were observed also when using two other lipids. Whereas
the stripe structures are related to the phase transition of the lipid, the dye-excluding domains
seem to be caused by traces of impurities present in the glucose. Supplementing glucose solutions
with nm-sized liposomes at millimolar lipid concentration suppresses the formation of the micron-sized
domains, presumably by providing competitive binding of the impurities to the liposome membrane
in excess. It is likely that such traces of impurities can significantly alter lipid phase diagrams
and cause differences among reported ones.
