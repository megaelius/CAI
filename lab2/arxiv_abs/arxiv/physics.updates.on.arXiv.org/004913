The equilibrium configuration of white dwarfs composed of a charged perfect fluid are investigated
in the context of the $f(R,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, for which $R$ and $\mathcal{T}$ stand for the
Ricci scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. By considering the functional
form $f(R, \mathcal{T})=R+2\chi \mathcal{T}$, where $\chi$ is the matter-geometry coupling
constant, and for a Gaussian ansatz for the electric distribution, some physical properties of
charged white dwarfs were derived, namely: mass, radius, charge, electric field, effective pressure
and energy density; their dependence on the parameter $\chi$ was also derived. In particular, the
$\chi$ value important for the equilibrium configurations of charged white dwarfs has the same
scale of $10^{-4}$ of that for non-charged stars and the order of the charge was $10^{20}$C, which
is scales with the value of one solar mass, i.e., $\sqrt{G}M_\odot\sim 10^{20}$C. We have also shown
that charged white dwarf stars in the context of the $f(R,\mathcal{T})$ have surface electric fields
generally below the Schwinger limit of $1.3\times 10^{18}$V/m. In particular, a striking feature
of the coupling between the effects of charge and $f(R,\mathcal{T})$ gravity theory is that the
modifications in the background gravity increase the stellar radius, which in turn diminishes
the surface electric field, thus enhancing stellar stability of charged stars. Most importantly,
our study reveals that the present $f(R,T)$ gravity model can suitably explain the super-Chandrasekhar
limiting mass white dwarfs, which are supposed to be the reason behind the over-luminous SNeIa and
remain mostly unexplained in the background of general relativity (GR).
