A central problem in the field of radiation therapy (RT) is how to optimally deliver dose to a patient
in a way that fully accounts for anatomical position changes over time. As current RT is a static process,
where beam intensities are calculated before the start of treatment, anatomical deviations can
result in poor dose conformity. To overcome these limitations, we present a simulation study on
a fully dynamic real-time adaptive radiation therapy (RT-ART) optimization approach that uses
ultra-fast beamlet control to dynamically adapt to patient motion in real-time. A virtual RT-ART
machine was simulated with a rapidly rotating linear accelerator (LINAC) source (60 RPM) and a binary
1D multi-leaf collimator (MLC) operating at 100 Hz. If the real-time tracked target motion exceeded
a predefined threshold, a time dependent objective function was solved using fast optimization
methods to calculate new beamlet intensities that were then delivered to the patient. To evaluate
the approach, system response was analyzed for patient derived continuous drift, step-like, and
periodic intra-fractional motion. For each motion type investigated, the RT-ART method was compared
against the ideal case with no patient motion (static case) as well as to the case without the use RT-ART.
In all cases, isodose lines and dose-volume-histograms (DVH) showed that RT-ART plan quality was
approximately the same as the static case, and considerably better than the no RT-ART case. The RT-ART
optimization framework has the potential to optimally deliver dose to a patient in a way that fully
accounts for anatomical changes due to motion. With continued advances in real-time patient motion
tracking and fast computational processes, there is significant potential for the RT-ART optimization
process to be realized on next generation RT machines.
