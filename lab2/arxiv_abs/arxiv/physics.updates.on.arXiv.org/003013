The urban transition, the increased ratio of urban to rural population globally and within countries,
is a hallmark of the 21st century. Our analysis of publicly available data from the World Bank spanning
several decades for ~195 countries show that across and within nations over time, per capita Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), energy use, and CO2 emissions are lowest in predominantly rural countries
(rural > urban pop.), increase rapidly across urbanizing countries (rural urban pop.) and are highest
in the most urban countries (rural < urban pop.). These trends coincide with changes in employment
by sector and gender. Rural economies are based largely on employment in the resource-extraction
sector, which includes agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and mining. In urbanizing nations,
male employment is predominantly in the industrial sector, including public utilities, while
female employment is higher in service-based than resource-based economies. In the most urban
nations, service economies predominate with some countries employing 90% of women and 65% of men
in the service sector. Our analysis shows that per capita GDP, energy use, and CO2 emissions increase
by over two orders of magnitude from low-income, resource-based rural countries to high-income,
urbanized countries with predominantly service economies. Data from the U.S. over the past 200
years illuminate a socio-metabolic urban transition similar to that seen globally in recent decades
across countries and through time. Our study suggests that increased energy demand and climate
consequences of burning fossil fuels will continue to accompany a rapidly urbanizing planet posing
major challenges for global sustainability.
