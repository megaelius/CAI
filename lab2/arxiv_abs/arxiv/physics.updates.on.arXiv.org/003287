A growing body of applied mathematics literature in recent years has focussed on the application
of fractional calculus to problems of anomalous transport. In these analyses, the anomalous transport
(of charge, tracers, fluid, etc.) is presumed attributable to long-range correlations of material
properties within an inherently complex, and in some cases self-similar, conducting medium. Rather
than considering an exquisitely discretized (and computationally intractable) representation
of the medium, the complex and spatially correlated heterogeneity is represented through reformulation
of the PDE governing the relevant transport physics such that its coefficients are, instead, smooth
but paired with fractional-order space derivatives. Here we apply these concepts to the scalar
Helmholtz equation and its use in electromagnetic interrogation of Earth's interior through the
magnetotelluric method. We outline a practical algorithm for solving the Helmholtz equation using
spectral methods coupled with finite element discretization. Execution of this algorithm for
the magnetotelluric problem reveals several interesting features observable in field data: long--range
correlation of the predicted electromagnetic fields; a power-law relationship between the squared
impedance amplitude and squared wavenumber whose slope is a function of the fractional exponent
within the governing Helmholtz equation; and, a non-constant apparent resistivity spectrum whose
variability arises solely from the fractional exponent. In geologic settings characterized by
self--similarity (e.g. fracture systems; thick and richly-textured sedimentary sequences,
etc.) we posit that diagnostics are useful for geologic characterization of features far below
the typical resolution limit of electromagnetic methods in geophysics.
