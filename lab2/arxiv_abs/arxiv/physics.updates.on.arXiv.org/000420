Recent numerical results on advection dynamics have shown that particles denser than the fluid
can remain trapped indefinitely in a bounded region of an open fluid flow. Here, we investigate this
counterintuitive phenomenon both numerically and analytically to establish the conditions under
which the underlying particle-trapping attractors can form. We focus on a two-dimensional open
flow composed of a pair of vortices and its specular image, which is a system we represent as a vortex
pair plus a wall along the symmetry line. Considering particles that are much denser than the fluid,
we show that two point attractors form in the neighborhood of the vortex pair provided that the particle
Stokes number is smaller than a critical value of order unity. In the absence of the wall, the boundaries
of the basins of the attracting points are smooth. When the wall is present, the point attractors
describe counter-rotating ellipses in this frame, with a period equal to half the period of one isolated
vortex pair. However, their boundaries are shown to become fractal if the distance to the wall is
smaller than a critical distance that scales with the inverse square root of the Stokes number. This
transformation is related to the breakdown of a separatrix that gives rise to a heteroclinic tangle
close to the vortices, which we describe using a Melnikov function. For an even smaller distance
to the wall, we demonstrate that a second separatrix breaks down and a new heteroclinic tangle forms
farther away from the vortices. Particles released in the open part of the flow can approach the attractors
and be trapped permanently provided that they cross the two separatrices. Furthermore, the trapping
of heavy particles from the open flow is shown to be robust to the presence of gravity, viscosity,
and noise.
