Coupling phase-stable single-cycle terahertz (THz) pulses to scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) junctions enables spatio-temporal imaging with femtosecond temporal and \r{A}ngstrom
spatial resolution. The time resolution achieved in such THz-gated STM is ultimately limited by
the sub-cycle temporal variation of the tip-enhanced THz field acting as an ultrafast voltage pulse,
and hence by the ability to feed high-frequency, broadband THz pulses into the junction. Here, we
report on the coupling of ultrabroadband (1-30 THz) single-cycle THz pulses from a spintronic THz
emitter(STE) into a metallic STM junction. We demonstrate broadband phase-resolved detection
of the THz voltage transient directly in the STM junction via THz-field-induced modulation of ultrafast
photocurrents. Comparison to the unperturbed far-field THz waveform reveals the antenna response
of the STM tip. Despite tip-induced low-pass filtering, frequencies up to 15 THz can be detected
in the tip-enhanced near-field, resulting in THz transients with a half-cycle period of 115 fs.
We further demonstrate simple polarity control of the THz bias via the STE magnetization, and show
that up to 2 V THz bias at 1 MHz repetition rate can be achieved in the current setup. Finally, we find
a nearly constant THz voltage and waveform over a wide range of tip-sample distances, which by comparison
to numerical simulations confirms the quasi-static nature of the THz pulses. Our results demonstrate
the suitability of spintronic THz emitters for ultrafast THz-STM with unprecedented bandwidth
of the THz bias, and provide insight into the femtosecond response of defined nanoscale junctions.
