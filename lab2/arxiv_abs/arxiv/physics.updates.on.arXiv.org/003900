Engineering simulators used for steady-state multiphase pipe flows are commonly utilized to predict
pressure drop. Such simulators are typically based on either empirical correlations or first-principles
mechanistic models. The simulators allow evaluating the pressure drop in multiphase pipe flow
with acceptable accuracy. However, the only shortcoming of these correlations and mechanistic
models is their applicability. In order to extend the applicability and the accuracy of the existing
accessible methods, a method of pressure drop calculation in the pipeline is proposed. The method
is based on well segmentation and calculation of the pressure gradient in each segment using three
surrogate models based on Machine Learning algorithms trained on a representative lab data set
from the open literature. The first model predicts the value of a liquid holdup in the segment, the
second one determines the flow pattern, and the third one is used to estimate the pressure gradient.
To build these models, several ML algorithms are trained such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network, and their predictive abilities
are cross-compared. The proposed method for pressure gradient calculation yields $R^2 = 0.95$
by using the Gradient Boosting algorithm as compared with $R^2 = 0.92$ in case of Mukherjee and Brill
correlation and $R^2 = 0.91$ when a combination of Ansari and Xiao mechanistic models is utilized.
The method for pressure drop prediction is also validated on three real field cases. Validation
indicates that the proposed model yields the following coefficients of determination: $R^2 = 0.806,
0.815$ and 0.99 as compared with the highest values obtained by commonly used techniques: $R^2 =
0.82$ (Beggs and Brill correlation), $R^2 = 0.823$ (Mukherjee and Brill correlation) and $R^2 =
0.98$ (Beggs and Brill correlation).
