Lubricant-infused surfaces (LIS) can promote stable dropwise condensation and improve heat transfer
rates due to a low nucleation energy barrier and high droplet mobility. Yet nucleation dynamics
on a non-uniform lubricant film on LIS during condensation are not well understood. Previous work
demonstrated a dynamic re-distribution of the lubricant film during condensation, leading to
oil-rich and oil-poor regions. In this work, we study water vapor condensation with nitrogen as
carrier gas on LIS infused with Krytox oils of different viscosity within a custom-built chamber
at various gas temperatures. We combine high-speed imaging and optical microscopy to determine
the apparent (droplet size ~ 1 {\mu}m) nucleation rate and density on LIS. We show that nucleation
predominantly occurs in oil-poor regions where the oil-vapor interfacial temperature is lower
than in oil-rich regions. This small temperature difference is enough to cause a significantly
lower nucleation free-energy barrier in the oil-poor regions, leading to enhanced nucleation.
The relative area ratio of oil-poor regions to total surface area, i.e., preferred area for nucleation,
can be tailored between 11% and 19% by changing the lubricant viscosity from 1627 to 73 cP. We statistically
analyze the influence of lubricant viscosity on the new emerging droplets on LIS at a wide range of
gas-substrate temperature differences. The results show that the nucleation rate density dramatically
increases with this temperature difference. More importantly, a strong dependence of nucleation
rate density on lubricant viscosity is discovered, which means that higher heat transfer rates
can potentially be achieved by lowering lubricant viscosity. We attribute the enhanced nucleation
primarily to enhanced droplet mobility and more frequent surface refreshing at lower lubricant
viscosity.
