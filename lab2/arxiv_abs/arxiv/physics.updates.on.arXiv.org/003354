In the early 1990s, contemporary interstellar dust penetrating deep into the heliosphere was identified
with the in-situ dust detector on board the Ulysses spacecraft. Later on, interstellar dust was
also identified in the data sets measured with dust instruments on board Galileo, Cassini and Helios.
Ulysses monitored the interstellar dust stream at high ecliptic latitudes for about 16 years. The
three other spacecraft data sets were obtained in the ecliptic plane and cover much shorter time
intervals.We compare in-situ interstellar dust measurements obtained with these four spacecrafts,
published in the literature, with predictions of a state-of-the-art model for the dynamics of interstellar
dust in the inner solar system (Interplanetary Meteoroid environment for EXploration, IMEX),
in order to test the reliability of the model predictions. Micrometer and sub-micrometer sized
dust particles are subject to solar gravity and radiation pressure as well as to the Lorentz force
on a charged dust particle moving through the Interplanetary Magnetic Field. The IMEX model was
calibrated with the Ulysses interstellar dust measurements and includes these relevant forces.
We study the time-resolved flux and mass distribution of interstellar dust in the solar system.
The IMEX model agrees with the spacecraft measurements within a factor of 2 to 3, also for time intervals
and spatial regions not covered by the original model calibration with the Ulysses data set. It usually
underestimates the dust fluxes measured by the space missions which were not used for the model calibration,
i.e. Galileo, Cassini and Helios. IMEX is a unique time-dependent model for the prediction of interstellar
dust fluxes and mass distributions for the inner and outer solar system. The model is suited to study
dust detection conditions for past and future space missions.
