Non-Hermiticity enriches topological phases beyond the existing framework for Hermitian topological
phases. Whereas their unusual features with no Hermitian counterparts were extensively explored,
a full understanding about the role of symmetry in non-Hermitian physics has still been elusive
and there has remained an urgent need to establish their topological classification in view of rapid
theoretical and experimental progress. Here we develop a complete theory of non-Hermitian topological
phases. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity ramifies the celebrated Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry
classification for insulators and superconductors. In particular, charge conjugation is unitary
rather than antiunitary due to the lack of Hermiticity, and hence chiral symmetry becomes distinct
from sublattice symmetry. It is also shown that non-Hermiticity enables a Hermitian-conjugate
counterpart of the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry class. Taking into account sublattice symmetry
or pseudo-Hermiticity as an additional symmetry, the total number of symmetry classes is 38 rather
than 10, which describe intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases as well as non-Hermitian random
matrices. Furthermore, due to the complex nature of energy spectra, non-Hermitian systems feature
two different types of complex-energy gaps, point-like and line-like vacant regions. On the basis
of these concepts and K-theory, we complete classification of non-Hermitian topological phases
in arbitrary dimensions and symmetry classes. Remarkably, multiple topological structures appear
for each symmetry class and each spatial dimension, which are also illustrated in detail with concrete
examples. Recently observed lasing and transport topological phenomena are categorized into
our classification. Our theory also provides topological classification of Hermitian and non-Hermitian
free bosons.
