Heat transport in the solar corona and wind is still a major unsolved astrophysical problem. Because
of the key role played by electrons, the electron density and temperature(s) are important prerequisites
for understanding these plasmas. We present such in situ measurements along the two first solar
encounters of Parker Solar Probe (PSP), between 0.5 and 0.17 AU from the Sun, revealing different
states of the emerging solar wind near solar activity minimum. These preliminary results are obtained
from a simplified analysis of the plasma quasi-thermal noise (QTN) spectrum measured by the Radio
Frequency Spectrometer (RFS/FIELDS). The local electron density is deduced from the tracking
of the plasma line, which enables accurate measurements, independent of calibrations and spacecraft
perturbations, whereas the temperatures of the thermal and supra-thermal components of the velocity
distribution, as well as the average kinetic temperature are deduced from the shape of the plasma
line. The temperature of the weakly collisional thermal population, similar for both encounters,
decreases with distance as $R^{-0.74}$, much slower than adiabatic. In contrast, the temperature
of the nearly collisionless suprathermal population exhibits a virtually flat radial variation.
The 7-second resolution of the density measurements enables us to deduce the low-frequency spectrum
of compressive fluctuations around perihelion, varying as $f^{-1.4}$. This is the first time that
QTN spectroscopy is implemented with an electric antenna length not exceeding the plasma Debye
length. As PSP will approach the Sun, the decrease in Debye length is expected to considerably improve
the accuracy of the temperature measurements.
