Tropical precipitation extremes are expected to strengthen with warming, but quantitative estimates
of future changes remain uncertain because of a poor understanding of changes in convective dynamics.
This uncertainty is addressed here by analyzing idealized convection-permitting simulations
of radiative-convective equilibrium in long-channel geometry. Across a wide range of climates,
the thermodynamic contribution to changes in instantaneous precipitation extremes follows near-surface
moisture, and the dynamic contribution is positive but small. The shapes of mass flux profiles associated
with precipitation extremes are determined by conditional sampling that favors strong vertical
motion at levels where the vertical saturation specific humidity gradient is large, and mass flux
profiles collapse to a common shape across climates when plotted in a moisture-based vertical coordinate.
The collapse implies a thermodynamic contribution that scales with near-surface moisture despite
substantial convergence in the free troposphere and allows the dynamic contribution to be defined
in terms of pressure velocity at a single level. Linking the simplified dynamic mode to vertical
velocities from a hierarchy of entraining plume models reveals that the small dynamic mode (<~2
%/K) is caused by opposing height-dependences of vertical velocity and density, together with
the buffering influence of cloud-base buoyancies that vary little with surface temperature. These
results reinforce an emerging picture of the response of extreme tropical precipitation rates
to warming: a thermodynamic mode of about 7 %/K dominates, with a minor contribution from changes
in dynamics.
