The possibility of constructing Lorenz's concept of available potential energy (APE) from a local
principle has been known for some time, but has received very little attention so far. Yet, the local
APE framework offers the advantage of providing a positive definite local form of potential energy,
which like kinetic energy can be transported, converted, and created/dissipated locally. In contrast
to Lorenz's definition, which relies on the exact from of potential energy, the local APE theory
uses the particular form of potential energy appropriate to the approximations considered. In
this paper, this idea is illustrated for the dry hydrostatic primitive equations, whose relevant
form of potential energy is the specific enthalpy. The local APE density is non-quadratic in general,
but can nevertheless be partitioned exactly into mean and eddy components regardless of the Reynolds
averaging operator used. This paper introduces a new form of the local APE that is easily computable
from atmospheric datasets. The advantages of using the local APE over the classical Lorenz APE are
highlighted. The paper also presents the first calculation of the three-dimensional local APE
in observation-based atmospheric data. Finally, it illustrates how the eddy and mean components
of the local APE can be used to study regional and temporal variability in the large-scale circulation.
It is revealed that advection from high latitudes is necessary to supply APE into the storm track
regions, and that Greenland and Ross Sea, which have suffered from rapid land ice and sea ice loss
in recent decades, are particularly susceptible to APE variability.
