During the last years, the new science of cities has been established as a fertile quantitative approach
to systematically understand the urban phenomena. One of its main pillars is the proposition that
urban systems display universal scaling behavior regarding socioeconomic, infrastructural
and individual needs variables. This paper discusses the extension of the universality proposition
by testing it against a broad range of urban metrics in a developing country urban system. We present
an exploration of the scaling exponents for over 60 variables for the Brazilian urban system. As
Brazilian municipalities can deviate significantly from urban settlements, functional cities
were selected based on a systematic density cut-off procedure and the scaling exponents were estimated
for this new subset of cities. To validate our findings we compared the results for overlaying variables
with other studies based on alternative methods. It was found that the analyzed socioeconomic variables
follow a superlinear scaling relationship with the population size, and most of the infrastructure
and individual needs variables follow expected sublinear and linear scaling, respectively. However,
some infrastructural and individual needs variables deviated from their expected regimes, challenging
the universality hypothesis of urban scaling. We propose that these deviations are a product of
top-down decisions/policies. Our analysis spreads over a time-range of 10 years, what is not enough
to draw conclusive observations, nevertheless we found hints that the scaling exponent of these
variables are evolving towards the expected scaling regime, indicating that the deviations might
be temporally constrained and that the urban systems might eventually reach the expected scaling
regime.
