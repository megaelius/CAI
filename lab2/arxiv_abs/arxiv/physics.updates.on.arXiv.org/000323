Detailed modeling and simulation of biochemical systems is complicated by the problem of combinatorial
complexity, an explosion in the number of species and reactions due to myriad protein-protein interactions
and post-translational modifications. Rule-based modeling overcomes this problem by representing
molecules as structured objects and encoding their interactions as pattern-based rules. This
greatly simplifies the process of model specification, avoiding the tedious and error prone task
of manually enumerating all species and reactions that can potentially exist in a system. From a
simulation perspective, rule-based models can be expanded algorithmically into fully-enumerated
reaction networks and simulated using a variety of network-based simulation methods, provided
that the network is not exceedingly large. Alternatively, rule-based models can be simulated directly
using particle-based kinetic Monte Carlo methods. This "network-free" approach produces exact
stochastic trajectories with a computational cost that is independent of network size. However,
memory and run time costs increase with the number of particles, limiting the size of system that
can be feasibly simulated. Here, we present a hybrid particle/population simulation method that
combines the best attributes of both the network-based and network-free approaches. The method
takes as input a rule-based model and a user-specified subset of species to treat as population variables
rather than as particles. The model is then transformed by a process of "partial network expansion"
into a dynamically equivalent form that can be simulated using a population-adapted network-free
simulator. The transformation method has been implemented within the open-source rule-based
modeling platform BioNetGen, and resulting hybrid models can be simulated using the particle-based
simulator NFsim.
