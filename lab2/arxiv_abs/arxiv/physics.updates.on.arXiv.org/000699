Single-pixel imaging (SPI) is a novel technique capturing 2D images using a photodiode, instead
of conventional 2D array sensors. SPI owns high signal-to-noise ratio, wide spectrum range, and
low cost. Various algorithms have been proposed for SPI reconstruction, including linear correlation
methods that consider measurements as the correlations between scenes and modulation patterns,
alternating projection methods treating measurements as zero-frequency coefficients of light
fields in Fourier space, and compressive sensing based methods introducing priors of natural images.
However, there is no comprehensive review discussing respective advantages, which is important
for SPI's further applications and development. In this paper, we reviewed and compared these algorithms
in a unified reconstruction framework. Besides, we proposed two other SPI algorithms including
a conjugate gradient descent based method aiming to fit measurement formation, and a Poisson maximum
likelihood based method utilizing photons' Poisson statistic. Experimental results on both simulated
and real captured data validate the following conclusions: to obtain comparable reconstruction
accuracy, the compressive sensing based total variation regularization method requires the least
measurements and consumes the least running time for small-scale reconstruction; the conjugate
gradient descent method and the alternating projection method run fastest in large-scale cases;
the alternating projection method is the most robust to measurement noise. In a word, there are trade-offs
between capture efficiency, computational complexity and noise robustness among different SPI
reconstruction algorithms. We have released our source code for non-commercial use.
