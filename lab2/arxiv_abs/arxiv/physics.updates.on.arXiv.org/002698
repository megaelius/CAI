We propose to couple a state-resolved rovibrational coarse-grain model to a stochastic particle
method for simulating internal energy excitation and dissociation of a molecular gas. An existing
coarse-grain model based on the NASA Ames ab initio database for the N2-N system is modified using
variably-spaced energy bins. Thermodynamic properties of the new coarse-grained model closely
match those of the full set of rovibrational levels over a wide temperature range, using a number
of bins much smaller than the complete mechanism. The chemical-kinetic behavior of the original
equally- and new variably- spaced bin formulations is compared by simulating excitation and dissociation
of N2 in an adiabatic, isochoric reactor. The variably-spaced formulation is better suited for
reproducing the dynamics of the full database at conditions of interest in Earth reentry. Furthermore,
we discuss details of our Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) implementation for the coarse-grain
model and describe changes to the collision algorithm necessary to accommodate our state-resolved
reaction mechanism. The DSMC code is then verified against equivalent master equation (ME) calculations.
In these simulations, state-resolved cross sections are used in analytical form. They verify micro-reversibility
for the bins and allow for faster execution of the code. In our verification, we obtain very close
agreement for the N and N2 concentrations, as well as the translational and rovibrational mode temperatures
obtained independently using both methods. In addition to macroscopic moments, we compare internal
energy populations predicted at selected time steps via DSMC and ME. We observe good agreement between
both methods within the statistical scatter limits imposed by DSMC. In future work, the rovibrational
coarse-grain model coupled to the particle method will allow us to study 3D reentry flow configurations.
