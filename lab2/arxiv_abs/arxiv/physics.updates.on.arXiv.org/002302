A systematic theoretical study of temperature-gradient-induced electrokinetic flow and electric
field of electrolyte solutions in a capillary is presented. The semi-analytical model for the fluid
flow and thermoelectric field are derived by solving the energy, Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes
equations simultaneously with the lubrication approximation. The temperature dependencies
of material properties, and the intrinsic Soret effect are taken into account. It is found that the
thermoelectric effect has three origins: first, the difference in the Soret coefficients of ions;
second, axial gradients of ion concentrations resulting from the temperature modified Boltzmann
distribution of ions; last, the fluid transport. The first origin prevails for lower $\zeta$ potentials
or wider capillaries, while the second dominates for higher $\zeta$ potentials and very narrow
capillaries. It is shown that electrolytes affect the thermoelectric field by altering four variables
relevant to ions, i.e. Soret coefficient difference $ \Delta S_T $, average Soret coefficient $
S_T $, normalized difference in diffusivities $ \chi $ and intrinsic Peclet number $ \Lambda $. The
thermoelectric fields due to the first two origins can cooperate with or cancel each other depending
on the sign of $ \zeta\Delta S_T $. Also, non-zero $ \chi $ can enhance or reduce the induced field depending
on the sign of $ \chi\zeta $. Furthermore, the overall flow can be decomposed into a thermoosmotic
flow (TOF) caused by an osmotic pressure gradient and dielectric body force and an electroosmotic
flow (EOF) due to the thermoelectric field. These two forms of flows may cooperate with or cancel
each other depending on the ratio of capillary radius to Debye length. It reveals that in contrast
to the conventional EOF, the TOF velocity $ \propto\zeta^2 $, and the thermal induced EOF velocity
$ \propto\zeta^{\nu}~(1<\nu<3)$.
