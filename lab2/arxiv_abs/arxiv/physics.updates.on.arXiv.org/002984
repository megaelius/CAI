Transitions between low-lying electron states in atoms of heavy elements lead to electromagnetic
radiation with discrete energies between about 0.1~keV and 100~keV (x rays) that are characteristic
of the element. Moseley's law --- an empirical relation first described by Moseley in 1913 which
supported predictions of the then-new Bohr model of atomic energy levels while simultaneously
identifying the integer atomic number $Z$ as the measure of nuclear charge --- predicts that the
energy of these characteristic x rays scales as $Z^2$. The foundational nature of Moseley's experiment
has led to the popularity of Moseley's law measurements in undergraduate advanced laboratory physics
courses. We report here observations of deviations from Moseley's law in the characteristic $K_{\alpha}$
x-ray emission of 13 elements ranging from $Z=29$ to $Z=92$. %: Cu, Rb, Mo, Ag, In, Ba, Tb, Ta, W, Pb,
Au, Pt, and U. While following the square-law predictions of the Bohr model fairly well at low $Z$,
the deviations become larger with increasing $Z$ (negligible probability of the Bohr model fitting
data by a $\chi^2$ test). We find that relativistic models of atomic structure are necessary to fit
the full range of atomic numbers observed (probability value of $0.20$ for the relativistic Bohr-Sommerfeld
model). As has been argued by previous authors, measurements of the relativistic deviations from
Moseley's law are both pedagogically valuable at the advanced laboratory level and accessible
with modern but modest apparatus. Here, we show that this pedagogical value can be be extended even
further --- to higher $Z$ elements, where the effects are more dramatically observable --- using
apparatus which is enhanced relative to more modest versions, but nevertheless still accessible
for many teaching laboratories.
