Nestedness is a property of interaction networks widely observed in natural mutualistic communities.
Despite a widespread interest on this pattern, no general consensus exists on how to measure it.
Instead, several metrics aiming at quantifying nestedness, based on different but not necessarily
independent properties of the networks, coexist in the literature blurring the comparison between
ecosystems. In this work, we present a detailed critical study of the behavior of six popular nestedness
metrics and the variants of two of them. In order to evaluate their performance, we compare the obtained
values of the nestedness of a large set of real networks among them and against a maximum entropy and
maximum likelihood null model. Our results point out, first, that the metrics do not rank the degree
of nestedness of networks universally. Furthermore, several metrics show significant undesired
dependencies on the network properties considered. The study of these dependencies allows us to
understand some of the systematic shifts between the real values of nestedness and the average over
the null model. This paper intends to provide readers with a critical guide on how to measure nestedness
patterns, by explaining the functioning of six standard metrics and two of its variants, and then
disclosing its qualities and flaws. By doing so, we also aim to extend the application of the recently
proposed null models based on maximum entropy to the still largely unexplored area of ecological
networks. Finally, to complement the guide, we provide a fully-documented repository named nullnest
which gathers the codes to produce the null model and calculate the nestedness index -- both the real
value and the null expectation -- using the studied metrics. The repository contains, moreover,
the main results of the null model applied to a large dataset of more than 200 bipartite networks.
