This investigation is a part of a research program aiming to characterize the extreme behavior possible
in hydrodynamic models by analyzing the maximum growth of certain fundamental quantities. We consider
here the rate of growth of the classical and fractional enstrophy in the fractional Burgers equation
in the subcritical and supercritical regimes. Since solutions to this equation exhibit, respectively,
globally well-posed behavior and finite-time blow-up in these two regimes, this makes it a useful
model to study the maximum instantaneous growth of enstrophy possible in these two distinct situations.
First, we obtain estimates on the rates of growth and then show that these estimates are sharp up to
numerical prefactors. This is done by numerically solving suitably defined constrained maximization
problems and then demonstrating that for different values of the fractional dissipation exponent
the obtained maximizers saturate the upper bounds in the estimates as the enstrophy increases.
We conclude that the power-law dependence of the enstrophy rate of growth on the fractional dissipation
exponent has the same global form in the subcritical, critical and parts of the supercritical regime.
This indicates that the maximum enstrophy rate of growth changes smoothly as global well-posedness
is lost when the fractional dissipation exponent attains supercritical values. In addition, nontrivial
behavior is revealed for the maximum rate of growth of the fractional enstrophy obtained for small
values of the fractional dissipation exponents. We also characterize the structure of the maximizers
in different cases.
