ePix10K is a hybrid pixel detector developed at SLAC for demanding free-electron laser (FEL) applications,
providing an ultrahigh dynamic range (245 eV to 88 MeV) through gain auto-ranging. It has three gain
modes (high, medium and low) and two auto-ranging modes (high-to-low and medium-to-low). The first
ePix10K cameras are built around modules consisting of a sensor flip-chip bonded to 4 ASICs, resulting
in 352x384 pixels of 100 $\mu$m x 100 $\mu$m each. We present results from extensive testing of three
ePix10K cameras with FEL beams at LCLS, resulting in a measured noise floor of 245 eV rms, or 67 e$^-$
equivalent noise charge (ENC), and a range of 11000 photons at 8 keV. We demonstrate the linearity
of the response in various gain combinations: fixed high, fixed medium, fixed low, auto-ranging
high to low, and auto-ranging medium-to-low, while maintaining a low noise (well within the counting
statistics), a very low cross-talk, perfect saturation response at fluxes up to 900 times the maximum
range, and acquisition rates of up to 480 Hz. Finally, we present examples of high dynamic range x-ray
imaging spanning more than 4 orders of magnitude dynamic range (from a single photon to 11000 photons/pixel/pulse
at 8 keV). Achieving this high performance with only one auto-ranging switch leads to relatively
simple calibration and reconstruction procedures. The low noise levels allow usage with long integration
times at non-FEL sources. ePix10K cameras leverage the advantages of hybrid pixel detectors with
high production yield and good availability, minimize development complexity through sharing
the hardware, software and DAQ development with all other versions of ePix cameras, while providing
an upgrade path to 5 kHz, 25 kHz and 100 kHz in three steps over the next few years, matching the LCLS-II
requirements.
