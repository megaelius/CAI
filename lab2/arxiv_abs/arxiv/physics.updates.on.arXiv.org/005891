The relationship between the topology of a network and specific types of dynamics unfolding on it
is an important topic in network science. One type of dynamics that has attracted increasing attention
because of its several implications is opinion formation. A phenomenon of particular importance
that is known to take place in opinion formation is the appearance of echo chambers, also known as
social bubbles. In the present work, we approach this phenomenon, with emphasis on the influence
of contrarian opinions, by considering an adaptation of the Sznajd dynamics of opinion formation
performed on several network models (Watts-Strogatz, Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, Random
Geometric Graph, and Stochastic Block Model). In order to take into account real-world social dynamics,
we implement a reconnection scheme where agents can reconnect their contacts after changing their
opinion. We analyse the relationship between topology and opinion dynamics by considering two
measurements: opinion diversity and network modularity. Two specific situations have been considered:
(i) the agents can reconnect only with others sharing the same opinion; and (ii) same as in the previous
case, but with the agents reconnecting only within a limited neighborhood. Several interesting
results have been obtained, including the identification of parameters that give rise to echo chambers.
Other cases are characterized not only by high diversity/high modularity, but also by low diversity/high
modularity. We also found that the restricted reconnection case reduced the chances of echo chamber
formation and also led to smaller echo chambers.
