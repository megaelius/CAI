Warm dense matter is present at the heart of gas giants and large exo-planets. Yet, its most basic
properties are unknown and limit our understanding of planetary formation and evolution. In this
state, where pressure climbs above 1 Mbar, matter is strongly coupled and quantum degenerate. This
combination invalidates most theories capable of predicting the equation of state, the viscosity
or heat conductivity of the material. When such properties are missing, understanding planetary
evolution becomes an arduous endeavor. Henceforth, research in this field is actively growing,
using high power laser or heavy ion beams to produce samples dense enough to overcome the 1 Mbar limit.
These samples are not actively confined and tend to expand rapidly, precluding the existence of
any thermodynamically stable equilibrium. However, a mega-ampere-class pulsed-power generator
can produce confined matter in the Mbar range, providing two conditions are being met. First, the
sample needs to be compressed cylindrically, to maximize magnetic pressure (compared to slab compression).
Second, a damper must be used to preclude the formation of a corona around the sample. This corona
robs the main sample from valuable current and limits the homogeneity of the compression. According
to numerical simulations, the setup proposed here, and called a magnetic anvil cell, can reach pressure
on the order of 1 Mbar using a mega-ampere pulsed power driver. These samples span several millimeters
in length. Unlike diamond anvil cell, which pressure is limited below 1 Mbar due to materials strength,
the magnetic anvil cell has virtually no pressure limit. Further, the current heats the sample to
several eV, a temperature well beyond diamond anvil cell capabilities.
