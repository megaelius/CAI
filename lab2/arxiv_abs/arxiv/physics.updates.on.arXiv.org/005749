The measurements of size distribution of small particles (e.g. dusts, droplets, bubbles, etc.)
are critical for a broad range of applications in environmental science, public health, industrial
manufacturing, etc. Laser diffraction (LD), a widely used method for such applications depends
on model-based inversion with underlying assumptions on particle properties. Furthermore, the
presence of sampling biases such as velocity differentials are often overlooked by the simple ex-situ
calibrations, which introduces as an additional source of error. In contrast, digital inline holography
(DIH), a single camera coherent imaging technique, can both measure particle size distributions
without the need for a model-based inversion and can directly provide information on the shape characteristics
of the particles. In this study, we evaluate the performance of an LD system in characterizing polydisperse
droplets produced in a flat fan spray using in-situ DIH based imaging as a reference. The systematic
differences in the two techniques are examined. A droplet-trajectory-based correction for the
LD-inferred size distributions is proposed to compensate for the observed differences. We validate
the correction using NIST standard polydisperse particles undergoing differential settling,
and then apply the correction to polydisperse spray droplet measurements. The correction improves
agreement between LD and DIH size distributions for droplets over two orders of magnitude, but with
LD still underestimating the fraction of droplets at sizes above ~1 mm. This underestimation is
possibly linked to the complex oscillatory and rotational motion of droplets which cannot be faithfully
captured by measurement or modelled by the correction algorithm without additional information.
