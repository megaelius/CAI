Identifying influential nodes in a network is a fundamental issue due to its wide applications,
such as accelerating information diffusion or halting virus spreading. Many measures based on
the network topology have emerged over the years to identify influential nodes such as Betweenness,
Closeness, and Eigenvalue centrality. However, although most real-world networks are modular,
few measures exploit this property. Recent works have shown that it has a significant effect on the
dynamics on networks. In a modular network, a node has two types of influence: a local influence (on
the nodes of its community) through its intra-community links and a global influence (on the nodes
in other communities) through its inter-community links. Depending of the strength of the community
structure, these two components are more or less influential. Based on this idea, we propose to extend
all the standard centrality measures defined for networks with no community structure to modular
networks. The so-called "Modular centrality" is a two dimensional vector. Its first component
quantifies the local influence of a node in its community while the second component quantifies
its global influence on the other communities of the network. In order to illustrate the effectiveness
of the Modular centrality extensions, comparison with their scalar counterpart are performed
in an epidemic process setting. Simulation results using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) model on synthetic networks with controlled community structure allows getting a clear idea
about the relation between the strength of the community structure and the major type of influence
(global/local). Furthermore, experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the merit of this
approach.
