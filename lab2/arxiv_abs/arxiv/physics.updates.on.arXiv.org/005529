The inference of chemical reaction networks is an important task in understanding the chemical
processes in life sciences and environment. Yet, only a few reaction systems are well-understood
due to a large number of important reaction pathways involved but still unknown. Revealing unknown
reaction pathways is an important task for scientific discovery that takes decades and requires
lots of expert knowledge. This work presents a neural network approach for discovering unknown
reaction pathways from concentration time series data. The neural network denoted as Chemical
Reaction Neural Network (CRNN), is designed to be equivalent to chemical reaction networks by following
the fundamental physics laws of the Law of Mass Action and Arrhenius Law. The CRNN is physically interpretable,
and its weights correspond to the reaction pathways and rate constants of the chemical reaction
network. Then, inferencing the reaction pathways and the rate constants are accomplished by training
the equivalent CRNN via stochastic gradient descent. The approach precludes the need for expert
knowledge in proposing candidate reactions, such that the inference is autonomous and applicable
to new systems for which there is no existing empirical knowledge to propose reaction pathways.
The physical interpretability also makes the CRNN not only capable of fitting the data for a given
system but also developing knowledge of unknown pathways that could be generalized to similar chemical
systems. Finally, the approach is applied to several chemical systems in chemical engineering
and biochemistry to demonstrate its robustness and generality.
