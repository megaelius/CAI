Robust and homogeneous lipid suppression is mandatory for coronary magnetic resonance angiography
(MRA) since coronary arteries are commonly embedded in fat. However, effective large volume lipid
suppression becomes challenging when performing radial whole-heart coronary MRA and the problem
may even be exacerbated at increasing magnetic field strengths. Incomplete fat suppression also
generates artifacts, and may affect advanced motion correction methods. The aim was to evaluate
a recently reported lipid insensitive MRI method for self-navigated coronary MRA at 3T. Lipid insensitive
binomial off resonant excitation (LIBRE) radiofrequency (RF) excitation pulses were included
into a self-navigated 3D radial GRE coronary MRA sequence at 3T. LIBRE was compared against conventional
fat saturation (FS) and binomial 1-180{\deg}-1 water excitation (WE). First, fat suppression
of all techniques was numerically characterized using Matlab and experimentally validated in
phantoms and in legs of human volunteers. Subsequently, free-breathing self-navigated coronary
MRA was performed using the LIBRE pulse as well as FS and WE in ten volunteers. Results obtained in
the simulations were confirmed by the experimental validations as LIBRE enabled near complete
fat suppression for 3D radial imaging in vitro and in vivo. For self-navigated whole-heart coronary
MRA at 3T, fat SNR was significantly attenuated using LIBRE compared with conventional FS. LIBRE
increased the RCA vessel sharpness significantly (37 +/- 9% (LIBRE) vs. 29 +/- 8% (FS) and 30 +/- 8%
(WE), both p<0.05) and led to a significant increase in the measured RCA vessel length to (83 +/- 31
mm (LIBRE) vs. 56 +/- 12 mm (FS) and 59 +/- 27 (WE) p<0.05). LIBRE enables robust large volume fat suppression
and significantly improves coronary artery image quality at 3T compared to the use of conventional
fat suppression and water excitation.
