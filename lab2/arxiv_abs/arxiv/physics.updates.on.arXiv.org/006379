CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology is likely to be widely deployed in coming decades in response
to major climate and economics drivers: CCS is part of every clean energy pathway that limits global
warming to 2C or less and receives significant CO2 tax credits in the United States. These drivers
are likely to stimulate capture, transport, and storage of hundreds of millions or billions of tonnes
of CO2 annually. A key part of the CCS puzzle will be identifying and characterizing suitable storage
sites for vast amounts of CO2. We introduce a new software tool called SCO2T (Sequestration of CO2
Tool, pronounced "Scott") to rapidly characterizing saline storage reservoirs. The tool is designed
to rapidly screen hundreds of thousands of reservoirs, perform sensitivity and uncertainty analyses,
and link sequestration engineering (injection rates, reservoir capacities, plume dimensions)
to sequestration economics (costs constructed from around 70 separate economic inputs). We describe
the novel science developments supporting SCO2T including a new approach to estimating CO2 injection
rates and CO2 plume dimensions as well as key advances linking sequestration engineering with economics.
Next, we perform a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of geology combinations (including formation
depth, thickness, permeability, porosity, and temperature) to understand the impact on carbon
sequestration. Through the sensitivity analysis we show that increasing depth and permeability
both can lead to increased CO2 injection rates, increased storage potential, and reduced costs,
while increasing porosity reduces costs without impacting the injection rate (CO2 is injected
at a constant pressure in all cases) by increasing the reservoir capacity.
