Lipid bilayer membranes are flexible thin laterally fluid films consisting of two unimolecular
layers of lipids. On spatial scales much larger than the bilayer thickness, the membrane elasticity
is well determined by its shape and adequately described by the classical Helfrich Hamiltonian.
However, various local membrane heterogeneities can result in a lipids tilt relative to the membrane
surface normal. On the basis of the elasticity theory, M. Hamm and M. M. Kozlov [M. Hamm and M. M. Kozlov,
Eur. Phys. J. E 3, 323 (2000)] derived the most general energy functional, taking into account the
tilt and bending. Recently, M. M. Terzi and M. Deserno [M. M. Terzi and M. Deserno, J. Chem. Phys. 147,
084702 (2017)] showed that Hamm and Kozlov's derivation is incomplete because of the missing of
the tilt-curvature coupling term. However, the energy functional derived by Terzi and Deserno
appeared to be unstable, thereby being invalid for applications. Here, we derive a stable elastic
energy functional, showing that the squared gradient of the curvature was missed in both of these
papers. This change in the energy functional arises from a more accurate consideration of the transverse
shear deformation terms and their influence on stability. We also consider the influence of the
pre-stress on the stability of the energy functional and show that the effective Gaussian curvature
should be neglected because of the stability requirements. We further generalize the theory, including
the stretching-compressing deformation modes, and provide the geometrical interpretation of
the terms that were previously missed by Hamm and Kozlov. The physical consequences of the new terms
are analyzed in the case of a membrane-mediated interaction of two amphipathic peptides located
in the same monolayer. We also provide the expression for director fluctuations, comparing it with
that obtained by Terzi and Deserno.
