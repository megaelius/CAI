High irradiance lasers incident on metal surfaces create a complex, dynamic process through which
the metal can rapidly change from highly reflective to strongly absorbing. Absolute knowledge
of this process underpins important industrial laser processes like laser welding, cutting, and
metal additive manufacturing. Determining the time-dependent absorptance of the laser light
by a material is important, not only for gaining a fundamental understanding of the light-matter
interaction, but also for improving process design in manufacturing. Measurements of the dynamic
optical absorptance are notoriously difficult due to the rapidly changing nature of the absorbing
medium. This data is also of vital importance to process modelers whose complex simulations need
reliable, accurate input data; yet, there is very little available. In this work, we measure the
time-dependent, reflected light during a 10 ms laser spot weld using an integrating sphere apparatus.
From this, we calculate the dynamic absorptance for 1070 nm wavelength light incident on 316L stainless
steel. The time resolution of our experiment (< 1 us) allows for the determination of the precise
conditions under which several important physical phenomena occur, such as melt and keyhole formation.
The average absorptances determined optically were compared to calorimetrically-determined
values, and it was found that the calorimeter severely underestimated the absorbed energy due to
mass lost during the spot weld. Weld nugget cross-sections are also presented in order to verify
our interpretation of the optical results, as well as provide experimental data for weld model validation.
