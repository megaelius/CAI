The plasmoid instability has revolutionized our understanding of magnetic reconnection in astrophysical
environments. By preventing the formation of highly elongated reconnection layers, it is crucial
in enabling the rapid energy conversion rates that are characteristic of many astrophysical phenomena.
Most of the previous studies have focused on Sweet-Parker current sheets, which, however, are unattainable
in typical astrophysical systems. Here, we derive a general set of scaling laws for the plasmoid
instability in resistive and visco-resistive current sheets that evolve over time. Our method
relies on a principle of least time that enables us to determine the properties of the reconnecting
current sheet (aspect ratio and elapsed time) and the plasmoid instability (growth rate, wavenumber,
inner layer width) at the end of the linear phase. After this phase the reconnecting current sheet
is disrupted and fast reconnection can occur. The scaling laws of the plasmoid instability are \emph{not}
simple power laws, and depend on the Lundquist number ($S$), the magnetic Prandtl number ($P_m$),
the noise of the system ($\psi_0$), the characteristic rate of current sheet evolution ($1/\tau$),
as well as the thinning process. We also demonstrate that previous scalings are inapplicable to
the vast majority of the astrophysical systems. We explore the implications of the new scaling relations
in astrophysical systems such as the solar corona and the interstellar medium. In both these systems,
we show that our scaling laws yield values for the growth rate, wavenumber, and aspect ratio that
are much smaller than the Sweet-Parker based scalings.
