Mechanoelectrical transduction in the inner ear is a biophysical process underlying the senses
of hearing and balance. The key players involved in this process are mechanosensitive ion channels.
They are located in the stereocilia of hair cells and opened by the tension in specialized molecular
springs, the tip links, connecting adjacent stereocilia. When channels open, the tip links relax,
reducing the hair-bundle stiffness. This gating compliance makes hair cells especially sensitive
to small stimuli. The classical explanation for the gating compliance is that the conformational
rearrangement of a single channel directly shortens the tip link. However, to reconcile theoretical
models based on this mechanism with experimental data, an unrealistically large structural change
of the channel is required. Experimental evidence indicates that each tip link is a dimeric molecule,
associated on average with two channels at its lower end. It also indicates that the lipid bilayer
modulates channel gating, although it is not clear how. Here, we design and analyze a model of mechanotransduction
where each tip link attaches to two channels, mobile within the membrane. Their states and positions
are coupled by membrane-mediated elastic forces arising from the interaction between the channels'
hydrophobic cores and that of the lipid bilayer. This coupling induces cooperative opening and
closing of the channels. The model reproduces the main properties of hair-cell mechanotransduction
using only realistic parameters constrained by experimental evidence. This work provides an insight
into the fundamental role that membrane-mediated ion-channel cooperativity can play in sensory
physiology.
