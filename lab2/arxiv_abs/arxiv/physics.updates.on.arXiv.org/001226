Turbulent flow separation induced by a protuberance on one of the walls of an otherwise planar channel
is investigated using Direct Numerical Simulations. Different bulge geometries and Reynolds
numbers - with the highest friction Reynolds number simulation reaching a peak of Re{\tau} = 900
- are addressed to understand the effect of the wall curvature and of the Reynolds number on the dynamics
of the recirculating bubble behind the bump. Most of the drag is due to the form contribution, whilst
the friction contribution does not change appreciably with respect to an equivalent planar channel
flow. The most bluff geometry has a larger recirculation region, whilst the Reynolds number increase
results in a smaller recirculation bubble and a shear layer more attached to the bump. The energy
introduced by the pressure drop follows two routes: part of it is transferred towards the walls to
be dissipated and part feeds the turbulent production hence the velocity fluctuations in the separating
shear layer. Spatial energy fluxes transfer the kinetic energy into the recirculation bubble and
downstream near the wall where it is ultimately dissipated. Consistently, anisotropy concentrates
at small scales near the walls irrespective of the value of the Reynolds number. In the bulk flow and
in the recirculation bubble, isotropy is restored at small scales and the isotropy recovery rate
is controlled by the Reynolds number. Anisotropy invariant maps are presented, showing the difficulty
in developing suitable turbulence models to predict separated turbulent flow dynamics. Results
shed light on the processes of production, transfer and dissipation of energy in this relatively
complex turbulent flow where non-homogeneous effects overwhelm the classical picture of wall
bounded turbulent flows which typically exploits streamwise homogeneity.
