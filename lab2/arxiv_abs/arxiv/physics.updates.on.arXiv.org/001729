Dual-energy CT (DECT) has been increasingly used in imaging applications because of its capability
for material differentiation. However, material decomposition suffers from magnified noise
from two CT images of independent scans, leading to severe degradation of image quality. Existing
algorithms achieve suboptimal decomposition performance since they fail to accurately depict
the mapping relationship between DECT and the basis material images. Inspired by the impressive
potential of CNN, we developed a new Butterfly network to perform the image domain dual material
decomposition due to its strong approximation ability to the mapping functions in DECT. The Butterfly
network is derived from the image domain DECT decomposition model by exploring the geometric relationship
between mapping functions of data model and network components. The network is designed as the double-entry
double-out crossover architecture based on the decomposition formulation. It enters a pair of
dual-energy images as inputs and defines the ground true decomposed images as each label. The crossover
architecture, which plays an important role in material decomposition, is designed to implement
the information exchange between the two material generation pathways in the network. Network
components exhibit different sensitivity to basis materials in the visualization. By analyzing
their sensitivity to different basis materials, we determined the roles of network components
in material decomposition. This visualization evaluation reveals what the network can learn and
verifies the rationality of network design. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations in material
decomposition of patient data indicate that the proposed network outperforms its counterpart.
