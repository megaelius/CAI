Direct numerical simulations of a temporally-developing, low-speed, variable-density, turbulent,
plane mixing layer are performed. The Navier-Stokes equations in the low-Mach number approximation
are solved using a novel algorithm based on an extended version of the velocity-vorticity formulation
used by Kim et al. (1987) for incompressible flows. Four cases with density ratios $s=1, 2, 4$ and
8 are considered. The simulations are run with a Prandtl number of 0.7 and achieve a $Re_\lambda$
up to 150 during the self-similar evolution of the mixing layer. It is found that the growth rate of
the mixing layer decreases with increasing density ratio, in agreement with theoretical models
of this phenomenon. Comparison with high-speed data shows that the reduction of the growth rates
with increasing the density ratio has a weak dependence with the Mach number. In addition, the shifting
of the mixing layer to the low-density stream has been characterized by analyzing one point statistics
within the self-similar interval. This shifting has been quantified, and related to the growth
rate of the mixing layer under the assumption that the shape of the mean velocity and density profiles
do not change with the density ratio. This leads to a predictive model for the reduction of the growth
rate of the momentum thickness, which agrees reasonably well with the available data. Finally,
the effect of the density ratio on the turbulent structure has been analyzed using flow visualizations
and spectra. It is found that with increasing density ratio the longest scales in the high density
side are gradually inhibited. A gradual reduction of the energy in small scales with increasing
density ratio is also observed.
