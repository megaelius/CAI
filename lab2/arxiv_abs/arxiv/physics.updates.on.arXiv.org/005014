Terahertz subwavelength imaging aims at developing THz microscopes able to resolve deeply subwavelength
features. To improve the spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit, a current trend is to
use various subwavelength probes to convert the near-field to the far-field. These techniques,
while offering significant gains in spatial resolution, inherently lack the ability to rapidly
obtain THz images due to the necessity of slow pixel-by-pixel raster scan and often suffer from low
light throughput. In parallel, in the visible spectral range, several super-resolution imaging
techniques were developed that enhance the image resolution by recording and statistically correlating
multiple images of an object backlit with light from stochastically blinking fluorophores. Inspired
by this methodology, we develop a Super-resolution Orthogonal Deterministic Imaging (SODI) technique
and apply it in the THz range. Since there are no natural THz fluorophores, we use optimally designed
mask sets brought in proximity with the object as artificial fluorophores. Because we directly
control the form of the masks, rather than relying on statistical averages, we aim at employing the
smallest possible number of frames. After developing the theoretical basis of SODI, we demonstrate
the second-order resolution improvement experimentally using phase masks and binary amplitude
masks with only 8 frames. We then numerically show how to extend the SODI technique to higher orders
to further improve the resolution. As our formulation is based on the equation of linear imaging
and it uses spatial modulation of either the phase or the amplitude of the THz wave, our methodology
can be readily adapted for the use with existing phase-sensitive single pixel imaging systems or
any amplitude sensitive THz imaging arrays.
