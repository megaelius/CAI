As relational datasets modeled as graphs keep increasing in size and their data-acquisition is
permeated by uncertainty, graph-based analysis techniques can become computationally and conceptually
challenging. In particular, node centrality measures rely on the assumption that the graph is perfectly
known -- a premise not necessarily fulfilled for large, uncertain networks. Accordingly, centrality
measures may fail to faithfully extract the importance of nodes in the presence of uncertainty.
To mitigate these problems, we suggest a statistical approach based on graphon theory: we introduce
formal definitions of centrality measures for graphons and establish their connections to classical
graph centrality measures. A key advantage of this approach is that centrality measures defined
at the modeling level of graphons are inherently robust to stochastic variations of specific graph
realizations. Using the theory of linear integral operators, we define degree, eigenvector, Katz
and PageRank centrality functions for graphons and establish concentration inequalities demonstrating
that graphon centrality functions arise naturally as limits of their counterparts defined on sequences
of graphs of increasing size. The same concentration inequalities also provide high-probability
bounds between the graphon centrality functions and the centrality measures on any sampled graph,
thereby establishing a measure of uncertainty of the measured centrality score. The same concentration
inequalities also provide high-probability bounds between the graphon centrality functions
and the centrality measures on any sampled graph, thereby establishing a measure of uncertainty
of the measured centrality score.
