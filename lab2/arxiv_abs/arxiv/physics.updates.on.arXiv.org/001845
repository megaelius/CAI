The generation of dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators has provided a route to
compact frequency combs of high repetition rate, which are amenable to chip-scale integration
and have already been employed for frequency synthesizers, ultrafast ranging, coherent telecommunications
and dual-comb spectroscopy. A particularly promising platform is photonic chip-scale microresonators
based on Si$_3$N$_4$, which can be integrated with on-chip lasers. Yet to date, soliton formation
in such Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators requires the use of external amplifiers, either due to low
quality ($Q$) factors or facet coupling losses. Moreover, these problems are compounded by the
difficulty in accessing soliton states. While additional amplifiers and single-sideband modulators
may overcome these challenges, for fully integrated Kerr soliton combs that combine a laser and
a Kerr microresonator on a single chip, it is essential to resolve these challenges, particularly
the power requirements. Here, we demonstrate ultralow-power single soliton formation in Si$_3$N$_4$
microresonators exhibiting $Q$ factors of $6.2\times10^6$ with 6.6 mW total input power (4.1 mW
in the waveguide) for devices of 1 THz repetition rate, using the photonic Damascene reflow process.
We also access single soliton states with simple laser tuning in eight consecutive resonances over
60 nm wavelength range. Moreover, we demonstrate single soliton formation at a record-low chip
input power of 48.6 mW with a repetition rate of 88 GHz---the lowest achieved for an integrated Si$_3$N$_4$
soliton comb, allowing applications such as ultrafast ranging and coherent communications. Our
results show the technological readiness of Si$_3$N$_4$ optical waveguides for future all-on-chip
nonlinear photonic devices with ultralow operating power.
