Cylindrical kilometre-scale artificial gravity space settlements were proposed by Gerard O'Neill
in the 1970s. The early concept had two oppositely rotating cylinders and moving mirrors to simulate
the diurnal cycle. Later, the Kalpana One concept exhibited passively stable rotation and no large
moving parts. Here we propose and analyse a specific light transfer solution for Kalpana One type
settlements. Our proposed solution is technically reliable because it avoids large moving parts
that could be single failure points. The scheme has an array of cylindrical paraboloid concentrators
in the outer wall and semi-toroidal reflectors at the equator which distribute the concentrated
sunlight onto the living surface. The living cylinder is divided into a number of $\varphi$-sections
(valleys) that are in different phases of the diurnal and seasonal cycles. To reduce the mass of nitrogen
needed, a shallow atmosphere is used which is contained by a pressure-tight transparent roof. The
only moving parts needed are local blinders installed below the roof of each valley. We also find
that settlements of this class have a natural location at the equator where one can build multi-storey
urban blocks. The location is optimal from the mass distribution (rotational stability) point
of view. If maximally built, the amount of urban floorspace per person becomes large, up to 25,000
m$^2$, which is an order of magnitude larger than the food-producing rural biosphere area per person.
Large urban floorspace area per person may increase the material standard of living much beyond
Earth while increasing the total mass per person relatively little.
