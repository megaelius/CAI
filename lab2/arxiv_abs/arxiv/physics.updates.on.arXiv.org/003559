Apparently random events in nature often reveal hidden patterns when analysed using diverse and
robust statistical tools. Power-law distributions, for example, project diverse natural phenomenon,
ranging from earthquakes1 to heartbeat dynamics2 onto a common platform of statistical self-similarity.
A large range of human languages are known to follow a specific regime of power-law distributions,
the Zipf-Mandelbrot law, in addition to showing properties like the Pareto principle and Shannon
entropy3,4. Animal behaviour in specific contexts have been shown to follow power-law distributions5,6.
However, the entire behavioural repertoire of a species has never been analysed for the existence
of underlying patterns. Here we show that the frequency-rank data of randomly sighted behaviours
at the population level of free-ranging dogs follow a scale-invariant power-law behaviour. While
the data does not display Zipfian trends, it obeys the Pareto principle and Shannon entropy rules
akin to languages. Interestingly, the data also exhibits robust self-similarity patterns at different
scales which we extract using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis7. The observed multifractal
trends suggest that the probability of consecutive occurrence of behaviours of adjacent ranks
is much higher than behaviours widely separated in rank. Since we observe such robust trends in random
data sets, we hypothesize that the general behavioural repertoire of a species is shaped by a syntax
similar to languages. This opens up the prospect of future multifractal and other statistical investigations
on true time series of behavioural data to probe the existence of possible long and short-range correlations,
and thereby develop predictive models of behaviour.
