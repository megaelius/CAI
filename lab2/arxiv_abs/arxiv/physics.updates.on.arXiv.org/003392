Bragg spectroscopy is one of the best established experimental methods for high energy resolution
X-ray measurements; however, this technique is limited to the measurement of photons producedfrom
well collimated (tens of microns) or point-like sources and becomes quite inefficient for photonscoming
from extended and diffused sources. The possibility to perform simultaneous measurementsof several
energies is strongly demanded when low rate signals are expected and single angular scansrequire
long exposure times. A prototype of a high resolution and high precision X-ray spectrometerworking
also with extended isotropic sources, has been developed by the VOXES collaboration atINFN Laboratories
of Frascati, using Highly Annealed Pyrolitic Graphite (HAPG) crystals in a semi- Von Hamos configuration,
in which the position detector is rotated with respect to thestandard Von Hamos one, to increase
the dynamic energy range. The aim is to deliver a cost effectivesystem having an energy resolution
at the level of eV for X-ray energies from about 2 keV up to tensof keV, able to perform sub-eV precision
measurements with non point-like sources. The proposedspectrometer has possible applications
in several fields, going from fundamental physics to quantummechanics tests, synchrotron radiation
and X-FEL applications, astronomy, medicine and industry.In particular, this technique is fundamental
for a series of nuclear physics measurements like, forexample, the energies of the exotic atoms
radiative transitions which allow to extract fundamentalparameters in the low energy QCD in the
strangeness sector. In this work, the working principleof the spectrometer is presented, together
with the tests and the results, in terms of resolution andsource, size obtained for Fe(K\alpha1,2),
Cu(K\alpha1,2), Ni(K\beta), Zn(K\alpha1,2), Mo(K\alpha1,2) and Nb(K\beta)lines.
