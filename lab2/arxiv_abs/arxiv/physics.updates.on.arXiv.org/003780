Vortex has been considered as the building block and muscle of turbulence for long time. A new physical
quantity called Liutex (previously named Rortex) has been defined as the rigid rotation part of
fluid motion. From DNS and experiment, forest of hairpin vortices has been found in flow transition
and low Reynolds turbulence, but more and more one leg vortices appear in fully developed turbulence.
This letter shows hairpin vortex is unstable. Hairpin vortex will weaken or lose one leg by the shear
and vortex interaction. This conclusion is made by Liutex definition and mathematical analysis
without any physical assumptions. The asymmetry of vortex is caused by the interaction of symmetric
shear and symmetric Liutex due to the definition of Liutex, which considers the smaller element
of a pair of vorticity elements as the rotational strength. For a 2-D fluid rotation, if a disturbance
shear effects the larger element, the rotation strength will not be changed, but if the disturbance
shear effects the smaller element, the rotation strength will be immediate changed due to the Liutex
strength definition. For a rigid rotation, if both vorticity of the shear and Liutex have the same
directions, e.g., clockwise, the Liutex strength will not be changed. If the vorticity of the shear
and Liutex have different directions, e.g., one clockwise and one counterclockwise, the Liutex
strength will be weakened. Then, the hairpin vortex could lose the symmetry and even deform to a one
leg vortex. The one leg vortex cannot keep balanced, and the chaotic motion and flow fluctuation
are doomed. This is considered as the mathematical foundation of turbulence formation. This theory
has been checked and proved by our DNS results of boundary layer transition.
