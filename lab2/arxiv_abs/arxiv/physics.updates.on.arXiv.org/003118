The effects of a stably-stratified boundary layer on flow and dispersion in a bi-dimensional street
canyon have been investigated experimentally in a wind tunnel in combination with differential
wall heating. Laser-Doppler anemometry together with a fast flame ionisation detector and cold-wire
anemometry were employed to sample velocities, concentration, temperatures and fluxes. A single-vortex
pattern was observed in the isothermal case, preserved also in the leeward case, but with an increment
of the vortex speed. Heating the windward wall was found to generate a counter-rotating vortex,
resulting in the reduction of velocity within the canopy. The stable stratification also contributes
reducing the speed, but only in the lower half of the canyon. The largest values of turbulent kinetic
energy were observed above the canopy, while inside they were concentrated close to the windward
wall, even when the leeward one was heated. An incoming stable stratification produced a turbulence
reduction in all the cases. Windward heating was found to produce larger temperature increments
within the canopy, while in the leeward case heat was immediately vacated above the canopy. A stable
approaching flow reduced both temperatures and heat fluxes. A passive tracer was released from
a ground-level point source at the centre of the canyon. The plume cross-section was mostly affected
by the windward wall heating, which produced an increment of the pollutant concentration on the
windward side by breaking the main vortex. The stable stratification created a generalised increment
of pollutant within the canopy, with concentrations twice as large. Turbulent pollutant fluxes
were found significant only at roof level and close to the source. On the other hand, in the windward
wall-heated case the reduction of the mean flux renders the turbulent component relevant in other
locations as well.
