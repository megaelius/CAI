Considering all the PDB annotated allosteric proteins (from ASD - AlloSteric Database) belonging
to four different classes (kinases, nuclear receptors, peptidases and transcription factors),
this work has attempted to decipher certain consistent patterns present in the residues constituting
the allosteric communication sub-system (ACSS). The thermal fluctuations of hydrophobic residues
in ACSSs were found to be significantly higher than those present in the non-ACSS part of the same
proteins, while polar residues showed the opposite trend. The basic residues and hydroxyl residues
were found to be slightly more predominant than the acidic residues and amide residues in ACSSs,
hydrophobic residues were found extremely frequently in kinase ACSSs. Despite having different
sequences and different lengths of ACSS, they were found to be structurally quite similar to each
other - suggesting a preferred structural template for communication. ACSS structures recorded
low RMSD and high Akaike Information Criterion(AIC) scores among themselves. While the ACSS networks
for all the groups of allosteric proteins showed low degree centrality and closeness centrality,
the betweenness centrality magnitudes revealed nonuniform behavior. Though cliques and communities
could be identified within the ACSS, maximal-common-subgraph considering all the ACSS could not
be generated, primarily due to the diversity in the dataset. Barring one particular case, the entire
ACSS for any class of allosteric proteins did not demonstrate "small world" behavior, though the
sub-graphs of the ACSSs, in certain cases, were found to form small-world networks.
