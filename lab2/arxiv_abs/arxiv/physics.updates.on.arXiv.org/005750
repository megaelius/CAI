The evolution of buoyancy-driven homogeneous variable-density turbulence (HVDT) at Atwood numbers
up to 0.75 and large Reynolds numbers is studied by using high-resolution Direct Numerical Simulations.
To help understand the highly non-equilibrium nature of buoyancy-driven HVDT, the flow evolution
is divided into four different regimes based on the behavior of turbulent kinetic energy derivatives.
The results show that each regime has a unique type of dependency on both Atwood and Reynolds numbers.
It is found that the local statistics of the flow based on the flow composition are more sensitive
to Atwood and Reynolds numbers compared to those based on the entire flow. It is also observed that
at higher Atwood numbers, different flow features reach their asymptotic Reynolds number behavior
at different times. The energy spectrum defined based on the Favre fluctuations momentum has less
large scale contamination from viscous effects for variable density flows with constant properties,
compared to other forms used previously. The evolution of the energy spectrum highlights distinct
dynamical features of the four flow regimes. Thus, the slope of the energy spectrum at intermediate
to large scales evolves from -7/3 to -1, as a function of the production to dissipation ratio. The
classical Kolmogorov spectrum emerges at intermediate to high scales at the highest Reynolds numbers
examined, after the turbulence starts to decay. Finally, the similarities and differences between
buoyancy-driven HVDT and the more conventional stationary turbulence are discussed and new strategies
and tools for analysis are proposed.
