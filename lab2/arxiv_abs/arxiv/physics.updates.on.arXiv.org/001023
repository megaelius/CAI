Interaction between microwave power, used for local heating and mode control, and density fluctuations
can produce a broadening of the injected beam, as confirmed in experiment and simulation. Increased
power deposition width could impact suppression of tearing mode structures on ITER. This work discusses
the experimental portion of an effort to understand scattering of injected microwaves by turbulence
on the DIII-D tokamak. The corresponding theoretical modeling work can be found in M.B. Thomas et.
al.: Submitted to Nuclear Fusion (2017)[Author Note - this paper to be published in same journal].
In a set of perturbative heat transport experiments, tokamak edge millimeter-scale fluctuation
levels and microwave heat deposition are measured simultaneously. Beam broadening is separated
from heat transport through fitting of modulated fluxes. Electron temperature measurements from
a 500 kHz, 48-channel ECE radiometer are Fourier analyzed and used to calculate a deposition-dependent
flux. Consistency of this flux with a transport model is evaluated. A diffusive and convective transport
solution is linearized and compared with energy conservation-derived fluxes. Comparison between
these two forms of heat flux is used to evaluate the quality of ECRF deposition profiles, and fitting
finds a significant broadening of 1D equilibrium ray tracing calculations from the benchmarked
TORAY-GA ray tracing code is needed. The physical basis, cross-validation, and application of
the heat flux method is presented. The method is applied to a range of DIII-D discharges and finds
a broadening factor of the deposition profile width which scales linearly with edge density fluctuation
level. These experimental results are found to be consistent with the full-wave beam broadening
measured by the 3D full wave simulations in the same discharges.
