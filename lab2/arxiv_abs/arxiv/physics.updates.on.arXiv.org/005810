We present experimental results of vacuum laser acceleration (VLA) of electrons using radially
polarized laser pulses interacting with a plasma mirror. Tightly focused radially polarized laser
pulses have been proposed for electron acceleration because of their strong longitudinal electric
field, making them ideal for VLA. However, experimental results have been limited until now because
injecting electrons into the laser field has remained a considerable challenge. Here, we demonstrate
experimentally that using a plasma mirror as an injector solves this problem and permits to inject
electrons at the ideal phase of the laser, resulting in the acceleration of electrons along the laser
propagation direction while reducing the electron beam divergence compared to the linear polarization
case. We obtain electron bunches with few-MeV energies and a 200 pC charge, thus demonstrating for
the first time electron acceleration to relativistic energies using a radially polarized laser.
High-harmonic generation from the plasma surface is also measured and provides additional insight
into the injection of electrons into the laser field upon its reflection on the plasma mirror. Detailed
comparisons between experimental results and full 3D simulations unravel the complex physics
of electron injection and acceleration in this new regime: we find that electrons are injected into
the radially polarized pulse in the form of two spatially-separated bunches emitted from the p-polarized
regions of the focus. Finally, we leverage on the insight brought by this study to propose and validate
a more optimal experimental configuration that can lead to extremely peaked electron angular distributions
and higher energy beams.
