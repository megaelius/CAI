In the present study, detailed numerical simulations are performed to investigate the primary
breakup of a gasoline surrogate jet under non-evaporative "Spray G" operating conditions. The
Spray G injector and operating conditions, developed by the Engine Combustion Network (ECN), represent
the early phase of spray-guided gasoline injection. To focus the computational resources on resolving
the primary breakup, simplifications have been made on the injector geometry. The effect of the
internal flow on the primary breakup is modeled by specifying a nonzero injection angle at the inlet.
The nonzero injection angle results in an increase of the jet penetration speed and also a deflection
of the liquid jet. A parametric study on the injection angle is performed, and the numerical results
are compared to the experimental data to identify the injection angle that best represents the Spray
G conditions. The nonzero injection angle introduces an azimuthally non-uniform velocity in the
liquid jet, which in turn influences the instability development on the jet surfaces and also the
deformation and breakup of the jet head. The asymmetric primary breakup dynamics eventually lead
to an azimuthal variation of droplet size distributions. The number of droplets varies significantly
with the azimuthal angle, but interestingly, the probability density functions (PDF) of droplet
size for different azimuthal angles collapse to a self-similar profile. Analysis has also been
conducted to estimate the percentage and statistics of the tiny droplets that are under resolved
in the present simulation. The PDF of the azimuthal angle is also presented, which is also shown to
exhibit a self-similar form that varies little over time. Finally, a model is developed to predict
the droplet number as a function of droplet diameter, azimuthal angle where a droplet is located,
and time.
