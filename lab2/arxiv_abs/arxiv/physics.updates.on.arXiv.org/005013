We report the Earth's rate of radiogenic heat production and (anti)neutrino luminosity from geologically
relevant short-lived radionuclides (SLR) and long-lived radionuclides (LLR) using decay constants
from the geological community, updated nuclear physics parameters, and calculations of the $\beta$
spectra. We carefully account for all branches in $^{40}$K decay using the updated $\beta^-$ energy
spectrum from physics and an updated branching ratio from geological studies. We track the time
evolution of the radiogenic power and luminosity of the Earth over the last 4.57 billion years, assuming
an absolute abundance for the refractory elements in the silicate Earth and key volatile/refractory
element ratios (e.g., Fe/Al, K/U, and Rb/Sr) to set the abundance levels for the moderately volatile
elements. The relevant decays for the present-day heat production in the Earth ($19.9\pm3.0$ TW)
are from $^{40}$K, $^{87}$Rb, $^{147}$Sm, $^{232}$Th, $^{235}$U, and $^{238}$U. A simple formula
for evaluation at arbitrary planetary composition is offered. The radiogenic heating rate of earth-like
material at Solar System formation was some 10$^3$ to 10$^4$ times greater than present-day values,
largely due to decay of $^{26}$Al in the silicate fraction, which was the dominant radiogenic heat
source for the first $\sim10$\,My. Decay of $^{60}$Fe contributed a non-negligible amount of heating
during the first $\sim15$\,My after CAI (Calcium Aluminum Inclusion) formation, interestingly
within the time frame of core--mantle segregation. Using factors and equations presented here,
one can calculate the first-order thermal and (anti)neutrino luminosity history of various size
bodies in the solar system and exoplanets.
