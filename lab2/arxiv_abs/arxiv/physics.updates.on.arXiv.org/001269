Independent tests aiming to constrain the value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ are usually
difficult because of its extreme smallness $\left(\Lambda \simeq 1\times 10^{-52}~\textrm{m}^{-2}\right)$.
Bounds on it from Solar System orbital motions determined with spacecraft tracking are currently
at the $\simeq 10^{-43}-10^{-44}~\textrm{m}^{-2}$ level, but they may turn out to be somewhat
optimistic since $\Lambda$ has not yet been explicitly modeled in the planetary data reductions.
Accurate $\left(\sigma_{\tau_\textrm{p}}\simeq 1-10~\mu\textrm{s}\right)$ timing of expected
pulsars orbiting the Black Hole at the Galactic Center, preferably along highly eccentric and wide
orbits, might, at least in principle, improve the planetary constraints by several orders of magnitude.
By assuming for such a hypothetical pulsar the orbit of, say, the very far star S85, characterized
by an eccentricity as large as $e = 0.78$ and an orbital period as long as $P_\textrm{b}=3580\pm 2550~\textrm{yr}$,
the cosmological constant would induce an instantaneous timing orbital shift $\Delta\delta\tau^\Lambda_\textrm{p}\left(E\right)$
as large as just $\simeq 1-10~\mu\textrm{s}$ for some given values of its eccentric anomaly $E$
at different epochs. By looking at the average time shift per orbit $\overline{\Delta\delta\tau}^\Lambda_\textrm{p}$
of closer pulsars, a S2-like orbital configuration with $e=0.8839,~P_\textrm{b}=16~\textrm{yr}$
would allow to obtain an upper bound as little as $\left|\Lambda\right|\lesssim 9\times 10^{-47}~\textrm{m}^{-2}$.
Our results can be easily extended to modified models of gravity using $\Lambda-$type parameters.
