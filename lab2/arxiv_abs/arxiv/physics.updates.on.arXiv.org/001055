In 1822, Cauchy presented the idea of traction vector that contains both the normal and tangential
components of the internal surface forces per unit area and gave the tetrahedron argument to prove
the existence of stress tensor. These great achievements form the main part of the foundation of
continuum mechanics. For about two centuries, some versions of tetrahedron argument and a few other
proofs of the existence of stress tensor are presented in every text on continuum mechanics, fluid
mechanics, and the relevant subjects. In this article, we show the birth, importance, and location
of these Cauchy's achievements, then by presenting the formal tetrahedron argument in detail,
for the first time, we extract some fundamental challenges. These conceptual challenges are related
to the result of applying the conservation of linear momentum to any mass element, the order of magnitude
of the surface and volume terms, the definition of traction vectors on the surfaces that pass through
the same point, the approximate processes in the derivation of stress tensor, and some others. In
a comprehensive review, we present the different tetrahedron arguments and the proofs of the existence
of stress tensor, discuss the challenges in each one, and classify them in two general approaches.
In the first approach that is followed in most texts, the traction vectors do not exactly define on
the surfaces that pass through the same point, so most of the challenges hold. But in the second approach,
the traction vectors are defined on the surfaces that pass exactly through the same point, therefore
some of the relevant challenges are removed. We also study the improved works of Hamel and Backus,
and indicate that the original work of Backus removes most of the challenges. This article shows
that the foundation of continuum mechanics is not a finished subject and there are still some fundamental
challenges.
