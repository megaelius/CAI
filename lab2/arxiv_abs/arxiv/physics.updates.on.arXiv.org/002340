Multi-phase reactive transports are ubiquitous in igneous systems. Complex mechanical and thermodynamic
interactions between solid, liquid and gas phases in magmatic aggregates lead to strongly non-linear
processes including flow localization, reaction-transport feedbacks, and tipping-point behaviors.
A challenging aspect of igneous processes is that they range from solid- dominated porous to liquid-dominated
suspension flows and therefore entail a wide spectrum of rheological conditions, flow speeds,
and length scales. Previous models have mostly been limited to the limits of two-phase flow in competent
rock at low melt fraction and in largely liquid magma bearing a small crystal load. The goal of this
paper is to develop a framework that is able to capture all stages of an igneous system from source
to surface including not only a rock and a melt but also an exsolved volatile phase. Adding a third
phase is critical for the study of magma degassing, which is intimately linked with magma transport
and storage in the shallow crust. Here, we derive an n-phase reactive transport model building on
the general concepts of Mixture Theory and the specific principles of Rational Thermodynamics
and Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics. The model operates at the continuum scale and requires constitutive
relations for fluxes within and transfers between phases. While our description of fluxes is similar
to previous work, we introduce a new formulation for phase transfers of mass, entropy, momentum,
and volume. We further propose phenomenological closures for the material response coefficients
that determine how fluxes and transfers respond to forcing gradients and phase differences in thermodynamic
properties. Finally, we demonstrate that the known limits of two-phase porous and suspension flow
emerge as special cases of our general model and discuss ramifications for igneous systems.
