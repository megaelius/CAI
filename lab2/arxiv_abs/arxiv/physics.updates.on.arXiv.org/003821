Linear analysis of the stability of diffuse clouds in the cold neutral medium with uniform magnetic
field is performed. We consider that gas in equilibrium state is heated by cosmic rays, X-rays and
electronic photoeffect on the surface of dust grains, and it is cooled by the collisional excitation
of fine levels of the CII. Ionization by cosmic rays and radiative recombinations is taken into account.
A dispersion equation is solved analytically in the limiting cases of small and large wave numbers,
as well as numerically in the general case. In particular cases the dispersion equation describes
thermal instability of Field (1965) and ionization-coupled acoustic instability of Flannery
and Press (1979). We pay our attention to magnetosonic waves arising in presence of magnetic field,
in thermally stable region, $35 \leq T \leq 95$ K and density $n\lessapprox 10^3\,\mbox{cm}^{-3}$.
We have shown that these modes can be unstable in the isobarically stable medium. The instability
mechanism is similar to the mechanism of ionization-coupled acoustic instability. We determine
maximum growth rates and critical wavelengths of the instability of magnetosonic waves depending
on gas temperature, magnetic field strength and the direction of wave vector with respect to the
magnetic field lines. The minimum growth time of the unstable slow magnetosonic waves in diffuse
clouds is of $4-60$ Myr, minimum and the most unstable wavelengths lie in ranges $0.05-0.5$ and $0.5-5$
pc, respectively. We discuss the application of considered instability to the formation of small-scale
structures and the generation of MHD turbulence in the cold neutral medium.
