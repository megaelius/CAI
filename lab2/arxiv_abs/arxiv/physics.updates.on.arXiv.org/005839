Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging accelerates MRI data acquisition by exciting multiple
image slices simultaneously. Overlapping slices are then separated using a mathematical model.
Several parameters used in SMS reconstruction impact the quality of final images. Therefore, finding
an optimal set of reconstruction parameters is critical to ensure that SMS acceleration does not
significantly degrade resulting image quality. Gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) data
were acquired with a range of SMS acceleration factors from volunteers. Images were collected using
two head coils (a 48-channel array and a smaller 32-channel array). Data from these coils were reconstructed
offline using a range of coil compression factors and reconstruction kernel parameters. A hybrid
space (ky-x), externally-calibrated coil-by-coil slice unaliasing approach was used for image
reconstruction. The resulting SMS images were compared with identical EPI data acquired without
SMS. A functional MRI (fMRI) experiment was also performed and group analysis results were compared
between data sets reconstructed with different coil compression levels. The 32-channel coil with
smaller dimensions outperformed the larger 48-channel coil in our experiments. Generally, a large
calibration region and small kernel sizes in ky direction improved image quality. Use of regularization
in the kernel fitting procedure had a notable impact. With optimal selection of other hyperparameters
in the hybrid space SMS unaliasing algorithm, coil compression caused small reduction in quality
in SMS accelerated images. Similarly, group analysis of fMRI results did not show a significant
influence of coil compression on resulting image quality. Hyperparameters used in SMS reconstruction
need to be fine-tuned once the experimental factors such as the RF receive coil and SMS factor have
been determined.
