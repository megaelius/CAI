Solar wind classification is conducive to understand the physical processes ongoing at the Sun
and solar wind evolution in the interplanetary space, and furthermore, it is helpful for early warning
of space weather events. With rapid developments in the field of artificial intelligence, machine
learning approaches are increasingly being used for pattern recognition. In this study, an approach
from machine learning perspectives is developed to automatically classify the solar wind at 1 AU
into four types: coronal-hole-origin, streamer-belt-origin, sector-reversal-region-origin,
and ejecta. By exhaustive enumeration, an eight-dimensional scheme ($B_T$, $N_P$, $T_P$, $V_P$,
$N_{\alpha p}$, $T_{exp}/T_P$, $S_p$, and $M_f$) is found to perform the best among 8191 combinations
of 13 solar wind parameters. 10 popular supervised machine learning models, namely $k$ Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines with linear and Radial Basic Function kernels, Decision
Tree, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Neural Network, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Quadratic Discriminant
Analysis, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, are applied to the labeled solar wind data sets. Among
them, KNN classifier obtains the highest overall classification accuracy, 92.8%. It significantly
improves the accuracy by 9.6% over existing manual schemes. No solar wind composition measurements
are needed, permitting our classification scheme to be applied to most solar wind spacecraft data.
Besides, two application examples indicate that solar wind classification is helpful for the risk
evaluation of predicted magnetic storms and surface charging of geosynchronous spacecrafts.
