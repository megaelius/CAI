The clinical practice of Medical Physics in Mexico has not been subject of comprehensive occupational
analyses. The absence of such studies not only arises radiation safety concerns, but also imposes
challenges to work-policy making. This work presents an initial effort to overview the current
occupational status of clinical Medical Physics in Mexico. Our motivation and final goal is to support,
based on data, the legal recognition of Medical Physics high-end training, and to provide information
that will potentially improve the Mexican health-care system. For the ease of analysis, the concept
of "person(s) developing Medical Physics tasks" (PDMPT) is introduced to refer to professionals
playing clinical medical physicist's (cMP) roles, disregarding academic profile or training.
A database of PDMPT in Mexico was built from official sources and personal communication with peers.
Our database included: employer(s), specialty and academic profile. It was found that 133 hospitals
in Mexico employ PDMPT, 49% of which are public institutions. A total of 360 positions involving
cMP roles were identified in the National Health-Care System, 77% of which corresponded to radiation
oncology. Public health services hold 65% of the reported positions. Cases of double- and triple-shift
workers where identified in this study, as 283 PDMPT occupied the 360 reported positions. Of all
PDMPT, 32% were women. Only 40% of PDMPT hold a graduate degree in Medical Physics, 46% of which were
located in the most densely populated region of Mexico. Our data suggests that Mexico is far from
fulfilling the international recommendations regarding cMP academic profile; however, this
problem could be solved in the near future for the specific cases of radiation oncology and nuclear
medicine services in the public health-care sector.
