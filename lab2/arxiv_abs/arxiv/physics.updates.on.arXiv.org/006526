Purpose To alleviate the spatial encoding limitations of single-shot EPI by developing multi-shot
segmented EPI for ultra-high-resolution fMRI with reduced ghosting artifacts from subject motion
and respiration. Methods Segmented EPI can reduce readout duration and reduce acceleration factors,
however, the time elapsed between segment acquisitions (on the order of seconds) can result in intermittent
ghosting, limiting its use for fMRI. Here, "FLEET" segment ordering--where segments are looped
over before slices--was combined with a variable flip angle progression (VFA-FLEET) to improve
inter-segment fidelity and maximize signal for fMRI. Scaling a sinc pulse's flip angle for each
segment (VFA-FLEET-Sinc) produced inconsistent slice profiles and ghosting, therefore, a recursive
Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) RF pulse design was developed (VFA-FLEET-SLR) to generate unique pulses
for every segment that together produce consistent slice profiles and signals. Results The temporal
stability of VFA-FLEET-SLR was compared against conventional-segmented EPI and VFA-FLEET-Sinc
at 3 T and 7 T. VFA-FLEET-SLR showed reductions in both intermittent and stable ghosting compared
to conventional-segmented and VFA-FLEET-Sinc, resulting in improved image quality with a minor
trade-off in temporal SNR. Combining VFA-FLEET-SLR with acceleration, we achieved a 0.6-mm isotropic
acquisition at 7 T--without zoomed imaging or partial Fourier--demonstrating reliable detection
of BOLD responses to a visual stimulus. To counteract the increased repetition time from segmentation,
simultaneous multi-slice VFA-FLEET-SLR was demonstrated using RF-encoded controlled aliasing.
Conclusions VFA-FLEET with a recursive RF pulse design supports acquisitions with low levels of
artifact and spatial blur, enabling fMRI at previously inaccessible spatial resolutions with
a "full-brain" field of view.
