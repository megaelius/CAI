Water scarcity is a reality in our world, and scenarios predicted by leading scientists in this area
indicate that it will worsen in the next decades. However, new technologies based in low-cost seawater
desalination can prevent the worst scenarios, providing fresh water for humanity. With this goal,
membranes based in nanoporous materials have been suggested in recent years. One of the materials
suggested is MoS$_2$, and classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation is one of the most powerful
tools to explore these nanomaterials. However, distinct Force Fields employed in MD simulations
are parameterized based on distinct experimental quantities. In this paper, we compare two models
of salt that were build based on distinct properties of water-salt mixtures. One model fits the hydration
free energy and lattice properties, the second fits the crystal density and the density and the dielectric
constant of water and salt mixtures. To compare the models, MD simulations for salty water flow through
two nanopores sizes were used -- one pore big enough to accommodate hydrated ions, and one smaller
in which the ion has to dehydrate to enter, and two rigid water models from the TIP4P family -- the TIP4P/2005
and TIP4P/$\epsilon$. Our results indicate that the water permeability and salt rejection by the
membrane are more influenced by the salt model than by the water model, especially for the narrow
pore. In fact, completely distinct mechanisms were observed, and they are related to the characteristics
employed in the ion model parameterization. The results show that not only the water model can influence
the outcomes, but the ion model plays a crucial role.
