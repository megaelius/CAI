The hydrodynamics of liquid flowing past gas sectors of unidirectional superhydrophobic surfaces
is revisited. Attention is focussed on the local slip boundary condition at the liquid-gas interface,
which is equivalent to the effect of a gas cavity on liquid flow. The system is characterized by a large
viscosity contrast between liquid and gas, $\mu/\mu_g \gg 1$. We interpret earlier results, namely
the dependence of the local slip length on the flow direction, in terms of a tensorial local slip boundary
condition and relate the eigenvalues of the local slip length tensor to the texture parameters,
such as the width of the groove, $\delta$, and the local depth of the groove, $e(y, \alpha)$. The latter
varies in the direction $y$, orthogonal to the orientation of stripes, and depends on the bevel angle
of groove's edges, $\pi/2 - \alpha$, at the point, where three phases meet. Our theory demonstrates
that when grooves are sufficiently deep their eigenvalues of the local slip length tensor depend
only on $\mu/\mu_g$, $\delta$, and $\alpha$, but not on the depth. The eigenvalues of the local slip
length of shallow grooves depend on $\mu/\mu_g$ and $e(y, \alpha)$, although the contribution
of the bevel angle is moderate. In order to assess the validity of our theory we propose a novel approach
to solve the two-phase hydrodynamic problem, which significantly facilitates and accelerates
calculations compared to conventional numerical schemes. The numerical results show that our
simple analytical description obtained for limiting cases of deep and shallow grooves remains
valid for various unidirectional textures.
