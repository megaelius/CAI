Spacecraft observations have shown that the proton temperature in the solar wind falls off with
radial distance more slowly than expected for an adiabatic prediction. Usually, previous studies
have been focused on the evolution of the solar-wind plasma by using the bulk speed as an order parameter
to discriminate different regimes. In contrast, here, we study the radial evolution of pure and
homogeneous fast streams (i.e. well-defined streams of coronal-hole plasma that maintain their
identity during several solar rotations) by means of re-processed particle data, from the HELIOS
satellites between 0.3 and 1 AU. We have identified 16 intervals of unperturbed high-speed coronal
hole plasma, from three different sources and measured at different radial distances. The observations
show that, for all three streams, (i) the proton density decreases as expected for a radially expanding
plasma, unlike previous analysis that found a slower decrease; (ii) the magnetic field deviates
from the Parker prediction, with the radial and tangential components decreasing more slowly and
quickly than expected, respectively; (iii) the double-adiabatic invariants are violated and
an increase of entropy is observed; (iv) the proton-core temperature anisotropy is constrained
by mirror mode instability; (v) the collisional frequency is not constant, but decreases as the
plasma travels away from the Sun. The present work provides an insight into the heating problem in
pure fast solar wind, fitting in the context of the next solar missions, and, especially for Parker
Solar Probe, it enables us to predict the high-speed solar-wind environment much closer to the Sun.
