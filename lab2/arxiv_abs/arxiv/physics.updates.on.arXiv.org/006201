Photosynthesis converts sunlight into the chemical free energy that feeds the Earth's biosphere,
yet at levels much lower than what thermodynamics would allow for. I propose here that photosynthesis
is nevertheless thermodynamically limited, but this limit acts indirectly on the material exchange
of water and carbon dioxide. I substantiate this interpretation using global observation-based
datasets of radiation, photosynthesis, precipitation and evaporation. I first calculate the
conversion efficiency of photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems and its climatological variation,
with a median efficiency of 0.78% (n = 13445). The rates tightly correlate with evaporation (r2 =
0.89), which demonstrates the importance of the coupling of photosynthesis to material exchange.
I then infer evaporation from the maximum material exchange between the surface and the atmosphere
that is thermodynamically possible using datasets of solar radiation and precipitation. This
inferred rate closely correlates with the observation-based evaporation dataset (r2 = 0.85).
When this rate is converted back into photosynthetic activity, the resulting patterns correlate
highly with the observation-based dataset (r2 = 0.56). This supports the interpretation that it
is not energy directly that limits terrestrial photosynthesis, but rather the material exchange
that is driven by sunlight. This interpretation can explain the very low, observed conversion efficiency
of photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems as well as its spatial variations. More generally,
this implies that one needs to take the necessary material flows and exchanges associated with life
into account to understand the thermodynamics of life. This, ultimately, requires a perspective
that links the activity of the biosphere to the thermodynamic constraints of transport processes
in the Earth system.
