Traditional cooking recipes follow a structure which can be modelled very well if the rules and semantics
of the different sections of the recipe text are analyzed and represented accurately. We propose
a structure that can accurately represent the recipe as well as a pipeline to infer the best representation
of the recipe in this uniform structure. The Ingredients section in a recipe typically lists down
the ingredients required and corresponding attributes such as quantity, temperature, and processing
state. This can be modelled by defining these attributes and their values. The physical entities
which make up a recipe can be broadly classified into utensils, ingredients and their combinations
that are related by cooking techniques. The instruction section lists down a series of events in
which a cooking technique or process is applied upon these utensils and ingredients. We model these
relationships in the form of tuples. Thus, using a combination of these methods we model cooking
recipe in the dataset RecipeDB to show the efficacy of our method. This mined information model can
have several applications which include translating recipes between languages, determining
similarity between recipes, generation of novel recipes and estimation of the nutritional profile
of recipes. For the purpose of recognition of ingredient attributes, we train the Named Entity Relationship
(NER) models and analyze the inferences with the help of K-Means clustering. Our model presented
with an F1 score of 0.95 across all datasets. We use a similar NER tagging model for labelling cooking
techniques (F1 score = 0.88) and utensils (F1 score = 0.90) within the instructions section. Finally,
we determine the temporal sequence of relationships between ingredients, utensils and cooking
techniques for modeling the instruction steps.
