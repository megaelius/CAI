The accurate characterization of nonequilibrium strongly-correlated quantum systems has been
a longstanding challenge in many-body physics. Notable among them are quantum impurity models,
which appear in various nanoelectronic and quantum computing applications. Despite their seeming
simplicity, they feature correlated phenomena, including emergent energy scales and non-Fermi-liquid
physics, requiring renormalization group treatment. This has typically been at odds with the description
of their nonequilibrium steady-state under finite bias, which exposes their nature as open quantum
systems. We present a novel numerically-exact method for obtaining the nonequilibrium state of
a general quantum impurity coupled to metallic leads at arbitrary voltage or temperature bias,
which we call "RL-NESS" (Renormalized Lindblad-driven NonEquilibrium Steady-State). It is based
on coherently coupling the impurity to discretized leads which are treated exactly. These leads
are furthermore weakly coupled to reservoirs described by Lindblad dynamics which impose voltage
or temperature bias. Going beyond previous attempts, we exploit a hybrid discretization scheme
for the leads together with Wilson's numerical renormalization group, in order to probe exponentially
small energy scales. The steady-state is then found by evolving a matrix-product density operator
via real-time Lindblad dynamics, employing a dissipative generalization of the time-dependent
density matrix renormalization group. In the long-time limit, this procedure converges to the
steady-state at finite bond dimension due to the introduced dissipation, which bounds the growth
of entanglement. We test the method against the exact solution of the noninteracting resonant level
model. We demonstrate its power using an interacting two-level model, for which it correctly reproduces
the known limits, and gives the full $I$-$V$ curve between them.
