Adding porosity to battery electrodes is believed to be universally useful for adding space to accommodate
volumetric expansion, electrolyte access to all active materials, helping to mitigate poor C-rate
performance for thicker electrodes and for allowing infilling with other materials. Ordered porous
electrode, such as inverse opals that have macroporosity, have been a model system: binder and conductive
additive free, interconnected electrically, defined porosity and pore size with thickness, good
electrolyte wettability and surprisingly good electrode performance in half cells and Li-battery
cells at normal rates. We show that the intrinsic electronic conductivity is important, and at fast
rates the intrinsic conductivity ultimately suppresses any charge storage in electrode materials.
Using a model system of inverse opal V2O5in a flooded Li battery three-electrode cell, whose Li electrochemistry
is very well understood, we show that beyond 10 C, electrodes can store almost no charge, but completely
recover once reduced to < 1C. We show how the IO material is modified under lithiation using X-ray
diffraction, Raman scattering and electron microscopy, and that little or no reaction occurs to
the material at higher rates. We also use chronoamperometry to examine rate behaviour and link the
limitations in high rate performance, and complete capacity suppression, to the intrinsic out-of-plane
conductivity of the IO network. The data show that even idealized electrodes with nanoscale dimensions,
functional porosity and full material interconnectivity, are fundamentally limited for high
rate performance when they are less conductive even when fully soaked with electrolyte. While adding
so-called functional size reduction, porosity etc. can be useful for some materials, these potential
benefits are clearly not universally useful for high rate electrodes in Li-ion batteries.
