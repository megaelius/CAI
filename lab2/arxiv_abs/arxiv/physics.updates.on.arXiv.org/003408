Purpose: To implement, optimize and test fast interrupted steady-state (FISS) for natively fat-suppressed
free-running 5D whole-heart MRI at 1.5T and 3T. Methods: FISS was implemented for fully self-gated
free-running cardiac- and respiratory-motion-resolved radial imaging of the heart at 1.5T and
3T. Numerical simulations and phantom scans were performed to compare fat suppression characteristics
and to determine parameter ranges (readouts per FISS module (NR) and repetition time (TR)) for effective
fat suppression. Subsequently, free-running FISS data were collected in ten healthy volunteers.
All acquisitions were compared with a continuous bSSFP version of the same sequence, and both fat
suppression and scan times were analyzed. Results: Simulations demonstrate a variable width and
location of suppression bands in FISS that was dependent on TR and NR. For a fat suppression bandwidth
of 100Hz and NR below 8, simulations demonstrated that a TR between 2.2ms and 3.0ms is required at
1.5T while a range of 3.0ms to 3.5ms applies at 3T. Fat signal increases with NR. These findings were
corroborated in phantom experiments. In volunteers, fat SNR was significantly decreased using
FISS compared with bSSPF at both field strengths. After protocol optimization, high-resolution
(1.1mm x 1.1mm x 1.1mm) 5D whole-heart free-running FISS can be performed with effective fat suppression
in under 8 min at 1.5T and 3T at a modest scan time increase compared to bSSFP.Conclusion: An optimal
FISS parameter range was determined enabling natively fat-suppressed 5D whole-heart free-running
MRI with a single continuous scan at 1.5T and 3T, demonstrating potential for cardiac imaging and
noncontrast angiography.
