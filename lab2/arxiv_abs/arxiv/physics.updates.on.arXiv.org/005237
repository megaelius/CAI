Multimode interference and multipolar interplay govern functionalities of optical nanoresonators
and nonlinear nanoantennas. Recently, excitation of the high-quality supercavity modes (quasi-BIC
states) in individual subwavelength dielectric particles has been predicted to boost the nonlinear
frequency conversion at the nanoscale. Here, we put forward the multipolar model which captures
the physics behind linear and nonlinear response driven by such high-$Q$ modes in nanoresonators.
We show that formation of the quasi-BIC state in the AlGaAs nanodisk can be understood through multipolar
transformations of coupled leaky modes. In particular, the hybridized axially symmetric TE-polarized
modes can be viewed as superpositions of multipoles, with a basis of parent multipoles constituted
mainly by magnetic dipoles and octupole. The quasi-BIC point in the parameter space appears where
dipolar losses are totally suppressed. The efficient optical coupling to this state is implemented
via azimuthally polarized beam illumination matching its multipolar origin. We establish a one-to-one
correspondence between the standard non Hermitian coupled-mode theory and multipolar models
that enables transparent interpretation of scattering characteristics. Using our approach,
we derive the multipolar composition of the generated second-harmonic radiation from the AlGaAs
nanodisk and validate it with full-wave numerical simulations. Back-action of the second-harmonic
radiation onto the fundamental frequency is taken into account in the coupled nonlinear model with
pump depletion. A hybrid metal-dielectric nanoantenna is proposed to augment the conversion efficiency
up to tens of per cent and actualize the nonlinear parametric downconversion. Our findings delineate
the in-depth conceptual framework and novel promising strategies in the design of functional elements
for nonlinear nanophotonics applications.
