In this work, we analyze the inertial migration of an electrophoretic particle in a 2-D Poiseuille
flow with an electric field applied parallel to the walls. For a thin electrical double layer, the
particle exhibits a slip-driven electrokinetic motion along the direction of the applied electric
field, which causes the particle to lead or lag the flow (depending on its surface charge). The fluid
disturbance caused by this slip-driven motion is characterized by a rapidly decaying source-dipole
field which alters the inertial lift on the particle. We determine this inertial lift using the reciprocal
theorem. Assuming no wall effects, we derive an analytical expression for a phoretic-lift which
captures the modification to the inertial lift due to electrophoresis. We also take wall effects
into account and find that the analytical expression is valid away from the walls. We find that for
a leading particle, the phoretic-lift acts towards the regions of high shear (i.e. walls), while
the reverse is true for a lagging particle. Using an order-of-magnitude analysis, we obtain different
components which contribute to the inertial force and classify them on the basis of the interactions
from which they emerge. We show that the dominant contribution to the phoretic-lift originates
from the interaction of slip-driven source-dipole field with the stresslet field (generated due
to particle's resistance to strain in the background flow). Furthermore, to contrast the slip-driven
phenomenon from a force-driven phenomenon in terms of their influence on the inertial migration,
we also study a non-neutrally buoyant particle. We show that the gravitational effects alter the
inertial lift primarily through the interaction of background shear with buoyancy induced stokeslet
field.
