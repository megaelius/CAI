Recently it was shown that an impurity exchanging orbital angular momentum with a surrounding bath
can be described in terms of the angulon quasiparticle [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 095301 (2017)]. The
angulon consists of a quantum rotor dressed by a many-particle field of boson excitations, and can
be formed out of, for example, a molecule or a nonspherical atom in superfluid helium, or out of an
electron coupled to lattice phonons or a Bose condensate. Here we develop an approach to the angulon
based on the path-integral formalism, which sets the ground for a systematic, perturbative treatment
of the angulon problem. The resulting perturbation series can be interpreted in terms of Feynman
diagrams, from which, in turn, one can derive a set of diagrammatic rules. These rules extend the
machinery of the graphical theory of angular momentum - well known from theoretical atomic spectroscopy
- to the case where an environment with an infinite number of degrees of freedom is present. In particular,
we show that each diagram can be interpreted as a 'skeleton', which enforces angular momentum conservation,
dressed by an additional many-body contribution. This connection between the angulon theory and
the graphical theory of angular momentum is particularly important as it allows to systematically
and substantially simplify the analytical representation of each diagram. In order to exemplify
the technique, we calculate the 1- and 2-loop contributions to the angulon self-energy, the spectral
function, and the quasiparticle weight. The diagrammatic theory we develop paves the way to investigate
next-to-leading order quantities in a more compact way compared to the variational approaches.
