Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are widely used in engineering turbulent flow
simulations. However, RANS predictions may have large discrepancies due to the uncertainties
in modeled Reynolds stresses. Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that machine learning can be used
to improve the RANS modeled Reynolds stresses by leveraging data from high fidelity simulations
(Physics informed machine learning approach for reconstructing Reynolds stress modeling discrepancies
based on DNS data. Physical Review Fluids. 2, 034603, 2017). However, solving for mean flows from
the improved Reynolds stresses still poses significant challenges due to potential ill-conditioning
of RANS equations with Reynolds stress closures. Enabling improved predictions of mean velocities
are of profound practical importance, because often the velocity and its derived quantities (QoIs,
e.g., drag, lift, surface friction), and not the Reynolds stress itself, are of ultimate interest
in RANS simulations. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework for augmenting turbulence
models with physics-informed machine learning, illustrating a complete workflow from identification
of input features to final prediction of mean velocities. This work has two innovations. First,
we demonstrate a systematic procedure to generate mean flow features based on the integrity basis
for mean flow tensors. Second, we propose using machine learning to predict linear and nonlinear
parts of the Reynolds stress tensor separately. Inspired by the finite polynomial representation
of tensors in classical turbulence modeling, such a decomposition is instrumental in overcoming
the ill-conditioning of RANS equations. Numerical tests demonstrated merits of the proposed framework.
