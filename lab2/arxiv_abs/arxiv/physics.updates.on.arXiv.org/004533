This paper presents a methodology and workflow that overcome the limitations of the conventional
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for geological facies modeling. It attempts to improve
the training stability and guarantee the diversity of the generated geology through interpretable
latent vectors. The resulting samples are ensured to have the equal probability (or an unbiased
distribution) as from the training dataset. This is critical when applying GANs to generate unbiased
and representative geological models that can be further used to facilitate objective uncertainty
evaluation and optimal decision-making in oil field exploration and development. We proposed
and implemented a new variant of GANs called Info-WGAN for the geological facies modeling that combines
Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN) with Wasserstein distance
and Gradient Penalty (GP) for learning interpretable latent codes as well as generating stable
and unbiased distribution from the training data. Different from the original GAN design, InfoGAN
can use the training images with full, partial, or no labels to perform disentanglement of the complex
sedimentary types exhibited in the training dataset to achieve the variety and diversity of the
generated samples. This is accomplished by adding additional categorical variables that provide
disentangled semantic representations besides the mere randomized latent vector used in the original
GANs. By such means, a regularization term is used to maximize the mutual information between such
latent categorical codes and the generated geological facies in the loss function. Furthermore,
the resulting unbiased sampling by Info-WGAN makes the data conditioning much easier than the conventional
GANs in geological modeling because of the variety and diversity as well as the equal probability
of the unconditional sampling by the generator.
