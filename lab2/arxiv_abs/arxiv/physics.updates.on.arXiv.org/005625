Thermodynamic properties of molecules are vital to chemistry, astronomy, biology, and other fields.
Where thermodynamic observables cannot be measured, computational methods are required to fill
in the blanks. This typically requires several steps: (i) calculation of the Born-Oppenheimer
potential energy surface (BOPES); (ii) determination of intramolecular vibrational modes; and
(iii) calculation of the partition function and thermodynamic observables. Typically, the first
step is the computational bottleneck since it requires solving the Schrodinger equation, a task
that quantum computers have the potential to accelerate beyond what is possible using classical
computers. Quantum computers have been constructed that manipulate entanglement and superposition
of qubits and thus operate on quantum states. In conjunction with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms,
these machines can approximate solutions to the Schrodinger equation. So far, noisy quantum computers
have been used to compute the BOPES of small molecular systems (step i, above). However, these calculations
are often too noisy for the determination vibrational modes (step ii) using traditional methods.
Here, we report a method to compute thermodynamic observables using electronic energy calculations
executed on a superconducting-qubit quantum computer. We calculate the BOPES of hydrogen using
the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, which is passed to a classical computer to compute
the parameters for the Morse potential, which mitigates the noise and provides vibrational energy
levels. Next, the partition functions of hydrogen, deuterium, and hydrogen deuteride, are calculated,
from which we obtain thermodynamic observables. Compared to experimental data, we have achieved
chemical accuracy for internal energy, entropy and heat capacity for these molecules and for their
isotopic exchange reaction.
