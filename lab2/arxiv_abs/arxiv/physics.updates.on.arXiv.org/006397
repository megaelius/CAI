Photonic crystal slabs (PCSs) are a well-studied class of devices known to support optical Fano
resonances for light normally incident to the slab, useful for narrowband filters, modulators,
and nonlinear photonic devices. In shallow-etched PCSs the linewidth of the resonances is easily
controlled by tuning the etching depth. This design strength comes at the cost of large device footprint
due to the poor in-plane localization of optical energy. In fully-etched PCSs realized in high index
contrast material systems, the in-plane localization is greatly improved, but the command over
linewidth suffers. This disadvantage in fully-etched PCSs, also known as high contrast gratings
(HCGs), can be overcome by accessing symmetry-protected Bound States in the Continuum (BICs).
By perturbing an HCG, the BIC may be excited from the free space with quality factor showing an inverse
squared dependence on the magnitude of the perturbation, while inheriting the excellent in-plane
localization of their unperturbed counterparts. Here, we report an exhaustive catalog of the selection
rules (if and to which free space polarization coupling occurs) of symmetry-protected BICs controlled
by in-plane symmetry breaking in six types of two-dimensional PCS lattices. The chosen lattices
allow access to the three highest symmetry mode classes of unperturbed square and hexagonal PCSs.
The restriction to in-plane symmetry breaking allows for manufacturing devices with simple lithographic
fabrication techniques in comparison to out-of-plane symmetry breaking, useful for practical
applications. The approach reported provides a high-level roadmap for designing PCSs supporting
controllable sharp spectral features with minimal device footprints using a mature fabrication
platform.
