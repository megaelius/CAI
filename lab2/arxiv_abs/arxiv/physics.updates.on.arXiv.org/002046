Objective:The objective of the current study was to demonstrate the three year outcome of the CERAB
technique for the treatment of extensive aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD). Methods:Between
February 2009 and July 2016, all patients treated with the CERAB technique for AIOD were identified
in the local databases of two centers and analyzed. Demographics and lesion characteristics were
scored. Follow-up (FU) consisted of clinical assessment, duplex ultrasound and ankle brachial
indices (ABI). Patency rates and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR)
were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: 130 patients (69 male and 61 female) were treated
of which 68% patients were diagnosed with intermittent claudication and 32% suffered from critical
limb ischemia. The vast majority (89%) were TASC-II D lesions and the remaining were TASC-II B and
C (both 5%). Median follow-up was 24 months (range 0-67 months). The technical success rate was 97%
and 67% of cases were performed completely percutaneously. The ABI improved significantly from
0.65 plusminus 0.22 preoperatively to 0.88 plusminus 0.15 after the procedure. The 30-day minor
and major complication rate was 33% and 7%. The median hospital stay was 2 days (range 1-76 days).
At 1 and 3-years FU 94% and 96% of the patients clinically improved at least 1 Rutherford category
(2% and 0% unchanged, 4% and 4% worsened). Limb salvage rate at 1-year was 98% and 97% at three year
follow-up. Primary, primary-assisted and secondary patency was 86%/91%/97% at 1-year, 84%/89%/97%
at 2-year and 82%/87%/97% at 3-year FU. Freedom from CD-TLR was 87% at 1-year and 86% at both 2 and 3-year
FU. Conclusions:The CERAB technique is a safe and feasible technique for the treatment of extensive
aortoiliac occlusive disease with good three year results regarding patency and clinical improvement.
