This paper is an attempt to introduce methods and concepts of the Riemann-Cartan geometry largely
used in such physical theories as general relativity, gauge theories, solid dynamics, etc. to fluid
dynamics in general and to studying and modeling turbulence in particular. Thus, we further generalize
our unified first-order hyperbolic formulation of continuum fluid and solid mechanics in order
to account for rotational degrees of freedom (spin) of the underlying microscopic dynamics. Such
a microscopic dynamics can be associated with the dynamics of small-scale eddies in turbulent flows
of viscous fluids or dynamics of dislocations continuously distributed in an elastoplastically
deformed solid. In order to achieve this, we use the rotational degree of freedom of the main field
of the theory, the distortion field, which characterizes the deformation and rotation of the material
elements and can be viewed as anholonomic basis triad with the non-vanishing torsion tensor. The
torsion tensor is then used to characterize distortion's spin and is treated as an independent field
with its own time evolution equation. The resulting governing equations have essentially the structure
of the non-linear Maxwell equations in a moving medium. The system is closed by providing an example
of the total energy potential. The extended system describes not only dissipative dynamics (which
raises the entropy) due to the viscosity or plasticity effect but it also has dispersive features
which are due to the non-dissipative energy exchange (which conserves the entropy) between micro
and macro scales. Both the dissipative and dispersive processes are represented by relaxation-type
algebraic source terms so that the overall system remains first-order hyperbolic. The turbulent
state is then treated as an excitation of the equilibrium laminar state due to the non-linear interplay
between dissipation and dispersion.
