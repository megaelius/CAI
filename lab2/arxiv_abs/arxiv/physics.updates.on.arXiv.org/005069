Modal analysis techniques are used to identify patterns and develop reduced-order models in a variety
of fluid applications. However, experimentally acquired flow fields may be corrupted with incorrect
and missing entries, which may degrade modal decomposition. Here we use robust principal component
analysis (RPCA) to improve the quality of flow field data by leveraging global coherent structures
to identify and replace spurious data points. RPCA is a robust variant of principal component analysis
(PCA), also known as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in fluids, that decomposes a data matrix
into the sum of a low-rank matrix containing coherent structures and a sparse matrix of outliers
and corrupt entries. We apply RPCA filtering to a range of fluid simulations and experiments of varying
complexities and assess the accuracy of low-rank structure recovery. First, we analyze direct
numerical simulations of flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds number 100 with artificial outliers,
alongside similar PIV measurements at Reynolds number 413. Next, we apply RPCA filtering to a turbulent
channel flow simulation from the Johns Hopkins Turbulence database, demonstrating that dominant
coherent structures are preserved in the low-rank matrix. Finally, we investigate PIV measurements
behind a two-bladed cross-flow turbine that exhibits both broadband and coherent phenomena. In
all cases, we find that RPCA filtering extracts dominant coherent structures and identifies and
fills in incorrect or missing measurements. The performance is particularly striking when flow
fields are analyzed using dynamic mode decomposition, which is sensitive to noise and outliers.
