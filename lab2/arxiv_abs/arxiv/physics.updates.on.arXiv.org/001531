The main sources of solar energetic particle (SEP) events are solar flares and shocks driven by coronal
mass ejections (CMEs). While it is generally accepted that energetic protons can be accelerated
by shocks, whether or not these shocks can also efficiently accelerate solar energetic electrons
is still debated. In this study we present observations of the extremely widespread SEP event of
26 Dec 2013. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the widest longitudinal SEP distribution ever
observed together with unusually long-lasting energetic electron anisotropies at all observer
positions. Further striking features of the event are long-lasting SEP intensity increases, two
distinct SEP components with the second component mainly consisting of high-energy particles,
a complex associated coronal activity including a pronounced signature of a shock in radio type-II
observations, and the interaction of two CMEs early in the event. The observations require a prolonged
injection scenario not only for protons but also for electrons. We therefore analyze the data comprehensively
to characterize the possible role of the shock for the electron event. Remote-sensing observations
of the complex solar activity are combined with in-situ measurements of the particle event. We also
apply a Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to the coronagraph observations of the two associated
CMEs to analyze their interaction. We find that the shock alone is likely not responsible for this
extremely wide SEP event. Therefore we propose a scenario of trapped energetic particles inside
the CME-CME interaction region which undergo further acceleration due to the shock propagating
through this region, stochastic acceleration, or ongoing reconnection processes inside the interaction
region. The origin of the second component of the SEP event is likely caused by a sudden opening of
the particle trap.
