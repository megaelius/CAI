A Fourier-based Library of Unbounded Poisson Solvers (FLUPS) for 2-D and 3-D homogeneous distributed
grids is presented. It is designed to handle every possible combination of periodic, symmetric,
semi-unbounded and fully unbounded boundary conditions for the Poisson equation on rectangular
domains with uniform resolution. FLUPS leverages a dedicated implementation of 3-D Fourier transforms
to solve the Poisson equation using Green's functions, in a fast and memory-efficient way. Several
Green's functions are available, optionally with explicit regularization, spectral truncation,
or using Lattice Green's Functions, and provide verified convergence orders from 2 to spectral-like.
The algorithm depends on the FFTW library to perform 1-D transforms, while MPI communications enable
the required remapping of data in memory. For the latter operation, a first available implementation
resorts to the standard all-to-all routines. A second implementation, featuring non-blocking
and persistent point-to-point communications, is however shown to be more efficient in a majority
of cases and especially while taking advantage of the shared memory parallelism with OpenMP. The
scalability of the algorithm, aimed at massively parallel architectures, is demonstrated up to
73 720 cores. The results obtained with three different supercomputers show that the weak efficiency
remains above 40% and the strong efficiency above 30% when the number of cores is multiplied by 16,
for typical problems. These figures are slightly better than those expected from a third party 3-D
FFT tool, with which a 20% longer execution time was also measured on average. From the outside, the
solving procedure is fully automated so that the user benefits from the optimal performances while
not having to handle the complexity associated with memory management, data mapping and Fourier
transform computation.
