Next generation low-background experiments require a detailed understanding of all possible
radiation backgrounds. One important radiation source are muon-induced neutrons. Their production
processes are up to now not fully understood. New measurements of the production of neutrons by cosmogenic
muons in high-Z materials at a shallow underground site are reported. Muon-induced neutrons are
identified by the detection of 2.2MeV gammas from their capture on hydrogen with high-purity germanium
detectors. The experimental results were compared to Geant4 Monte Carlo predictions. The measured
rate of 2.2MeV neutron capture gammas for lead was found to be in good agreement with the Geant4 predicted
rate. An external neutron yield of (7.2$^{\text{+0.7}}_{\text{$-$0.6}}$)$\cdot$10$^{-5}$g$^{-1}$cm$^{2}$
neutrons per tagged muon was determined for lead with the help of Geant4. For copper the measured
rate was found to be a factor of 0.72$\pm$0.14 lower than the Geant4 predicted rate. Using this factor
an external neutron yield of (2.1$\pm$0.4)$\cdot$10$^{-5}$g$^{-1}$cm$^{2}$ neutrons per tagged
muon was obtained for copper. An additional simulation was performed using the FLUKA Monte Carlo
code. The FLUKA predicted rate of detected 2.2MeV neutron capture gammas for lead was also found
to be in good agreement with the experimental value. A detailed comparison of muon interactions
and neutron production in lead for Geant4 and FLUKA revealed large discrepancies in the description
of photo-nuclear and muon-nuclear inelastic scattering reactions for muon energies at shallow
underground sites. These results suggest that Geant4 underpredicts the neutron production in
photo-nuclear inelastic scattering reactions while at the same time it overpredicts the neutron
production in muon-nuclear inelastic scattering reactions.
