Optical nanoantennas can efficiently confine light into nanoscopic hotspots, enabling single-molecule
detection sensitivity at biological relevant conditions. This innovative approach to breach
the diffraction limit offers a versatile platform to investigate the dynamics of individual biomolecules
in living cell membranes and their partitioning into cholesterol-dependent lipid nanodomains.
Here, we present optical nanoantenna arrays with accessible surface hotspots to study the characteristic
diffusion dynamics of phosphoethanolamine (PE) and sphingomyelin (SM) in the plasma membrane
of living cells at the nanoscale. Fluorescence burst analysis and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
performed on nanoantennas of different gap sizes show that, unlike PE, SM is transiently trapped
in cholesterol-enriched nanodomains of 10 nm diameter with short characteristic times around
100 {\mu}s. The removal of cholesterol led to the free diffusion of SM, consistent with the dispersion
of nanodomains. Our results are consistent with the existence of highly transient and fluctuating
nanoscale assemblies enriched by cholesterol and sphingolipids in living cell membranes, also
known as lipid rafts. Quantitative data on sphingolipids partitioning into lipid rafts is crucial
to understand the spatiotemporal heterogeneous organization of transient molecular complexes
on the membrane of living cells at the nanoscale. The proposed technique is fully biocompatible
and thus provides various opportunities for biophysics and live cell research to reveal details
that remain hidden in confocal diffraction-limited measurements.
