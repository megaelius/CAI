Recording EEG simultaneously with fMRI provides a unique approach for studying temporal and spatial
dynamics of the brain. However, EEG data collected during fMRI acquisition are contaminated with
MRI gradients and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, in addition to artifacts of physiological
origin (eye blinks, muscle, motions). Before any further data analysis, these EEG artifacts must
be reduced. There have been several proposed approaches for reducing some of these artifacts off-line
with manual and time-consuming preprocessing. Notably, and to the best of our knowledge, there
is not a fully automatic and comprehensive pipeline for reducing all main EEG artifacts, such as
MRI gradients, BCG, eye blinks, muscle, and motion artifacts, which could be applied to large EEG-fMRI
datasets. In this paper, we combine average template subtraction (i.e., OBS and AAS) and ICA to detect,
and suppress such artifacts. Further, we have developed a pipeline for automatically classifying
independent components associated with not only MRI-related artifacts, but also, physiological
artifacts, such as blink and muscle artifacts. In order to validate our results, we tested our method
on both resting-state and task-based (i.e., event-related potentials [ERP]) EEG data from eight
exemplar participants. We compared manually corrected and the automatically corrected EEG data
during resting-state in the time/frequency domains and we found no significant differences among
the two corrections. A comparison between ERP data also showed no differences between the manually
corrected and fully automatic fMRI-EEG-corrected data. Importantly, compared to manual noise
suppression, APPEAR reduced the time required for EEG noise suppression per single subject and
made it possible to automatically process large EEG-fMRI cohorts composed of hundreds of subjects
with manageable researcher time and effort.
