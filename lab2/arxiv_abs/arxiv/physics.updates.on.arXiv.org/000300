Predicting protein 3D structure from amino acid sequence remains as a challenge in the field of computational
biology. If protein structure homologues are not found, one has to construct 3D structural conformations
from the very beginning by the so-called ab initio approach, using some empirical energy functions.
A successful algorithm in this category, Rosetta, creates an ensemble of decoy conformations by
assembling selected best short fragments of known protein structures and then recognizes the native
state as the highly populated one with a very low energy. Typically, an energy function is a combination
of a variety of terms characterizing different structural features, say hydrophobic interactions,
van der Waals force, hydrogen bonding, etc. It is critical for an energy function to be capable to
distinguish native-like conformations from non-native ones and to drive most initial conformations
assembled from fragments to a native-like one in a conformation search process. In this paper we
propose a linear programming algorithm to optimize weighting of a total of 14 energy terms used in
Rosetta. We reverse the Monte Carlo process of Rosetta to approach native-like conformations to
a process generating from the native state an ensemble of initial conformations most relevant to
the native state. Intuitively, an ideal weighting scheme would result in a large "basin of attraction"
of the native structure, which leads to an objective function for the linear programming. We have
examined the proposal on several benchmark proteins, and the experimental results suggest that
the optimized weights enlarge the attraction basin of the native state and improve the quality of
the predicted native states as well. In addition, a comparison of optimal weighting schema for proteins
of different classes indicates that in different protein classes energy terms may have different
effects.
