We investigate a mechanism to manipulate wall-bounded flows whereby wave-like undulations of
the wall topography drives the creation of bespoke longitudinal vortices. A resonant interaction
between the ambient vorticity of the undisturbed shear flow and the undulation of streamlines enforced
by the wall topography serves to slightly rotate the spanwise vorticity of the mean flow into the
streamwise direction, creating a swirling motion, in the form of regular streamwise rolls. The
process is kinematic and essentially identical to the `direct drive' CL1 mechanism for Langmuir
circulation (LC) proposed by Craik (1970). Boundary layers are modelled by selecting suitable
primary flow profiles. A simple, easily integrable expression for the cross-plane stream function
is found in two asymptotic regimes: the resonant onset of the essentially inviscid instability
at early times, and the fully developed steady state viscous flow. Linear-order solutions for flow
over undulating boundaries are obtained, fully analytical in the special case of a power-law profile.
These solutions allow us to quickly map out the circulation response to boundary design parameters.
The study is supplemented with direct numerical simulations which verify the manifestation of
boundary induced Langmuir vortices in laminar flows with no-slip boundaries. Simulations show
good qualitative agreement with theory. Quantitatively, the comparisons rest on a displacement
length closure parameter adopted in the perturbation theory. While wall-driven LC appear to become
unstable in turbulent flows, we propose that the mechanism can promote swirling motion in boundary
layers, a flow feature which has been reported to reduce drag in some situations.
