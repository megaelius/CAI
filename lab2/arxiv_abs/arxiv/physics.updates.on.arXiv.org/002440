The eigenvectors of the electronic stress tensor have been identified as useful for the prediction
of chemical reactivity because they determine the most preferred directions to move the bonds that
correspond to a qualitative change in the molecular electronic structure. A new 3-D vector based
interpretation of the chemical bond that we refer to as the bond-path framework set $\mathbb{B}
= \{p,q,r\}$ provides a version of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) beyond the minimum
definition for bonding that is particularly suitable for understanding changes in molecular electronic
structure that occur during reactions. The bond-path framework set $\mathbb{B}$ is straightforwardly
constructed and visualized from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of QTAIM. This approach is applied
to the structural deformations of ethene that occur during applied torsion ${\theta}$, -180.0{\deg}
$\leq$ ${\theta}$ $\leq$ +180.0{\deg}. The corresponding stress tensor version is readily constructed
as $\mathbb{B}_{\sigma} = \{p_{\sigma},q_{\sigma},r\}$ within the QTAIM partitioning making
it possible to compare experimentally and computationally determined electronic charge densities.
The bond-path framework set $\mathbb{B}$ or $\mathbb{B}_{\sigma}$ are the networks that comprise
three strands: the least preferred ($p, p_{\sigma}$), most preferred ($q, q_{\sigma}$) and $r$
is the familiar QTAIM bond-path. We demonstrate that the most preferred direction for bond motion
using the stress tensor corresponds to the most compressible direction and not to the least compressible
direction as previously reported. We show the necessity for a directional approach constructed
using the eigenvectors along the entire bond length and demonstrate the insufficiency of the sole
use of scalar measures for capturing the nature of the stress tensor within the QTAIM partitioning.
