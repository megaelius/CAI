The influence of miscibility and liquid wettability during droplet impact onto thin wall films
is investigated experimentally. Despite similar liquid properties and impact conditions, differences
in the splashing limit, the crown extension and the duration of the ascending phase are observed.
These differences are related to the interfacial tension of the droplet/wall-film liquid pairs,
which is linked to their miscibility and wettability. More precisely, by calculating the crown
surface energy, we show that the energy stored in the interface between droplet and wall-film (if
any) is not negligible and leads to smaller crown extensions and the need of more kinetic energy to
initiate splashing. Similarly, by calculating a modified capillary time taking into account all
surface and interfacial tensions, we show that the interfacial tension acts as a non-negligible
recoiling force, which reduces the duration of the ascending phase. The dynamics of this ascending
phase is well captured for different wall-film thicknesses if accounting for the variations of
the liquid masses in movement. Overall, droplet/wall-film interactions can be seen as inertio-capillary
systems where the interfacial tension between droplet and wall film plays a significant role in
the storage of energy and in the crown kinetics during the impact process. Besides, this analysis
highlights that viscous losses have already a significant effect during the crown extension phase,
by dissipating almost half of the initial energies for droplet impact onto thin wall films, and most
likely by influencing the capillary time scale through damping.
