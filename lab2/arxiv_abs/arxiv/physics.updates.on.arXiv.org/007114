Mathematical models of diffusive transport underpin our understanding of chemical, biochemical
and biological transport phenomena. Analysis of such models often focusses on relatively simple
geometries and deals with diffusion through highly idealised homogeneous media. In contrast,
practical applications of diffusive transport theory inevitably involve dealing with more complicated
geometries as well as dealing with heterogeneous media. One of the most fundamental properties
of diffusive transport is the concept of mean particle lifetime or mean exit time, which are particular
applications of the concept of first passage time, and provide the mean time required for a diffusing
particle to reach an absorbing boundary. Most formal analysis of mean particle lifetime applies
to relatively simple geometries, often with homogeneous (spatially-invariant) material properties.
In this work, we present a general framework that provides exact mathematical insight into the mean
particle lifetime, and higher moments of particle lifetime, for point particles diffusing in heterogeneous
discs and spheres with radial symmetry. Our analysis applies to geometries with an arbitrary number
and arrangement of distinct layers, where transport in each layer is characterised by a distinct
diffusivity. We obtain exact closed-form expressions for the mean particle lifetime for a diffusing
particle released at an arbitrary location and we generalise these results to give exact, closed-form
expressions for any higher-order moment of particle lifetime for a range of different boundary
conditions. Finally, using these results we construct new homogenization formulae that provide
an accurate simplified description of diffusion through heterogeneous discs and spheres.
