Purpose: This study aims to optimize and characterize the response of a mPSD for in vivo dosimetry
in HDR brachytherapy. Methods: An exhaustive analysis was carried out in order to obtain an optimized
mPSD design that maximize the scintillation light collection produced by the interaction of ionizing
photons. Several mPSD prototypes were built and tested in order to determine the appropriate order
of scintillators relative to the photodetector, as well as their length as a function of the scintillation
light emitted. Scintillators BCF-60, BCF-12 and BCF-10 constituted the mPSD sensitive volume.Each
scintillator contribution to the total spectrum was determined by irradiations in the low energy
range.For the best mPSD design, a numerical optimization was done in order to select the optical
components that better match the light emission profile. The optimized dosimetric system was used
for HDR brachytherapy dose determination. The system performance was quantified in term of signal
to noise ratio and signal to background ratio. Results: It was determined that BCF-60 should be placed
at the distal position, BCF-12 in the center and BCF-10 at proximal position with respect to the photodetector.This
configuration allowed for optimized light transmission through the collecting fiber, avoiding
inter-scintillator excitation and self-absorption effects.The optimized luminescence system
allowed for signal deconvolution using a multispectral approach, extracting the dose to each element
while taking into account Cerenkov stem effect.Differences between the mPSD measurements and
TG-43 remain below 5%. In all measurement conditions, the system was able to properly differentiate
the produced scintillation signal from the background one. Conclusions: A mPSD was constructed
and optimized for HDR brachytherapy dosimetry, enabling real time dose determination, up to 6.5cm
from the 192Ir source.
