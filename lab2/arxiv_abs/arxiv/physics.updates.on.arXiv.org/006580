The brain may be thought of as a many-body architecture with a spatio-temporal dynamics described
by neuronal structures. The oscillatory nature of brain activity allows these structures (nodes)
to be described as a set of coupled oscillators forming a network where the node dynamics, and that
of the network topology can be studied. Quantifying its dynamics at various scales is an issue that
claims to be explored for several brain activities, e.g., activity at rest. The resting-state associates
the underlying brain dynamics of healthy subjects that are not actively compromised with sensory
or cognitive processes. Studying its dynamics is highly non-trivial but opens the door to understand
the general principles of brain functioning. We hypothesize about how could be the spatio-temporal
dynamics of cortical fluctuations for healthy subjects at resting-state. We retrieve the alphabet
that reconstructs the dynamics (entropy/complexity) of magnetoencephalograpy signals. We assemble
the cortical connectivity to elicit the network's dynamics. We depict an order relation between
entropy/complexity for frequency bands. We unveiled that the posterior cortex conglomerates
nodes with both stronger dynamics and high clustering for {\alpha} band. The existence of these
order relations suggests an emergent phenomenon of each band. Interestingly, we find that the posterior
cortex plays a cardinal role in both the dynamics and structure regarding the resting-state. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study with magnetoencephalograpy involving information
theory and network science to better understand the dynamics and structure of brain activity at
rest for different bands and scales.
