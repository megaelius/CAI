Simulating ultrafast electron-nucleus coupled dynamics poses a non-trivial challenge and an
important problem in the investigation of ultrafast processes involving coupled electronic and
vibrational dynamics. Because irreversibility of the system dynamics results from thermal activation
and dissipation caused by the environment, in dynamical studies, it is necessary to include heat
bath degrees of freedom in the total system. When the system dynamics involves high-energy electronic
transitions, the environment is regarded to be in a low-temperature regime and we must treat it quantum
mechanically. In this paper, we present rigorous and versatile approaches for investigating the
dynamics of open systems with coupled electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom within a fully
quantum mechanical framework. These approaches are based on a quantum Fokker-Planck equation
and a quantum Smoluchowski equation employing a heat bath with an Ohmic spectral density, with non-Markovian
low-temperature correction terms, and extensions of these equations to the case of multi-state
systems. The accuracy of these equations was numerically examined for a single-state Brownian
system, while their applicability was examined for multi-state double-well systems by comparing
their results with those of the fewest-switch surface hopping and Ehrenfest methods with a classical
Markovian Langevin force. Comparison of the transient absorption spectra obtained using these
methods clearly reveals the importance of the quantum low-temperature correction terms. These
equations allow us to treat non-adiabatic dynamics in an efficient way, while maintaining numerical
accuracy. The C++ source codes that we developed, which allow for the treatment of the phase and coordinate
space dynamics with any single-state or multi-state potential forms, are provided as Supporting
Information.
