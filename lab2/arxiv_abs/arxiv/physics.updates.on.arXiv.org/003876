Spontaneous emission of quantum emitters can be modified by engineering their optical environment.
This allows a resonant nanoantenna to significantly modify the radiative properties of a quantum
emitter. In this article, we go beyond the common electric dipole approximation for the molecular
electronic transition and take light-matter coupling through higher order multipoles into account.
We investigate, by means of theory and numerical simulations, a strong enhancement of the magnetic
dipole and electric quadrupole emission channels of a molecule adjacent to a plasmonic patch nanoantenna.
While this on its own had been considered, the assumption in prior work usually has been that each
molecular transition is dominated only by one of those multipolar emission channels. This leads
naturally to the notion of discussing the modified emission in terms of a modified local density
of states defined for each specific multipolar transition. In reality, this restricts the applicability
of the approach, since specific molecular transitions occur via multiple multipolar pathways
that have to be considered all at once. Here, we introduce a framework to study interference effects
between higher order transitions in molecules by (a) a rigorous quantum-chemical calculation
of their multipolar moments and (b) by a consecutive investigation of the transition rate upon coupling
to an arbitrarily shaped nanoantenna. Based on that formalism we predict interference effects
between these transition channels. This allows for a strong suppression of radiation by exploiting
destructive interference. Our work suggests that placing a suitably chosen molecule at a well defined
position and at a well defined orientation relative to a nanoantenna can fully suppress the transition
probability.
