We report an atomic-scale analysis of the microstructure of Nb3Sn coating on Nb prepared by vapor
diffusion process for superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavity application using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Epitaxial growth of Nb3Sn on the Nb substrate is found and four types
of orientation relationships at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface are identified by electron diffraction
or high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis. Thin Nb3Sn grains
are observed in regions with low Sn flux and they have the specific orientation relationship, Nb3Sn
(1-20)//Nb (-111) and Nb3Sn (002)//Nb (0-11). The Nb3Sn/Nb interface of thin grains had a large
lattice mismatch, 12.3 at.%, and a high density of misfit dislocations was observed by HR-STEM.
Based on our microstructural analysis of the thin grains, we conclude that the thin regions are probably
a result of a slow interfacial reaction with this particular orientation relationship at the interface.
The Sn-deficient regions are seen to form initially at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface and remain in the grains
due to the slow diffusion of Sn in bulk Nb3Sn. The formation of Sn-deficient regions and the effects
of strain and interfacial energies on the formation of Sn-deficient regions at various interfaces
were also estimated by first-principle calculation. The finding of orientation relationships
at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface provides important information about the formation of defects in Nb3Sn
coatings such as large thin regions, Sn-deficient regions, which are critical to the performance
of Nb3Sn superconducting radiofrequency cavities for accelerators.
