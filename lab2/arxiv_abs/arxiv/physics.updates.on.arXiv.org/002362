We analyse the time dependent non-linear rheology of a dilute bacterial suspension (e.g. E. coli)
for a pair of impulsively started linear flows - simple shear and uniaxial extension. The rheology
is governed by the bacterium orientation distribution which satisfies a kinetic equation that
includes rotation by the imposed flow, and relaxation to isotropy via rotary diffusion and tumbling.
The relevant dimensionless parameters are the Peclet number $Pe\equiv \dot{\gamma}\tau$, which
dictates the importance of flow-induced orientation anisotropy, and $\tau D_r$, which quantifies
the relative importance of the two intrinsic orientation decorrelation mechanisms (tumbling
and rotary diffusion). Here, $\tau$ is the mean run duration of a bacterium that exhibits a run-and-tumble
dynamics, $D_r$ is the intrinsic rotary diffusivity of the bacterium and $\dot{\gamma}$ is the
characteristic magnitude of the imposed velocity gradient. The solution of the kinetic equation
is obtained numerically using a spectral Galerkin method, and yields the relevant rheological
properties over the entire range of $Pe$. For simple shear, the stress relaxation predicted by our
analysis at small $Pe$ is in good agreement with the experimental observations of Lopez et al. (2015).
However, the analysis at large $Pe$ yields relaxations that are qualitatively different. The rheological
response in the experiments corresponds to a transition from a nearly isotropic suspension of active
swimmers at small $Pe$, to an apparently (nearly) isotropic suspension of passive rods at large
$Pe$. In contrast, the computations yield the expected transition to a nearly flow-aligned suspension
of passive rigid rods at high $Pe$. We probe this active-passive transition systematically, complementing
the numerical solution with analytical solutions obtained from perturbation expansions about
appropriate base states.
