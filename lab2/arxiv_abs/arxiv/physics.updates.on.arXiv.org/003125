The analysis of the seismic vulnerability of urban centres has received a great attention in the
last century, due to the progressive concentration of buildings in metropolitan areas. In order
to estimate the seismic vulnerability of a densely populated urban area, it would in principle be
necessary to develop in-depth analyses for predicting the dynamic behaviour of the individual
buildings and their structural aggregation when subjected to the expected earthquake. Furthermore,
in order to correctly estimate the soil structure interaction, reliable geological data for each
site should be available. These detailed seismic analyses, however, are extremely cost-intensive,
require great processing time and expertise judgement. The aim of the present study is to propose
a new methodology able to combine information and tools coming from different scientific fields
in order to reproduce the effects of a seismic input in urban areas, with known geological features,
and to estimate the entity of the damages caused on existing buildings. In particular, we present
an agent-based model of earthquake dynamics, based on the Self-Organized Criticality framework,
in order to evaluate the effects of a sequence of seismic events on a certain large urban area during
a given interval of time. The integration of GIS data sets, concerning both geological and urban
information about the territory of Avola (Italy), allows performing a parametric study of these
effects on a real context. The proposed new approach could be very useful in estimating the seismic
vulnerability and defining planning strategies for seismic risk reduction in large urban areas.
