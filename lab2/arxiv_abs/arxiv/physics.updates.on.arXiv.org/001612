A lot of research has been carried out to find out the influence of low frequency noise on human behavior.
Based on currently available results, some countries have been developing National Standard to
limit the low frequency noise to protect people's health and working performance. However, after
investigating 28 National Standards about noise limitation of working machine and other noise
emission standards of China, it is found that the stipulation of low frequency noise covers limited
aspects. Most of the limitation used A-weight sound level as the evaluation index, which only presents
the loudness perception of sound, not its influence. In this paper, two connected topics are presented.
One is to investigate the Chinese National Standard and International Standard, in order to summarize
all the noise limitation on low frequency noise. The second topic is the application of online psychoacoustic
test to evaluate the influence of low frequency noise on human performance, which can enlarge the
subjective testing sample size in order to facilitate the establishment of related National Standard.
The online Hass effect experiment is repeated to verify the accuracy of online psychoacoustic test.
The volunteers are asked to conduct several sessions of the colour identification problems under
different kind of controlled noise. The accuracy and finishing time are taken into consideration
to evaluate their performance under different kinds of noise. The results show that low frequency
noise does affect humans' working performance and the existing Chinese Noise limitation Standards
are inadequate in low frequency noise limitation.
