The line-of-sight (LOS) component of the large-scale photospheric magnetic field has been observed
since the 1950s, but the daily full-disk observations of the full vector magnetic field started
only in 2010 using the SOLIS Vector Stokes Magnetograph (VSM) and the SDO helioseismic and magnetic
imager (HMI). Traditionally, potential field extrapolations are based on the assumption that
the magnetic field in the photosphere is approximately radial. The validity of this assumption
has not been tested yet. We investigate here the structure and evolution of the three components
of the solar large-scale magnetic field in 2010 - 2017, covering the ascending to mid-declining
phase of solar cycle 24, using SOLIS/VSM vector synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field.
We compare the observed VSM vector magnetic field to the potential vector field derived using the
VSM LOS magnetic field observations as an input. The new vector field data allow us to derive the meridional
inclination and the azimuth angle of the magnetic field and to investigate their solar cycle evolution
and latitudinal profile of these quantities. SOLIS/VSM vector data show that the photospheric
magnetic field is in general fairly non-radial. In the meridional plane the field is inclined toward
the equator, reflecting the dipolar structure of the solar magnetic field. Rotationally averaged
meridional inclination does not have significant solar cycle variation. While the vector radial
component $B_r$ and the potential radial component $B_r^{PFSS}$ are fairly similar, the meridional
and zonal components do not agree very well. We find that SOLIS/VSM vector observations are noisy
at high latitudes and suffer from the vantage point effect more than LOS observations. This is due
to different noise properties in the LOS and transverse components of the magnetic field, which
needs to be addressed in future studies.
