We provide detailed comparisons between experimental findings and numerical simulations of large
cooperatively interacting, spatially disordered metamaterial arrays, consisting of asymmetrically
split rings. Simulation methods fully incorporate strong field-mediated inter-meta-atom interactions
between discrete resonators and statistical properties of disorder, while approximating the
resonators' internal structure. Despite the large system size, we find a qualitative agreement
between the simulations and experiments, and characterize the microscopic origins of the observed
disorder response. Our microscopic description of macroscopic electrodynamics reveals how the
response of disordered arrays with strong field-mediated interactions is inherently linked to
their cooperative response to electromagnetic waves where the multiple scattering induces strong
correlations between the excitations of individual resonators. Whereas for a regular array the
response can be overwhelmingly dominated by a spatially-extended collective eigenmode with subradiant
characteristics, a gradual increase of the positional disorder rapidly leads to a spatial localization
of both the electric and magnetic dipolar excitation profile of this eigenmode. We show how the effects
of disorder and cooperative interactions are mapped onto the transmission resonance in the far
field spectrum and measure the "cooperative Lamb shift" of the resonance that is shifting toward
the red as the disorder increases. The interplay between the disorder and interactions generally
is most dramatic in the microwave arrays, but we find that in suitable regimes the strong disorder
effects can be achieved also for plasmonic optical systems.
