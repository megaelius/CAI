Second sound and heat diffusion in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) is well-known phenomena
which is related to the high thermal conductivity of this material. In this paper, we have shown that
the heat diffusion along the tube axis affects the macroscopic motion of SWCNT and adapting this
phenomena to coarse-grained model can improve the precision of the coarse-grained molecular dynamics
(CGMD) exceptionally. The nonlinear macroscopic motion of SWCNT in the free thermal vibration
condition in adiabatic environment is demonstrated in the most simplified version of CG modeling
as maintaining finite temperature and total energy with suggested dissipation process derived
from internal heat diffusion. The internal heat diffusion related to the cross correlated momentum
from different potential energy functions is considered, and it can reproduce the nonlinear dynamic
nature of SWCNTs without external thermostatting in CG model. Memory effect and thermostat with
random noise distribution are not included, and the effect of heat diffusion on memory effect is
reviewed through Mori-Zwanzig formalism. This diffusion shows perfect syncronization of the
motion between that of CGMD and MD simulation, which is started with initial conditions from the
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The heat diffusion related to this process has shown the same
dispersive characteristics to second wave in SWCNT. This replication with good precision indicates
that the internal heat diffusion process is the essential cause of the nonlinearity of the tube.
The nonlinear dynamic characteristics from the various scale of simple beads systems are examined
with expanding its time step and node length simultaneously.
