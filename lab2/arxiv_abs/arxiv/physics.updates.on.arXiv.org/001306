Comprehensive and quantitative investigations of social theories and phenomena increasingly
benefit from the vast breadth of data describing human social relations, which is now available
within the realm of computational social science. Such data are, however, typically proxies for
one of the many interaction layers composing social networks, which can be defined in many ways and
are typically composed of communication of various types (e.g., phone calls, face-to-face communication,
etc.). As a result, many studies focus on one single layer, corresponding to the data at hand. Several
studies have, however, shown that these layers are not interchangeable, despite the presence of
a certain level of correlations between them. Here, we investigate whether different layers of
interactions among individuals lead to similar conclusions with respect to the presence of homophily
patterns in a population---homophily represents one of the widest studied phenomenon in social
networks. To this aim, we consider a dataset describing interactions and links of various nature
in a population of Asian students with diverse nationalities, first language and gender. We study
homophily patterns, as well as their temporal evolutions in each layer of the social network. To
facilitate our analysis, we put forward a general method to assess whether the homophily patterns
observed in one layer inform us about patterns in another layer. For instance, our study reveals
that three network layers---cell phone communications, questionnaires about friendship, and
trust relations---lead to similar and consistent results despite some minor discrepancies. The
homophily patterns of the co-presence network layer, however, does not yield any meaningful information
about other network layers.
