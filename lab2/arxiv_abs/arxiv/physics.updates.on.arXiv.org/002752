We propose a kinetic model describing the formation of the strahl and halo electron populations
in the solar wind. We demonstrate that the suprathermal electrons propagating from the sun along
the Parker-spiral magnetic field lines are progressively focused into a narrow strahl at heliospheric
distances $r\lesssim 1$ AU, while at $r\gtrsim 1$ AU the width of the strahl saturates due to Coulomb
collisions and becomes independent of the distance. Our theory of the strahl broadening does not
contain free parameters and it agrees with the Wind observations at 1 AU to within $15-20\%$. This
indicates that Coulomb scattering, rather than anomalous turbulent diffusion, plays a dominant
role in strahl formation in these observations. We further propose that the nearly isotropic halo
electron population may be composed of electrons that ran away from the sun as an electron strahl,
but later ended up on magnetic field lines leading them back to the sun. Through the effects of magnetic
defocusing and Coulomb pitch-angle scattering, a narrow source distribution at large heliocentric
distances appears nearly isotropic at distances $\sim$1 AU. The halo electrons are, therefore,
not produced locally; rather, they are the fast electrons trapped by magnetic field lines on global
heliospheric scales. At the electron energies $K \lesssim 200\,\, {\rm eV}$, our theory is quite
insensitive to the particular mechanism that produces a population of sunward-streaming suprathermal
particles. At larger energies, however, our theory indicates that the scattering provided by Coulomb
collisions alone is not sufficient to isotropize a narrow sunward-propagating electron beam.
