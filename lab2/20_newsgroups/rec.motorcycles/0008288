hey... I'm pretty new to the wonderful world of motorcycles... I just
bought
a used 81 Kaw KZ650 CSR from a friend.... I was just wondering what kind of
saddle bags I could get for it (since I know nothing about them)  are there
bags for the gas tank?  how much would some cost, and how much do they
hold?
thanks for your advice!!!  I may be new to riding, but I love it
already!!!!
