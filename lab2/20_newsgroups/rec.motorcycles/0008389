From what I've seen in my 17 years as an MOA member, most of the folks
in the RA are also in the MOA... I guess it's called covering all the
bases to get some idea of what is really happening.. How else does one
think the RA gets all the juicey news about what's happen' inside the 
Nihilism isn't for everyone, not that it really matters!
