    I saw a bike today and I want to know what it is.  Lets begin
by saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally,
it had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, at
first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),
but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,
the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like 
900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for the
rear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)
So, what did I see?
(PS, for any of you Boulder DoDers, I saw it parked at the Engineering
center today. It is white with light green stripes.)
