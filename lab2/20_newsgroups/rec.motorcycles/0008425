  Anyone interesting in a mailing list for Harley-Davidson bikes, lifestyle,
politics, H.O.G. and whatever over 310 members from 14 countries make it,
may subscribe by sending a request to:
              harley-request@thinkage.on.ca
          or  uunet.ca!thinkage!harley-request
* Your request to join should have a signature or something giving your full
* Email address.  Do not RELY on the header "From:" field being useful to me.
* This is not an automated "listserv" facility. Do not expect instant
* gratification.
The list is a digest format scheduled for twice a day.
Members of the harley list may obtain back-issues and subject-index
    listings, pictures, etc. via an Email archive server. 
Server access is restricted to list subscribers only.
FTP access "real soon".
