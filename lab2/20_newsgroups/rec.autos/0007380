Hi,
My friend's 1983 Toyota Tercel accelerates by itself without using
the gas peddel. The repairman said it has a internal leak of air in
the carburetor and needs a new carburetor (costs $650). She likes
to know if it is possible to fix the problem without replacing
the whole carburetor.
Thank you.
