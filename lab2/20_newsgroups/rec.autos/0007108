	"I read an article in the 3/25 Chicago Tribune stating that
	Chrysler is having problems addressing the demand for the 3.5L
	engine for it's LH cars.  Can anyone post how long they are
	waiting for an ordered car or how long they have been told
	they'll have to wait??"
Ordered mine December 30, got it nine weeks later.  But the dealer said
that *new* orders were being held up -- he didn't expect to see any
more 3.5L-engine LHs for awhile.
