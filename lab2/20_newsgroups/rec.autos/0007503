A list of options that would be useful. They can be existing
options on a car, or things you'd like to have...
1) Tripmeter, great little gadget. Lets you keep rough track of
   mileage, makes a good second guesser for your gas gauge...
2) Full size spare
3) Built in mountings and power systems for radar detectors.
4) a fitting that allows you to generate household current with
the engine running, and plug ins in the trunk, engine compartment
and cabin.
Feel free to add on...

Within the span of the last few weeks I have heard elements of
separate threads which, in that they have been conjoined in time,
struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing
gourd. --Unknown net.person
