I just had my 41 Chrysler painted. I was told to refrain from waxing it and
to leave it out in the sun!! Supposedly this let's the volatiles escape from
the paint over a month or so (I can smell it 15 feet away on a hot day) and
lets any slight irregularites in the surface flow out, as the paint remains
a little soft for a while.
