Hey...
I may be wrong, but wasn't Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath?  He's a
MAJOR brother in Christ now.  He totally changed his life around, and
he and his wife go on tours singing, witnessing, and spreading the
gospel for Christ.  I may be wrong about Black Sabbath, but I know he
was in a similar band if it wasn't that particular group...
Grace and peace to all, (I'll see you ALL Someday!)
