I am writing a X-based dosemu which requires XKeyReleasedEvent. 
I found the keycode of XKeyReleasedEvent is wrong.   If I run the program on
a Linux host(XFree1.2) with  DISPLAY set to the local Linux and to
the Sun host (X11R5), the two keycodes from the two Xservers are different. 
Of course, the keycode of XKeyPressedEvent is O.K.
Can anybody verify this ?     Did I do anything wrong ? 
Thanks.
