I am in the process of modifying an X application that uses Xlib.  I'd
like to include a timer-driven facility (for network polling), but cannot
see how to do it using Xlib.  I know it can be done with Xaw, using
XtAppAddTimeout and XtTimerCallBackProc.  How do I do the same using
Xlib?
Thanks for any help.  Please email.
