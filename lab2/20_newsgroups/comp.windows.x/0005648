Can anybody tell me anything about the availibility of non-Roman fonts
for X-Windows? Especially Unicode and/or han idiographic fonts.
Also, how about conversion tools for getting PC/Macintosh fonts into a
format suitable for X? I would assume it is not too difficult for
bitmap fonts.
The FAQ's for this group and comp.fonts are not very helpful on these
questions.
