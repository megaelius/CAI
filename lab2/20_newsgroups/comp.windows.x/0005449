Greetings,
My question is whether the upcoming release of X11R6 will provide
(strong) authentication between the X clients and server(s). If so,
will this feature be based on the Kerberos authentication mechanism
(and, if so, will Kerberos Version 5 be used)? Please reply via email.
Thanks,
--Andre
