I've installed X11R5 with patches for Solaris 2.1 on our SPARCstation LX /
SPARCclassic pool. On the LX, X11R5 runs fine, but on the classics,
after giving the command startx, Xsun prints the following messages:
	WARNING: cg3_mmap: can't map dummy space!
	Mapping cg3c: No such device or address
and exits.
Does anybody know how to fix this problem?
Thanks in advance.
