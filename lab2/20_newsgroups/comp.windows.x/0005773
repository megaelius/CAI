While I have respect for John's ability and integrity, I really regret his
leaving just after a major release (or, more accurately, making the release
just before leaving).  Several of us are having problems with xv-3.00, and
in particular I have issues with all the fixes that have so far been made
to the Imakefiles and xv.h.  Without John to adjudicate, and everybody
posting fixes that work for *them*, chaos is inevitable; let's hope it is
temporary.
