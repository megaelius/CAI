I am creating a graphics program using the Athena widgets. I use
Xlib routines to install a custom Graphics Contex by obtaining the display,
and window variables with the XtWindowOfObject() and XtDisplayOfObject().
The object was one of the sub widgets.  
  The problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected
the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one. I tried moving the allocation
of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing
changed. I am preforming all of this manipulation before calling 
XtAppMainLoop().
Thank you for any help.
