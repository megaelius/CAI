Well, thanks largely to subscribers of this group, here's xrastool 1.0,
the animation package I started just over 3 weeks ago. A number of the
solutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated in
the code, so have a look! The full blurb has been posted to
comp.windows.x.announce.
This post is in two parts. To unpack the source code, extract the
articles into file1 and file2 (for example). Use a text editor to
remove leading and trailing text at the "---cut here---" markers
(including the markers themselves). Next type "cat file1 file2 >
file", then "uudecode file" and "zcat xrastool1.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -".
Read the README file for instructions on how to proceed from there.
Enjoy!
Derek
P.S. The source is also available for anon ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu
in the contrib/ directory. If there is enough demand, a static binary
will be provided for those without the XView libraries or include
files.
