(e). (d) is close but misses the point that there is a third party,
with their own subjective viewpoint, asked to make a decision.  Peace
is not "better" than war, unless we view the situation subjectively as
humans.  Of course, we *are* humans, and so *do* view situations from
our own perspective, so it is meaningful for us to discuss questions
of war and peace.
