      Aha; this would put the definition much closer to the moral
absolutism I'm more aquainted to debating.

      We all agree that it's rather unlikely (as the definitions of
"rape" and "murder" are tied to the definitions of "evil", more like
impossible, actually); but what if some society, someday, actually hit
on a good, sound reason for _why_ rape and murder should be moral?

      I don't quite parse this, but you seem to be saying, "absolute
morals are defensible, insofar as we consider them good". Which, of
course, is correct; but then you need an absolute definition of "good".

      Hang on - what's an "aberrance in a moral system"?
Do you mean "moral codes that seem useless or bad", perchance? But your
judgement of what exactly is 'useless' and/or 'bad' is your own opinion;
subjective, not objective.

      Me too, and add in all unmotivated morals and laws as well.
