Thanks to whoever posted this wonderful parody of people who post without 
reading the FAQ!  I was laughing for a good 5 minutes.  Were there any 
parts of the FAQ that weren't mentioned?  I think there might have been one
or two...
Please don't tell me this wasn't a joke.  I'm not ready to hear that yet...
