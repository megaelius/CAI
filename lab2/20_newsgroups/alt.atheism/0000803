What a coincidence!  That's exactly how I've experienced it too.
So far.
Trouble is, I've no way of knowing if it is just coincidence.
That is, it appears to have been that way in all measurements to date.
But I wouldn't go as far as saying that it will always be so - or that it need 
always be so.

More coincidence!  Wow.
Still - I wish I could be *sure* that it was always going to be like that.
