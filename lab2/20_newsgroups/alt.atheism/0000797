Not that Einstein "proved" anything, but you can't answer it, and your 
answer be in general true.  And even that statement assumes an
objective reality independent of our beliefs about it.

s/an objective reality for values/some values are real even in the face
of disagreement/
If you are saying that some moral systems are better than others, in
your opinion, then all you get is infinite regress.  What you do not get
is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
is inferior to that of the man of peace.  Your saying it does not
make it so,  and that's according to your premise, not mine.
