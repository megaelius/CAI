If the quality x does not exist, nothing has quality x.  Which part did
you not understand?

Peter, you may assert that I am confused about this all you want, but
wishing it does not make it so.   A simple theory is not simple until
someone judges it to be.  A theory merely makes predictions.  Predictions
are not accurate until someone judges them to be.  You are choosing
theories at subjective whim, in other words?  At what point do things
get objective, Peter?
