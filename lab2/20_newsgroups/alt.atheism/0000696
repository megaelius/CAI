To repeat what I said in an earlier post: Evolution is theory and fact.  If you
accept the facts, then that is a display of reason and intelligence and much
different from anachronistic religion.  If you assess the theories of evolution
objectively, then there can be 0% religion involved and evolution remains
useful in the realm of science.
Simply put, evolution/creation when each is looked at properly - theory/fact
vs. assertion/fiction - is a specific example of exactly what separates reason
and science from nonsense.
