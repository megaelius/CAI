The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not
necessarily rectangular) as a window.  My problem then is in
finding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons"
from the first one.  Is this simply a matter of extending the
usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked
against another polygon???  Is there a simpler way??
Comments welcome.
