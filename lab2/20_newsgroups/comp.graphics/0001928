   I need help in creating my 4x4 perspective matrix.  I'd like to use this for
   transforming x, y, z, w in some texture mapping code I got from Graphics Gems
   I.  I have many books which talk about this, but none of them in simple plain
   english.  If you have Graphics Gems I, I'm talking about page 678.
   I'd like to have a perspective matrix that handles different field-of-views
   and aspect of course.  Thank's for your help.
ca2 = cos(alpha / 2) Horizontal
sa2 = sin(alpha / 2)
cb2 = cos(beta / 2) Vertical
sb2 = sin(beta 7 2)
Zf = Far clipping value
Zn = Near clipping value
Matrix:
[[ca2/sa2 0 0 0]
