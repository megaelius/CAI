Get the generic version (for Unix and VMS) and build it. IMHO a
VMS .com file to build it is supplied.
As the distribution comes as .tar.Z you should either have uncompress
and tar on VMS or a UNIX flavoured machine handy.
Usually you won't find this on IBM-PC specific archives, but on the better
ones :)
