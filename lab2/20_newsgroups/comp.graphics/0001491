I have a small program to extract a 640x480 image from a vga 16 color screen,
and store that image in a TIFF file.  I need to insert the image into a
sales brochure, which I then need printed in 4 color.  On a mac, I would
use Photoshop to separate the image into 5 EPS files, and then pull it into
quark express, then get it printed to film on a lintronix at a service bureau.
However, I don't have a mac, but I do have windows.  What would I need to 
do this type of operation in the windows 3.1 environment?  Are there any
separation programs available on the net?  Is there a good page layout program
that I should look into?
Thanks in advance.
