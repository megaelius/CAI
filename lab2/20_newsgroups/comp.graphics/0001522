I've got a 386 20Hz computer which is under warranty and my Trident
8900C video card is starting to play-up (surprise, surprise). Therefore
I'm going to try to exchange it for a better card.
The BIG Question is:
Which video card is high quality and with an
acceptable price tag (on student budget) ???
	Thank you in advance.
