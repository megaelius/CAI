The 68070 _does_ exist. It's number was licensed to Philips to make their
own variant. This chip includes extra featurfes such as more I/O ports, 
I2C bus... making it more microcontroller like.
Because of the confusion with numbering (!), Philips other products in the
[range with the 68??? core have been given differend numbers like PCF...
or PCD7.. or something.
