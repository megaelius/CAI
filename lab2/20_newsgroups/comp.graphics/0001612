Does anyone have any real experience with the Kubota Kenai/Denali
series of graphics workstations?  They pretty much blow the pants
off SGI machines and Sun machines in the same price point, which
is about 50,000 bucks.  Real nice stuff, but I've only seen the
stuff on paper.  I'm wondering, is there anything NOT to like?  The
specs are too massive to get into here, but if a summary is desired
I could be coaxed into uploading the spec sheet.
