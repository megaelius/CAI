If some kind person has access to a mathematical package such as Mathematica,
Maple,... I would like to ask you for the solution to the following problem.
I sometimes have algebra problems like this where I would like a simplified
symbolic solution. Is there a FTP-able package out there that can handle such
beasts?
    I would like to solve the following ray - Bezier patch intersection
    for the scalar constant t in:
        P                    + t * V                =  Q(u,w)
         (origin point in 3D)       (dir vector 3D)
    in terms of only:
          P            V            P                     and various scalars
           (origin) ,   (dir 3D) ,   (i,j) 0 <= i,j <= 3
    where:
    Q(u,w) = [U] [N] [B] [M]  [W]
      [U] = [ u  u    u     u ....     u  1 ]      ( 0.0 <= u <= 1.0 )
          = [ u  u  u 1 ]    ( in my particular case )
          = [ w  w  w 1 ]    ( in my particular case )
      [ N ] = [ M ]   =  | -1  3 -3  1 |     ( for my particular case )
      [ B ] =  | P       P       P       P      | (control points in 3D space)
                                        Thanx,
                                    chuck@elwood.reston.ingr.com
