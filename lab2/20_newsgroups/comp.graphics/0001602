Hi all.  I'm looking for datasets of a human body or head  in any
of the popular formats.  I'm doing a presentation tomorrow which
could be greatly enhanced by bringing in this 'human' factor.  I've
looked around the net with no sucess so far.  Anyone got any ideas?
I'd also appreciate info on the location of datasets for the
USS Enterprise (any model)
Thanks in advance,
Ronan
