I was chaining around in the anonymous ftp world looking for 3D Studio
meshes and other interesting graphical stuff for the program, and found
a few files with the extension 3D2.  My 3DS v2.01 doesn't know this type
of file, so what are they?
And of course, the perennial... Where are some meshes, fli files, etc.
out there?   I would have thought that someone would have collected a few
and put them somewhere, but alas I am without this knowledge.
mucho appreciato
