I have numerous 7000 series scopes which are surplus to requirements.
These devices range from fully functional to having a fault which
remained unrepaired since they weren't needed any longer.
My query is: is there anybody in Australia interested in buying them?
I think the shipping costs would make it impractical to send them O/S.
(Certainly the mainframes, but if you're willing to pay shipping, I'll
consider offers for individual plug-ins).
For those who are in the know (anywhere in the world), what are these 
bits worth second hand in your area?
I have:
	11	7603 Mainframes
	4	7A15 Vertical Amp
	18	7A15A Vertical Amp
	1	7A16 Vertical Amp
	10	7A22 Differential Amp (10uV / Div, 1 MHz, 100,000:1 CMRR)
	6	7B50 Timebase
	8	7B50A Timebase
	1	7B51 Timebase
in addition, I have the following, which have been smoke damaged in a fire
and, although washed, are probably a little more prone to failure than
the others:
	2	7603 Mainframes
	5	7403N Mainframes
	5	7A15 Vertical Amp
	2	7A15A Vertical Amp
	5	7B50 Timebase
Overall, I suspect that the 7A22's are worth as much as all the rest
put together. All bar one of these are operational - that one failed
and has never been repaired because it was no longer needed.
The 7A22 has an on-board voltage offset as well as switchable high-
and low- pass filters. There is _nothing_ on the market, to my
knowledge, that comes close to the specs of this plug-in.
All of the above have service manuals.
