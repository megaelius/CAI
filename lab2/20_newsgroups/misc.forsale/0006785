I have this kit which includes the following :
1)	82c84a/82c84a-5
All these are chips with complete manual in a box. I don't know whether they
still work or not, and I don't really know what they are. 
So this is mainly for those who knows what this is and have use of it 
(probably EE stuff since this used to belong to a EE student)
Anyone interested, please make me an offer.
