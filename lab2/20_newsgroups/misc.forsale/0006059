I'm looking for a used/inexpensive audio mixer.  I need at least 
4 channels of stereo input and 1 channel of stereo output, but I would
prefer 8 or more input channels.  Each channel needs to have at least a 
volume control.  I'll consider buying broken equipment.  The mixer needs 
to be fairly small (I haven't got a lot of space for it).
