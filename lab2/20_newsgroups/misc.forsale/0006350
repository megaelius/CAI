I am looking to sell my ICOM IC-02AT and extras.  I have the  
following:
CM-12 Battery
HS-10 Headset
HS-10SA VOX unit
Cigarette Adapter
Leather Case
BC-25V Wall Charger
IC-BP3 Battery		Also have one that needs a new cell (i think,  
its been a while)
It is in good condition, has a scratch on the front that is not  
visible when in the leather case.
If you are interested, make me an offer.
