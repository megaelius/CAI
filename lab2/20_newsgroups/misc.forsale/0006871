I have forsale a 486 25 slc notebook very small
                         64 shades of grey VGA
                         built in trackball
                         very fast machine
bought it just 3 months ago for $1500.00 and realized
I don't need this much power in a notebook.
I was asking $1300.00... Now the first person with $1150.00 takes it.
