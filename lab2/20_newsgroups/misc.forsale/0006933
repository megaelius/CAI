I have a certificate for one round-trip airfares to either Acapulco or
Cancun, Mexico.
Expiration date is one year from now.
The maximum retail value, depending on time and location, is estimated at
$1100, including accommodation for 3 days and 2 nights at a leading
hotel. I am asking for $1000 or best offer.
