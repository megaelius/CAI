Mind my asking why you're selling a used machine with a damaged
keyboard for the about the same price as a brand new A4000/030
(A4000-EC030/4 megs/120meg IDE HD/HD Floppy/v3.0 OS - $1899)?
I'd like to get an A3000 locally for something reasonable like less
than 1K without monitor.  Brand new the A3000-25mhz/50 meg HD/HD
floppy/2.1 ROM isn't running for more than $1400 or so.
Considering it's damaged, probabably has a real old version of the OS
I'll offer $700.  Don't laugh...my A2000 isn't worth more than
$250-$300 these days.
