1. There is a similar idea here in ex-USSR about how many militioners it needs
   to place a new electric lamp. The answer is nine: one stays on a table and
   holds the lamp, four hold the table and turn it and yet four run around the
   table in opposite direction not to make the first feel bad (when being
   turned). Pitily, it lacks this kind of dark humour as Nick's msg does.
2. To my mind the signature should be smth like:
                                          Albert
