Is this group for real? I honestly can't believe that most of you expect you
or your concerns to be taken remotely seriously if you behave this way in a
forum for discussion. Doesn't it ever occur to those of you who write letters
like the majority of those in this group that you're being mind-bogglingly
hypocritical?
