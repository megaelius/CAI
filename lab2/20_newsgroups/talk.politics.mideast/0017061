Absolutely.  If Yoni and Bibi Natanyahu are "typical jew leader"s,
then I personally am proud to aspire to such a status (disregarding
Hamaza H. Salah's negative connotation of Jews).  Yoni was a great
man and a Harvard grad who died for his country and people.  Bibi
is also a great leader who will undoubtedly be a major force in
Middle East politics for many years to come.
