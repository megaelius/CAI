   As someone who reads Israeli newpapaers every day, I can state
with absolute certainty, that anybody who relies on western media
to get a picture of what is happening in Israel is not getting an
accurate picture.  There is tremendous bias in those stories that
do get reported.  And the stories that NEVER get mentioned create
a completely false picture of the mideast.
