I agree -- he looked and sounded very western.
I did not quite follow one thing that he said.  He referred to a
ten mile stretch that would remain of Israel if the "occupied"
territories were given away.  Is that really true, I mean are the
territories that significant in area or did I get lost in the discussion?
Could someone enlighten me on this?
