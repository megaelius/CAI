The borders of the Jewish state as drawn by the U.N. included the areas which

I never touched an Arab during my army service and never voted for anyone more
right than the Green party.  Will I be spared by these "humanist standards"?
(or will anyone stop to consider this before sloughtering me?)
I doubt it.  And not only because of the past record of murdering helpless
women and children since the turn of the century up to these days.
