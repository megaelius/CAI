Dear Mr. Davidsson,
   You claim that your purpose is to fight racism.  But you don't
seem to have any interest in injustice except that which may have
been committed by Israel.  The treatment of Jews in Arab nations,
an injustice of staggerring proportions, is an injustice that you
do not seem to care the least bit about.  Why not?
