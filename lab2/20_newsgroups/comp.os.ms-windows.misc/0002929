Hello,
I thought this problem might have something to do with Windows 3.1 SMARTDRV and
a VESA video card...any ideas???
I recently purchased a 486DX-33 machine and am having problems where the 
machine will suddenly freeze or reboot.  This may happen in Windows 3.1 or DOS 
5.0.  Sometimes it is after printing a document, sometimes after using the 
mouse, and sometimes just when I am sitting there.  Twice when it happened, the 
machine rebooted and sounded seven beeps.  I looked in the documentation and 
the seven beep code meant a problem with interrupts.  The machine has the 
following configuration and files:
5.25 and 3.5 floppies
170 Meg IDE hard drive
256k cache
Microsoft compatible mouse on com1
Citizen GSX-145 on lpt1
NI SuperVGA Monitor with VESA Windows Accelerator Card w/ 1Meg
Two VESA slots
Windows 3.1
When the machine freezes, I can't use the mouse or keyboard or use Ctrl-Alt-Del 
to reboot.  If any one can give me any help, I would greatly appreciate it.  If 
anyone can help configure this machine for the best efficiency (memory wise) I 
would appreciate that also.
