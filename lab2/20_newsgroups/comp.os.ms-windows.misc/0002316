The Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) documentation (blurb)
states that the user must separately acquire the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK), which contains the Windows tools
to build the drivers. If we are using Borland C++ with Application
Frameworks, is this necessary? We also have a copy of the Microsoft
Press Programmer's Reference Library (books) which normally comes
with the SDK, and Microsoft Macro Assembler 6.0. Why is the SDK
neccessary for development of Virtual Device Drivers?
