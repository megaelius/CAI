Can someone out there tell me how to switch Window's screen resolution
quickly and easily?  I know that I can go back into install to do it,
but what I'd really like is to have is the ability to just change a
couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution
changed.  I already have both video drivers that I need on my system,
so that isn't a problem.
Thanks,
Sean.
