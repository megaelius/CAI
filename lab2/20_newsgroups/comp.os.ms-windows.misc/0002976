Due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts.
This is a uuencoded bitmap.  960X600 256 colors.
The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background.
The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display
because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons
to fit in without being on top of the picture. Reguarding image
quality and resolution - I have not seen much better.
For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here
is how to put it back together.
	1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files
	2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer
	   in each file.
	3. concatinate all the parts into a single file
	4. uudecode the file
There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as
uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).  If neccesary I could post
these tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know.
