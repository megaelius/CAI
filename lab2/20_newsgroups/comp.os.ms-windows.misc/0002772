I have several people sharing my machine and would like to set up separate
environments under Windows for each of them.  Is there some way of setting
things up separate desktops/directories for each of them?  Ideally,
I'd like totally separate virtual machines.  I'd be willing to settle for
less, and may end up having batch files that copy .ini files around
depending on who wants to use the machine.

Alas, Setup/n doesn't work if you don't have a network.
