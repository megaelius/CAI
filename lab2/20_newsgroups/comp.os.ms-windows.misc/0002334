Can somebody help me out of this.....
I just installed the Version 104 of McAFree anti-virus program and when i
tried to scan the entire hard disk, i got the message of "Sorry, I can't open
xxxx" for a couple of files, including the WScan104.exe. This didn't happen 
before (in previous  version) nor appear on my friend's machine. 
Thankx....
