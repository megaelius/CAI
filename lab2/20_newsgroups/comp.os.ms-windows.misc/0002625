Hi all,
has anybody tried to compile CTRLTEST from the MFC/SAMPLES directory,
after compiling the MFC-libs with BWC ?
Seems to me, that BWC isn't able to distinguish pointers to overloaded
functions.
For example, imagine the following 2 (overloaded) functions:
void same_name ( void ) 
void same_name ( int )
After trying the whole day, I think, with BWC its impossible to take the
adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined
function pointer. 
Am I right ? Has anybody else had this problem ?
	thanx
