Title says it all: I'm in need of a Truetype OEM character set font - ie
one that contains the line drawing and other characters in the PC 
character set similar to those you get when running a text mode application.
If anyone could point me at such a thing, I'd be grateful.
[The only OEM fonts included with Windows are not Truetype.]
Regards,
Colin Manning
