I am interested to know if there is know procedure/document to
configure an IBM Musci Feature (IMF) card to work as the sound device
with MS-Windows 3.1.  I believe the IMF uses the same FM synth chip as
the Soun Blaster, but didn't know what driver to use or how to
configure the MIDI-mapper.
Any help, past success, suggestions?
Thanks,
Don.
