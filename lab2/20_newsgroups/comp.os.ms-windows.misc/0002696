Sorry, I did`nt tell exactly what I need.
I need a utility for automatic updating (deleting, adding, changing) of *.ini files for Windows. 
The program should run from Dos batchfile or the program run a script under Windows.
I will use the utility for updating the win.ini (and other files) on meny PC`s.  
Do I find it on any FTP host?
