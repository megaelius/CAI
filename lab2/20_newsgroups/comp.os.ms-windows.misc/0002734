Hi.  I am having some interesting problems with my Boca graphics card, which 
is based on the Cirrus Logic chipset (I am not sure exactly which one).  The
problem is as follows:
If I use any Windows driver at 800x600 except for the 64K-colour driver (ie
16 colour or 256 colour), the image on screen becomes too tall - no amount of
resizing on the monitor will make it fit.  And if I use Excel with the 64K-
colour driver, it hangs as soon as it loads.  Anyone out there used this
card/experienced anything similar.
Please reply by mail, and I will post any solutions here.
Regards
  - Simon
