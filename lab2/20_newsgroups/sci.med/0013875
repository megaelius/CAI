The picture from the press conference on the cover of the Times
that day had Prof. Altman at the lectern holding a Yale pennant
over his head ... there was a tiny Canadian flag pasted atop the
Yale crest.  He may also have had his tongue sticking out, but
I might be confused with a picture of Mark Messier holding the
1987 Canada Cup aloft.
[Heck, I'd be that happy too ... in either case! (-;]
