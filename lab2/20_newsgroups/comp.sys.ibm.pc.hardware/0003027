Please help if you can with the following strange problem:
  The Maxtor 340 drive in my 386 clone would from time to
  time, for no obvious reason spin down completely (one can
  tell by the sound) and simply refuse to be accessed. DOS
  reacts with an error (Drive D: cannot be accessed or
  something the like). Unfortunately, I cannot just reproduce
  the error. Sometimes it occurs more often, sometimes
  less. The last time it happened was when I wanted to 
  demonstrate some software to a colleague.
    I would like to know if anybody has experienced similar
  problems. I don't like to take the thing to the dealer
  only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it. I
  checked the other post in this group about Maxtor, and
  I don't seem to be the only one who has problems. However,
  no one describes the same problem, and I also have a 
  different configuration.
  Thanx in advance for any e-mailed help.
