I am selling a USR HST 14.4k baud modem with v42bis compression upgrades.
THere is no manual, as it was lost going from one side of the U.S. to the other at some point.  THe modem is setup for max throughput, and it has built in help, but a quick reference guide on the bottom of it, so its use it not difficult by any means.
Any offers?
