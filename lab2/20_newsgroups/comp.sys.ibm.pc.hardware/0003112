Hi,
I would like to hear the net.wisdom and net.opinions on IDE Controllers.
I would liek to get a IDE controller card for my VLB DX2 66 Motherboard.
What are good options for this (preferably under $200). It MUST also work
under OS/2 and be compatible with Stacker (and other Disk Compression S/W).
Please advise .....
