Hi,
I'm looking to buy a 17" monitor soon, and it seems that I can't decide what
monitor I should buy. I have a MAG 17S (this is a .25 dpi version and it using
a TRINITON tube) and a NANAO 560i in mind.
Does anyone know of any specification or problems these monitor have?
Actually, any related opinions at buying a 17" monitor will be welcomed.
 Thanks in advance,
