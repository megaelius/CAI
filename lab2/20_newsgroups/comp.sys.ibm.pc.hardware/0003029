	Just a quick THANKS to the many who explained the backing up of my
masters.  Apparently they are NOT copy-protected; I just used a program that
is unable to handle high-density (old shit).  I was surprised to hear that
"NO programs on high-density disks have copy protection," which someone
back there said.  Huh!  Learn something new every day!
