  Has anybody ever heard of Hawk EISA/VLB motherboards?  NET Computers
International (from Computer Shopper) has the 486/33 version w/256k
cache for $559.  I'm trying to decide between this motherboard and the
NICE motherboard.  Thanks!
  PS:  The Hawk motherboard has 3 EISA slots, two of which are VLB.  The
spec sounds identical to the Nice.
