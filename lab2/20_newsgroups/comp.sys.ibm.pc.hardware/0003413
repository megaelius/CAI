My computer won't recognise my disk after a reboot (Windows crash - Grrr!!)
Are there any options to restore everything, without losing data? 
The drive previously had 3 partitions, but I do not remember the exact
settings.
I have copies of the boot data from the disk (PC-tools rescue disk).  I do not
want to lose my data - 340MB IDE drive.  Do I have any options?
