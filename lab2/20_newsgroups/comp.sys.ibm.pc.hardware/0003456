I have just installed a Diamond Stealth 24 ISA card in
a '486DX2-66 system with 256K cache, and 16 megs of memory,
that gets about a 126 SI 6.0 CPU Benchmark rating.  Using
the 1024x768x16 color driver under Windows, I am getting a
Winbench Winmarks rating of only about 9.5 Million.  Since
I have heard that others get 15-to-16 million for this card,
I assume that something is very wrong with my setup.
What are some possible causes of the card slowing down like this?
I ran the Qualitas ASQ diagnostic program on memory, and I noted
the following memory timings on my machine:
ASQ v1.30 by Qualitas  SYSTEM ANALYSIS  Mon Apr 19, 1993  11:43:49AM    page: 1
    Hex     KB     KB   Access Speed Ratio (%)
  Start  Start   Size  Time us 0   25   50  75  100
Note two things on this chart:
1) The video memory appears to be many orders of magnitude slower than
system memory.  Are there wait states being inserted here, and what would
cause that?
2) The EMS Page frame seems to be ridiculously slow, even though
it is being mapped to the fast XMS memory in my system through
EMM386.  What's going on there?
Note that my Stealth 24's video BIOS at C000-C7FF is being shadowed
through the AMI BIOS.  
Any ideas on what might be happening here?
