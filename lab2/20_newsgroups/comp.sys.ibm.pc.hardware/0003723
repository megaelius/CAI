Boy am I glad that I didn't start out with one of thos PS/2 computers.
I started the upgrade operation out by spending $235 for a AMD386DXL-40
Forex upgradable mother board from Midwest Micro. When it was time to
upgrade I bought a Intel 486DX2-50 cpu for $350 and was finished.
I still don't see why they ever made the 486\50 cpu at all. Its to
fast for both ISA and LB and VESA boards.. 
Some test results taken on my mb and 486DX2-50 cpu and some others...
Gosh..I think I just installed a virus..It was called MS DOS6...
Don't copy that floppy..BURN IT...I just love Windows...CRASH...
