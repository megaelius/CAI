I posted this once but didn't receive any responses.
I've been looking for a good notebook for about $1700.  My two
favorites are the Zeos Freestyle/SL and the Micro something or
other Winbook (the one with the Apple Powerbook style trackball
and handrest and the 486SLC).
Any suggestions on others?  I'd love to hear from someone who has
one of the two mentioned above, too.
Thanks in advance,
