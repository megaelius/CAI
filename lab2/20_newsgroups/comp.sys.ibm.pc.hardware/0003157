   Oh yeah, I just read in another newsgroup that the T560i uses a
   high quality Trinitron tube than is in most monitors.(the Sony
   1604S for example) and this is where the extra cost comes from.  It
   is also where the high bandwidth comes from, and the fantastic
   image, and the large image size, etc, etc...
It's also where the two annoying lines across the screen (one a third
down, the other two thirds down) come from.
