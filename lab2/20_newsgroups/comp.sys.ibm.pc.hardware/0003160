My Western Digital also has three sets of pins on the back. I am using it with
another hard drive as well and the settings for the jumpers were written right 
on the circuit board of the WD drive......MA SL ??
I can't remember what the last one was. If you can't find these markings on the
circuit board, I'll open my machine and tell you what mine are.......
