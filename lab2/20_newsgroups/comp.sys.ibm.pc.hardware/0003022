as someone else already mentioned, don't "carry thru" the other 23 pins.
plan A, minimal null modem:
if you're transfering files betwen 2 PCs, this ought to work (unless
you have a persnickity comm program).
plan B, null modem with modem control:
some comm software will wait for DCD before transferring anything.
such software will raise DTR to enable the modem to accept a call.
with this cable, each side's DTR will drive the other's DCD.
plan C, null modem with hardware flow control:
for high-speed transfers, you want the flow control.
plan D, deluxe null modem (combine B and C):
this one is ideal.  it leaves out DSR and RI (rarely used anymore).
if you're really paranoid, or you just have an 8th wire to spend,
you might add:
the pin numbers above are (obviously) for 25-pin connectors.
i don't have a 9-pin pinout handy.
