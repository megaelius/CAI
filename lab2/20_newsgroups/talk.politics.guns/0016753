	Some wept as they heard Elie Wiesel describe a Jewish woman
	somewhere in the Carpathian mountains, who read a short
	newspaper article about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.  "She
	wondered aloud: 'Why are our Jews in Warsaw behaving like
	this?  Why are they fighting?  Couldn't they have waited
	quietly until the end of the war?'
	"Treblinka, Ponar, Belzec, Chelmno, Birkenau; she had never
	heard of these places.  One year later, together with her
	entire family she was in a cattle-car traveling to the black
	hole of history named Auschwitz."  At the end of his speech,
	the writer said, "She was my mother."

Is anyone else impressed with the short count of the bodies found in
Waco?  Have the rest been assumed bodily into heaven?
