Nice sound-bite, David, but not relevant.  At the moment
I reason that that tornado is coming right at me, I begin
to feel fear.  At the moment I realize that that car coming 
toward me is in *my* lane, I begin to feel fear. 
I was responding to a post which suggested that the FBI 
attacked the compound because they were afraid Koresh would
unlock the power of the seven seals.  If the FBI actually
believed tjhat Koresh could do that, fear is a reasonable
reaction.
Why call Koresh a prophet?  Why not?  My dictionary has at
least two definitions for the word that fit this situation.
"One who prophesies future events"  Seems like Koresh fits
                                    this one nicely, as he
                                    correctly predicted death
                                    by conflagration.
"An effective spokesman for a       Seem like he wins on this one, too.       
group, a cause, or the like"        At least, he certainly got the
                                    public's attention.
IMHO, being a "prophet" and a nut-case are not mutually
exclusive.
