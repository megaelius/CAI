Last time I checked, the bullet weighs quite a bit more than the case, and said
case is a hell of a lot weaker than the chamber of a gun, and the burning rate
of gunpowder is propotional to the pressure.
Translation:  Not bloody likely.
Ammunition exploding would either explode in bulk, removing large hunks of the
surrounding landscape, or it would go off singly and spray the area with low
velocity, lightwieght shrapnel.  If a cop can't tell the difference between
a wound inflicted by such shrapnel and a wound inflicted by a 55 grain bullet
doing better than Mach 3, he's in the wrong line of business.

P.S.--100 AR-15's for 100 people?  Gee, my dad has 3 and there are only 2
people living there.  Obviously preparing to take over the world or something.
Just can't trust them crazy conservative Presbyterians, ya know.
Soon I discovered that this rock thing was true.  Jerry Lee Lewis was the Devil.
Jesus was an architect previous to his career as a prophet.  All of a sudden,
I found myself in love with the world, so there was only one thing that I could
do was ding a ding dang my dang a long ling long.
