	Not so, Arnie.  You forget repeating arms (which include machine
guns, gatling-style guns, etc...), cannon, rifles, and let's not forget
the bullets they managed to use.  Everything from rocks to lead to
a couple iron balls with a chain between them.  If you think warfare
is brutal today, buddy you have no idea how brutal things can get.
