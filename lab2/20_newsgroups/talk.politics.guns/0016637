Chemical weapons are not concidered a *very* effectiv weapon against
millitary forces. On civillians on the other hand....
That's one GOOD reason for banning it.
You need VAST amounts of chemicals to be affective, so the best reason
to have/use it is price. (that's why it's called The Poor Mans A-bomb)
Any thoughts on Bio-weapons ??	
If this discusion is about civillians having chem-weapons;
What should they use them on?? Rob a bank ??
	This is not a .signature.
	It's merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith
	and to bring down the evil Internet.
