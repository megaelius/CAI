        Well, if we're going to discuss being a police officer in
America today.       
        The FBI lists 132 police officers killed (feloniously and
accidentally) in 1990.  That's apparently everybody at all levels.
Year        Officers killed       Rate/100,000 police officers
* Includes one officer in Mariana Islands
** Includes one officer each in Guam and Mariana Islands
*** Includes one officer in Guam and two in foreign locations
**** Includes one officer in American Samoas and two in foreign countries
***** Includes one officer in Guam and one Federal officer killed in
Peru
