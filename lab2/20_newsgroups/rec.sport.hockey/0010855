Don't know who scored, but the Isles (28-7 franchise record in
playoff OT games) took game four by a score of 4-3 for their
third consecutive OT win over the Capitals tonight at Uniondale.
If you know, please post who scored for a Isles fan living in
Atlanta:Hockey Hell.
Lord Stan's a Uniondale Man!  GO ISLES!
