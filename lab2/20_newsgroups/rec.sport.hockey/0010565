UPI Clarinet has just relayed a "scoop" from the Toronto Sun
(or was that Star?  I like the Star myself ...) that Iron Mike
Keenan has come to an agreement with the New York Rangers for
next season.  Interestingly, this comes the day after the Times
Sports had an editorial about how the Rangers need their own
Pat Riley ... who cares about what happens after next season?
