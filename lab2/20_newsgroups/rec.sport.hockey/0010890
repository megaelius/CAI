   Which doesn't mean much since the statistics are mostly based on
the 5-game playoff format. But, yes, it looks dark for the B's. What a
disappointment.
   Still, I think the problem is mental. They needed the saves Blue
came up with, perhaps he can offer something to mentally rally around.
   Who do you think gets the start in game three? I hope it is going
to be Blue. If the team can rally around him, maybe Moog can too.
