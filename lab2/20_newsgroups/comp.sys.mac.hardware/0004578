Someone asked me if I there existed an init that removes the dialog
   "you're gonna disconnect all apletalk users " or something
like that, when the powerbook falls asleep.
He said he was sure that such a thing existed, and he thought it was
freeware. Can anyone help me out with this ?
BTW : Where can I get Switch-a-roo, or something of the kind,
but schareware or freeware ?
