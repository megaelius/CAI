   I have to increase the memory in a Plus or SE (I'm not sure which since
I haven't seen it yet). I did this a few years ago but I no longer have the
instructions. I forget which resistor needs to be cut to go from 1 to 4 Mbs.
   Can anyone direct me to this information? Is there an ftp'able doc some-
where with diagrams?
                          Thanks, Dick Grant
