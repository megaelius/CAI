Does anyone have any experience using LCIII with MIDI?  Do they get along OK?
I have heard that the IIvx is not suitable for MIDI, but I have not heard anyon
e say anything definitive about LCIII and MIDI?  If you have had experience, wh
at MIDI interface have you used?  Anyone used Finale software in this setting?
 Please e-mail.  I will summarize.
Thanks,
