Please excuse and redirect me if this has already been answered, but is
there a small utility that switches the functionality of the caps-lock
key and the ctrl key on the powerbook keyboard?  I use the ctrl key far
more than caps-lock, so it would be more convenient and comfortable.
Thank you for any help,
Scott Farrar
