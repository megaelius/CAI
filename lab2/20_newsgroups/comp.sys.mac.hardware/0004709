 I know of several NuBus frame-grabber boards but wonder if there
 might be similar ones for the lesser Macs (those without slots),
 something permitting instant freezing of a video picture (PAL) 
 and feeding it in without jaggies to a simple digitizer like 
 MacVision (which takes 22 secs to scan a picture, so a frame
 grabber is a necessity). 
 The objective is 512*342 1bit/ pixel (B/W) pictures stored in
 HyperCard... have tried using top-quality VCR with freeze-frame
 function but the screens come out full of streaks and garbage.
    PLEASE reply ONLY to ----------> ianf@random.se
      and I'll summarize
      to the net (cannot
   read such high-volume
    group as is c.s.m.h)             Thanks!
