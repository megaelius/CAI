I am going to be getting a C650 soon, but I don;t want Apple 
to come out with the Cyclones and the Tempest in a month
and have the price drop on the system I want.  I have negotiated a 
good deal with a supplier for a C650 8/80 and I would like to jump on it,
but, again, I don't want the price drop to smuther me.  BTW, the deal
I have is a C650 8/80 with mouse for $2295... does anyone know of a better
deal?
thanks,
