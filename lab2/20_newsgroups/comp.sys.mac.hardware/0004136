There's this old SE here. It's got the older-style fans that remind
me of a house-ventilator. A cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotor
I usually see. Anyway, the SE makes this loud buzzing noise due
to vibration somewheres. If I remove the screws and loosen the front
from the back, it quiets down. I can only assume that the fan housing
from this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibrating
against it. 
Anyway, any suggestions for where to get replacement fans and how to
"stealth" this guy? Your experiences welcome.....
