I have used both my serial ports with a modem and a serial printer, 
so I cannot use Appletalk.  Is there a Ethernet to Localtalk hardware
that will let me use the Ethernet port on my Q700 as a Localtalk 
port.  Until they come out with
satellite dishes that sit on your window & give you internet access
from your home, I won't at all be using that port.
Saurabh.
