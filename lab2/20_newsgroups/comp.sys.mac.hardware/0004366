I have an external hard drive I wish to use as startup disk.
problem is, when I switch on the mac, it boots on the internal HD,
but when I restart  (warm boot) the mac, it boots from the external.
how do I make  it boot directly from the external ?
please email replies if possible.
thanks in advance.
jerry
