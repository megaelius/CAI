Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD-
1304 because of several manufacturing flaws.  The new model is now the
1430, which just like Apple's new Sony Trinitrom CLAIMS to be 14 inches.
I'm not sure of the details on the defects, but I work at our schools
bookstore
and can tell you that nearly half of them were returned with some kind of 
defect or another.
Just my two cents worth.
