According to what I saw in a store today, the Performa 405 is not the same
as an LCIII.  It only has a 16Mhz 68030 while the LCIII has a 25Mhz 030.
Correct me if I am wrong, because it is possible that the dealer may have
forgotten to remove the description that was next to the actual computer.
Dealers who sell the Performa are known to have about as much knowledge
about Macs as I do about DOS machines.
