I ran speedometer 3.21's tests (all of them) on my IIsi first with the 64k
cache enabled, then with the cache disabled.  I put both runs in this
uuencoded machine record...  the numbers favor the cache, mostly for
benchmarks with a lot of memory throughput...
-----cut here-------
begin 644 cache.sit
