Need an extended keyboard? Don't like how much space an official Apple
Extended Barge takes up?
I've gotten some Repetitive Syndrome Injury, and thus I bought an Apple
Split keyboard.
I don't need two keyboards, so I'm selling it....(the datadesk that is)
$85 or best offer - includes ground shipping... may or may not include the
ADB cable. Probably will.
