Hello all,
If anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and
motherboard of a Quadra 950 please let me know.  I have tried some mail
order places and some local stores.  Both groups would prefer that I part
with over $1000 to get just the case.  In my eyes this seems about $600-$700
to much.  Any comments?  I currently own the guts of a 950.
Please email me or post to this group w/ info,
Thanks in advance,
