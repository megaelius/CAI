Hey everybody:
   I want to buy a mac and I want to get a good price...who doesn't?  So,
could anyone out there who has found a really good deal on a Centris 650
send me the price.  I don't want to know where, unless it is mail order or
areound cleveland, Ohio.  Also, should I buy now or wait for the Power PC.
Thanks.
BoB
