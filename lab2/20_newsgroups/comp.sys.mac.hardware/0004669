I just put a 33MHz 040 CPU into my Centris 610.  Now I have a math coprocessor,
but is it possible to speed up the Centris to run at either 25MHz or 33MHz??
I didn't see any oscillators on the motherboard like the ones on the IIsi's
motherboard!  Where is the oscillator for the Centris?
Any ideas?
Thanks
