Some time back in this newsgroup, I seem to recall a thread about
predicting the runs a given lineup of 9 batters could be expected
to score given the appropriate statistical alphabet soup for these
hitters (OBP, SLG, AVG, bat length, hat size, day-of-the-week,
weather conditions, etc.).  :-)  Anyway, was I dreaming or is there
some such animal?
My apologies if this has been covered recently, I probably get to
read 10% of the articles posted here.  No time.  
Many thanks in advance,
scotty
