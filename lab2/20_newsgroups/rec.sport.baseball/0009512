o any of you experts want to analyze Ron Gant?
Is his early season slump because he is still swinging his bat the way
he was last year (trying to hit to all fields, etc.) or has he changed his
swing back to the "old" Gant and is just in a small early season slump.
Is his spot int he lineup even secure, especially the way he has
been hitting?
