Let's not forget that Yoni Netanyahu died while freeing civilian
hostages from PLO terrorists who had hijacked a passenger airliner to
Uganda.  Mrs. Dora Bloch apparently died in Uganda though I don't
believe that her body has ever been found.  This is the very same PLO
that both Rabin and Netanyahu refuse to negotiate with.  This should
not be surprising.
