Boy is this guy in for a shock when he hits the real world!  Our tax rate 
is incredibly high, higher than many European countries -- it is just
packaged differently (income, Social inSecurity, Medicare, payroll taxes,
property taxes, sales taxes, fees, mandatory disability insurance, state, 
federal, local, etc. etc. etc.).  Other countries just haven't found as
many ways to hide "revenue enhancers" as our clever American politicians.
I hope you enjoy the $8K you actually get to spend from your first $25K
job out of school, Rob, you patriot you.
