"Well, I'll know right away by the look in her eyes
she's lost all illusions and she's worldly wise, and I know
if I give her a listen, she's what I've been missing, what I've been missing
I'll be lost in love and havin' some fun with my cynical girl
Who's got no use for the real world, I'm looking for a Cynical Girl"
          --- Marshall Crenshaw, "Cynical Girl"
