Excuse me?  WHO destroyed the BD's?  Last I knew, they burned themselves...
Prove to me that the FBI, ATF, or the Government in general either burned
the compound themselves, or that the BD's had no choice but to commit
mass suicide rather than coming out peacefully (a promise that was made
twice by Koresh himself, which he broke both times).
