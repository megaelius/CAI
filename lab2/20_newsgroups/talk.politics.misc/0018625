  So do you want the president to specifically order each and every activity
of the FBI, or what?  And how willing are you to blame Reagan and Bush,
directly, for the incidents that took place in the War on Drugs in their
administration?  Are you going to blame Bush for the fact that Weaver's wife,
infant, son were killed?  It happened while he was president.
