Sigh.
The use of the term ZOG (which, I understand, stands for Zionist
Occupation Government, or some such bullshit) was used for satiric
purpose.  Since the posting I was responding to was on alt.conspiracy,
among other crossposted groups, I composed a satiric message
using jargon sometimes found on that group.  I figured that the
content (and context) of the message was so absurd that no one would
take any part of it completely seriously.
If anyone believes that I am an anti-semite, it will be news to my
Jewish boss and his Israeli wife, both of whom I am on cordial terms
with as well as as the many Jews that I have been friends, companions,
and co-workers with over the years.  Not to mention, news to me.
As far as guns go... I support the Bill of Rights -- all of it -- and
if you wish to arm yourself to the teeth, by all means, do so.
However, the concept of a .50 calibre machine gun as a sporting weapon
(for target practice or otherwise) struck, and continues to strike me
as moderately absurd, even if constitutionally protected.
To each their own.
