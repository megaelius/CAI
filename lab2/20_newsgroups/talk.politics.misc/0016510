You might try the Ninth Amendment since Koresh and his people
won't be exercising any of their _unenumerated_ rights from now on.
You might also try the Tenth Amendment, since the jurisdiction of
Texas law enforcement was clearly violated. 
Finally, check out the Fourteenth Amendment which merely underlines
all of the previous violations, cubed and squared.
