      Well, it seems the "National Sales Tax" has gotten its very
      own CNN news LOGO!
      Cool.  That means we'll be seeing it often.
      Man, I sure am GLAD that I quit working ( or taking this 
      seriously ) in 1990.  If I kept busting my ass, watching 
      time go by, being frustrated, I'd be pretty DAMN MAD by 
      now.
      YEAH!  Free HEALTH CARE!   Oh, yeeaaaahhhh!

      I just wish I had the e-mail address of total gumby who
      was saying that " Clinton didn't propose a NST ".
      To paraphrase Hilary Clinton - " I will not raise taxes on
      the middle class to pay for my programs "
      To paraphrase Bill Clinton - " I will not raise taxes on
      the middle class to pay for my programs "
