	But Janet Reno says it was safe and non-debilitating, non-toxic
tear gas.  She is our Attorney General and she would not tell us 
this if it were not true.

	I really cant imagine anyone having the nerve to tell the 
public that the "plan" was that the gas was going to make all
the mothers pick up their children and run out of the building.
And yet this is exactly the story they were out pitching yesterday.
