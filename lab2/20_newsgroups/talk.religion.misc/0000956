WHAT!!?!??  Are you trying to tell me, that the master of nonsenses'
most famous work is not what is published?  I'M SHOCKED!!!
What are some of the differences?  Did _Through_the_Looking_Glass_ also
get changed?  I've been using Martin Gardners Annotated Alice for
my copy of that, how close is that to the real thing?
