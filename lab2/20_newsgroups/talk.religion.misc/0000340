Get thee to a natural history museum or a library, Mr. Rawlins.  How
do you explain the nearly complete skeletons of australopithecines and
other primal hominids like _Homo erectus_?  _Homo erectus_ was
certainly not an ape, and it definitely was not a modern human either.
Consider some of its morphological features: small cranial capacity,
supraorbital ridges, receding forehead, sharp angling of the occipital
bone, receding chin, large masseter muscles for chewing, pentagonal
skull shape, diastema between incisors and canines, protruding
canines, shovel-shaped incisors.  _H. erectus_ was bipedal, though.
So are these nearly complete skeletons of _erectus_ human?  Or ape?
Or fanciful reconstructions?  Have you even seen one?
