First of all, I have no phobia of objective reality.  I'm simply
saying that the scientific model of the atom is probably not 
what is really out there.  I'm not saying that there's no object
that sources these properties we measure from atomic theory.
Take light as another example.  There are two theories: particle and
wave.  Each one fails to predict the behavior of light as some point.
So which is it: particle or wave?  You tell me.  You're the sensible
one.
