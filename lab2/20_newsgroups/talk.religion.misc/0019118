Overlooking entirely that there is nothing to prevent anyone from
taking the bus across the river to buy guns.  An utterly worthless
statistic.

As it should be.  They have a homicide rate that is a couple of orders
of magnitude lower then this country's (as does almost everyone else
in the world).  But I suppose that it's too unreasonable to suppose
that a lower availability of handguns has anything to do with that fact.

Right.  Remember those riots a while back?  Remember what they were
about?  Nope, we have nothing to fear from the US government (unlike
those Canadians living under the terribly oppressive regime up north).

Britain basically homogeneous?!?  In comparison to the US?!?
Now I _know_ you're an ignorant putz.
