So what if the FBI wasn't aware of suicide plans?  This may not even be an
]accurate statement, anyway, since the last report of listening devices used
in the compound may reveal new information.  We'll have to wait.
   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say?  Their credibility
is shot anyway, since they *origianlly* said that Koresh was going to surrender
after the Passover.  We saw how accurate that was.
   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside.  Outside 
meaning outside the compound?  Yes, the FBI reported seeing two people
(according to CNN reports) using torches to set the compound on fire.   They
were outside.
   Either way, I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves.  You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the "destruction of the people".  All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible.
