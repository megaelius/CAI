     If all choices should have federal funding so poor people can afford them,
then shouldn't firearms be federally subsidized?  After all, it is the people
in the ghettoes who are most affected by the proliferation of weapons among
criminals.  Shouldn't they have federal funding so they can protect themselves
and their families from inner city criminals?

     C'mon, Rob.  If there is one argument that is ridiculous concerning
abortion it is that pro-choice should imply federal funding for abortion. 
It's very dishonest.
