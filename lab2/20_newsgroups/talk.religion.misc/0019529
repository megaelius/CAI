Put like this, I can't answer. I was originally pointing out that your
attitude _seemed to be_ (I don't know if it really was) that chemists
tend to ignore all kinds of effects; your original posting stated that
when doing chemistry, it is common to ignore atomic interactions, and
I responded that this is exactly what chemists do.

Perhaps this revolution has yet to reach Cambridge (my, now I'll get
flamed for sure;-) ). But perhaps I am guilty of referring to 
"true chemists" (tm) which are nothing but my ideal, and do not
actually exist. Chemistry is a very easy subject to treat poorly.

No, actually organic chemists were among the first chemists to use
modern MO theories for explaining reactions that did not fit into the
old models. In synthetic organic chemistry, which still comprises
a large part of organic chemistry, it is indeed common to ignore
the rest of the molecule and pay attention only to the functional
groups, but I think this, too, has changed with the advent of
molecular modelling and asymmetric synthesis. Supramolecular 
interactions _can_ be taken into account, albeit with difficulty.
