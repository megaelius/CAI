   See, this is what really bugs me about this whole incident, and
   also about Usenet:  Here we are almost two months after the original
   raid, a raid witnessed by several members of the press, and there is 
   STILL no agreement about the basic facts.  Riggs, here, and others,
   are claiming that the BD's shot first, while others on the net claim
   that the feds did, in the form of concussion grenades.  
   I suggest that before ANY of you make any claims about who shot 
   first, you DOCUMENT your claim with actual evidence, and not just
   FOAF or "he said / she said".     Otherwise don't use words like
   "fact" above - it just makes you all look stupid.
