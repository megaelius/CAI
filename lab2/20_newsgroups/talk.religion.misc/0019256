Again, you have claimed this, but you have never explained. You never
did explain how deducing macroevolution from its observable consequenses
(effects) is different from deducing Earth's roundness, its position in
the solar system, the existence of atoms and its components etc., from
observable effects.
Please do so or shut up on this subject.
