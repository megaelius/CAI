Here are four pseudo-random character generators, based on
irreducible trinomials.  Each contains 16 separate trinomials,
one of which is selected on initialization (there are 64
distinct trinomials between the 4 PRCGs).  The PRCGs are
initialized with a 32-bit seed, and a 4-bit trinomial-
selector.
I would like to get comments on these by anyone who is
interested enough to look them over.  Please email,
because our news is on the fritz (Note that this was
posted via email).
