I read about the development of EISA-2 some time ago but dismissed it
in light of the intense interest in VESA and PCI.  However, I recently
was disheartened to hear that ISA cannot address more than 16mb of RAM,
a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon.
I recall that EISA-2 will support 64-bit transfer among other enhancements.
Is there such a standard being developed?
