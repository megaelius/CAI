Hi,
Does anyone have a source for 386DX/25 Motherboards?  I've
been calling around the local stores and everyone appears
to be only stocking the 386DX/33/40 or 386SX/25/33 motherboards.
How difficult is it to modify a 386DX/40 motherboard to run at
25 MHz?  Is it as simple as replacing the system clock with a
slower part?
Thanks!
