Hi!
I'd like to switch my floppy drives so that my 3.5" b: drive becomes a:, while
my 5.25" a: becomes b:. I'm having a few problems, though.
I know that the ribbon cable must be switched, as well as the CMOS settings, 
to reflect this change, and I think that I've done that correctly. However, the
drives do not operate correctly in this configuration. From the C:> prompt, if 
I type a:, the 5.25" drive light comes on; if I type b:, both the light for the
5.25" and 3.5" drives come on.
There are some jumpers on each drive:
5.25"  Label   Original Pos.   Pos. I changed it to
Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
