Okay, here is my configuration:
80486-33 Gateway 433C Micronics ISA
WD212MB IDE HD ( drive C: )
ST3144A 125MB IDE HD ( drive D: )
Adaptec SCSI 1542B controller, with SCSI BIOS enabled
Seagate ST296N 80MB SCSI drive
Alrighty, when I boot up I get the Adaptec BIOS message, but it says
something like:
"Drive C: installed"
"Drive D: installed"
"ADaptec SCSI BIOS not installed!"
And I can't get to the Seagate drive.
I go into PhoenixBIOS setup, remove the entry for drive D:, and BOOM, I can
access the Seagate.  Is there a way to get two IDE drives and the Seagate
at the same time?  I have ASPI4DOS.SYS, but it just hangs the system.
