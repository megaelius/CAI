I need info regarding a miniscribe 3.5" half-height drive. There is a
sticker on it with the following,
But the sticker on the biggest chip on the MFM interface has this,
What is the spec of the drive (# of cyl, heads, etc)?
How fast is this drive? Can I use it as a RLL drive? 
I also have a SCSI interface that seems to match all the connectors
for this drive. It has this description,
Can I replace the MFM interface by the SCSI interface and use the drive
as a SCSI drive? What would the drive size be? There is a set of jumpers
on the SCSI interface with "6SEL" besides it. What is the use of it?
Could someone also send me specs for Seagate ST4096 (5" full-height) drive?
My e-mail is zhang@whbws.ms.ornl.gov
Thanks
