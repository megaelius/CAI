AHHHUUURRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!   Spinrite says: 80 sectors marked bad in the FAT
initially, 79 returned to active use, 80 new sectors marked bad, following
successive runs of spinrite.
I think I need a new ESDI HDD controller.
I know that these two will work:
Adaptec 2322B
Others that MIGHT work:
Ultra Store 12
If you own one and will sell it cheaply I'll buy it.
Thanks,
