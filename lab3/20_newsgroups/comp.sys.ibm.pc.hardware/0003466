I have a 386/40 motherboard with AMI BIOS.
I haven't located the little motherboard manual yet,
and suddenly it's giving me 10 beeps when I turn the power on.
It was working fine this morning,
then gave all kinds of problems, in Windows and outside it.
After multiple reboots, now it only gives 10 beeps and sits there?
Anybody know what 10 beeps means?
Thanks.
