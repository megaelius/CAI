I got a ET4000/W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday
and ran a winmark test on it. The card is a VL-BUS card which
can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM.
It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers.
The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours.
Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.
Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using
Hint chipsets.
Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab.
Using ET4000/W32 drivers
640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.
Using ET4000 drivers.
800x600  16colours 4.01     
From the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the
hardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are
just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card.
The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer.
It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it
which supports 256 colors on all resolution.
From these results, it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card
in 256 colours mode.
