Would someone be willing to explain to me the 486DX 50MHz is not more
popular than it is?  I would think it would be just as fast, if not 
faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications.  Plus, a 50MHz 
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
chip in the future.  I must be missing something, since everyone is 
buying the DX2 66...  Many adds don't even mention the DX 50.
 Thanks a lot,
