A weird thing has happened to my computer lately,
it gets locked (stops doing anything) at any instance
without any reason whatsover. I might be using 
Edit and gets locked, or i might be at the prompt
at the same occurs. It happens almost once every 3 times
i connect the computer, Does Anyone have the slight idea
what's wrong with it?
(If i try to use CTRL-ALT-DEL after that, no response. I have
to turn it off and back on again)
Thanks. Any help will be really appreciated.
E-mail if possible as sometimes i can't access this service.
