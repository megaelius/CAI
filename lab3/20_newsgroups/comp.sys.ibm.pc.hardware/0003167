  My brother is in the market for a high-performance video card that supports
VESA local bus with 1-2MB RAM.  Does anyone have suggestions/ideas on:
  - Diamond Stealth Pro Local Bus
  - Orchid Farenheit 1280
  - ATI Graphics Ultra Pro
  - Any other high-performance VLB card
Please post or email.  Thank you!
