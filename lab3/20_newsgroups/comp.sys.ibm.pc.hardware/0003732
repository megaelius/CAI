I just bought a new AMIECU EISA motherboard and an Adaptec 1742A fast-SCSI 
controller. I wanted to install the AHA-1742A and did as written in the
AMIECU manual. But the CFG-utility told me to get a newer version of the Adaptec 
configuration overlay file named 'adp0000.ovr', because the old one is not 
compatible to my motherboard.
The adaptec driver utility is version 3.0.
