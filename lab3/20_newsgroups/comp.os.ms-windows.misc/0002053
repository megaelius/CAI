Here is another hint:
	I have a really jumping mouse (ps2 type), and finally the mouse
stops jump changing HIMEM.SYS (yes, himem!), is you use:
x can be 1,2,...,8 (Of course my computer DON'T appear on the list for
these parameter)
 And maybe, your mouse can stop jump... (But your problem looks more
like a dirty mouse ;)...
	Hope it help (to anybody!)
