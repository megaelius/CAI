	In response to a "different" kinda wallpaper, here's what I
use.  I think the original gif/whatever was called "not_real".  The 
artist name and logo is in the lower right corner.  You will need VGA
I think, and I have this sized for 800x600 256 color screens.  Use
this in your Windows directory and do not tile it.  Hope you enjoy.
begin 666 ntreal.bmp
