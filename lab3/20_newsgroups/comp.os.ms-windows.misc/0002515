I had enough problems with my ISA bus Ultra Plus that I finally returned it,
but many of the people I spoke to through the net were happy with the EISA
version of the Ultra Pro.  I kind of suspect the MACH32 chip was designed
with a 32-bit external bus in mind and the ISA version is kind of a hack, but
that's just a guess.
