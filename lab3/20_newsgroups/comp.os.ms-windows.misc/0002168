Wow, what did you use it for?  Single-tasked word processing?
I have 8 files loaded right now and a 29-MB virtual machine (12MB of
RAM). My friend down the street gripes that he can't even format a
floppy in the background.  Many unix people love OS/2 because they are
used to multi-tasking systems.

Too bad they hold a gun to the mouse piper while they
throw mice at their "new" trap, trying to get it to work. :)
