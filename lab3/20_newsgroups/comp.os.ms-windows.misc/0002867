Hi, 
I have a simple question. Is it possible to create a OVERLAPPED THICKFRAME
window without a title bar; ie
I don't seem to be able to get rid off the title bar.
I have another question:
I have a overlapped window(say V) which has few child windows (a,b,c, etc)
The window shows up with all it's children fine. Now, I create another 
child(t) with a WS_THICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of
it's siblings. Style WS_THICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it. How do
I make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's siblings.
I used SetWindowPos() and BringWindowToTop() without success. What's happening
is that while I am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as I let go, it goes
behild it's siblings.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
