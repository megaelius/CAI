Has anyone else been playing with that wincmd utility from PC Magazine?
If so, I am having trouble concatenating string variables together and
need your help.  For example:
temp = "path"
temp2 = "file.ext"
fullpath = temp+"/"
say fullpath			// output = 'th/'
fullpath = fullpath+temp2
say fullpath			// output = 'h/file.ext'
So, it seems to be dropping the first few characters with each
concatenations.  Is it that I am out of memory -- I only have maybe 20
variables total -- the article didn't mention memory limits. 
email me if you have an idea or would like to see the actual source and
output.  Thanks for your help.
