I am getting Garbled output when serial printing thru Windows & works
etc.  This has occurred on several systems and goes if a LaserJet 4 is
used.  I suspect that there is no need for handshaking in this case due
to the capacity (memory/speed) of it.  There is no problem printing from
DOS.  Are there any obvious tweaks I'm missing.  I'm sure its not JUST
me with this problem.  Thanks for reading....  John Atherton
