Hi, folks,
I have a question:
        How can I generate a PCX file using Word for Windows (2.0) ?
I know I can select a Postscript printer driver to get a PS file, but how
can I generate a PCX file ? Is there a printer capture utility for windows
that ever exists ? Or a utility to transfer PS format to PCX format, or
TIFF format?
Please reply by E-MAIL, I will give a summary. Thanks.
