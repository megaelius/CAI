The latest driver release is 59 and can be found at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
in the pub/pc/win3/... directory structure as pro59.zip.  I checked with ATI's
BBS last nite and there were no releases past 59.
We have the ATI Local Bus card and I noticed that I get garbage around the
edges of a window when I move it.  Has anybody else noticed this also?
