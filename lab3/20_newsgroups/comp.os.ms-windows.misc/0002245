On a recently acquired Gateway 2000 machine, when starting Windows,
three copyright statements flash on the screen right after the MS logo
disappears and before ProgramManager takes over.  This does not happen
on any other of our machines, and I am wondering whether this is a
feature or whether this is related to several problems we are having
with the machine.
The system is a Gateway 2000, 4DX-33 machine.

The AUTOEXEC.BAT file looks like this:

The CONFIG.SYS file looks like this:
DOS=HIGH,umb
Does anyone know what is going on?  Any help would be much
appreciated.
