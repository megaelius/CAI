Hi All
Hope you all had a Blessed Easter. I have a document which I believe
refutes the notion that the SSPX (Society of Saint Pius X) is in
schism, or that there has been any legitimate excommunication. If
anyone is interested in reading the truth about this matter please
email me and I'll send them the document via email. Its 26 pages long,
so I wont be posting it on the news group.
Its titled
    This article  was  originally  an  English	translation,  by  the
    Society  of  Saint	Pius  X  in  Ireland, from the French Journal
    'Courrier de Rome'.  The French  article,  in  its	turn,  was  a
    translation  from  the  Italian of the Roman Newsletter 'Si Si No
    No'.
    This booklet contains the transcription, with some minor editing,
    of	the  Irish  article, and was transcribed and produced by John
    Clay, Townsville, Queensland, Australia.

God Bless ye all,
An Irish Fairwell
may the road rise to meet you
may the wind be always at your back
may the sun shine warm upon your face, 
the rains fall soft upon your fields,
and until we meet again,
may God hold you in the palm of his hand.
