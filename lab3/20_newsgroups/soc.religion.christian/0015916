Hello everyone. I just wanted to let everyone know that I have just
been selected as part of the Reduction In Force here at Amdahl. For all
that are currently in a dialog with me, or are waiting letters from me,
I have saved your letters on floppy and will continue when I get back
on the net from another account in the future.
For those who are on the GEnie network, my email address there is:
God Bless and Goodbye until then. If you want to continue dialogs with
me via US MAIL, I can be contacted at:
            Tony Rose
            c/o JUDE 3 MISSIONS
            P.O. Box 1035
            Felton, CA 95018
