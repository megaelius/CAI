There is a contradiction related to the moral issue of polygamy in the
Mormon writings.  In the book in the book of Mormon called the book of 
Jacob, Joseph Smith wrote that it was an abomination to God for 
David and Solomon to have many wives.  Later, when Joseph Smith wrote
the Doctrines and Covenants (possibly when polygamy was becoming an
issue in his personal life) he wrote that it was not an abomination for
David to have many wives.  How do Mormons answer this contradiction?
