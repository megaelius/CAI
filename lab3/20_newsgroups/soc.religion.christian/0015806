Does anyone belong to or know any facts about the
              Christian Reformed Church?
[It's one of two major heirs to the Dutch Reformed tradition in the
U.S. The other is the Reformed Church in America.  The CRC is
more or less a spinoff from the RCA.  It was unclear to me from
my reference exactly the differences between them are.  --clh]
