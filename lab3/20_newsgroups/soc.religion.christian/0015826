It's my understanding that Romans 9:13 "As it is written, Jacob have I
loved, but Esau have I hated." refers not to the two individuals, but
rather to their offspring, the tribe of Jacob and the tribe of Esau
See Obadiah, for example.  In fact, if you scan through the OT, you
will find similar references to the two tribes.
