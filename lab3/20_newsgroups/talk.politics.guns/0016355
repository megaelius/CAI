We will see what will happen to the "survivors".  Don't forget however
that the members of the cult are responsible for the deaths of 4 ATF
agents.  Do you really expect Koresh (dead or alive) to take sole 
responsibility for this?  I can just see it now, survivior at trial 
"I was just following orders".  Where have we heard that before???
Two wrongs don't make a right,
 but three rights make a left.
