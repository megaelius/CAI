I just heard on CNN that the Texas Rangers found an M60 machine gun
in the BD compound Rubble.  The newscaster called this a new hi-tech
military weapon!  HA HA!!  I would bet that it is that Rock Armory
M60 semi-auto, or that it was leagally owned and the tax was paid.
What year was the M60 patented?
Just showing you how the media is twisting the facts,
