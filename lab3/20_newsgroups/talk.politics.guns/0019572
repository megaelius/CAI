For you, or the government, or anyone else to say what is dangerous or
harmful to the followers is direct interference in religion; it has been
used quite improperly even when nothing as drastic as Waco has happened.
No evidence has been presented that the Davidians have engaged in any 
activities harmful to others before the actions of the BATF.  On this
morning's news, there was an item about the BATF warrant being unsealed.
That they bought $200,000 worth of LEGAL weapons has not been denied by
anyone.  When they were accused of harming others in the past, the local
sherriff had no problems in serving a warrant; our rights as free people
were violated by the BATF going in shooting.  
This country was founded on the superiority of the rights of the individual.
Remember Pastor Niemoller's remarks.
