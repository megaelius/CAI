Has anyone noticed or commented on the fact that so many of those who
were willing, nay demanding, that we wait forever for Mr Hussein and
Iraq, that we use tremendously costly "sanctions", to avoid a loss
of life, are now at the fore front of those clammoring that we should
have smashed those "religious radicals" and we were wasting money allowing
this stand off to go on  ?  How the worm turns when the sect changes.
