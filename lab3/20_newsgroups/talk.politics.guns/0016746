Perhaps I wasn't sufficiently clear.  I was NOT accusing YOU of being
a quisling.  The quislings are in our own U.S. government, throwing
away the people's right to keep and bear arms -- at least, that's
where the ones that I INTENDED to refer to are.  I figured that people
on this newsgroup would interpret that as intended, but obviously
something of my intent got lost.
