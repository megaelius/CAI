Dunno if you'll find it in the Constitution, but that other document of American
liberty, that kids are taught to hallow in school, is the Declaration of
Independence.  That document is in fact a justification not just for the right
if revolution, but of the DUTY of revolution by the people, once the government
gets too oppressive.  It is a very radical document, and I recommend all
Americans... especially those in office... read it once a year.
