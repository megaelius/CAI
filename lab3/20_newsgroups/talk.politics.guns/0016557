]    Now what in the world does this have to do with anything?
Because the hispanic communities in Phoenix are high crime areas.
Likewise, in LA, CERTAIN hispanic communities (with immigrants from certain 
countries) had high participation in the looting after the riot. Others,
which comprise hispanics with several generations of residency in the US,
were peaceful.
