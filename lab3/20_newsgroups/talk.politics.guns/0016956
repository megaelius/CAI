A friend recorded CNN news during the gassing and incineration of
the BD's.  I went through it carefully today, and found something
very interesting.  A tank is pulling out of the house, and there
is a fireball, maybe 24" across that lasts for about 1 second.
Exactly ten minutes and thirty nine seconds later, the smoke starts
billowing out of that area of the building.
Now, I'm no govt. spokestwinkie, so it might really have been a
weather balloon or something.  Perhaps someone would check it out
and comment.
