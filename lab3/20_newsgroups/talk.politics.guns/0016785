The best reason to abolishing the ATF is that they don't have enough
to do.  If the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned to
the FBI (firearms) and IRS (tobacco and alcohol).  Both of these
organizations have enough to do.  The FBI is probably not going to try
to get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a broken
gun.
There have been postings stating that law enforcement should be
divided and and weak.  But there is nothing more dangerous to
liberties than a law enforcement agency without enough criminals to
chase.  The ATF is one and look at the trouble it started in
Waco.
