Y'know, the perp who commits a drive-by near the homes of some of my friends
ain't gonna be in any condition to do so again...  and most of the places with
large numbers of drive-bys are places where guns are strictly controlled, or
the residents can't afford them..
Just because you once had freedom of speech, we've decided information is too
easy to transmit, so for the public good we will start armed raids on anyone
who says something that violates what we believe is proper to say.
You attack one Constitutional right as being outdated, and I can probably come
up with a like justification to attack the others.  Retaining any of your rights
requires retaining all of your rights.
