Anyone happen to know what the max resolution for quicktime is?  I'm 
trying to determine if a maxed out system using quicktime could produce
and edit broadcast quality video (including bringing the video in via
video spigot/etc.).  So far I have yet to see anything that's even close
to S-VHS in quicktime, but it'd be great to hear that it's possible.
Thanks for the help,
Alex Bratton
