A friend of mine recently acquired an 8!24 GC card for his IIsi
and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white.
I know there have been numerous reports about the worth of
the GC, but I was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little
more on the subject.  Any replies encouraged.  Thanks in ad-
vance.
