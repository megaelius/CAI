I have a Mac Plus with 4 megs of memory and a 20 megabyte hard drive for
sale.  The computer has a new power supply and has recently been overhauled.
I also have an Imagewriter 1 printer available, though I do not have a cable
for it.  The hard drive has loaded on it goodies for word processing and
other home and student uses.  This system has been babied.  Price is
negotiable.
