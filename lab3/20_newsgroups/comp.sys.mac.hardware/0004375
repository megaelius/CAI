I believe it goes or will go:
powerPC
Pentium
In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was
 slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel. But, this is using a system designed
 for the 030. So, It stands to reason that a system designed for an 040 ie
 quadra) would do better. So overall I'd figure 040 = 030 * 2.5 or so.
    Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system
 at the level of a fast quadra, but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the
 speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems. and wait for the 680060. I think
 it laps the pentium.
