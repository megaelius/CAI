Well, I saw a few posts on this and asumed that everyone is talking about 
the new 14" display... mine does it to... kinda like when I would degauss 
my old 13", and since the new one lacks this button, I assume that is 
what it is doing... anyone that knows I'd appreciate the info, but it 
doesn't worry me...
