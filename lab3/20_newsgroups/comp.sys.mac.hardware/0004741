On 4/20/93, Tim Keanini was heard to say regarding "Mac SCSI spec?:" 
  TK> From: blast@nntp.crl.com (Tim
  TK> Keanini)
  TK> I have a MacIIFX and I know that it is wired about its SCSI chain.
  TK> I just bought a drive and I need to find out a few hardcore SCSI
  TK> question:
  TK> Does the IIFX SCSI chain want to see active or passive termination?
  TK> Does the IIFX SCSI spec want me to enable the initiation of the SDTR
  TK> message?
  TK> WHat does the IIFX SCSI spec want as far as parity checking?
  TK> These are some very good questions for the FAQ. If someone does not
  TK> have time to answer these questions but does know where I can look
  TK> them up please let me know and I will repost the answers for everyone
  TK> to see.
      Read TechNote #273...it deals with more than any sane person wants to
know about the IIfx's SCSI....
  TK> thanks, Tim Keanini        <timk@broder.com>  or  <blast@crl.com>
