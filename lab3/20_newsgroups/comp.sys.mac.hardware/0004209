Hi,
I'm in the market for an internal color video adaptor for my PB 145.  I
was wondering if anyone has used the PowerVision adaptor made by
Mirror.  If so, can you tell me how feel about the speed and
compatability of it?  I might also be interested in other boards by
Envisio etc., so if you have such a board please e-mail your opinion of
it.  Thanks in advance.
John
