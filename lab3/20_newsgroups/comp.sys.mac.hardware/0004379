I also suffer from these video "artefacts". My configuration is a
Centris 610, 4/160, 1MB VRAM with a NEC 4FG. It only happens at
832x624, in 8bit colour with virtual memory off during scrolling. This
occurs when the VRAM SIMMS are installed as well as removed.
It seems that the 610 does not like 832x624.
Does anyone *not* have these problems in the above mentioned
conditions?
