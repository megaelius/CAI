In my quest for speed, I've run into a problem. 66.66 mhz and 80 mhz
clock oscillators are available but I haven't found any speeds between
66.66 and 70 mhz for further testing. Fox Electronics (813) 693-0099 can make custom oscillators but if anyone knows a source cheaper than $12/osc please
let me know. Some 68 and 70 mhz units would complete my speed trials on the
old Q700
