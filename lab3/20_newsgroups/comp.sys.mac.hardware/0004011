easily installed in existing pc clone devices, you mean
and thats not even really true, cause neither the controller
nor the computers bios will know anything about them
and it probably wouldnt be in sony's (or whoever) best interest
to restrict themselves to customers using pc clones and apple ][s
(and whatever other obsolete boxes might use the familiar old
floppy interface)
