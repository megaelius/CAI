This question is, to me, like asking "Why use SCSI at all?"
- Due to the rather primitive standard DMA solution (which is used by almost all
  floppy interfaces) of PCs, the speed is limited to approx 500 Kbytes/s. 
  I want a standard allowing higher performance.
- With SCSI, the OS can issue a request to the disk and then go ahead with other
  things. Later, when the controller has performed the search and physical read,
  data can be transferred to main memory at "RAM speeds". Not very relevant with
  MS-DOS, but MS-DOS is not made for the future.
- I've *got* a SCSI interface. I've got a 5.25" and a 3.5" floppy, too, and I am
  not going to throw them out. With SCSI I may add, for all practical purposes,
  an "unlimited" number of disk units without sacrificing any of my old disks. 
- For my PC, I've got a 300 Mbyte SCSI disk adopted from a SUN machine, and I
  can carry it over to a Mac, a Sparcstation, an Alpha machine... whatever I like
  to, if I decide to turn my back to the PC. (I *do* know that I cannot expect
  to move the data without reformatting!)
There are probably numerous other reasons for SCSI as well.

No, not replace, but supplement. And contrary to a floppy, a MD may be fast enough
to run programs (or access data) directly off the MD. So we'll have much higher
expectations/demands, which is much better supported by SCSI than the old floppy
interface. And the price of SCSI controllers is not that high any more - isn't it
something like a dozen large pizzas, nowadays? :-)
ka.
