Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to
this newsgroup.  The "test" was the following command:
>Plot3D[((-2*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-5000)^2+(y-8000)^2+
>{x,-5500,19500},{y,-5500,19500},PlotPoints->50]
I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on
various Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and
workstations.  The results are posted below:

Funny how the IIsi running at 25 MHz is slower than other equivalent
machines, lots slower in fact.  Perhaps the version of Mathematica
makes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was allocated.
Another interesting thing is how fast the SGI did it.  Wow. 
Basically, though, I wouldn't draw any conclusions from this data.  It
seems that Mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of variables.  I
was just curious how different machines would measure up.  
Well, if you have any questions or if I forgot something, just drop me
a line at "cmmiller@iastate.edu".

PS  If the spacing of the above table doesn't come out right on your
machine, tell me and I'll mail you a copy of this in a binhexed Word
5.1 document.
