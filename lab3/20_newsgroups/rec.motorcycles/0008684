In response to Jerry Lotto's post about not putting your helmet on your
mirror or else risk damaging the padding from the inside.
One of the major causes of mirror breakage is impact with the pavement.
Laws mandating that all mirrors be protected by helmets might be in order.
But seriously...
One place to put a helmet is on a, preferably clean, footpeg, hanging from
the chin-guard, away from any hot pipes.
