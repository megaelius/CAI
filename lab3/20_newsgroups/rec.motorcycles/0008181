Insurance companies sure seem to go for No-Fault coverage.  Since the
majority of accidents are the cagers' fault, doesn't this imply that we
would have to pay much higher rates under a No-Fault system?
With a cars-only system, it seems to make sense on the surface: take the
legal costs out of the system.  But it looks like motorcyclists would
get screwed.
