Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not. If
you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors
that screw into your handlebars, your helmet should fit over your mirror
and be fairly stable. I doubt I have to mention it, but this trick isn't
quite so smart on a GoldWing, CBR600, any GSXR, or any bike with
fairing-mounted mirrors.
I was a little surprised, though, to find that you had your helmet on
your seat while you were centerstanding your bike. I usually leave my
helmet on until my bike is parked, if for no other reason than I
wouldn't want my helmet to be on any surface that I was about to start
tilting and jerking . . .

I saw the quote below on a pair of Nankai race-replica leathers. I think
this sort of phrase is typically known as "Japlish."
