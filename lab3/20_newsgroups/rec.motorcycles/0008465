In regards ot some of the posts concerning bias in articles of k bikes
versis /2's or boxers of a later date or whatever.. Jeezzz, Lighten up!
I wrote the slash two blues for a bit of humor which seems to be lacking
in the MOA Owners News, when most of the stuff is "I rode the the first
day, I saw that, I rode there the second day, I saw this" 
any body out there know were the sense if humor went in people?
I though I still had mine, but I dunno...
