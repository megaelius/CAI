I have two Motif Widgets. I would like to control one of them via the
keyboard and the other with the mouse. I set the keyboard focus on the first
widget, but as soon as I click the mouse on the second one, I lose the
keyboard focus on the first one. 
Could some kind soul show me how to do this?
Thanks
