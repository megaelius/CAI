While I cannot answer questions about running XDM over a DECnet, I can
say that the following defines must be added to the site.def before
building R5 before any X clients will work over a DECnet.
From site.def
#define ConnectionFlags -DTCPCONN -DUNIXCONN -DDNETCONN
#define ExtraLibraries -ldnet
Hoping this helps,
George
