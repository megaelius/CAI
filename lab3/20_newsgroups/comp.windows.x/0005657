I've found that I have to add the "-8" option for displaying JPEGs
with the new version.  For some reason, if I don't, it goes into
24-bit mode and the resulting image is displayed with 216 colors 
(from a 6x6x6 array) instead of 256 and looks grainier.  Since I'm
on the ubiquitous 8-bit pseudo color display I would have thought it
could tell that.
