I recently found the file xgolf on a German ftp site
(reseq.regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de) but unfortunately the shar file
was incomplete and the author's email address given in the readme file
(markh@saturn.ee.du.edu) does not work.
Can anyone assist by giving the location of a full version of this (or
any other golf game for X) game, or a way of contacting the author?
Please reply by email if you can help
