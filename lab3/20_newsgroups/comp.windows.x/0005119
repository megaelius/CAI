I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text.
I want it to be of fixed width, but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls
automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point
visible.
In trying to do this I have two problems:
 - The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget
   taller, but instead it seems to cover part of the text.
 - The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text
   in order to keep the insertion point visible.
Any help is appreciated.
