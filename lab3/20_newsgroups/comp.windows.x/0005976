Hi out there!
Every command-line-shell-favourating user: Close your ears, ehm, eyes...
I'm looking for a X file-manager which can be driven under TWM.
Somebody told me last night, there is one under OpenWindows
(and there certainly is one under MS-Windows :-#).
But I'd like an X-one, you know, with icon's, click-and-drag, directory-structures
shown in a graphic-layout, a paper-basket etc. ...
Anybody got an idea?
Please reply.
