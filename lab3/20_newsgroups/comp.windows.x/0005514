Hi Xperts,
this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-(
I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)...
I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric
field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
contains the following bit:
	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,
	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes
which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.
Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space
in a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...
Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,
and clear this problem? 
Any help is very much appreciated.
