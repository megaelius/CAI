	Hi. I'm trying to figure out how to make a window manager
place the window where the create window command tells it,
regardless of what it may think is right. (my application has
reason to know better)
	I don't want to set the override-redirect because I do
want all the embellishments that the window manager gives, I just
want the wm to accept my choice of location.
	I've tried twm, tvtwm and mwm and they are all
uncooperative.
	Thanks,
	-- Ethan
