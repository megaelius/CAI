	I want to be able to send a Pixmap from one client to the next.
Along with this I want to send the Colormap and foreground and
background pixel values.  So far not a problem, I can do
this with no problem.
  However, once I have the Pixmap id and the Colormap id, how
do I go about telling the server that the second (receiving)
client now wants to have associations with the two id's?
