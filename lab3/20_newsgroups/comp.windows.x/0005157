Version 1.3 of Xew widgets is available at
	export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/Xew-1.3.tar.Z
	export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/Xew-1.3.README
For better details, check the README. (For extensive details, you have
to with Xew-1.1.ps.Z, still haven't had time to update this one).
No new functionality has been added since 1.2 version. Raster widget
handles now expose events slightly more intelligently than before
(really had to do this when I added a simple program that uses X11R5
Athena Porthole and Panner widgets). The program demo/viewer.c is
very simple demonstration of panner/porthole usage (copied
from'editres' actually :-)
