Hi there,
  Do someone of you have a program for sending a key event
to another window but it MUST appear in that window....
I have used xsendevent.tar package but it does not do that !!!
For example, if I get a program executing:
#!/bin/sh
read something
echo $something
and if I send the key event "<KeyPress>a,<KeyRelease>a"
to that window then I will get:
something=a
Thanks in advance.
