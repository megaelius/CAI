One way to "mask" the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the
XAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the
show_mouse_position function. 
If the XEvent arrive in this function as 
XEvent p_event;
then, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So, 
you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case
it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. 
By the way, you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with 
these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish
between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In 
essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. 
Unfortunately, the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the 
value of the pressed button.
Any ideas,
