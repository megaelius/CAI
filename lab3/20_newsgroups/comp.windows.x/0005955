I`m looking for some assistance in locating information on how to run
win 3.1 on a CGA monitor. The setup suggests you look at the manual, but
the guy I`m helping is part of a large office and computer assistance
must be booked in advance, therefore he cant get windows onto his CGA
system. 
Thanx in anticipation
