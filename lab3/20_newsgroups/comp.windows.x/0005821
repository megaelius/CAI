   Here's a listing that I came accross a while ago.  This question seems to 
come up often enough that I figured this would be of interest.  Note that 
the server "X Appeal" for DOS is available in demo form on the internet via 
anonymous ftp.  This is one way of quickly checking out the feasability of 
using your system as an X server.  Enjoy!

This is a monthly guide of X servers that can be used on non-UNIX
networked machines to display X clients running on UNIX machines.  I
use the name UNIX loosely here.  I know others can run X.
The sources for this information come from many places:  the FAQ for
comp.windows.x, blurbs and info packets from the vendors, user manuals
for the products themselves, conversations with sales representatives,
personal experience, comp.windows.x articles, etc.
Please forward any corrections or updates to the above address.
