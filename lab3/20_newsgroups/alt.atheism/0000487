Just a side note on this German translation (or whatever) of Josephus.
My historian friend says that the latest craze about Josephus is
the Japanese translation!  He says the thing is selling like hot cakes
over in Japan.  As good and powerful as Josephus reads in English, I
suspect it reads even better in Japanese!
