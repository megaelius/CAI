Well, that's the end-point problem again.   Being able to 
distinguish some egregious terrorist from some saintly man 
of peace does not mean that you have a method for telling
who's a terrorist in general.
Of course we *try* to tell them apart, but for my money
it's better to try with the full awareness that we all
bring bias to the judgement than to imagine that we are
using some objective test.
