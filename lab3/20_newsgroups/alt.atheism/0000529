Suppose X-ist saucers land.  The aliens destroy all paper currency and tattoo
"666" on people's foreheads and start sacrificing small children.  Then a
bunch of other aliens come along and offer to get rid of the X-ists in return
for one dollar.  The people happen to have a single dollar bill hidden during
the purge.
Get the point?  None of these events are *inherently* impossible.  So it is
not the case that the value of a dollar bill is fixed by reality.
For a more mundane example of how the value of a dollar bill is not constant,
consider the following game thought up by the RAND corporation:
You are with a bunch of friends.  You have a $10 bill.  You offer to sell the
$10 bill to the highest bidder -- subject to the restriction that you also
get to take the money bid by the second-highest bidder.
Try it.  You'll find that sometimes people will end up bidding more than $10
for your $10 bill.
