Simple.  Take out some physics books, and start looking for statements which
say that there is no objective physics.  I doubt you will find any.  You might
find statements that there is no objective length, or no objective location,
but no objective _physics_?  (Consider, for instance, that speed-of-light-in-
vacuum is invariant.  This sounds an awful lot like an objective
speed-of-light-in-vacuum.)
