How many runs will be scored in Denver?
I don't know.
but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in 
Mile High Stadium during the last few years of the Bears/Zephyrs 
tenure in the American Association.
Here's the total runs scored per game in Zephyrs games, 
all league games and the ratio. I found the same ratios for HR.
Year  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio   
It seems pretty clear that Denver will have a large effect 
on runs scored (I'll stick with my prediction from last year 
that it'll be one of the top 3 in the NL this year) 
and a fairly large effect on Homeruns - though apparently not as large as 
Atlanta, Wrigley, Cincinnati and San Diego.
Still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park.
