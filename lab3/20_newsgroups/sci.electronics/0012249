Has anybody out there used/tested these new Fluke Scopemeters?
How do they compare to a low-end Tectronix oscilloscope? Are
there any big drawbacks about these handheld scopes when
compared to the benchtop scopes of the same price range
Any info on the Fluke Scopemeters would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
