The object of a cooling tower is to distribute dissolved salts in 
cooling water over large areas of farmland and to therefore decrease
farm subsidies for non-producers by rendering their land infertile.
A side effect of this deficit-reduction program is that they provide
a low-T reservoir for a variety of industrial processes.
Now you know.
