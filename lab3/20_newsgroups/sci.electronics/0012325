I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option
known as "differential ready".  Apparently land-based
beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS 
receiver (with differential option installed).
How does this system work?  What frequency is used for
the land-based beacons?
Thanks in advance,
