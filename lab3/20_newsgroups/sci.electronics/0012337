Hi,
Right now I should do some characterization of opamps. Because I don't  
have
special equipment for this task, I have to do this job with relativly  
simple
equipments (Frequency sweeper, DSO, etc.). 
Does anyone know good test circuitry for characterization of opamps? 
Especially for measuring open-loop gain, phase margin, PSSR, CMMR and so  
on.
Are there any books or application notes on this subject available?
Please reply vi e-mail or nn.
Thanks
Mark
