I NEED to sell this pronto to get a car (my engine locked up)!
Machine runs great... only used in my house.  Has been covered when
not in use on the days I wasn't around.
$2,300 INCLUDING Federal Express Second Day Air, OR best offer, COD to
your doorstep (within continental US)!!  I need to sell this NOW, so
if you don't agree with the price, make an offer, but within reason.
Thanks,
(please no letters asking me to donate for a tax break)
