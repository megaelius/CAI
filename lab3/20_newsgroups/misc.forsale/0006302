	I have 5 full reels of Ampex 456 2" recording tape.  This tape was
used once at 15 ips and carefully stored.  All reel include an Ampex tape
band.  The tape has not been bulk erased to my knowledge.  The history of
the tape in know and available upon request.  JMAR in Toronto sells new
2" 456 for $260+tax (Canadian)  I would like $100CDN/reel which will include
postage.
