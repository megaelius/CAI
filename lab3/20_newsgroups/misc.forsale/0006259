	This mower is in perfect condition and
	contains the following features:
	- Electric Start
	- 26 inch cut
	- Double Rear Baggers
	- New Battery
	- New Engine (one year old)
	- Inflatable Tires (gives nice ride)
	- Cushioned Seat (gives nice ride)
	I am moving into a house that has a
	small area of grass to cut and does not
	require such large mower. The engine was
	replaced, not rebuilt, last year due to
	some faulty work done by a lawn mower
	repair shop.
