Almost sold, but the potential buyer has an opportunity to buy a DSO from a
co-worker...so the following is still available:
Used, good condition:
Hitachi V-422 40MHz Dual-Channel Portable Analog Oscilliscope
	o 1mV/div
	o DC offset
	o alternate magnification (10x magnified & non-magnified waveform)
	o VERT mode trigger
	o TV sync separation circuit
List price	$910.00 (...and the price Fry's electronics just quoted!) :-(
Sells for	$699.99 (JDR MicroDevices current price)
		$745.95 (Products International)
Your price used $425.00 obo
But wait - now  $350.00 obo
Buy it, take it home, pretend you can fix simple household appliances...or just
watch the alternating current running through your house!
I'm open to trades of radio, video or computer equipment...but I don't want to
trade for another scope! :-)
I'd prefer a local buyer, because (a) a local buyer can check it out and (b) a
local buyer can take it with him/her.
