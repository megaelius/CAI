Okay, okay, Norman himself isn't actually for sale.  BUT:
I have two Saturday Even Post's, both of which have Norman Rockwell
illustrations on the front cover.
October 29, 1960  --  with candidate Kennedy on campaign
   -- has, obviously, a Norman Rockwell of Kennedy on the cover
November 5, 1960  --  with candidate Nixon on campaign
   -- And here we have Nixon.  He's not a crook...
These are both in very good condition.
Let me know if you're interested, and to what tune.  ($$)
