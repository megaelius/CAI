I am upgrading my computer systems to FAX modems, and am selling my
2 2400/1200/300 baud USR modems without FAX or error correction.
One is internal ($25), the other is external ($30). 
Both are U.S. Robotics (the highest rated modem manufacturer).
Add $4 shipping or pick up in the Washington DC area.
Offers welcome.  (I would trade either for a 1x3x70ns SIMM.)
