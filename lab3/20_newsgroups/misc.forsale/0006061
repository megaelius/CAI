I would like to sell my Logitech Hand-held 256 Gray Scale Scanner. I
originally bought it as a toy and have no practical use for it. Hardly
ever used it.
Package includes:
-board
-Scan-Mate software
-Ansel Image Editing software
-All original manuals, box, etc.
Originally bought for $350 in Jan '92.
Selling for $150.
If interested, let me know.
