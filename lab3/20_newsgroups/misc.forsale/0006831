** Talaris Lazer printer, 16pg/min **
I have a lazer printer from Talaris that suppose to printer 16 pg / min.
I have never set it up to use because I did not expect it to be any bigger than
a lazerJet IIp, but I', wrong.  It was purshase used when a company 
liquidated it.
I will sale it for $350 + shipping.
