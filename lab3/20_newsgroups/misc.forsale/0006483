OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:
02106@chopin.udel.edu or
02106@ravel.udel.edu or
02106@bach.udel.edu or
