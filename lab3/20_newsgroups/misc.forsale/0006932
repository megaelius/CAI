I have a certificate for one round-trip airfares to either Orlando,
Las Vegas and Reno/Lake Tahoe.
Expiration date is one year from now.
The maximum retail value, depending on time and location, is estimated
at $2000 for all three locations, including accommodation for 3 days
and 2 nights at a leading hotel. I am asking for $1800 or best offer.
Purchase of tickets for a single location is possible.
