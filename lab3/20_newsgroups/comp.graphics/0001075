Dear Reader,
I'am searching for an implementation of a polygon reduction algorithm
for marching cubes surfaces. I think the best one is the reduction algorithm
from Schroeder et al., SIGGRAPH '92. So, is there any implementation of this 
algorithm, it would be very nice if you could leave it to me.
Also I'am looking for a fast !!! connectivity
test for marching cubes surfaces.
Any help or hints will be very useful.
Thanks a lot
                                                (o o)
