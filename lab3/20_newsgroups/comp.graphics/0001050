Dear Binary Newsers,
I am looking for Quick C or Microsoft C code for image decoding from file for
VGA viewing and saving images from/to GIF, TIFF, PCX, or JPEG format. I have
scoured the Internet, but its like trying to find a Dr. Seuss spell checker 
TSR. It must be out there, and there's no need to reinvent the wheel.
Thanx in advance.
 The Internet is like a Black Hole....
