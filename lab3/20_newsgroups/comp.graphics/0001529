I'm posting this for a friend:
  I have an immediate need for a polygon-based hidden-line removal  
  program.  I can deal with any input/output format, but I need to be able  
  to do perspective views in any orientation and range.
  Is there a public-domain hidden-line program around?  It seems like  
  there should be, but I have not been able to locate one.
Email replies and I will summarize.
Thanks
