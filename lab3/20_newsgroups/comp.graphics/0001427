Can anyone explain the polygon fill rules for X? I know about the even-odd
rule but what is the nonzero winding number rule? What happens when the 
left and right boundary lines have many pixels on a given scanline? What 
are the rules concerning abutting polygons?(Are they the same as the 
join-style in the GC?) 
I've read the X pixelization rule but how does the X server determine the 
center point of a pixel? Is there any support for shading?(color interpolation)
Can someone point me to a definitive book that discusses these issues?
			Thanks in advance to the Gurus for there responses
