This seems to be a simple problem but I just cannot solve it.
I wrote a C program to draw some polygons on the screen, and I want to 
print it on my printer. So, I press "print-screen" on the keyboard.
The problem is the printer just print out some ASCII characters.
Is there any other way to print the screen without using "print-screen"????
Please help!
