Hello networld!
I'm looking for documentation/books on parametric drafting.
Does anyone know of such material, electronic on a Gopher/ftp-site
or books/authors.
Im not looking for commercial software rather info on implementation 
and theory of the subject. Im planning to make a parametric
generator for autocad and i would need some referance.
Everything you know is of interest!
Thanks in advace!!
