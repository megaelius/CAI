Help!  I'm trying to program my VGA!  I've got it working
with in pascal with the following routines for mode $13h
(320*200*256).  I've got a VESA compatable Trident 8900C w/1meg
and need to program in 1024*768 mode.  I don't care how many colors.
Could someone take this code and help me write 2 new procedures to
replace them so that it'll work in 1024*768*16 or 1024*768*256?
That'd be GREAT!  Thanks...
Here is the code I currently have for 320*200*256 mode:
  Procedure GraphMode;
    Begin { VideoMode }
        Mov  AH,00
        Mov  AL,13h
    End;  { VideoMode }
  Procedure PlotPoint (x, y, c : Integer);
    Begin
      Mem[$A000:x+y*320]:=c;
