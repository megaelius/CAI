I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the
tracing utility (can't remember the name, sorry!)
included in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert
bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be
imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap.
Result - the file is completely in Corel format and
can be SCODAL'ed no problem!
BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the
solution less than idea, is that the trace utility
spits out many more points than are necessary to
define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and
curves are both traced as many short segments.
So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to
image.
The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping
out the extra points by hand using Corel.
I've done it a few times :-]

As I say, if you don't mind the problems, go via the route...
