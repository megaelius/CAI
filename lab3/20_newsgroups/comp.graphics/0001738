Does anyone know how to decode the color information of a NTSC signal ?
I need to convert this data to RGB for a Video Capture Utility I am 
writing for use with an IBM M-MOTION Video adapter card...
I need to know the how the V and U signals work in the color process.
Thanks in advance for any information or algorythms etc.
