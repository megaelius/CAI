Ok, lets say youve got a grid of hexagons
that go in a        10
                    etc..
for a total of 15 rows down
that means there are 10 hexagons in the 1st line,
9 lined up underneath in the second line
10 lined up underneath in the third line
9 lined up under neath in the fourht...
the problem is  given the center of any arbritrary hexagon, and a line with
and arbritrary slope, Which hexagons does that line cross through 
(The line doesn't necessarily have to cross through the center of other hexagon,it can even be a tangent and count).  Any helpers, my friend was baffeled
when trying to figure this.
