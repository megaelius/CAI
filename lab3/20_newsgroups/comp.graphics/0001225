Hi,
well I have opened up a FTP site for getting the latest software drivers
for Genoa graphics cards.
Here is how to access it:
login:ftp
password:ftp
cd pub/genoa
binary
prompt
hash
(now if you wanna have the latest drivers for the 7900 board)
cd 7000series
mget *
quit
This is the sequence to get the drivers.
If you have any further question, please email me.
Best regards, Stefan Hartmann
