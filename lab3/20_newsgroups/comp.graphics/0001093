-> I have been on the phone with Impulse for about 3 months waiting for
-> my cross - platform upgrade (Amiga to IBM). They have told me every
-> week for 3 months, "it will be ready next week". Still waiting.......
 They've been saying that for two years now, you'd think by now people
wouldn't go on about it being 'soon' and only believe it when they can
buy it. I wish Amiga users wouldn't be so gullible (gasp, how dare he
say that!).
