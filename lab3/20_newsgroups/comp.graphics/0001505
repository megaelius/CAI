Scott,
	I'm not so sure if this is helpful, but I usually use XV v2.21.  I use Sun IPCs and IPXs, and it works fine.  It can display in a good number of ways.(root being one of them)  It's also possible to have XV put up a background automatically at login.  Hope this helps.

BTW  XV v2.21 is on anonymous FTP somewhere. (archie fer it!)
