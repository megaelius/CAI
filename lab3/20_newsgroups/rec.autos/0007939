Okay, okay, I know the Ford Probe is made in the US, in fact it's
made in Michigan, at a Mazda plant.  My question: are most of the parts
from American or Japanese sources?  I have been told that most of the US
assembly plants for Japanese automakers import almost all of the parts used in
the vehicles.
Any information anyone has on this will be appreciated!
