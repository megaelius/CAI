Agreed!  I own a Mercury Villager and I'm very impressed with the V6 and
the AT.  In the past, I've been biased towards manual/standard transmissions(I owned
an Aerostar with a 5-speed, it was awesome!), but settled with the AT in the
Villager and have been pleasantly surprised with it's performance.
BTW, Consumers Report in their report on the Villager, alluded to some
funny noises from the AT, I've been listening for them but haven't noticed anything
unusual.
