There is a picture in the May 1993 edition of European Car (although,
it may not be on the shelf yet).
Some things that the article says:
	- prototype has front wheel drive (first front drive
	  for Mercedes since the beginning of WWII)
	- wheelbase 3.15m
	- 7 seater
	- they claim that the price will be about the same as a
	  Renault Espace or Chrysler Voyager (DM 50,000)
Looking at the picture (slightly disguised) it looks like the Ford
Aerostar, to me.

            The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates
            that you probably wouldn't understand anyway!
