First off, the correct spelling of Nissan's luxury automobile division
is "Infiniti" not "Infinity."  I would also like to clear up the question
of what kind of engines power Lexus and Infiniti automobiles, since a
person had remarked in earlier posts that most Lexus and Infiniti models
had V6 engines, while at the same time saying that several of each
manufacturer used V8 engines.
Lexus:
Infiniti:
  G20- inline 4 (I must admit that I cannot remeber for sure here)
I hope this helps.
