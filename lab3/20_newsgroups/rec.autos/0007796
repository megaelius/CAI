I would gladly spend twice the money for insurance, rather than using
Geico.  Not only do they supply radar guns to the police they also want
to make radar detectors illegal.  They also ask if you have a detector
(probably to put you in a high risk group or just refuse to insure you).
I know a few people who were droped by geico due to an accident that
was not their fault.
