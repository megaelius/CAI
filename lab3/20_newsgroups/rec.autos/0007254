With the popularity of minivans, the market room for station wagons is 
squeezed out. They are not as comfortable as sedan, and don't carry as 
much as the minivans. 
This is not to say nobody wants the wagon anymore. But the demand is certainly
hampered by the minivan, and may not be economical to build a product for.
