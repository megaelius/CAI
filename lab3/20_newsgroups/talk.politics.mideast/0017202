   Why does the Center For Policy Research pose such unbelievably
stupid and loaded questions to this newsgroup.  What are you? - a
think tank, or a fish tank?  Every time I start to believe I have
seen the outer boundaries of your stupidity, you come up with one
step beyond.  When will it end, man?  Can you actually have brain
enough to dress and feed yourself each morning?
