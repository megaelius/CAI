"Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the 
 mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The 
 rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the 
 borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki 
 from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of 
 the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. 
 They are quiet now, those villages, except for howling of wolves 
 and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the 
 dead."
