Actually, Islam postulates that the Jews have deliberately falsified the
written Bible for nefarious purposes, and thus the Jewish claim to the
Land of Israel is nullified.  That does not leave much room for Jews
to manuever, whether they live as dhimmis in Dar al-Islam, or as enemies
in Dar al-Har.
