Why do you title this "News you will miss" ?
There have been at least three front-page stories on it in the L.A. Times.

Guildenstern: Our names shouted in a certain dawn ... a message ... a
              summons ... There must have been a moment, at the beginning,
              where we could have said -- no. But somehow we missed it.
