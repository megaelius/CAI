This is nonsense. I lived in the Negev for many years and I can say
for sure that no Beduins were "moved" or harmed in any way. On the
contrary, their standard of living has climbed sharply; many of them
now live in rather nice, permanent houses, and own cars. There are
quite a few Beduin students in the Ben-Gurion university. There are
good, friendly relations between them and the rest of the population.
All the Beduins I met would be rather surprised to read Mr. Davidson's
poster, I have to say.
