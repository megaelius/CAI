Theories judged to be simple, by people.  Predictions judged to
be accurate, by people.   These are value judgements, and science doesn't 
work without them.

Accurate in whose opinion?  Yours?  Is the fact that it seems to be an 
accurate description which applies to everyone of *no* relevance?

Confidently asserted falsehood.  On the one hand, people can demonstrate 
that they value freedom as consistently as they can report the rising of 
the sun.  People will disagree if you say freeedom is worthless no less 
often than they will disagree if you say evolution (or for that matter, QM or
relativity) is an accurate description of observed phenomena.  On the
other hand, even in the face of a certain amount of disagreement, it remains
reasonable to believe in the value of freedom and that QM etc. is an accurate 
description of observed phenomena.
