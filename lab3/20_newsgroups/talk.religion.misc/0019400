  Exactly.  What would happen if I barracade myself in my house for a
while with lots of firearms.  Then, when the police come with a search
warrent, first I slam the door in their face, then shoot at them when
they try to enter.  After this, I shoot at people who try to get me
to come out.  This sort of thing happens every now and then, and it
usually ends up being a shoot-out between the police and the person(s)
behind the barricade.  Why are the Branch Davidians any different?
