If an unreasonable warrant is served in the 'knock' fashion, I can see
the warrant, claim it is unreasonable, allow the search, and hire a
lawyer to have the evidence suppressed.
If any warrant is served in the 'no-knock' fashion, all I
see is men with guns bashing in the door.  Maybe they've got "POLICE"
or "ATF" jackets, maybe they yell "Police".  But ANYONE can do that
with little effort. Even if I have time to take in all this, if I
decide they are police and fail to defend myself, my decision could easily
be fatal.
More likely I can't see the jackets before I have to decide whether to
defend myself or not, and they yell as they are bashing in the door,
so I can't hear them.  Or, they've already thrown in some flash-bang
grenades, deafening and confusing me.

Some news readers expect "Disclaimer:" here.
Just say NO to police searches and seizures.  Make them use force.
