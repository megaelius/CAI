You seem to be forgetting about the life of the mother.  You contend that
the life of the unborn child is more important than the crimes of the
father, but you label the stuggle of a rape victim to survive and put her
nightmare in the past as a matter of "convenience!"  Outrageous.

If you showed the same compassion for the pregnant woman that you do for
the unfortunate baby, I might have more tolerance for your views.  You
seem, however, to be intent on questioning a woman's wisdom in allowing
herself to be raped.  If you can, please understand that I am talking
about those cases in which the woman has no control over whether she
becomes pregnant...such cases do, in fact, exist.
