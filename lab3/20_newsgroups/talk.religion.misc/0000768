So?
Of course he's a paleontologist.  He's also an evolutionist.  In fact,
I'm damn glad he's made it apparent that evolutionary biology has the
ability to adapt to new lines of evidence and to develop new theories.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be science; it would be something like
creationism.
So when should we expect your next out-of-context quote, John E. King?
Do creationists like yourself ever use anything other than appeal to
authority to support arguments?  Like science, maybe?  I guess not.
(And they wonder why they can't teach creationism in science
classrooms.)
