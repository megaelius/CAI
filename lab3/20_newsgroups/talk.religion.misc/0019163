    Non-toxic tear gas?!?  Do you know what tear gas is?
    I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw 
    a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  The sensation 
    was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.
    I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out
    like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping
    out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor).
    I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.
