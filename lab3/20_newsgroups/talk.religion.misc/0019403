This can be now assumed kin of comic books.  There are many authors and artists
who write on, say, Superman.  This does not make the fictional character
worthy of blind sycophantic worship.  Indeed, I too could write of Jesus.  Does
that make my writings sacred and me worthy of becoming a saint?  Somehow I doubt
it.

 About a week ago a number of discrepancies were posted to this
newsgroup which noone, NOT ONE christian dared to take up.  Perhaps the original
poster could re-post them for Bill...?
