I assume you are saying that no-knock warrants are 'unreasonable', this
is a matter of opinion and is not a CLEAR violation of the 4th
admendment. You say that 'this is a country of laws' yet you seem very
willing to ignore these laws, or at least those you disagree with,
and respond to a legal situation with 'blazing guns'. Like it or not,
as it stands now no-knock warrants are legal. If you don't like this
there are legal means to fight this including contacting your
congresspersons about changing the law; and, if it happens to you,
fighting its legality in court.
