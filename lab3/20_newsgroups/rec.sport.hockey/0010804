Apparently, the public workers' strike in St John's, Newfoundland is over.
The strike has, since mid-January, forced the St John's Maple Leafs hockey
team to play their home games in other cities such as Toronto, Cornwall
and Charlottetown. They have been playing their playoff home games
in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Leafs' management said that they COULD
return to St John's for the second round.
