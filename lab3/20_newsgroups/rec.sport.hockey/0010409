 Well, I'm a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to
get the opponent's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone
with them.  There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a
powerplay.  These three players usually play on three different lines.
Which would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple
shift.
The Wings' lines usually look like this:
                      Gallant-Yzerman-Ciccarelli
                      Kozlov-Fedorov-Drake
                      Kennedy-Burr-Probert
                      Ysebaert-Primeau-Sheppard
Oh by the way:  Start praying! : )
