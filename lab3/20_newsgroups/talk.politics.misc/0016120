OOooooHhhh!  He admits it!  The infamous "first step".  Let's look at
it this way.  I have never harmed anyone with my firearms.  I have
successfully defended myself with them.  I have successfully procurred
food with them.  I have successfully had much enjoyment in target
practicing with them.  
In that order firearms are important to me.  Friend, I was raped as a
child by an older child who had a knife.  That ain't never gonna
happen again.  There is no one, including yourself, who will *ever*
make me a victim again.  As long as you don't try to make me a victim,
I will leave you alone.  But if you *ever* try to make me a victim,
I'll fight you all the way, such as I'm doing now.  And I'll fight you
with a response appropriate to the situation.  Now, you aren't
advocating making me a victim are you?  Exactly what are you doing?
