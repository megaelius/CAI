Are you any less stunningly ignorant?  Have you ever heard of life
insurance premiums some companies give in which nonsmokers are charged
much smaller premiums than smokers?
Not to mention auto insurance being much cheaper for women under 25 than
for men under 25, because women on the average drive more carefully
than most men--in fact, almost as carefully as I did before I was 25.
