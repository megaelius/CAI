Overriding any concern about morality is the fact that men (Dennis
is a man's name?) don't get abortions.  Thus it is unreasonable to 
suppose that YOUR insurance premiums are being used for the 
possibility that you will be getting an abortion.
It looks like what you're really objecting to is other people paying
money for the possibility that THEY might need to get an abortion.
