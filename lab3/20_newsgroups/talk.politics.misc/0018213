Larry,
One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expects/fears one might need.
If one is opposed to abortion, one should not be required to pay for
"coverage" of it because one will NEVER want to use that "service" and
neither should that person be COMPELLED to pay for other people's
abortions PARTICULARLY if one sincerely believes that abortion is
murder.
