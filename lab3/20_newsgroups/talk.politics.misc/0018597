Before you go absolving the BATF & FBI of all blame in this incident, you should
probably be aware of two important facts.
1.  There is no such thing as non-toxic tear gas.  Tear gas is non-breathable
    remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting, followed eventually
    by siezures and death.  Did the FBI know the physical health of all the people
    they exposed??  Any potential heart problems among the B-D's??
2.  Have you ever seen a tear gas canister??  Tear gas is produced by burning a
    chemical in the can.  The fumes produced are tear gas.  The canister has a 
    warning printed on the side of it.  "Contact with flamable material can result
    in fire."  Now, how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building 
    they admited was a fire-trap??
This whole thing was a case of over-reaction by the officials at every step.
I hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are held
accountable.  But that is highly unlikely when you figure they are going to
be investigating themselves.
