  And what's your evidence that you had more such rights in 1932?
  In those days people were ROUTINELY sent off to the county home
  for the feeble-minded/confused if they showed the slightest weirdness.
  Remember all the jokes people used to make about "the guys in the
  white coats and the big butterfly net" coming to "take you away"?
  That sort of thing used to really happen.  Nowadays you can be a
  total loon and end up living, and dying, on the street.
