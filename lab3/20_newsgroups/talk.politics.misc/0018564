	When did the BATF say this? Everything I've seen from the BATF,
	from the official version to the dissident statements of BATF
	officers who conducted the raid claims that the Davidians were
	shooting at the agents long before they were within grenade 
	range. 
	Also, if the warrant is sealed, how do we know it was a 'no-knock'?
