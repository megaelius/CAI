I guess my news reader deleted the lines of the 4th amendment which deal
with no-knock warrants.  How do you deduce that they are in clear violation?
Now maybe no-knock warrants SHOULD be illegal.  But until the Supreme Court
says so, your own pronouncements on the warrant's constitutionality are just
wishful thinking.
