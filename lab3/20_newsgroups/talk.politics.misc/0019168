The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city.
Despite some pious legends, the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days. We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups. For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
(especially after centuries of political instability and terror), the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of. When studied with a
knowledge of cult psychology, Acts is eerily familiar, especially today.
