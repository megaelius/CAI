It's my understanding that Koresh didn't want to come
out alive, rather to fulfill his own interpretations
of some prophecies.
More interesting was discussions on the news about subterannean
tunnels under the complex.  Wonder if he was planning on hiding
out a few days, then re-emerging "resurrected"?  Sounds a bit
like the book "Passover Plot" to me.  Hmmmmm...
