I have the right to live there UNDER the established
government, right?  Exactly.  Thus, the Palestinian Arabs
should be content to live under Israeli rule, but should cease
clamoring for an independent state.  OR, they should get one in
Gaza and, if it can be worked out, part of the West Bank.  This
is what I have proposed all along, Nabil.
