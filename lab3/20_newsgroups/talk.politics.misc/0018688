	Perhaps I don't get my news from the right sources. Reading
the Washington Post practically every day, I had considered the "facts"
I stated above to be a matter of public record, and hardly in dispute.
So, if "others on the net" - and in the rest of the media as well, are
claiming something else, I'll be glad to entertain such claims in an
open-minded manner. To date, this is the first I've seen of any claim 
that the BATF used ANY weapons BEFORE the Branch Davidians opened 
fire on them. So - please -  enlighten me.

have seen fit to mention are particularly        those of my employer or
praiseworthy or particularly scandalous ones.    any government agency."
It seems to me that the historian's foremost     - Bill Riggs
duty is to ensure that virtue is remembered,
and to deter evil words and deeds with the
fear of posterity's damnation."
