	I've never seen CNN give out the poll questions on the air.
If you sent them a letter asking for them, you might get them.  Here's
my guess of how part of a session might look:
Question: Do you approve of Clinton's performance?
Answer: No
Questions: Do you disapprove due to the gays in the military issue?
Answer: Yes
Conclusion: Clinton has a low approval rating because he's not moving
fast enough on gays in the military.
	I think any group truly dedicated to reporting the news would
not use manufactured news like polls.
